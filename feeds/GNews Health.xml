She later told police that she began bringing her own water bottle instead of drinking the “sour” water. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The employee eventually “noticed her water from her personal water bottle that she brought from the store smelled nasty,” the documents said, adding that she decided to dispose of the bottle rather than investigate further.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Janitor caught on camera ‘inserting penis’ into water bottle&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the office lacked security cameras, the woman purchased a small camera online and attached it to her computer. She also placed a large water bottle in the camera's view.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Later that evening, the woman was notified of movement on the camera. “What she witnessed moments later was far worse than anyone could imagine,” court documents revealed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The video clearly showed the nighttime janitor, Lucio Diaz, approach M.A.’s desk as if to clean, set the cleaning rag and cleaning bottle on the desk, unzip his pants, pull out his penis, grab the water bottle sitting on the desk, unscrew the cap, and begin to insert his penis into the water bottle (turning it upwards to ensure the water in the bottle touched his penis), and rub his penis on the mouth of the bottle,” report quoted court documents. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“He then put the cap back on the bottle, set it back where he found it, zipped up his pants, grabbed the cleaning bottle and rag, and continued to ‘clean’ the desk. Lucio Diaz was not phased, he was not nervous—he had done this before—and it had now become just a part of his daily ‘cleaning’ ritual,” the report added. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the complaint, Diaz admitted to the crimes during police questioning, saying he “did it because he knew [the employee] would drink it the next day” and mentioned having a “sickness.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The woman later underwent several STD tests, all of which came back positive for Herpes simplex virus type 1, a condition she had never tested positive for before, the complaint revealed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tests on Diaz also showed he was positive for the same virus, along with chlamydia. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Following this, several other women working at the medical practice found they had contracted STDs. The Independent reported it has reviewed multiple civil suits filed against Diaz.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On October 10, 2022, another woman who was targeted by Diaz informed police that she tested positive for herpes simplex virus type 1 and chlamydia after consuming water from her bottle that had been contaminated with his urine, as stated in the court documents, &lt;a rel="dofollow" href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/03/24/janitor-urinating-bottles-houston/82641024007/" target="_blank"&gt;reported &lt;/a&gt;USA Today. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Hindustan Times</author><pubDate>Tue, 25 Mar 2025 02:26:38 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigAJBVV95cUxNV3NWTkhLcEp6SU9QUHBRZktCb1NiRnp3TEVWemVfaDlycmE3REFwd2lWZmNsOG0xY2M2OWpJNGYwUnd0MmQ1ZEJhbXI4cDNzUzdjckVWRkV6RGY2MWM4UU42bV9rS1VtXzA3eXlOOVVRYmhIN1dzSVBLaHo2UVNpT3pPbXNqUElZaWhNQ3lreU9NZFozZVJydDJ6Y2dFT3Z1ZVdXbDVqT2pKWkhNX0VIZTkwdVRrYy1jSGhtczBEdmFrYWt1NlBpQTNjeWlabFNvQzRYdGw3dmhWU1Y5VmgxaHVFVDFmZHoxQmg2dHA1UWo1M0tFRnBsVlRlMk5CT2g2</guid></item><item><title>Priority pathogens: UK draws up new disease-threat watch list -

Using a condom during sex is usually said to be the best way of reducing the risk of catching it, but doesn't eliminate it entirely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;It can be treated with a single injection of antibiotics, although&lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ceq5j784n7go" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt; a small number of treatment-resitant cases&lt;/a&gt; have been found in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eeiVGB"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-518485e5-0 DkKTF"&gt;'Let's get it done'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;In November 2023, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) recommended a targeted roll-out of the MenB vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Primarily designed to tackle Meningitis B in children, the JCVI found the treatment was roughly 40% effective at preventing people from contracting and spreading gonorrhoea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The body, which considers whether different immunisations should be offered on the NHS, said it would be cost-effective if given to people who are most at risk of catching gonorrhoea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;That includes gay and bisexual men and people who have had an STI in the past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The JCVI said the money saved from fewer appointments and antibiotic treatments would be greater than the cost of the vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Prof Matt Phillips, president of the British Association for Sexual Health and HIV (BASHH), tells BBC Newsbeat it's "pushing for this to happen as soon as possible".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"If we don't deal with it now, we're going to see more people with serious types of gonorrhoea and more cases of antibiotic resistance," he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"The science says we should do this, the JCVI says we should do this. Let's get it done."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Other charities working in sexual health tell BBC Newsbeat they agree, including the Terrence Higgins Trust which says "it's time to put money where it needs to be. The time is now".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;A spokesperson for the Department for Health and Social Care says "we want everyone to have good access to sexual health services and treatment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"We're currently considering the JCVI advice and we will update in due course."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;They also added: "Last month we announced a boost of almost £200m to the public health grant, which funds sexual health clinics across the country".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eeiVGB"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-518485e5-0 DkKTF"&gt;'There's a lot of shame around it'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Max, who creates educational online content on sexual health and wellbeing aimed at gay and bisexual men, says he would "absolutely" take the vaccine if he was offered it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;He shared his own gonnorhoea diagnosis online and believes we should be more open about discussing STIs to reduce the stigma around them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"There's a lot of shame around it," he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"People think it's dirty. I felt like talking about it online not only normalised getting tested and having the treatment, but also took away the shame.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"Even if you're doing everything right, you can still get an STI".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The latest data on STIs shows under-25s, black men and gay and bisexual men are most likely to catch gonnorhoea. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Max says he's often had to work harder to get information on sexual health which he didn't get in school. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"I think as queer people we have to go out of our way to get the information," he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"It's not something we're actively taught".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eeiVGB"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-518485e5-0 DkKTF"&gt;'I've gotten gonorrhoea repeatedly'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;One of the organisations looking to change that is The Love Tank, based in London. It campaigns on sexual health and other areas of wellness for LGBT+ people, including drug abuse and mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;It told BBC Newsbeat it also supports the campaign to have the MenB vaccine offered on the NHS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"Sexual health services are already massively underfunded and understaffed", says project co-ordinator Phil Samba.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"I feel like we should all be talking about sexual health," he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"It should be as normalised as going to the dentist".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;He also says he's noticed more people he knows testing positive for gonorrhoea, and says he's caught it himself "repeatedly".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 bdPeAJ"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-8353772e-0 iUqqeb"&gt;Phil works for The Love Tank in London which runs awareness campaigns on sexual health and wellbeing&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Phil and The Love Tank also campaign for a wider use of Doxy-PEP, where the antibiotic doxycycline is taken in advance of sex to prevent some sexually transmitted bacterial infections being caught. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Neither Doxy-PEP nor the MenB vaccine are currently offered for free on the NHS in sexual health clinics, but can be bought through online pharmacies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Both Boots and Superdrug offer private vaccination on the High Street for £110 per dose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Phil thinks it's important, though, that MenB is available to anyone who needs it, and says funding for drugs like PrEP to prevent HIV, and vaccines for mpox - formerly referred to as monkeypox - have come too late.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"We have not learned from the past," says Phil. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"We need to learn from mistakes and try to provide people with resources, vaccines and medications.

&lt;p&gt;This one is a head scratcher. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There’s no denying that the internet loves a good hack — especially if it’s one that will help prevent the crapulence feeling that comes on the morning after consuming one too many espresso martinis.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The latest quirky health hack is milk thistle supplements being used to prevent nasty hangovers. In a &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@lucyconlanxx/video/7336271554596146465?q=milk%20thistle&amp;amp;t=1742852925396" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;video &lt;/a&gt;of a TikTok user raving about the herbal remedy, she told her viewers: “Last week I went out and took two of these before a night of drinking and I woke up and ran a 5k the next day.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But before you jump on the milk thistle bandwagon, there’s more to know about this plant medicine.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first glance, milk thistle in its purest form looks like a tall plant with pretty purple flowers — something you might stick in a vase and put on display in your home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, milk thistle is known for more than just its good looks. Technically speaking, the plant’s seeds extract &lt;a href="https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/milk-thistle" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;silymarin&lt;/a&gt; — which is a mixture of compounds known for its antioxidant properties. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It comes in different forms — capsules, tablets and liquid extracts.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For years — dating back to the 16th century — silymarin has been used as an herbal remedy for treating a number of ailments — including liver disorders. It’s also said to help pregnant women increase their breast milk production. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Regarding the liver, milk thistle helps by blocking toxins from reaching liver cells and for reducing inflammation. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.mountsinai.org/health-library/herb/milk-thistle" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Mount Sinai&lt;/a&gt;, some studies show that milk thistle can help improve liver function and increase survival chances in people with alcoholic hepatitis and cirrhosis — which is inflammation of the liver and liver disease, both caused by excessive alcohol consumption. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, experts are hesitant about people popping a milk thistle supplement thinking it will allow them to down several shots of tequila without feeling it the next day. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While it could help support healthy liver function — the research that has been done on milk thistle is still very limited and nowhere claims that it’s a one and done &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/milk-thistle-hangover#:~:text=Despite%20these%20potential%20benefits%2C%20milk,be%20considered%20a%20hangover%20remedy.&amp;amp;text=Milk%20thistle%20may%20aid%20various,it's%20effective%20for%20treating%20hangovers." target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;hangover cure&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Due to its anti-inflammatory properties, silymarin &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; help &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/milk-thistle-hangover#recommendation" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;minimize some hangover symptoms&lt;/a&gt; — like body aches — but that’s about the extent of it.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;People with certain &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/06/03/health/5-supplements-you-should-avoid-if-you-have-metabolic-syndrome/"&gt;plant allergies&lt;/a&gt; should also be hesitant about consuming milk thistle. For those who are allergic to plants like ragweed, marigold or daisy — they may experience an allergy to milk thistle since it’s a similar plant. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Remember to always consult a doctor before trying any sort of health hack you hear about online.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And milk thistle isn’t the only trending supplement that’s got experts rolling their eyes — &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/03/24/health/popular-supplement-might-be-worthless-new-study-finds/"&gt;creatine&lt;/a&gt;, used by gym goers to help increase muscle mass and boost performance, is in the spotlight with some calling it useless.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We’ve shown that taking 5 grams of creatine supplement per day does not make any difference to the amount of lean muscle mass people put on while resistance training,” said senior study author Mandy Hagstrom, from the University of New South Wales School of Health Sciences. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, chin hairs aren’t limited to post-menopausal women. Women of reproductive age get facial hair, too, and Kausel said that if this happens, you may want to see your doctor. “Having chin hair might mean that your androgens (male hormones) are high,” she said. “High androgens come from either the ovaries (polycystic ovarian syndrome, or PCOS, being the most common cause) or, much less frequently, the adrenal glands.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PCOS is a &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/polycystic-ovary-syndrome-signs_l_633d8874e4b04cf8f368e393" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7730375"&gt;common and treatable condition&lt;/a&gt; caused by cysts in the ovaries that overproduce androgens, so a person’s cycle, ovulation, and fertility can be impaired, Kausel said. “You may have other issues, too, that come from having high androgens, such as acne, hair loss, and hirsutism. PCOS can also have metabolic manifestations with weight gain, insulin resistance, and a high risk of developing Type 2 diabetes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is also a hereditary condition, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, that can have a late onset and affect facial hair growth, Green said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Another condition that can cause sudden hair growth is Cushing’s disease, where the body produces too much cortisol, leading to higher levels of androgen,” she said. “Cushing’s disease is also associated with weight gain, headaches, and blood sugar issues.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long story short: If you’re pre-menopausal and you develop facial hair, especially if it comes on suddenly, see your doctor for a diagnosis and treatment plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What to do about hair on your chin &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;While some of us are happy to decorate our chin hair with beads, others might want to get rid of it. Luckily, Green said, there’s a lot you can do if that’s the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“&lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/topic/laser-hair-removal" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7730375"&gt;Laser hair removal&lt;/a&gt; is a convenient option to clear out unwanted excess hair,” Green said. “The laser emits a specific wavelength that targets the hair follicle’s pigment or melanin. With current advancements in technology, lasers can safely treat all skin tones and hair colors except gray and white, which do not contain melanin for the laser to detect.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, “Electrolysis is a great option for permanent hair removal that works for gray and white hairs,” she noted. “During electrolysis, an electric current is delivered to the bottom of the follicle, destroying the root and damaging the follicle to prevent hair growth.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A physician could also prescribe anti-androgenic medication like &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/topic/spironolactone" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7730375"&gt;spironolactone&lt;/a&gt; to target the excess androgens and prevent further chin or other unusual hair growth, Green said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Over-the-counter depilatory creams can be used at home to dissolve the hair, too, but these products tend to be irritating and can even burn the skin if not used properly,” she said. “There are prescription eflornithine creams that work to reduce hair growth, and this cream is a good option for unwanted hair in a small, target area.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, while you may be tempted to pluck your chin hairs, Green strongly advises against that. “Plucking using a tweezer is not the preferred method of hair removal, as it can damage the skin and cause ingrown hairs and folliculitis,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New, long chin hairs can be annoying, but they’re often not cause for concern. And if they’re really bothering you, there’s a lot you can do to address them ― so don’t be afraid to chat with your doctor or dermatologist about any hair growth concerns you might have.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article originally appeared on &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/why-get-chin-hairs-get-older_l_645ed358e4b0c10612ebb90c" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7730375"&gt;HuffPost&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span&gt;“Don’t do the shots,” a woman identified as the girl’s mother said through an interpreter during an interview with the organization &lt;strong&gt;Children’s Health Defense&lt;/strong&gt;. The woman added there are doctors who can help, and the disease is “not as bad as they’re making it out to be.”  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;span&gt;The prominent &lt;strong&gt;anti-vaccine group&lt;/strong&gt;, which was founded and previously chaired by current HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., posted a video interview on March 17 with a couple identified as the parents of the child who died.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;span&gt;“We would absolutely not take the MMR,” the mother said, because the couple have four other children who contracted measles and survived. “The measles wasn’t that bad, they got over it pretty quickly.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;span&gt;The interview comes as the Texas outbreak has sickened &lt;strong&gt;more than 300 people&lt;/strong&gt; since January, surpassing the number of cases reported nationwide last year. Almost all the cases to date are among unvaccinated individuals or in individuals whose vaccination status is unknown. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;span&gt;The child was the &lt;strong&gt;first recorded measles death in the U.S. in a decade&lt;/strong&gt;.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;span&gt;Measles was officially eliminated in 2000 due to a highly effective vaccination program, but vaccinations have waned, and a 2019 outbreak threatened that status.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;span&gt;Most measles cases in the U.S. are initially introduced by an unvaccinated person exposed during international travel who then brings the virus back to spread among &lt;strong&gt;undervaccinated communities&lt;/strong&gt; at home.   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;span&gt;In Texas, the outbreak has centered among a &lt;strong&gt;large Mennonite community&lt;/strong&gt; in Gaines County, where vaccination rates are historically low. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;span&gt;In the interview, the girl’s father said measles “are good for the body,” and can help boost a person’s immune system. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It’s a claim not supported by science, but one repeated recently by Kennedy in a Fox News interview.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="auto"&gt;
&lt;span&gt;“And there’s a lot of studies out there that show that if you actually do get the wild infection, you’re protected later. It boosts your immune system later in life against cancers, atopic diseases, cardiac disease, etc,” Kennedy said earlier this month. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;span&gt;The current outbreak represents a &lt;strong&gt;significant test&lt;/strong&gt; for Kennedy, who for the first time has had to reckon his past as a longtime critic of vaccines with his new leadership of the federal health establishment. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Hill</author><pubDate>Mon, 24 Mar 2025 23:13:38 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>Should you get a measles booster?

If you fall into that age range and you are not sure what version of the vaccine you got, the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/hcp/vaccine-considerations/index.html"&gt;CDC recommends&lt;/a&gt; another dose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="Q52TG6SF3ZBX7DDSCW6OIYH7UA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;People born between 1968 and 1989 possibly got one dose of the measles vaccine, instead of the two given to children today. The CDC says one dose is enough for most adults but recommends two doses of the vaccine for anyone planning international travel. And health officials may recommend people get a second dose of the vaccine if there’s a local measles outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="PMEBS25NHRE73LQNGTHRX6QH4E" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Savoy said she got her second dose of the measles vaccine in high school during an outbreak in the 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="MHCPRJVSCNESPELNJ7C4V5LB6U" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“There are some people who are in their early 50s, late 40s who — if they only ever got one dose of MMR and they never had the measles as an infection — they might benefit from getting a booster dose,” Savoy said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="SUQQ6FCBDVF7LFF624YUN4CVNQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;If you got two doses of the measles vaccine, experts said, a booster isn’t going to provide any additional protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="AG27KVZALJFNVJKZ5SEBFU2KBM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;A person’s vaccine-induced measles immunity can wane over time, but it’s rare, Ratner said. What can happen is “primary vaccine failure,” when a person doesn’t respond to one dose of the measles vaccine and they’re not protected against the virus, Ratner said. This is why children get a second dose, to ensure they have the antibodies, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="MSACBDP2JBGLJJVIKAJNSCVEDA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;There are lab tests that can measure a person’s antibody protection against measles, Savoy said. But the test may not be covered by insurance, and the results are only an approximate measurement of a person’s risk if they are exposed to the virus, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h3 class="wpds-c-iLVUUd wpds-c-iLVUUd-bALvEi-isCenteredLayout-false" data-qa="article-header" data-contentid="TANYB5ZLUBDTPDU5YAZVHNE5GY" data-apitype="header" level="2" id="TANYB5ZLUBDTPDU5YAZVHNE5GY"&gt;How can an adult find out whether they’re vaccinated?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="WX24242LTNGCZFQBT4ANA3IZOY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Most Americans were vaccinated for a number of diseases as children, but experts said it can be impossible for adults to remember the shots they received decades ago, and in many cases, medical records can be hard to find.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="GD5UG53BOREHZC2MRCSILX7CNE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“If you’re a 57-year-old adult like me, well, I’m sure that my pediatrician is no longer around,” said &lt;a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/faculty/1015/daniel-salmon" target="_blank"&gt;Daniel Salmon&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of international health at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. “For many adults, especially older adults, there may not be a single source for their immunization record.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="UL3GQHPHHRAOTOHGQTMA5ASJDI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Start by asking your health-care provider whether they have your vaccination records. You can also contact your state’s health department.

It can be “very, very difficult” for people to keep track of their vaccinations when they move or travel out of state for health care, said &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/sampathkumar-priya-m-d/bio-20053991"&gt;Priya Sampathkumar&lt;/a&gt;, an infectious-disease specialist at Mayo Clinic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="54GLR2V4TNBY7N4EF4YJ5OP5TE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“We have a really fragmented health-care system,” Salmon said, causing records supporting individual-level vaccines to often be scattered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="G6CHXMYUERDERCGR3DDSN627RQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Based on a patient’s age and medical history, Sampathkumar said, she can tell someone the vaccines they should have gotten.

&lt;p&gt;In the UK, officials said further testing of the rest of the sheep's flock has found no other infections. The one infected ewe has been humanely culled to mitigate further risk and to "enable extensive testing."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Strict biosecurity measures have been implemented to prevent the further spread of disease," UK Chief Veterinary Officer Christine Middlemiss said in a statement. "While the risk to livestock remains low, I urge all animal owners to ensure scrupulous cleanliness is in place and to report any signs of infection to the Animal Plant Health Agency immediately."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While UK officials believe that the spillover has been contained and there's no onward transmission among sheep, the latest spillover to a new mammalian species is a reminder of the virus's looming threat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Globally, we continue to see that mammals can be infected with avian influenza A(H5N1)," Meera Chand, Emerging Infection Lead at the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), said in a statement. In the US, the Department of Agriculture has documented hundreds of infections in &lt;a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/livestock-poultry-disease/avian/avian-influenza/hpai-detections/mammals"&gt;wild and captive mammals&lt;/a&gt;, from cats to bears, raccoons, and harbor seals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chand noted that, so far, the spillovers into animals have not easily transmitted to humans. For instance, in the US, despite extensive spread through the dairy industry, no human-to-human transmission has yet been documented. But, experts fear that with more spillovers and exposure to humans, the virus will gain more opportunities to adapt to be more infectious in humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chand says that UKHSA and other agencies are monitoring the situation closely in the event the situation takes a turn. "UKHSA has established preparations in place for detections of human cases of avian flu and will respond rapidly with NHS and other partners if needed."&lt;/p&gt;

That held true for eight specific diets evaluated, including the Mediterranean diet and strictly plant-based regimens, as well as diets designed to lower inflammation or blood pressure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“What most of these diets had in common was that they were rich in fruit and vegetables, whole grains, unsaturated fat, nuts, legumes and then low in processed meat, sugars and trans fat,” said an author of the study, Marta Guasch-Ferré, an adjunct associate professor of nutrition at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Previous studies have similarly found that diets rich in fruits and vegetables are associated with lower cholesterol and blood pressure and &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/vegetarian-vegan-diets-lower-risk-heart-disease-cancer-rcna151970" target="_blank"&gt;a decreased risk of heart disease or cancer&lt;/a&gt;. But most of that research hasn’t evaluated the overall effect on people’s quality of life as they age, Guasch-Ferré said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“It’s not just about living longer but also maintaining good health in the later stages of life,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The link between a healthy diet and lower disease risk is a major talking point for Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has repeatedly blamed food additives and processed food consumption for &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/rfk-jr-says-government-ignores-chronic-disease-misguided-rcna190042" target="_blank"&gt;rising rates of chronic disease in the United States&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The new study evaluated participants ages 39 to 69 over 30 years from 1986 to 2016. The group was selected from two databases of health professionals, so it may skew more health-conscious than average. In addition to evaluating people’s mental and physical fitness at age 70, the researchers screened for 11 chronic conditions, including cancer, diabetes, stroke, multiple sclerosis and Parkinson’s disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;In particular, the Alternative Healthy Eating Index — a diet designed to reduce chronic disease — had the strongest association with healthy aging. The index awards high scores to people who consume small amounts of fish, at least five daily servings of vegetables and at least four daily servings of whole fruits while cutting out red meat, sugar-sweetened beverages and fruit juice. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Participants who scored the highest on the Alternative Healthy Eating Index had an 86% greater likelihood of healthy aging, the study found, compared with participants with the lowest scores. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The U.S. dietary guidelines don’t adhere completely to the index, recommending instead at least three vegetable servings and at least two fruit servings per day, plus protein from lean meat, poultry, fish, eggs, beans or nuts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;All eight diets in the study promoted fruits, vegetables and whole grains over red and processed meats. But there are slight differences: For instance, the Mediterranean diet emphasizes healthy fats such as olive oil, fish and nuts, while the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension diet prioritizes low-sodium foods. The MIND diet, a combination of those two, encourages people to eat berries to promote brain health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;While past research has found &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/vegetarian-vegan-diets-lower-risk-heart-disease-cancer-rcna151970" target="_blank"&gt;numerous health benefits associated with vegetarian or vegan diets&lt;/a&gt;, Guasch-Ferré said the study’s findings suggest that middle-aged people &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/mediterranean-diet-may-reduce-prevent-ptsd-symptoms-new-research-shows-rcna121223" target="_blank"&gt;don’t need to be fully vegetarian to stave off disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“We can reduce our intake of animal food, but still, some amounts may be healthy,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The study doesn’t address whether a healthy diet in midlife can reverse the negative effects of a poor diet in childhood or young adulthood — a question researchers hope to answer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“With respect to many lifestyle factors, our mantra typically is it’s never too early and it’s never too late,” said Stephen Kritchevsky, a professor of gerontology at Wake Forest University School of Medicine, who wasn’t involved in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Diet isn’t the only factor that affects aging, he added — physical activity, stress and a person’s genetics can also play roles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“If people want to age healthily, the top four things in my mind are: maintain a healthy weight, get exercise, eat well … and don’t smoke,” Kritchevsky said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Mon, 24 Mar 2025 22:17:38 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipAFBVV95cUxQa05oMFRUY3JlUTRXemo3TzlEaHVLcUd4Ql9SbERJYzNJak50em5EWWtUZ1VpbWRXV29CUnlKUmtWX0I1Y0wxSm9CRUo1aVp3a011VjczQ3F4UXRDU0tTNlg5ekY1RGsxUm9IQ1lWYjJOOVF5amdmbFBxcDhyZjVIRTRMODZXcFJmR0RiSVpHdE5kRDU4S0RNMS1XX1ZvQUJSVGdIaNIBVkFVX3lxTE5SOUVNQ21qSl9aV3NIZ2lwNV9WVkdlWWQ0MjhnbDRZaXQ3RGQ2Z3FJY3RWN0hjQmVfa0d1WWRGU3VsQnVRdnREUm40UW5oTkprUi02NUJn</guid></item><item><title>How well is your NYC neighborhood protected against measles?

A rate of 95% is needed for herd immunity, which provides protection to those too young to receive the vaccine or who refuse it, according to the state health department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lowest MMR vaccination rate for 2-year-olds is in Staten Island’s 10309 ZIP code encompassing Rossville and Village Greens, where just 65% of children between 24 and 35 months have gotten their first dose. Three Hell’s Kitchen ZIP codes also have vaccination rates under 70%, as does the 11414 ZIP code covering Queens’ Howard Beach, according to city data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Citywide, only about 81% of children between 24 and 35 months have received their first MMR shot, and rates vary from 65% to 99% across the ZIP codes, according to the data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There are numbers that are still deeply troubling,” &lt;a href="https://gothamist.com/news/4th-measles-case-confirmed-in-ny-gov-hochul-asks-for-help-promoting-vaccination" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Gov. Kathy Hochul said last week&lt;/a&gt;, following confirmation of the state’s fourth measles case this year. The governor called on clergy and other “pillars of our communities” to help promote vaccination in New York as measles spreads in parts of the United States and Canada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="streamfield-paragraph rte-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The approach to raising vaccination rates will have to be tailored to each specific community, said Dr. Adam Ratner,  director of the Division of Pediatric Infectious Diseases at NYU Langone’s Hassenfeld Children's Hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“ The issue with the Hell's Kitchen rate may be very different from the issue with the Staten Island rate, which may be different from Williamsburg,” Ratner said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three Williamsburg ZIP codes that were &lt;a href="https://www.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/186-19/de-blasio-administration-s-health-department-declares-public-health-emergency-due-measles-crisis#/0" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;placed under a vaccine mandate&lt;/a&gt; by then-Mayor Bill de Blasio during the city’s 2018-2019 measles outbreak currently have MMR vaccination rates between 70% and 76% for children between 24 and 35 months old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other end of the spectrum, Queens' Breezy Point neighborhood has a 99% MMR vaccination rate for children between 24 and 35 months old, as does the area around JFK Airport. But most neighborhoods fall somewhere in the middle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;”Measles is the most contagious disease that we know of and consequently, you need very high vaccination rates to prevent outbreaks,” Ratner said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In New York City, almost all children enter kindergarten with two doses of the MMR vaccine, due to the state’s strict school vaccination rules, which &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/06/13/732501865/new-york-advances-bill-ending-religious-exemptions-for-vaccines-amid-health-cris" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;don’t allow for religious exemptions&lt;/a&gt;. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends the first dose of the vaccine be administered between 12 and 15 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Staten Island parents often raise concerns about vaccine safety and side effects, express a preference for natural immunity or have the misconception that vaccination could lead to autism, said Dr. Anna Cornish, the medical director of ambulatory pediatrics at Northwell Health’s Staten Island University Medical Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cornish said pediatricians at the hospital educate patients about the MMR vaccine, and tailor information to their specific concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, if a parent said they preferred their child achieved natural immunity through exposure to measles, Cornish said she would explain that contracting measles can “lead to severe complications, hospitalizations, long-term health problems, even potentially death.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaccine education should also happen in schools and other community settings, Cornish said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New York has had four measles cases so far this year, including three in New York City, and health officials have yet to identify signs of community transmission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles vaccination coverage is the most important factor in determining a community’s risk for an outbreak, according to the city health department. But other factors also play a role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If someone gets measles while traveling and returns to an undervaccinated community, the size of any resulting outbreak will likely depend on how many people are directly exposed to that person, how densely populated the area is and the strength of the public health response, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ncird/whats-new/measles-outbreak-risk-in-us.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;according to the CDC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most large outbreaks that occurred in the United States between 2021 and 2023 took place in undervaccinated communities that were “close-knit” and had a high population density, the CDC says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, there are outbreaks in Texas and New Mexico, and in the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Quebec.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;A headline for this article was updated with additional information.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Gothamist</author><pubDate>Mon, 24 Mar 2025 21:49:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipwFBVV95cUxONDRIZ3dielUyV0xib3dpZjdlZnh0WGVsUl96S3BNaGNpWlF6SnpNMWVvYWxPejRrWTRCZjRGZFR1ZjM2R1R3SGdGWHZYRk9MYS1mZnY5ams1UHlHc2dKNFQ3UWYyOWV4MHJERGxnOWJkbGhUYTdsenBwTXBlYWJCRzQ3SFBMd2tPR1dycjlfZXYydl9iT2MzRDNVQU1kUGhWTjVrZ19nQQ</guid></item><item><title>Breakthrough as paralyzed man walks again after single injection of new treatment - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMisAFBVV95cUxPNWZOcE5nMU1wTTk5bmRlTkpsVmZBU2tYSXJKSEZyLThVUklTcklGQ2VWT3ljbnE3dTg3bHpvRk53SUJLZHM3UjEtYklEVG5fRXNSaHNEUm9kbFBxa21kUThJMHp5SkhYUmJLdzktRmc2Ujh1elQxUVpaS0dNZWtKeXp6OC0zNG05a1pISEdmVTdDcEZRdlJNUl9RcUhvQkZNT2ZpSzRmakxsVkJWNVFtVdIBtgFBVV95cUxNX21OVlp0a0Y2NXQ2WGEtbWczMkw2clN6cnU1S3h5UU5BVlU3UnFFaGhuTmxNMl96M0JPZHBHZWFBcVNNVWIxaVJROFNORDhadnFmQ1hZbnBmSXh6WUtxMmJXVE9FY082dHEzYml4M3dkZFBQOVhDeGUyN0pLb2M2ZDJTc3RibzZvdzM1VEhaQVpzaUt6dTZGakdscTJNamVzbFJvalJScVFndzR0MFU3VXRQNFA5Zw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A single shot of stem cells may hold the cure for people paralyzed by a spinal cord injury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Stem cell scientist Hideyuki Okano from Keio University in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/japan/index.html" id="mol-9588a7f0-08d6-11f0-9873-9103be3eac79" class=""&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;

 &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Stem cells can be guided to turn into many different cell types, which makes them a powerful tool for regenerative medicine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Prior to the start of this medical experiment, scientists used other types of stem cells with very mixed results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;James St. John, a translational neuroscientist at Griffith University in Australia admitted: 'Nothing's really worked so far.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This included using cells taken from human bone marrow, muscle-making cells harvested from donors, and embryonic stem cells extracted from fetuses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the new procedure, scientists grab cells from easily accessible areas like an adult donor's skin or blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Next, researchers use a set a four specific genes which they slip into the harvested cells - turning the clock back and forcing them to turn into stem cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists inject these genes into the cells using carriers like harmless viruses or mRNA - the same tool doctors use for vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nobel Prize winner Shinya Yamanaka was first credited with discovering these genetic switches for reprogramming cells in 2006. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It can take weeks before the adult cells start to lose all of these specialized traits and revert back into stem cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Once they're all turned into stem cells, doctors can inject them into the areas of the body where there's damage or degeneration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If successful, the cells will start to act like the missing or damaged cells - essentially re-growing those parts of the body - such as a knee ligament, the retina of an eye, or a spinal cord.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'That's a great positive outcome. It's very exciting for the field,' St. John added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, St. John warned that there's still a long way to go before this breakthrough becomes a definitive cure for spinal injuries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;St. John, who has conducted his own stem cell trials involving spinal cord injuries, noted that every single injury is different and researchers will need to run more trials to see if iPS cells work for all types of injuries or just certain paralysis cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 24 Mar 2025 21:17:55 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisAFBVV95cUxPNWZOcE5nMU1wTTk5bmRlTkpsVmZBU2tYSXJKSEZyLThVUklTcklGQ2VWT3ljbnE3dTg3bHpvRk53SUJLZHM3UjEtYklEVG5fRXNSaHNEUm9kbFBxa21kUThJMHp5SkhYUmJLdzktRmc2Ujh1elQxUVpaS0dNZWtKeXp6OC0zNG05a1pISEdmVTdDcEZRdlJNUl9RcUhvQkZNT2ZpSzRmakxsVkJWNVFtVdIBtgFBVV95cUxNX21OVlp0a0Y2NXQ2WGEtbWczMkw2clN6cnU1S3h5UU5BVlU3UnFFaGhuTmxNMl96M0JPZHBHZWFBcVNNVWIxaVJROFNORDhadnFmQ1hZbnBmSXh6WUtxMmJXVE9FY082dHEzYml4M3dkZFBQOVhDeGUyN0pLb2M2ZDJTc3RibzZvdzM1VEhaQVpzaUt6dTZGakdscTJNamVzbFJvalJScVFndzR0MFU3VXRQNFA5Zw</guid></item><item><title>Fake CDC vaccine site linked to anti-vax nonprofit once headed by RFK - University of Minnesota Twin Cities</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipgFBVV95cUxQc0RqYXQ3OTF5TWdqOHN5czZFWDg2S1FwS2gxSmN0M3BaUUZpSmR0QzdWNm80Q04wb0JoSHU2ZVZVUlZRNVVXdkNPdkF1WW1FZ1l2UUdCTm1zRzF2TGMwWEs1ZHkxZkRpdHg2Q29qR285aGx6MVdENS1haDRXdlNXc2djWVRKUFFRRUdQRDJGT2daQzZVemw0bVhBaF9XRVRYRmYzTnFn?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;An imposter US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) vaccine safety site hosted by a nonprofit once led by Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Robert F.

              &lt;p&gt;A common workout supplement might be less useful than believed. In research out this month, scientists found that creatine failed to help people build significantly more muscle than normal while training.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers at the University of New South Wales led the study, &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/17/6/1081"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; last week in the journal Nutrients. The clinical trial compared people who underwent resistance training while taking or not taking a typical daily dose of creatine, finding no significant difference in added lean body mass by the end; everyone gained mass while training—the scientists just didn’t see more mass in the creatine group as they expected. The findings could mean that larger regular doses of the supplement are needed to see muscle-building benefits, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements-creatine/art-20347591"&gt;Creatine&lt;/a&gt; is naturally produced by the body and can be found in certain foods such as seafood and red meat. It helps supply energy to the muscles, particularly during intense bursts of activity like lifting weights. Some research has &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8949037/"&gt;suggested&lt;/a&gt; that creatine supplementation can help improve people’s athletic performance and their ability to pack on muscle mass, including in placebo-controlled trials (a gold standard of research).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the UNSW researchers, however, these past trials may have had a critical flaw, since they often had people start taking creatine just as they began their new exercise routine. This design means it would be harder to tell apart the separate benefits of creatine from exercise.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To get around this possible limitation, the researchers had some of their volunteers take creatine a week before the exercise part of the trial—a 12 week course of resistance training—began, which is known as a “wash-in” period. The volunteers took 5 grams of creatine a day, a dose often used for maintenance once people start taking it regularly (the researchers note that a loading phase is not needed to reach the saturation level of creatine, or the maximum amount of stored creatine that our bodies respond to). People in both groups were relatively healthy, but weren’t big exercisers prior to the study; in total, 54 people completed the trial.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The creatine group did seem to experience a small boost in lean body mass on average during the first week (around 0.5 kilograms). But these gains ultimately didn’t give people a leg-up over the controls; by the study’s end, both groups gained roughly two kilograms in added lean body mass on average.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The people taking the creatine supplement saw changes before they even started exercising, which leads us to believe that it wasn’t actual real muscle growth, but potentially fluid retention,” said study researcher Mandy Hagstrom, an exercise scientist at UNSW’s School of Health Sciences, in a &lt;a href="https://www.unsw.edu.au/newsroom/news/2025/03/sports-supplement-creatine-makes-no-difference-to-muscle-gains-trial-finds"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; from the university. “Then once they started exercising, they saw no additional benefit from creatine, which suggests that five grams per day is not enough if you’re taking it for the purposes of building muscle.”&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The findings don’t necessarily sink creatine as a muscle-building aid, the researchers say. It’s possible that over the longer term, for instance, people taking creatine could still experience greater muscle mass. Or it might take a higher maintenance dose to see these effects (the researchers note that 10 grams a day can be safe to take). The researchers also avoided using a “loading phase,” which is when people will start by taking a much higher dose of creatine at first, up to 25 grams, for the first week, but they did expect to see some effect from the dose they used in their study.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the researchers say more studies will be needed to test different doses and treatment lengths—studies that will hopefully incorporate wash-in periods and other measures to ensure accurate results. But the current findings may already help people keep their expectations in check if they decide to start taking creatine for muscle mass, they add.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“For your average person taking creatine to boost their gains in the gym, this will hopefully change their perception about what it can help them achieve,” said lead author Imtiaz Desai, from UNSW’s School of Health Sciences and Neuroscience Research Australia (NeuRA), in a statement. “For professional athletes, particularly those who must be at a particular weight for their sport, the findings may inform how and when they take the supplement.”&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers from CHU Nîmes, Université Montpellier, and multiple MS centers in France have found that oral cholecalciferol in doses of 100,000 IU every two weeks significantly reduced disease activity in clinically isolated syndrome and early relapsing‑remitting multiple sclerosis.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;The study is &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2831270" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;i&gt;JAMA&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multiple sclerosis (MS) typically starts with an acute episode involving the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/central+nervous+system/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;central nervous system&lt;/a&gt;, such as &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/optic+neuritis/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;optic neuritis&lt;/a&gt; (inflammation of the optic nerve), transverse myelitis (inflammation of the spinal cord), or brainstem syndromes. This combination of initial signs is termed a clinically isolated syndrome (CIS), although CIS does not always convert to MS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The risk factors for relapse (conversion to clinically definite MS) include the presence of cerebrospinal fluid oligoclonal bands, a high number of T2‑weighted fluid‑attenuated inversion recovery lesions on brain MRI, and younger age at CIS onset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vitamin D deficiency is a risk factor for MS and is associated with disease activity, but prior supplementation trials have produced conflicting results. Given its immunomodulatory effects, vitamin D has mostly been tested as an add‑on therapy to interferon beta. The research team aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of vitamin D as monotherapy in recent CIS cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the D‑Lay MS randomized clinical trial, investigators conducted a parallel, double‑blind, placebo‑controlled study comparing high‑dose cholecalciferol versus placebo in untreated CIS.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;Eligibility criteria included adults aged 18–55 with CIS onset within 90 days, serum vitamin D &amp;lt;100 nmol/L, and MRI evidence of dissemination in space or ≥2 lesions plus positive oligoclonal bands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A total of 316 participants were randomized 1:1 to receive oral cholecalciferol 100,000 IU (n=163) or matching placebo (n=153) every two weeks for 24 months. The primary outcome was disease activity (first relapse or new/contrast‑enhancing MRI lesions). Of the 316 randomized, 303 (156 vitamin D; 147 placebo) received at least one dose and 288 completed the full 24‑month follow‑up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disease activity occurred in 94 of 156 patients (60.3%) receiving vitamin D versus 109 of 147 (74.1%) receiving placebo (HR, 0.66), and median time to disease activity was significantly longer with vitamin D (432 vs. 224 days).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All three secondary MRI outcomes favored vitamin D: overall MRI activity (57.1% vs. 65.3%; HR, 0.71), new or enlarging T2 lesions (46.2% vs. 59.2%; HR, 0.61), and contrast‑enhancing lesions (18.6% vs. 34.0%; HR, 0.47).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oral high‑dose cholecalciferol reduced &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/disease+activity/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;disease activity&lt;/a&gt; in CIS and early relapsing‑remitting MS. These findings support further investigation, including pulse high‑dose vitamin D as an add‑on therapy. High‑dose vitamin D may offer an inexpensive, well‑tolerated option, especially where access to standard disease-modifying therapies is limited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors recommend future trials of vitamin D add‑on therapy, particularly in patients with severe baseline deficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;Anti-vaccine advocate and health secretary for the United States, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., ordered the nonprofit he once chaired to delete a webpage that mimicked the design of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention while wrongly linking vaccines to autism. The New York Times earlier &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/22/health/cdc-kennedy-vaccine-disinformation.html"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; on the development.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;RFK Jr. has long been an outspoken skeptic of vaccines, despite scant evidence supporting cause for concern. The mock website featured evidence both supporting and debunking a connection to autism, but much of the research making a connection was reportedly not peer-reviewed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That is a common strategy with conspiracy theorists—espouse some mainstream views that are undoubtedly true in order to create an aura of legitimacy for the more dubious statements that follow. Bryan Johnson, the longevity guru, offers fundamental advice that is reasonable—i.e. get a full night’s rest, eat unprocessed foods—then veers &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/test-subjects-for-bryan-johnsons-anti-aging-program-said-it-made-them-feel-sick-report-2000579299"&gt;into more fringe ideas&lt;/a&gt; not necessarily supported by empirical evidence.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But Children’s Health Defense, the non-profit that RFK Jr. led for years before stepping aside in 2023, took an egregious step in creating a fake website intended to look like a real CDC fact sheet.

Or maybe it is simply that now, as the newly confirmed Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, he wants to use the institution and his newfound power to control the narrative. The CDC recently said it will &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/cdc-to-re-investigate-vaccines-and-autism-despite-decades-of-evidence-showing-no-link-2000573773"&gt;re-investigate the link&lt;/a&gt; between vaccines and autism.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is also possible that deadly &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/cdc-to-re-investigate-vaccines-and-autism-despite-decades-of-evidence-showing-no-link-2000573773"&gt;measles outbreaks&lt;/a&gt; across the United States have something to do with RFK Jr.’s move. The outbreaks have been concentrated in communities with low vaccination rates. In January, an unvaccinated “school-aged” child in Texas died from measles—the first such U.S. death &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/measles-outbreak-in-texas-turns-deadly-as-parents-scramble-for-shots-2000568730" data-mrf-link="https://gizmodo.com/measles-outbreak-in-texas-turns-deadly-as-parents-scramble-for-shots-2000568730"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; in a decade. Measles is highly contagious, and roughly 94% of a population needs to be vaccinated in order to prevent widespread transmission.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“Secretary Kennedy has instructed the Office of the General Counsel to send a formal demand to Children’s Health Defense requesting the removal of their website,” the Health and Human Services Department told the NYT in a statement. “At H.H.S. we are dedicated to restoring our agencies to their tradition of upholding gold-standard, evidence-based science.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;RFK Jr. during his Senate &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/01/30/nx-s1-5281452/trump-cabinet-picks-rfk-confirmation-hearing-help-committee"&gt;confirmation hearing&lt;/a&gt; said the CDC would return to “gold standard science,” and said he would support vaccines if shown data backing their safety.

&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_2-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, each breakfast and lunch recipe offers a very similar calorie range, so you can eat the same breakfast or lunch every day if that’s easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;span class="accordion__title"&gt;Why is there not a 1,200 calorie modification?&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_3-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We no longer provide modifications for 1,200-calorie days in our meal plans. The 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans suggests that limiting calories to 1,200 per day is too low for most people to meet their nutritional needs, plus it’s unsustainable for long-term health and well-being.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_193-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Whether you’re looking for quick prep meals, sheet-pan dishes or recipes you can make ahead, this plan makes it easy to enjoy an array of delicious flavors that fight inflammation. Throughout the week, you’ll enjoy a wide range of colorful, anti-inflammatory fruits and vegetables like berries, beets, dark leafy greens, asparagus, broccoli and carrots. We’ve also included a variety of beans, legumes and whole grains, all packed with powerful plant compounds known for their unique anti-inflammatory properties.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; To amplify the inflammation-fighting effects, we’ve added healthy fats, particularly omega-3 fatty acids, sourced from foods like salmon, walnuts and chia seeds.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Studies show that regularly eating anti-inflammatory foods helps to reduce the risk of developing chronic diseases like cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Registered dietitians thoughtfully create EatingWell’s meal plans to be easy-to-follow and delicious. Each meal plan meets specific parameters depending on the health condition and/or lifestyle goal it is targeting and is analyzed for accuracy using the nutrition database, ESHA Food Processor. As nutritional needs differ from person to person, we encourage you to use these plans as inspiration and adjust as you see fit. While we previously included meal plans and modifications for 1,200 calories, we no longer do. The 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans suggests that limiting your calories to 1,200 per day is too low for most people to meet their nutritional needs, plus it’s unsustainable for long-term health and well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

But just a few days in, he realized it was far harder than he anticipated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While on vacation in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/california/index.html" id="mol-63854520-08d5-11f0-aeeb-bdb3bbfdaf77"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; just four days into the challenge, he was having trouble finding places to eat out and had to sit out on lunches and dinners with a friend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Unable to stick to his strict diet and experiencing unpleasant - and inconvenient - intestinal problems, he caved and ate fast foods, ice cream and ultra-processed snacks within a week of starting the diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said: 'The biggest thing that sucks about it is when you're out. There is no convenience. I can't go to Chipotle. I can't go to a random Taco Stop Taco spot. I can't go to Dave's Hot Chicken or Chick-fil-A. Like, I have to cook.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Aside from having limited food options and being forced to skip out on meals, his health took a turn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Within a week of starting his journey, Moscato began feeling anxious, experiencing chest pains, as well as a 'weirdness' in his stomach, while also becoming mildly depressed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Realizing this was unsustainable, he decided to loosen the restrictions on his diet and started incorporating pork and some fruits into his meals by the third week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Jake Moscato, a 28-year-old Youtuber decided to try the red meat diet for 60 days to know whether he would look like 'a superhero or mess up his body'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The New Yorker had initially decided to only consume beef and salt for the entire 60-day period&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At one point in the first three days, the New Yorker said: 'I'm not looking forward to anything. I am so sick of this, I am so sick of meat. I might go &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/veganism/index.html" id="mol-67b97490-08b7-11f0-bddf-ffd29a983855" class=""&gt;vegan&lt;/a&gt; after this.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;His new diet was&lt;span&gt; '95, 97 percent red and do a little bit of fruit, eggs and pork.' &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After adding other food items to his diet, the YouTuber began to enjoy his meals again - noting that a combination of beef and pork smelled 'delicious.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As he came to the 60-day mark, Moscato also reported that his mood, energy and focus had also significantly improved. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Once he completed the challenge, Moscato underwent blood tests to see how much his body had changed.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Compared to his pre-challenge tests, results showed he had managed to reduce his body fat from 16 to 14.6 percent and drop his body weight from 208lbs to 202lbs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Notably, he had also gained about 2lbs in each of his arms and 2lbs of muscle in his chest - increasing his total muscle mass by about 6lbs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, test results showed his cholesterol levels increased by 12mg - going from 157 mg to 169mg, with bad cholesterol levels (LDL) jumping from 67mg to 92mg and his good cholesterol levels dropping from 81mg to 69mg. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Excessive LDL (low-density lipoprotein) or bad cholesterol &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;can build up in the walls of the arteries, forming plaque. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;This plaque can narrow the arteries and increase the risk of heart attacks and strokes. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;On the other hand, HDL (high-density lipoprotein) cholesterol is known as the 'good' cholesterol because it helps remove other forms of cholesterol from the bloodstream and lowers the risk for heart disease.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts that healthy cholesterol levels for both men and women above the age of 20 ranges between 125mg to 200mg while LDL levels should remain below 100mg and HDL levels 40mg and higher - indicating that Moscato was not at the risk of developing heart disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;His testosterone levels had also increased from 748 nanograms to a much higher 800ng while his iron levels went from 88 micrograms to a worrying 176ug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Before and after Moscato began his version of the carnivore diet&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The International Agency for Research on Cancer also classifies red meat as a Group 2A carcinogen (substances that can cause cancer) and could potentially lead to breast, colorectal and lung cancer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Excess iron, or iron overload, can damage vital organs like the liver, heart as well as the pancreas, leading to conditions like liver disease, diabetes and heart problems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While Moscato said he hated eating the carnivore diet during the challenge, he plans to continue to indulge in it while also consuming fruits and avocados after he received his results. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite his results, doctors suggest eating a plant-based diet such as the &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-12248549/Im-expert-helped-popularize-Mediterranean-diet-heres-eat-day.html"&gt;Mediterranean diet that rich in fruits&lt;/a&gt;, vegetables, whole grains and legumes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mountains of research have singled it out as the best and most well-rounded diet for health and longevity, lowering the risk of everything from dementia to heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2018 study published in JAMA assessed 26,000 women who followed the Mediterranean diet and found that those who had adhered to the diet closely for up to 12 years had up to a 28 percent reduced risk for heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The heart health boosting power of the diet comes from its emphasis on limiting saturated fats that typically come from animal products like meat and butter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Unsaturated fats, the type that makes up Mediterranean diet-approved foods such as olive oil, nuts, and fish help lower the level of 'bad' LDL cholesterol and triglycerides in the blood, which cause a build-up of fatty deposits in the blood vessels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;While Moscato, said that he hated eating the carnivore diet during the challenge, he plans to continue to indulge in it while also consuming fruits and avocados&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As those fatty deposits grow, they make it difficult for enough blood to flow through the arteries, which greatly increases the risk for a heart attack or stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts have long warned about the risks of consuming excessive red meat and skipping out on vegetables and grains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Red meats are high in saturated fats, which can cause elevated levels of bad cholesterol and increase the risk of developing cardiovascular diseases like coronary heart disease, strokes and heart failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The International Agency for Research on Cancer also classifies red meat as a Group 2A carcinogen (substances that can cause cancer) and excessive consumption could probably lead to breast, colorectal and lung cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Apart from this, a 2025 Neurology study found people who excessively eat red meat are more likely to develop cognitive decline and dementia compared to their counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study concluded that those who had eaten 0.25 or more servings per day had a 13 percent higher risk of developing dementia and 14 percent risk of cognitive decline compared to those who ate less than 0.10 servings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For a healthy diet, experts recommend limiting red meat consumption to no more than 12-18 ounces (cooked) per week or about three servings. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The most commonly taken of all medicines, the humble aspirin, has proved to be a panacea for all manner of conditions. Not just lowering the temperature in feverish illnesses and alleviating the pain and swelling of arthritic joints, but also protecting against migraine attacks, promoting the growth of babies in the womb and countering the adverse effects of raised &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/conditions/heart-health/how-why-reduce-blood-pressure-high-alcohol-hypertension/"&gt;blood pressure&lt;/a&gt; in pregnancy. And most important of all, markedly reducing the toll of disability and death in those at high risk of strokes and heart attacks. No other medicine does so much at so negligible a cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now we learn, as recently &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2025/03/05/aspirin-combat-cancer-scientists-cambridge-university/"&gt;reported in this paper&lt;/a&gt;, that researchers at Cambridge University have shown that aspirin also “helps combat cancer”. This is a significant twist to an old story that originates back in the 1990s when the studies investigating its role in preventing those strokes and heart attacks revealed quite unexpectedly that those taking aspirin were much less likely (by almost a half) to develop or succumb from &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/conditions/cancer/signs-symptoms-screenings-treatments-bowel-cancer/"&gt;bowel cancer&lt;/a&gt;. Logically then an aspirin a day might prevent on a major scale this third commonest of all cancers, as well as markedly improving the prospects of survival for those with the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be sure an aspirin a day has its hazards, specifically irritating the lining of the stomach which, given its blood thinning properties, can predispose to internal bleeding. This could be outweighed by its putative benefits about which, however, doctors in general have been sceptical. It seems intrinsically implausible that so simple a remedy should dramatically improve the outcome in bowel cancer in the absence of any conceivable mechanism as to how it might do so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No longer. The significance of this recent research is in having identified aspirin’s mode of action to involve activating the T cells of the body’s immune system to destroy cancer cells and inhibit their metastatic spread. This sophisticated form of ‘immunotherapy’ (as it is known) is similar in principle to that of other much more costly anti-cancer drugs with the prospect that their synergistic use together might further enhance their effectiveness. That is for the future. Meanwhile Prof Peter Elwood of Cardiff University in a comprehensive review in the &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41416-023-02506-5" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;British Journal of Cancer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; argues the circumstantial evidence is already so persuasive, “it is only reasonable that knowledge of its probable benefits should be widely publicised”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;This week’s query comes courtesy of Mrs MD from Devon who for the past couple of years has been afflicted by a “scalding” sensation at the tip and side of the tongue diagnosed by her doctor as “burning mouth syndrome”, for which he prescribed amitriptyline. This has not improved matters; on the contrary her symptoms have progressively worsened. “My tongue is now so sore and dry that food is difficult to swallow and mostly tastes like cardboard”. Might there be, she wonders, some other explanation? “I would be so grateful if anyone could offer advice”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, further to the recent observations on the eclectic range of remedies for those hot poker cluster headaches, a couple of readers comment on the impressive efficacy of ‘occipital nerve blockade’ – the injection of a steroid and local anaesthetic in the region of the occipital nerve at the back of the neck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next it is imperative, a reader warns, to be aware that “&lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/conditions/cold-flu/ask-dr-james-painful-headaches/"&gt;horrendous headaches&lt;/a&gt;” may be a result of the inflammation of the blood vessels of the scalp and eye known as giant cell arteritis. “The diagnosis was only made after I had had a couple of episodes of disturbed vision” he writes- but unfortunately despite prompt (mandatory) treatment  with high dose steroids he nonetheless lost most of the sight in the affected eye.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Email queries and comments in confidence to &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a class="ck-anchor ck-custom-link" href="mailto:Drjames@teleraph.co.uk"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Drjames@teleraph.co.uk&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The outbreak is believed to have originated in a local Mennonite community. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;The outbreak has grown to 309 cases and spread across 14 Texas counties, according to the most recent information from &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025" target="_self" rel="" title="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025"&gt;the Texas Department of State Health Services&lt;/a&gt;.

But the sit-down interview with Children’s Health Defense was the first time the parents of the child spoke at-length publicly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;In the video, the parents talk about their daughter’s sickness, and how it started mild but then got worse until their daughter was having trouble breathing. They talk about taking their child to the emergency room, and how hospital staff sedated and intubated the child.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;As she recounts the story, the mother begins to cry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;She dips her head into her hand, wipes her nose and her eyes. Another woman emerges and hugs the mother. The father stares out of the video frame, his face in profile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;The mother asks for a Kleenex. The father takes a deep breath. The couple declines to pause the interview. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;They recount being called to the hospital as their daughter’s condition deteriorated, and the mother remembers telling hospital staff over the phone to put the girl on life support if needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;article id="related-story-embed-DW2HXBQTGVDT7BWD3IAPMOZ7VY" data-oembed-type="related-story" class="dmnc_features-article-body-embeds-related-story-module__8iRXq block w-full inline-block my-2 p-7 bg-gray-lighter border border-gray-light ignore-body-text secondaryBold secondaryBold-7"&gt;&lt;label class="dmnc_features-article-body-embeds-related-story-module__dzAkK pr-3 text-blue-dark"&gt;Related:&lt;/label&gt;&lt;a class="dmnc_features-article-body-embeds-related-story-module__82BFj" href="/news/public-health/2025/03/05/will-the-measles-outbreak-spread-to-dallas-fort-worth-experts-say-it-depends-on-residents/"&gt;Will measles outbreak come to Dallas-Fort Worth? ‘Pockets of unvaccinated’ could play role&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;“I said, ‘Yes, whatever it takes to save her,’” the mother says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;Their daughter died shortly after, in the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="body-text-header"&gt;‘God does no wrong’&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;The couple’s other four children also contracted measles, but survived and did not have severe cases, the couple said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;The interviewer asks then about vaccination. She says she’s talked with other parents who still wouldn’t get their kids vaccinated because of the risk of “injury,” and says that Children’s Health Defense has also heard about vaccine injuries. (The measles-mumps-rubella vaccine has been heavily researched and, while there are occasional side effects or complications, has been proven to be both safe and effective.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;Would the couple get their children vaccinated if they could, the interviewer asks, knowing now that their other four children were given alternative treatments and survived?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;article id="related-story-embed-D2KNCTJURREBLEL2KGU4SXP6BI" data-oembed-type="related-story" class="dmnc_features-article-body-embeds-related-story-module__8iRXq block w-full inline-block my-2 p-7 bg-gray-lighter border border-gray-light ignore-body-text secondaryBold secondaryBold-7"&gt;&lt;label class="dmnc_features-article-body-embeds-related-story-module__dzAkK pr-3 text-blue-dark"&gt;Related:&lt;/label&gt;&lt;a class="dmnc_features-article-body-embeds-related-story-module__82BFj" href="/news/education/2025/03/24/data-these-charts-show-how-measles-vaccination-rates-declined-in-texas-public-schools/"&gt;Data: These 6 charts show how measles vaccination rates declined in Texas public schools&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;“We would absolutely not take the MMR,” the mother replies. “The measles wasn’t that bad, they got over it pretty quickly.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;The interviewer asks then about the “fear-mongering in the press,” and what the couple would recommend to other parents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;The mother answers through an interpreter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;“She says they would still say, ‘Don’t do the shots, there’s doctors that can help with measles, they’re not as bad as they’re making it out to be,” the interpreter, who is off-screen, says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;The father talks briefly about the benefits of natural immunity to the measles, which his other children now have. Then, through the interpreter, he talks about his daughter’s death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;“They think that it’s not as bad as the media is making it out to be and it was her time on earth,” the interpreter says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;“They believe that she’s better off where she is now versus all the negativity and all the stuff going on. They think she was too good for this earth.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;The couple says their other children have struggled, they miss their sister. The interviewer asks if there’s anything the community can do for them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;Both the husband and the wife reply, in English, “just pray.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;The husband speaks to the interpreter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;“He says God does no wrong and he wanted this to wake people up,” the interpreter says. “And he says he’s woken them up for sure.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;“Start a better life,” the father adds in English. “Come closer to him.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="body-text-header"&gt;Measles vaccination&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;The measles outbreak that started in Texas is one of several that have taken root across the U.S. as vaccination rates have dipped nationwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;Measles, which is a highly contagious virus, has been considered eliminated in the U.S. since 2000, due to high vaccine uptake. But the virus is so contagious that even small pockets of unvaccinated people are susceptible to an outbreak if the virus is introduced to the community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;Because of the outbreak that began in Gaines County, Texas has already reported more measles cases in 2025 than in any full year since 1992.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;The two-dose measles-mumps-rubella vaccine is 97% effective at preventing measles infection. It’s recommended in childhood beginning at about 12 months old. It’s also recommended for all older children and adults, with the exception of people who are pregnant or immunocompromised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;Local health authorities across Texas are offering the measles vaccine at clinics. People can also contact their doctors or pharmacies to ask about vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Dallas Morning News</author><pubDate>Mon, 24 Mar 2025 17:48:01 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi0wFBVV95cUxQLS00OHZ4ZUR6MjhwZWt0MTVzTkZNWUV3ZnBmSmpSOGpVM3A2Si1JQ1BRMV9zVkNvOUh5aU9tNmxHMVhzdUlEaUxWczhBdEIzVWhYZjYtYkVGUnRXMWZJZjNGbTluNWx1RkREdlU1bzNFaGhCOW9GeTF4QzNqc3RTUkdnclNRTVp3Vi11TWpMeUFNTFFKbkRDWS0yeUZkMUVMQkItVlZNMVVUVEQ0TjFjekJ1MGZxUGpLZThPdUNRRGJvbDI0T3ZKOVJ4eXZfeUdHdmlF</guid></item><item><title>One 21-year-old twin got stage 4 colon cancer, the other didn't... their doctor has a terrifying theory why - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinAFBVV95cUxQZnhJVUgzZUVpdTdvSXdacC03OTJ6N09rVmhJdEJmdDE2cmYyRzFrcnFLNUt6OFc1cHc1OTJ5SGRGS1BEU0FQOEt0S3NURWdISnh1WDdfaGdad2doQ01zNEIzazdZX05jV0w1V2pjX1dDTW8xdEIxMkZ1LUpQczZ2R1pPUjJRUnB5WUlpNVpLTzQzVzAwTGRJRktXR27SAaIBQVVfeXFMT1gwdzlaQkd6YVNQV0xnTm00a2Z6SlRkcjRDbVdvX2pxbjRFMmRmRk1nbTY0SnBoSjJuS2YwV3FTSFhCUkpESU9oZnJFNHZuYjVsMFBtUF9WbjMxYURvZEc2OGdnd05MM19SalJoYWZ1ZVBnSXRjR25IU3I2U1NIaUwxNXdVY01sdUdmNk5rMnQydlFvTmdXeU8xMEVaV3QxWkRn?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Brinlee Luster and her twin sister, Mariela, do everything together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They went to the same college, studied the same subjects, met their husbands on the same day and even got married just two months apart. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But in 2023, Brinlee had to face a devastating diagnosis alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The 21-year-old from &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/utah/index.html" id="mol-c3885ba0-08bd-11f0-b116-3597f85e5054"&gt;Utah&lt;/a&gt; suddenly began suffering 'severe abdominal cramping' and was so fatigued she could hardly complete a hike that usually came as second nature. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors dismissed her symptoms as anxiety, side effects of her birth control, or irritable bowel syndrome. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the midst of planning her wedding and finishing college at Utah State University, Brinlee also put the symptoms down to stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But when her health worsened a few months later, a colonoscopy revealed stage four colon cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mariela, however, has remained healthy, though she did undergo a colonoscopy to remove polyps, which can turn into cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Their case highlights the mystery about &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14460025/colon-cancer-doctor-young-people-warning-signs-risk.html"&gt;what's causing an explosion of colon cancers&lt;/a&gt; in young people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Brinlee Luster was diagnosed with stage four colon cancer at age 21, just before graduating college and getting married.

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While doctors are still &lt;a target="_self" href="/snapchat/article-13906749/A-doctor-blames-two-ingredients-Americas-colon-cancer-crisis.html"&gt;unraveling the causes of America's colon cancer epidemic&lt;/a&gt;, Dr Lewis suggested antibiotic use going all the way back to childhood could be a factor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said: 'Antibiotics in childhood and in adulthood can affect the bacteria that line the colon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We're being very, very careful about prescribing antibiotics to young people because we do know there is at least a slight increased risk for colon cancer decades later.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Because Brinlee and Mariela had such similar lifestyle and dietary habits, the different use of antibiotics in their childhoods may have played a role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Colorectal &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-c28441d0-08ac-11f0-a088-dfe2cc6ff8d4"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; is the fourth most common cancer in the US and the second-leading cause of cancer deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The American Cancer Society estimates 154,270 Americans will be diagnosed with colon cancer this year, and 52,900 will die. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This includes 19,550 cases and 3,750 deaths in under-50s.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;By 2030, colon cancer is estimated to be the biggest cancer killer in patients under 50. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Antibiotic use has been a growing concern among colorectal oncologists, as evidence suggests the drugs could permanently alter protective bacteria lining the intestinal tract. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Antibiotics, prescribed more than 230million times a year in the US, are meant to kill harmful bacteria, but they also attack the gut's healthy bacteria, which regulate digestion and help the immune system protect against infections. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This leaves the digestive tract vulnerable to inflammation, which may cause cells to mutate and become cancerous.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Rates of colorectal cancer in Americans under 50 have risen over the past two decades. This graph shows the latest year for which data is available&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Brinlee, pictured here, underwent 30 rounds of chemotherapy. She has been in remission since December&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Brinlee and Mariela, both pictured here, have started a sweatshirt brand to provide easy IV access for people going through chemotherapy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41416-021-01665-7"&gt;2021 study&lt;/a&gt; of more than 40,000 people found antibiotic use was more strongly linked to colon cancer in younger patients than older patients. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The experts believe this could be due to a worldwide increase in antibiotic use, as prescriptions have surged 46 percent across the globe since 2000. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, experts have also suggested lifestyle factors like obesity, diet, and physical inactivity can also lead to cancer-causing inflammation in the gut.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Brinlee underwent 30 rounds of chemotherapy, completing the treatment in December. She is now cancer free. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mariela also had a colonoscopy after her sister's diagnosis, where doctors removed several polyps.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While many of these are harmless, some may develop into cancer due to abnormal cell growth and mutations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mariela said: 'I like to think that she really did save my life in a way because I was headed down that route.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The twins are working to raise awareness and have also created 'The Port Studio,' a line of sweatshirts that provide easy IV access for people going through chemotherapy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Brinlee said: 'I don't want to hide that I had cancer. Sharing your story is uncomfortable, but I want to be able to share it so that people can be inspired.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'There's always room for hope.'  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Now scientists say they have completed proof-of-concept experiments for a new type of long-lasting implant that self-assembles in the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;While not yet tested in humans, the researchers behind the work say the approach could bring benefits beyond the field of birth control, offering a simple way to administer long-acting drug delivery systems without the need for invasive procedures – an appealing prospect for parts of the world with poor medical infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“It’s suitable for any poorly soluble hydrophobic drug, especially where long-acting delivery is needed. This includes treatments for HIV, TB, schizophrenia, chronic pain, or metabolic disease​,” said Dr Giovanni Traverso, a co-author of the study from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a gastroenterologist at Brigham and Women’s hospital in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The approach involves injecting micro-crystals of a synthetic version of the hormone progesterone contained in a solvent that does not mix well with water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Once in the body, the solvent exchanges with bodily fluid. However, the micro-crystals prefer to clump together than interact with this water-rich environment. This, together with the formation of further crystals as the solvents exchange, results in the development of a solid implant, capable of releasing the drug slowly over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The team, whose study was published &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s44286-025-00194-x" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;in the journal Nature Chemical Engineering&lt;/a&gt;, tested the approach in rats, allowing them to refine the choice of solvent in the injection. The drug release in rats was sustained for at least 97 days, although Traverso said there was potential for longer durations depending on formulation adjustments​.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“The dosing and volumes of drug are compatible with multi-year dosing,” he said, adding that the formation of a solid implant means it can be removed if required, while the approach is also compatible with the use of small needles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;However, the research is still in its early stages, with the efficacy of the approach yet to be tested. “It lays the groundwork for future human studies which we hope will start in the next three to five years,” Traverso said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Dr Janet Barter, the president of the Faculty of Sexual and Reproductive Healthcare, said the approach could be an exciting advancement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“This innovation has the potential to be convenient option for individuals in low-resource settings, where access to contraception and healthcare services can be limited,” she said. “We welcome further research into the safety, efficacy, and the accessibility of this promising technology and encourage the authors to work with potential users in future to ensure they meet the needs and preferences of those who will rely on it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Mon, 24 Mar 2025 17:25:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitgFBVV95cUxOeUdydlFXRmFOQUJFZkJSZFAySGd2YlNKYVEzVHItdW11dGRPZGEzM2RReHJlVUw3WXQtV3Y1dkVidEFqUWJ6UEZxQkszc2pMREVPRnBjSlVxTkpkcXIyT1B0NTlVNXFocVNtQWUweUtaQUtTdVNBZDdDQUpIazdhYnQ5N1lzNjRKZHN4d1ZobVc4UGMyeEhHTEFZZ01tRS1fclhvbkxQM25ZeDZmNHU1UzAxWEU1Zw</guid></item><item><title>Simple walking technique that's groundbreaking for weight-loss and longevity... here's how to do it - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A new walking technique is sure to put a pep in your step.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Interval walking training (IWT) involves walking at a slow pace for three minutes, then at a fast pace for three minutes, and then returning to a slow pace for another three minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers say &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13527307/scientists-step-guide-burning-calories-walk-stride.html"&gt;taking long strides&lt;/a&gt;, and engaging the upper body by swinging one's arms are key to getting the most out of the practice. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to a growing body of evidence, this simple tweak to the way you get your daily steps could slash your &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-11803477/Just-11-MINUTES-brisk-walking-day-slash-chances-dying-early-study-reveals.html"&gt;risk of an early death&lt;/a&gt; and disease more than running on a treadmill can.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Raising one's heart rate, even for brief spurts, improves blood flow to deliver oxygen and nutrients to all parts of the body, triggers the release of feel-good endorphins, strengthens the heart, burns calories, and enhances cognition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And because it is &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/femail/article-12452215/Walking-workout-Australia-benefits-best-exercise-Rachael-Attard-lean-legs.html"&gt;less intense on the body&lt;/a&gt; than jogging and stair-climbing, the activity is easier on the joints, hips, and knees, and is a safe option for people who are older and more fragile, or new to exercise, to do everyday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;IWT was developed by a team at Shinshu University in Matsumoto, &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/japan/index.html" id="mol-0dc02720-08cd-11f0-bc3f-633faae45867"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;, in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Their research showed that, five months of IWT, subject saw an average 10 percent improvement in overall fitness, along with long-term benefits including lower blood pressure and a 10 to 15 percent increase in aerobic capacity—equivalent to reversing cardiovascular age by about 10 years, according to researchers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Interval walking training (IWT) is an exercise program developed by researchers in Japan that alternates between walking at a brisk pace of about five miles per hour for several minutes, followed by a slower recovery pace just slightly faster than a casual stroll&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Walking is already one of the best forms of exercise, with studies showing a 30 percent reduced risk of early death, heart disease, and diabetes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's low-intensity in nature, making it sustainable and accessible for anyone while still boosting oxygen flow and blood circulation throughout the body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Walking gently strengthens the heart compared to high-impact activities like running, enhances lung capacity, and improves metabolism and other markers of chronic disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;IWT enhances the benefits of walking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Adding short bursts of higher effort elevates the heart rate more than maintaining a steady pace, boosts calories burned, and prompts a greater release of endorphins. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Participants performed five sets of exercises per session four or more days per week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;IWT involves alternating between three minutes of fast walking – researchers say using about 70 percent effort - and three minutes of relaxed walking, roughly 40 percent effort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is meant to be done five times at least four times per week. The entire five-round set including a warm up and cool down should take roughly 24 minutes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Breathing should be heavy enough that the person is able to speak in truncated phrases, but not sing or have very detailed conversations. Researchers advise reaching 70 to 85 percent of one's maximum heart rate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If a person is not at least slightly breathless, the workout is too easy. But if they're gasping for air, they are working too hard and should slow down. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They should also avoid slouching, clenching their fists, and recommend a straight, tall posture.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to IWT's co-creator Dr Hiroshi Nose, most exercise programs for older adults are hard to stick to long-term. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While gyms with treadmills and stationary bikes are effective forms of exercise that can track one’s progress, these can be expensive and hard to stick to long-term. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers from Shinshu University and Jukunen Taiikudaigaku Research Center in Matsumoto published a study in 2017 that included more than 6,400 middle-aged and senior adults from Japan, the US, and Denmark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They included healthy individuals and those with diseases related to lifestyle, including high blood pressure and diabetes, starting in 2007.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Two graphs demonstrating that adults who consistently followed their interval walking program over 22 months significantly improved their cardiovascular fitness, with the most committed walkers showing the greatest gains&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Graph showing that participants who consistently followed their walking program over 22 months significantly reduced their risks for common health problems like high blood pressure and cholesterol, with the most active walkers seeing the greatest benefits&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Subjects also wore a tracker around their waist to track steps, speed, and calories burned and signaled to the wearer when to go from slow to fast walking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At the start of the study and at the end five years later, researchers measured their aerobic capacity, or how well the heart, lungs, and muscles use oxygen during exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A higher aerobic capacity helps one run farther and train harder without getting winded. And a higher capacity is linked to a lower risk of heart disease, diabetes, and premature death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People in the study uploaded their walking data every two weeks to an app and got automated feedback and personalized advice from trainers about optimizing their time walking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After five months, researchers identified the subjects’ peak aerobic capacities, blood pressure, and muscle strength. They also continued to track their lifestyle-related disease scores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To see how well people adhered to the exercise plan, researchers continued collecting data for thousands of adults for about two years.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After five months, subjects saw an average 10 percent fitness boost. In the long term, they had lower blood pressure and an aerobic capacity that reached 10 to 15 percent – the equivalent, researchers say, to rolling your cardiovascular age by about 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Muscles became stronger as well, which reduces fall risks and improves mobility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also saw a 20 percent reduction in lifestyle disease scores, which look for obesity, high blood pressure, diabetes, and high cholesterol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And overall, people were in a better mood, in part because people walked in groups, which reduced loneliness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After about two years, 70 percent of people stuck with IWT, compared to roughly 30 percent for gym memberships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Their findings were published in the journal &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://journals.lww.com/acsm-essr/fulltext/2017/07000/interval_walking_training_can_increase_physical.6.aspx"&gt;Exercise and Sport Sciences Reviews&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Exercise training is one of the most effective strategies for decreasing the likelihood of age- and lifestyle-related diseases. This promotes an older person’s sense of independence and enhances their quality of life in the rapidly growing elderly population of many countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 24 Mar 2025 17:19:20 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>Groundbreaking walking technique that has 2x more health benefits - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMivgFBVV95cUxNZTJMZ1hmcFRwR3ItNXNyLTd5VkxjZF95bVZoWmJRaF9RM3habk1iQW1WX1FQaFE4cnBraUxmR2JZdTJJSlZMS1RQV0NZU0dlZTMwRThLMnlac25VUnI2dTlTbHVYX09NY1l0NVFiRHktajFHckp0Q3FXT012ZTVfcnBWeVZjdk5ja0dSYUVqTDJyUXAtLVlQVnlXaVM4RmNoUk5jY05ya090akViSUJsWGtkbEhZLVdQZUtIOFBR?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A new walking technique is sure to put a pep in your step.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Interval walking training (IWT) involves walking at a slow pace for three minutes, then at a fast pace for three minutes, and then returning to a slow pace for another three minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers say &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13527307/scientists-step-guide-burning-calories-walk-stride.html"&gt;taking long strides&lt;/a&gt;, and engaging the upper body by swinging one's arms are key to getting the most out of the practice. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to a growing body of evidence, this simple tweak to the way you get your daily steps could slash your &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-11803477/Just-11-MINUTES-brisk-walking-day-slash-chances-dying-early-study-reveals.html"&gt;risk of an early death&lt;/a&gt; and disease more than running on a treadmill can.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Raising one's heart rate, even for brief spurts, improves blood flow to deliver oxygen and nutrients to all parts of the body, triggers the release of feel-good endorphins, strengthens the heart, burns calories, and enhances cognition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And because it is &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/femail/article-12452215/Walking-workout-Australia-benefits-best-exercise-Rachael-Attard-lean-legs.html"&gt;less intense on the body&lt;/a&gt; than jogging and stair-climbing, the activity is easier on the joints, hips, and knees, and is a safe option for people who are older and more fragile, or new to exercise, to do everyday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;IWT was developed by a team at Shinshu University in Matsumoto, &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/japan/index.html" id="mol-0dc02720-08cd-11f0-bc3f-633faae45867"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;, in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Their research showed that, five months of IWT, subject saw an average 10 percent improvement in overall fitness, along with long-term benefits including lower blood pressure and a 10 to 15 percent increase in aerobic capacity—equivalent to reversing cardiovascular age by about 10 years, according to researchers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Interval walking training (IWT) is an exercise program developed by researchers in Japan that alternates between walking at a brisk pace of about five miles per hour for several minutes, followed by a slower recovery pace just slightly faster than a casual stroll&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Walking is already one of the best forms of exercise, with studies showing a 30 percent reduced risk of early death, heart disease, and diabetes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's low-intensity in nature, making it sustainable and accessible for anyone while still boosting oxygen flow and blood circulation throughout the body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Walking gently strengthens the heart compared to high-impact activities like running, enhances lung capacity, and improves metabolism and other markers of chronic disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;IWT enhances the benefits of walking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Adding short bursts of higher effort elevates the heart rate more than maintaining a steady pace, boosts calories burned, and prompts a greater release of endorphins. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Participants performed five sets of exercises per session four or more days per week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;IWT involves alternating between three minutes of fast walking – researchers say using about 70 percent effort - and three minutes of relaxed walking, roughly 40 percent effort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is meant to be done five times at least four times per week. The entire five-round set including a warm up and cool down should take roughly 24 minutes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Breathing should be heavy enough that the person is able to speak in truncated phrases, but not sing or have very detailed conversations. Researchers advise reaching 70 to 85 percent of one's maximum heart rate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If a person is not at least slightly breathless, the workout is too easy. But if they're gasping for air, they are working too hard and should slow down. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They should also avoid slouching, clenching their fists, and recommend a straight, tall posture.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to IWT's co-creator Dr Hiroshi Nose, most exercise programs for older adults are hard to stick to long-term. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While gyms with treadmills and stationary bikes are effective forms of exercise that can track one’s progress, these can be expensive and hard to stick to long-term. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers from Shinshu University and Jukunen Taiikudaigaku Research Center in Matsumoto published a study in 2017 that included more than 6,400 middle-aged and senior adults from Japan, the US, and Denmark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They included healthy individuals and those with diseases related to lifestyle, including high blood pressure and diabetes, starting in 2007.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Two graphs demonstrating that adults who consistently followed their interval walking program over 22 months significantly improved their cardiovascular fitness, with the most committed walkers showing the greatest gains&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Graph showing that participants who consistently followed their walking program over 22 months significantly reduced their risks for common health problems like high blood pressure and cholesterol, with the most active walkers seeing the greatest benefits&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Subjects also wore a tracker around their waist to track steps, speed, and calories burned and signaled to the wearer when to go from slow to fast walking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At the start of the study and at the end five years later, researchers measured their aerobic capacity, or how well the heart, lungs, and muscles use oxygen during exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A higher aerobic capacity helps one run farther and train harder without getting winded.

&lt;p&gt;TUCSON, Ariz — A convention held at Casino Del Sol was shut down prematurely due to reports of ongoing medical concerns.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Wild Wild West Steampunk Convention was cancelled by the Tribal Medical Authority.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a since-deleted Facebook post from the Wild Wild West Steampunk Con's Facebook page, multiple individuals at the hotel reported they were not feeling well. The post listed reported symptoms included stomach pain, nausea, vomiting and food aversion. They also recommended wearing masks.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steampunk also made a statement in the comments of their first post alerting of the closure, which reads, "we are shutting down comments on this post as we cannot allow speculation or infighting to carry on! We will have further information when it is available."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multiple people from the event contacted &lt;a href="https://www.kvoa.com/news/top-stories/casino-del-sol-shuts-down-event-due-to-contagious-virus/article_f4c351dc-a453-4e09-a531-5ec8ba6c947d.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;News 4 Tucson &lt;/a&gt;searching for answers.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Israel Hoyer, a vender at the event, called News 4 Tucson to explain what he witnessed.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"They didn't tell us anything and that was concerning. They just said it was a medical evacuation and that they had to get everyone out of the ballroom where the vendors were at and that they were shutting down the Hotel Casino where all the vendors and people were staying as well and that we all had to leave. We had two hours to break down everything and get out of the building," Hoyer said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A statement shared on Casino Del Sol's Facebook page states a member of a group at the hotel informed management a member of their group had a contagious virus, and a few others were showing symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The full statement reads, "This afternoon a member of a group staying at Casino Del Sol informed management that a member of their group had a contagious virus and a few others were showing symptoms. Out of caution we informed the group they should stop the remainder of their festivities. The health and welfare of our guests and team members is of paramount importance and we will provide updates as needed. Casino Del Sol remains open for business."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have reached out to the Tribal Medical Authority for comment.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;SIERRA VISTA, Ariz. (KVOA) - A hiker experienced an unexpected encounter with a wild animal in Ash Canyon south of Sierra Vista on March 23, 2025. The Cochise County Sheriff's Office was promptly contacted about the attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hiker reported that after a day of hiking, he returned to his vehicle to find a coatimundi perched on the hood. His attempts to scare the animal away led to the coatimundi tearing off a windshield wiper and subsequently attacking him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_top" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hiker managed to get inside his vehicle, but not before the animal scratched and bit him. He is now receiving a rabies vaccine at a local hospital as a precaution and plans to return to his home in Tucson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A USDA Wildlife Specialist responded to the scene but could not locate the coatimundi. The specialist will return later to continue the search.

But new research from &lt;a href="https://www.yale.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Yale University&lt;/a&gt; challenges that idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-early-role-of-the-hippocampus"&gt;Early role of the hippocampus&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists at Yale University have found that even very young &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/wearable-imaging-device-reveals-infant-brain-activity/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;infants&lt;/a&gt; can encode memories. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team studied babies aged four months to two years using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to monitor their brains as they viewed new images of faces, objects, and scenes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When infants were shown a previously seen image alongside a new one, those who had more hippocampal activity during the first viewing were more likely to look longer at the familiar image. That’s a sign the infant remembered it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study senior author Nick Turk-Browne is a professor of psychology in Yale’s Faculty of Arts and Sciences and director of Yale’s Wu Tsai Institute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The hallmark of these types of memories, which we call episodic memories, is that you can describe them to others, but that’s off the table when you’re dealing with pre-verbal infants,” said Turk-Browne.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-measuring-memory-in-babies"&gt;Measuring memory in babies&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because babies can’t talk, studying their memory has always been tricky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team developed a test using &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/sounds-can-change-the-way-we-see-things/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;visual recognition&lt;/a&gt;. Babies usually look longer at things they recognize. So, if a baby stared at a previously seen image longer than a new one, researchers took that as a sign of recognition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When babies have seen something just once before, we expect them to look at it more when they see it again,” said Turk-Browne. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So in this task, if an infant stares at the previously seen image more than the new one next to it, that can be interpreted as the baby recognizing it as familiar.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-brain-activity-in-the-hippocampus"&gt;Brain activity in the hippocampus &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study focused on the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/sleep-reboots-the-brain-making-room-for-new-memories/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;hippocampus&lt;/a&gt; – the area of the brain involved in memory. The researchers found that activity in the hippocampus during the initial viewing of an image predicted how well the baby would recognize it later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The strongest activity was in the back part of the hippocampus, which in adults is associated with episodic memory – our ability to remember specific events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results were consistent across all 26 infants in the study, but the effect was especially strong in those over 12 months old. This supports the idea that the hippocampus gradually develops the capacity for episodic memory in the second year of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-two-types-of-memory-in-one-small-brain"&gt;Two types of memory in one small brain&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This isn’t the first time the Yale team has looked at memory in babies. In earlier research, the researchers showed that even three-month-old infants use a different type of memory called “statistical learning.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While episodic memory helps us remember specific events – like a birthday party – statistical learning helps us notice patterns, such as how most birthday parties have balloons and cake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Statistical learning is about extracting the structure in the world around us,” said Turk-Browne. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is critical for the development of language, vision, concepts, and more. So it’s understandable why statistical learning may come into play earlier than episodic memory.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These two types of memory use different areas of the hippocampus. Statistical learning happens in the front part, which develops earlier. Episodic memory relies more on the back part, which matures later. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This difference might explain why babies are good at picking up patterns even if they can’t recall specific events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-where-do-those-early-memories-go"&gt;Where do those early memories go?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If babies can form episodic memories, why don’t we remember our own earliest experiences? According to Professor Turk-Browne, there are a few possible explanations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One is that these early memories don’t stick around – they may fade before becoming part of long-term memory. Another idea is that the memories still exist but are inaccessible later in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, the Yale team is now exploring whether memories formed in infancy can persist, even if we can’t recall them as adults. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers are testing whether children can recognize home videos taken from their own perspective as babies. Early results suggest some of these memories might last into preschool years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tristan Yates, lead author of the current study,  is a developmental cognitive neuroscientist at Colombia University who received her PhD from Yale under the guidance of Professor Turk-Browne.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Tristan’s work in humans is remarkably compatible with recent animal evidence that infantile amnesia is a retrieval problem,” said Turk-Browne. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re working to track the durability of hippocampal memories across childhood and even beginning to entertain the radical, almost sci-fi possibility that they may endure in some form into adulthood, despite being inaccessible.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-new-understanding-of-the-baby-brain"&gt;A new understanding of the baby brain&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study suggests that the baby brain might be more powerful than we thought and that our earliest memories may not be completely lost. Instead, they might be stored in ways we don’t yet understand. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hippocampus seems to be working much earlier in life than once believed, and the idea that we simply can’t retrieve those memories – rather than not forming them at all – is gaining traction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research opens new questions about how memory develops, how it changes over time, and whether those lost moments from our baby years are still hidden deep within us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adt7570" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Science&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?

    &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span&gt;I still remember the elation I felt crossing the finish line of my first marathon – mixed with sheer exhaustion and the nagging question of how my brain was coping with the intense effort. It turns out, I wasn’t alone in wondering about the brain’s response to endurance running.   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;A new study conducted at the University of the Basque Country, published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s42255-025-01244-7" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Nature Metabolism&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, reveals that marathon running can cause a temporary reduction in brain myelin content, with levels fully recovering within two months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;Why does myelin matter for marathon runners?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Marathon running is the ultimate test of human endurance, pushing the body to its metabolic limits over a grueling distance of 42 km. During a marathon, runners predominantly rely on carbohydrates, particularly glycogen stored in their muscles, as the primary source of energy. However, as glycogen reserves become depleted over the course of the race, the body gradually shifts to utilizing fat as fuel. This metabolic transition is essential for maintaining energy levels during prolonged exercise, but it also poses a challenge for the brain – which typically relies on glucose as its primary energy source.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="featuredVendors"&gt;&lt;div class="featuredVendorInner"&gt;&lt;div class="row"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Want more breaking news?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Subscribe to &lt;i&gt;Technology Networks&lt;/i&gt;’ daily newsletter, delivering breaking science news straight to your inbox every day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.technologynetworks.com/subscribe-to-breaking-science-news" target="_blank" class="btn"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Subscribe for FREE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Scientists are now suggesting that the brain may adapt to this energy deficit by utilizing myelin lipids as an alternative fuel. Myelin is a fatty substance that surrounds and insulates nerve fibers in the brain and spinal cord, forming a sheath that facilitates the rapid transmission of electrical signals between neurons. Composed of approximately 70–80% lipids, myelin has traditionally been understood as purely structural and insulating. However, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-024-01749-6" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;span&gt;animal studies&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; have hinted at a dual function: under extreme metabolic stress, myelin lipids may be mobilized to sustain neural function. Yet, whether this phenomenon occurs in humans during endurance exercise has remained unclear.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;Could the brain also be using myelin as a metabolic buffer during these moments of acute energy shortage? The possibility raises important questions about the potential long-term impacts of endurance training on brain health, particularly for those who regularly undertake such strenuous activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;Such a question is especially relevant to marathon runners, who push their bodies through hours of continuous physical effort, potentially depleting glycogen stores and forcing the body to draw on fat reserves. This hypothesis led corresponding author &lt;a href="https://www.achucarro.org/director/carlos-matute/" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Carlos J. Matute&lt;/a&gt;, a professor in the Department of Neurosciences at the University of the Basque Country, and colleagues to investigate whether intense endurance exercise – like running a marathon – could transiently reduce brain myelin content in humans. Although &lt;a href="https://nyaspubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/nyas.14912" target="_blank"&gt;previous studies&lt;/a&gt; have explored the effects of prolonged exercise on the brain, none have specifically examined changes in myelin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;Marathon running temporarily affects brain myelin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Matute and his team used &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.technologynetworks.com/neuroscience/articles/neuroimaging-techniques-and-what-a-brain-image-can-tell-us-363422" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;span&gt;advanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;with a specialized technique called multicomponent relaxometry to assess the myelin water fraction (MWF) – a well-established imaging biomarker that reflects the amount of myelin in the brain – on 10 marathon runners before and after completing a 42 km race. MWF is calculated by measuring the proportion of water trapped between the lipid bilayers of the myelin sheath relative to the total water content in brain tissue. This method is particularly sensitive to subtle changes in myelin levels and is commonly used to monitor myelin integrity in neurological conditions. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="grey-box-container"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;Multicomponent relaxometry&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span&gt;An MRI technique that analyzes the relaxation times of water molecules to differentiate between different tissue components. It is commonly used to measure the MWF, which reflects the amount of myelin in the brain.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Brain scans were performed on all participants (8 men and 2 women) both before and within 48 hours after completing the race. Follow-up scans were also performed on two of the runners two weeks post-race and on six runners two months post-race to track recovery. The imaging technique generated detailed 3D parametric maps of MWF, allowing researchers to detect even minor changes in myelin content.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;The study revealed a consistent reduction in MWF in 12 areas of white matter, with the most significant reductions – up to 28% and 26% – observed in the pontine crossing and corticospinal tracts, respectively. The affected areas are vital for motor function and integrating sensory and emotional inputs, highlighting a potential impact on movement and emotional regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="grey-box-container"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;Pontine crossing tracts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span&gt;White matter pathways in the brainstem that are involved in the coordination and integration of motor signals from the brain to the spinal cord.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;Corticospinal tracts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Major neural pathways that transmit motor commands from the cerebral cortex to the spinal cord, playing a crucial role in voluntary motor control.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span&gt;“The signal for myelin water fraction – a surrogate of myelin content – is substantially reduced upon marathon running in specific brain regions but recovers within two months. These findings suggest that brain myelin content is temporarily and reversibly diminished by severe exercise,” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s42255-025-01244-7" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;span&gt;said&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; the authors.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;MWF levels began to rebound within two weeks and by two months post-marathon, MWF levels had fully recovered to pre-race levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;The team examined whether the observed decrease in MWF could be attributed to dehydration, as prolonged endurance exercise often leads to fluid loss. However, analyses of brain volume and hydration status indicated that neither global nor regional dehydration was responsible for the changes in MWF. Brain volumes remained unchanged before and after the race, suggesting that the reduction in MWF truly reflected a temporary depletion of myelin content rather than changes in water distribution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;Metabolic myelin plasticity and its implications&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The study introduces the concept of “metabolic myelin plasticity” – the idea that myelin may also function as a lipid reservoir during periods of metabolic stress. The idea proposes that myelin lipids could be mobilized as an energy source when common brain nutrients, like glucose, are in short supply. This concept challenges the conventional view of myelin as purely a structural entity and suggests that it may play an adaptive role in maintaining neural function during extreme endurance activities.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;“Myelin plasticity is fundamental to brain adaptation to neuronal activity, as it modifies myelin structure by increasing or decreasing the thickness of the myelin sheath. Our findings strongly suggest that widespread reversible MWF reduction in endurance physical exercise represents a new form of plasticity to support brain function at the expense of myelin lipid use,” &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s42255-025-01244-7" target="_blank"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; the authors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;The ability to draw on myelin lipids may support brain function during endurance challenges, but repeated depletion and restoration of myelin could have long-term consequences, particularly in athletes who frequently engage in prolonged, strenuous activities. Individuals with neurological vulnerabilities, such as those predisposed to demyelinating diseases, might also face increased risks if myelin is routinely used as an energy reserve. While the reversible nature of MWF reduction is reassuring, it remains unclear whether repeated cycles of depletion and recovery could lead to cumulative damage or impaired remyelination over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;Larger and more comprehensive studies are essential to validate these findings and explore their broader implications. Future research should investigate whether cognitive or neurophysiological functions are affected during or after endurance activities, particularly in those who regularly participate in marathons or ultramarathons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;Reference:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt; Ramos-Cabrer P, Cabrera-Zubizarreta A, Padro D, Matute-González M, Rodríguez-Antigüedad A, Matute C.

According to the &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/whole-grains/art-20047826" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt;, whole grains can help control cholesterol levels, weight and blood pressure, and can help lower the risk of heart disease and diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;That doesn’t mean refined grains need to be entirely avoided, experts say. In fact, focusing too much on specific foods and nutrients rather than one’s overall health and lifestyle can have more deleterious effects than eating a slice of white bread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Here’s what you need to know about whole grains versus refined grains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-is-the-difference-between-whole-grains-and-refined-grains" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;What is the difference between whole grains and refined grains?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Grains are the edible, dry seeds of grasses grown for food. Every whole-grain kernel is made up of three components, explains Dena Champion, a registered dietitian at the Ohio State University Wexner medical center: a hard outer coating known as bran, a small core known as the germ and a large, starchy middle layer called endosperm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;When a whole-grain kernel is processed to make a refined grain, like white flour, it is stripped of the germ and bran, leaving only the endosperm. The endosperm is the largest component of whole grain, but it also contains the fewest nutrients. Removing the germ and bran from grains also removes significant amounts of fiber, protein, vitamins and minerals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="54b7068d-7ea8-4575-8fc4-2d940bc414b0" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class=" dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-1tx6u99"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Grains of wheat in a mill in Khanna in India’s Punjab state, on 18 May 2022.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Sajjad Hussain/AFP/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Generally, this processing is performed to create softer flavors and textures, says Champion.

It also helps the body control blood sugar levels by improving insulin sensitivity and reducing one’s risk of diabetes. Fiber also keeps you fuller for longer, Young says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Additionally, as registered dietitian Ashli Greenwald told &lt;a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/barley-farro-sorghum-and-more-9-whole-grains-to-try" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Johns Hopkins Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, whole grains contain phytonutrients, which are plant-based compounds that can reduce inflammation and may reduce the risk of heart disease and diabetes. Some whole grains can also be “good sources of protein”, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-are-the-risks-of-a-diet-high-in-refined-grains" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;What are the risks of a diet high in refined grains?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;By contrast, one of the biggest risks of a diet high in processed and refined grains is not getting adequate fiber, says Champion. “Most Americans are not consuming enough fiber, and consuming more whole grains can have a big impact,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://nutrition.org/most-americans-are-not-getting-enough-fiber-in-our-diets/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;American Society for Nutrition&lt;/a&gt;, only 7% of American adults meet current fiber-intake recommendations: 14g of fiber per 1,000 calories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="InteractiveBlockComponent" priority="critical" deferuntil="idle" props='{"url":"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2023/10/archive-zip/giv-13425WMrLo2pc9VIk/","scriptUrl":"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js","alt":"Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’","format":{"design":10,"display":0,"theme":4},"elementId":"54bc1961-942c-424e-a992-c44c65a9914b","isMainMedia":false}'&gt;&lt;figure id="54bc1961-942c-424e-a992-c44c65a9914b" data-alt="Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’" data-testid="interactive-element-Graphic%20with%20three%20lines%20of%20text%20that%20say,%20in%20bold,%20%E2%80%98Well%20Actually%E2%80%99,%20then%20%E2%80%98Read%20more%20on%20living%20a%20good%20life%20in%20a%20complex%20world,%E2%80%99%20then%20a%20pinkish-lavender%20pill-shaped%20button%20with%20white%20letters%20that%20say%20%E2%80%98More%20from%20this%20section%E2%80%99" data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="element element-interactive element--inline element-inline dcr-w422y2"&gt;&lt;a data-name="placeholder" href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2023/10/archive-zip/giv-13425WMrLo2pc9VIk/" class="dcr-1eupayo"&gt;Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Products made with refined grains are also more likely to be highly processed and to contain added sugar, saturated fat and sodium, Champion says – “for example, a packaged pastry”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Due to the lower levels of fiber and higher levels of highly processed ingredients, diets rich in refined grains are more likely to lead to poor gut health, increased blood sugar spikes and increased inflammation, says Young.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class=" dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-21" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;skip past newsletter promotion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;aside aria-label="newsletter promotion" class="dcr-av5vqf"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-1xjndtj"&gt;Practical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good life&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SecureSignup" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"newsletterId":"well-actually","successDescription":"Practical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good life"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1eusqlu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy Notice: &lt;/strong&gt;Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But they are a staple of many cultural cuisines – sushi rice in Japan, for example, or baguettes in France. These &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2023/08/06/1190900066/japanese-food-diet-healthy-eating" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;cultures&lt;/a&gt; “often have &lt;a href="https://www.deliciousmagazine.co.uk/why-are-the-french-healthier-than-brits/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;better&lt;/a&gt; health markers than the US”, Young notes. She adds that these refined grains are merely one part of lifestyles that tend to include smaller portion sizes, less ultra-processed food, more balanced meals and more physical activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;One’s overall diet is more important for health than any single food, experts say. “No one needs to consume 100% whole grains 100% of the time,” Champion says. In general, she says, a healthy diet contains “whole grains more often than refined, lots of fruit and vegetables and plenty of fiber”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="2ea869a9-d394-4526-abef-be879bdabf28" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class=" dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-1tx6u99"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;White rice as part of a seafood sambal dish at a food stall in Malang, East Java, Indonesia, on 16 January 2025.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: NurPhoto/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The low-carb diet craze of the 90s and early aughts was “more about restricting than swapping or diversifying our diets”, says Malak Saddy, a registered and licensed dietitian. “If you wanted to have carbs, you could only have whole grains,” she recalls. As wonderful as whole grains can be, you “can also find those nutrients in fruits and vegetables”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;It’s important not to oversell the promise of whole grains. As Saddy notes, diet is only one component of overall health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“If you don’t have access to food, or a safe place to sleep, or you’re not financially stable and don’t have a support system, then you can eat as many whole grains as you want and you still won’t receive the benefits of it,” she says. “Those other determinants are impacting you way more.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;What’s more, refined grain products can often be more affordable than whole grain foods. A loaf of Ezekiel sprouted grain bread costs about $8, for example, while a loaf of classic white Wonder &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/bread" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Bread&lt;/a&gt; costs just over $3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Whole grains and refined grains need to be morally neutralized, Saddy says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“It becomes a sense of elitism: because I eat whole grains, I am better than you,” she says. This attitude, she argues, creates a dynamic that can contribute to disordered eating patterns where some foods are deemed good and others bad. “That is much more harmful to our health than just eating the white rice or the white tortilla,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Terms like “multigrain”, “wheat” or “made with whole grains” can be clever ways companies try to make products seem whole grain when they’re not, says Young.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Instead, experts say, one should look at nutrition labels to determine a product’s ingredients and fiber content. Ingredients like “whole wheat” or “100% whole grain” should be named first on the list of ingredients, Young says. And a true whole grain product should contain at least 3g of fiber.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;One can also buy unprocessed whole grains – for example, quinoa, farro, oats or brown and black rice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Mon, 24 Mar 2025 16:03:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifkFVX3lxTE03VWZ4TGFrd2czRXhyZGZ1ZUdKYjRzTXF0MG8wWTlfQWo2ZU5EWnNxUFp0VDNOWUJuNGs2a3F2c3JwVkhLd3pwQm4ybVA0ZWd6QjBvdzNKcFJfUkcxbXRncmhHaEhhQXNRcmRWc01OU3h3eWRJRVpEMFkyUFNFZw</guid></item><item><title>The Risk of Becoming Allergic to Meat After a Tick Bite May Be Higher Than Thought - Gizmodo</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiswFBVV95cUxOZ1NlaVQ5SFhrOE5LUVRsNmROdzdEblAxRDE0TkdkdE5BMDFibkFKV1JORHZ6QTdaV0lkU3hpTGJZckVIazlUWlhzd01CM1FrS3p2UmczTE5GR2lqOUZINmxkc3lXajNUMERfWW45eWRvWV8tYWRubUEta0k1SjgweUdERjhESTNjb1MtRTZMVEVBQzAxQzBpakFsQmg5NnNfTldaa3pvb1UzZEwtNUNaSlFXUQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content prose dark:prose-invert lg:prose-lg lg:leading-[29px] font-serif max-w-none"&gt;
              
              
              &lt;p&gt;The tick menace is even worse than we thought. A pair of new studies this month suggests that there are more tick species out there in the U.S. that can cause an unusual form of allergy to red meat.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scientists from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and local health officials published the research late last week in the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases. The studies detail cases of red meat allergy, formally known as alpha-gal syndrome, tied to bites from two tick species not normally associated with it—ticks that also cause Lyme disease. These cases seem rare, but indicate that more people are at risk for the syndrome than currently assumed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Alpha-gal is a sugar found in the muscles of most mammals, though importantly not humans. We can normally tolerate the alpha-gal found in the meat we eat without issue. But &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/weird-meat-allergy-caused-by-ticks-may-be-easier-to-cat-1832872448"&gt;for reasons we’re still trying to understand&lt;/a&gt;, a tick bite can sometimes cause our bodies to develop an overactive immune response to alpha-gal, essentially making us allergic to red meat and even dairy. Alpha-gal syndrome is the only type of classic food allergy that involves a sugar (the alpha-gal) rather than a protein. And unlike other food allergies, symptoms might take hours, not minutes, to show up after exposure.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the U.S., alpha-gal cases are nearly always associated with the bite of a lone star tick (&lt;em&gt;Amblyomma americanum&lt;/em&gt;), which is predominantly found throughout the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ticks/maps/lone_star_tick.pdf"&gt;eastern half&lt;/a&gt; of the country. But there are different tick species known to cause it in other parts of the world, and doctors stateside have encountered the occasional case in places where the lone star shouldn’t be residing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In this latest research, scientists have discovered at least two, but possibly more, cases of alpha-gal that don’t fit the typical description.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/4/24-0577_article"&gt;one study&lt;/a&gt;, researchers documented a woman in Washington who developed alpha-gal in 2017, following a bite from an unknown species of tick. As a result, she switched to a vegetarian diet. Three years later, she got a second tick bite. Though she avoided any symptoms because of her diet, blood tests showed a dramatic rise in antibodies to alpha-gal. This time, she was able to collect the tick for testing, identified as &lt;em&gt;Ixodes pacificus&lt;/em&gt;, or the western black-legged tick. Two years later, she got another bite from an &lt;em&gt;I. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;pacificus&lt;/em&gt; tick and once again experienced a rise in alpha-gal antibodies. Importantly, the woman also reported no recent travel history to places where the lone star tick is found.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/4/24-1265_article"&gt;second study&lt;/a&gt;, researchers traced back a case of alpha-gal in Maine likely caused by the bite of an &lt;em&gt;Ixodes scapularis&lt;/em&gt; tick, or deer tick. Though lone star ticks have rarely been found in Maine, they’re not thought to have established a local population in the area, according to the researchers. Despite this, they were able to find 23 confirmed cases of red meat allergy reported to the state dating back to 2014. While some people could have caught these cases while traveling in areas endemic to the lone star tick, several people reported no such travel.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The “findings might reflect a limited role for tick species other than &lt;em&gt;A. americanum&lt;/em&gt; in [alpha-gal syndrome] development in the United States, which is further supported through review of geographic distribution of suspected cases and range of &lt;em&gt;A. amblyomma&lt;/em&gt; ticks,” the authors wrote in one paper.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That said, most cases of red meat allergy in the U.S. are still reported in places where the lone star tick is found. Lab experiments have also supported the idea that these ticks are more likely to cause the allergy than other species in the U.S. But both &lt;em&gt;Ixodes&lt;/em&gt; ticks are widely distributed through regions of the U.S. and are already known to spread nasty diseases like Lyme to people.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Though alpha-gal cases caused by &lt;em&gt;Ixodes&lt;/em&gt; ticks might be rarer than the classic version, the overall incidence of the syndrome is climbing. A study in 2023 from the CDC and others &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/ticks-are-giving-americans-an-allergy-to-red-meat-1850687624"&gt;estimated&lt;/a&gt; that up to 450,000 Americans have developed alpha-gal syndrome since 2010, with rates likely increasing over that time period as well. So if more ticks besides the lone star can cause the condition, then people and doctors in parts of the country where it isn’t commonly found should at least be aware of the possibility, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

 &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Grip strength has long been used by doctors to identify patients at risk of developing various health problems early on&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'If you can do this with the right weights, everything else is stronger,' he added&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The stronger and resilient body ages slower and has less disease.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To take the test, Mr Jones advises gripping a very heavy weight or object for one minute straight — for instance a dumbbell, that is three-quarters of your own body weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For the average British man, this means lifting 85kg, while for a woman it's 54kg. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, lifting something this heavy can cause back injuries. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The maximum safe weight a man should lift is 25kg, while women should be careful lifting any more than 15kg, according to the Health and Safety Executive (HSE). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Hanging from a pull-up bar for as long as you can is another, less risky measure of grip strength. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For men, 60 seconds is a reasonable target; for women, 30 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Men who can hang for only 30 seconds, and women for only 15 seconds may have a raised risk of premature mortality, suggests research in the BMJ in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Grip strength has long been used by doctors to identify patients at risk of developing various health problems early on, including&lt;span&gt; cardiovascular disease and even dementia.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2016, research involving nearly 7,000 people by University College London found that those who had weaker grip strength at the start of the 17-year study had a higher-than-average rate of premature death from all causes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Balancing on one leg continuously for more than 40 seconds is a key sign of strength and mobility among 18 to 39-year-olds, the health service says&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another analysis of previous research, with nearly 140,000 people, found that weak grip strength is a more accurate predictor for early death than high blood pressure, reported The Lancet in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And according to one study published in the Journal of Strength and Conditioning last year, those with the least muscle strength were almost 150 per cent more likely to die early.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If you're unable to grip the weight for a full minute, Mr Jones advised working on building up strength in your hands and arms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There are a number of &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-7883199/How-strength-grip-provide-insight-overall-health.html"&gt;available gadgets &lt;/a&gt;that are designed to improve grip strength by strengthening the key muscles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts advise using some for just a minute a day to achieve a benefit.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another at home longevity exercise is the balance test. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Research suggests that those who can't balance on one leg for more than 10 seconds could be at a vastly increased risk of dying within 10 years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And more recent studies claim that the length of balancing time should vary by age.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to NHS scientists, balancing on one leg continuously for more than 40 seconds is a key sign of strength and mobility among 18 to 39-year-olds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;By contrast, those aged between 70 and 79 should manage 18 to 19 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The reason standing on one leg is such a marker of fitness is because it uses so many different parts of the brain and body at once.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It tests balance, and strength — and these two things are lost, the more frail a person comes, making them more prone to bone shattering falls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the NHS test, those trying to test should aim to stand one one leg with their hands on their hips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Keeping their eyes open, the timer starts as soon as the foot lifts off the ground.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It stops when the foot is either lowered or their hands are taken off their hips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Those aged 18 to 39 should manage 43 seconds, the NHS says, and 40 seconds if you're aged between 40 and 49.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For 50 to 59-year-olds, the figure stands at 37 seconds and 30 for 60 to 69-year-olds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;By 70 to 79, this drops to between 18 and 19 seconds and a little over five seconds if you're over 80.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 24 Mar 2025 15:40:47 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipAFBVV95cUxNZzNXOXB2V1pBS0gxQTgxVUFSdXlWZ21OYTh2a1ZZTER0eEZ1Yjh6X1E4N3NVbzcxNkhNcWEzdTQySDg3dlFBakVETEQzaFQxVHF6V0tqQ1ZXQ0FMSTlNdWNLNVlxd0NuNS10c1U3V25LdGVsTjJDWlFORkR1dTU4OFZHSk9jMUd4SHVXeEVwWUo0bEpZRW1ZS3lLRHFQQzJ3OTdZdtIBqgFBVV95cUxPWXFsQUFtUjU2X2xLaEJyMFYtcUExZTZhSzdvazBhUUxYMDlUQlF0UHl5UWVEcFB4RlU4d2g2YTQ3WVZ4akJ6bFRyU0E0V3pHdEFYSXJJWkJLd1JxVFdKdjVFTXBQNGZFbDJwOWQta0VJNkZZakN1MWZ5bFZsc3Q5d2l5ZWp0eml4QVY2NE02SXN6QldFai02S0s2bTJZXzZTbEstR0JlX25wQQ</guid></item><item><title>Are you avoiding these ‘bad’ foods?

It travels through the bloodstream on lipoproteins, primarily low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LDL (Low-Density Lipoprotein):&lt;/strong&gt; Often labeled as “bad” cholesterol, LDL can contribute to plaque buildup in the arteries if levels become too high.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HDL (High-Density Lipoprotein):&lt;/strong&gt; Known as “good” cholesterol, HDL helps remove excess cholesterol from the bloodstream, transporting it to the liver for excretion.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="inlineIMG verticalImageClass"&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;img data-src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/img/2022/07/29/550x309/nuts_1659097298617_1659097316644_1659097316644.jpg" class="lazy" src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/550x309.jpg" alt="Not all cholesterol is bad and the healthy one helps in removing the harmful cholesterol from our arteries(Pixabay)" title="Not all cholesterol is bad and the healthy one helps in removing the harmful cholesterol from our arteries(Pixabay)"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;Not all cholesterol is bad and the healthy one helps in removing the harmful cholesterol from our arteries(Pixabay)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Understanding that cholesterol has both beneficial and potentially harmful forms is essential. Rather than demonising all cholesterol, the focus should be on maintaining a healthy balance.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Myth 2: Dietary cholesterol directly causes high blood cholesterol&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fact: &lt;/strong&gt;For many years, foods high in cholesterol—like eggs, shrimp, and red meat—were blamed for raising blood cholesterol levels. However, research over the past few decades has shown that dietary cholesterol impacts blood cholesterol to a much lesser extent than once believed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Saturated and Trans Fats:&lt;/strong&gt; These fats, rather than dietary cholesterol itself, play a more significant role in elevating LDL levels. Foods high in saturated fat (such as fatty cuts of meat and full-fat dairy) and trans fats (found in some processed foods) are more problematic.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Individual Response:&lt;/strong&gt; Genetics and overall diet quality also determine how dietary cholesterol affects blood levels. For most people, moderate consumption of cholesterol-rich foods does not lead to significant changes in blood cholesterol.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Myth 3: All fats are unhealthy&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fact:&lt;/strong&gt; Not all fats contribute to heart disease. In fact, fats are essential for the absorption of vitamins and provide energy. The key is distinguishing between different types of fats:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unsaturated Fats:&lt;/strong&gt; Found in olive oil, avocados, nuts, and fish, these fats can improve blood cholesterol levels and reduce inflammation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Saturated Fats:&lt;/strong&gt; While some saturated fat can be part of a balanced diet, excessive consumption has been linked to higher LDL levels.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trans Fats:&lt;/strong&gt; These are harmful fats often found in processed and fried foods and should be minimized as much as possible.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Myth 4: Cholesterol medications are harmful and should be avoided&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fact:&lt;/strong&gt; Cholesterol-lowering medications, particularly statins, are among the most studied and effective tools for reducing the risk of heart disease. While all medications can have side effects, the benefits of statins in reducing heart attacks and strokes in high-risk individuals are well documented.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evidence-Based Use:&lt;/strong&gt; For people with high LDL levels or existing heart disease, statins and other lipid-lowering therapies can be lifesaving.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Individualised Treatment:&lt;/strong&gt; Not everyone needs medication. Decisions should be based on a comprehensive risk assessment that includes family history, lifestyle factors, and other health conditions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Myth 5: You only need to worry about cholesterol if you have heart disease&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fact:&lt;/strong&gt; High cholesterol often develops without symptoms and can contribute to heart disease silently over many years. Regular screening is crucial, even if you feel healthy, as early detection and lifestyle changes can prevent complications down the line.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Screening Recommendations:&lt;/strong&gt; Most health guidelines suggest that adults get their cholesterol checked every 4-6 years, or more frequently if they have risk factors such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or a family history of heart disease.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Preventative Approach: &lt;/strong&gt;By knowing your numbers, you and your healthcare provider can develop a personalized plan that may include dietary adjustments, exercise and if necessary, medications.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The conversation around cholesterol and heart health is evolving as science uncovers more nuanced insights into how our bodies work. Dr Abhijit Borse said, “Debunking these common myths is not only about setting the record straight—it’s about empowering individuals to make informed decisions about their health. A balanced diet, regular exercise and personalised medical advice remain the cornerstones of a healthy heart.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="inlineIMG"&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;img data-src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/img/2021/08/31/550x309/jesse-orrico-Us3AQvyOP-o-unsplash_1630381277700_1630381345040.jpg" class="lazy" src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/550x309.jpg" alt="Improve cholesterol levels, lower risk of heart disease: Garlic supplements may reduce total and/or LDL (low-density lipoprotein) cholesterol by about 10–15%.(Unsplash)" title="Improve cholesterol levels, lower risk of heart disease: Garlic supplements may reduce total and/or LDL (low-density lipoprotein) cholesterol by about 10–15%.(Unsplash)"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;Improve cholesterol levels, lower risk of heart disease: Garlic supplements may reduce total and/or LDL (low-density lipoprotein) cholesterol by about 10–15%.(Unsplash)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He concluded, “As research continues to advance, staying informed and consulting with healthcare professionals will ensure that you’re taking the best steps for your cardiovascular well-being. By demystifying cholesterol, we can shift the focus from fear to understanding and proactive care, ultimately leading to healthier hearts and longer lives.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This article is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.

In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/situation-summary/index.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;said on Friday&lt;/a&gt; that there have been 70 confirmed human cases since 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-2"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The virus is spread through contact with infected birds or other species, including through touching their droppings and bedding, although people can also catch the virus by killing or preparing infected poultry for cooking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Avian flu has been detected in cattle, in the United States, with the Centers for Disease Control reporting 41 cases and 989 dairy herds affected as of Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-3"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Other animals, including cats, foxes and pigs, have also been known to contract the virus, though the addition of sheep to that list will add to the concern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Phil Stocker, chief executive of the National Sheep Association, which represents British sheep farmers, said that the case did not pose a threat to food safety but raised questions about farming different kinds of animals in the same location. “In this instance sheep and poultry have mixed on the same farm, resulting in the transmission of avian influenza,” he said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Meera Chand, emerging infection lead at the U.K.’s health security agency, said that while “globally, we continue to see that mammals can be infected with avian influenza,” the “current evidence suggests that the avian influenza viruses we’re seeing circulating around the world do not spread easily to people — and the risk of avian flu to the general public remains very low.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The New York Times</author><pubDate>Mon, 24 Mar 2025 15:18:26 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url=""

removed from the patient while the operation is under way. If the examination suggests the tumour has been removed, the nerve-containing outer layer of the prostate can be left intact, reducing the patient’s risk of erectile problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Prof Greg Shaw, the trial lead and a consultant urologist at University College London hospitals NHS foundation trust, said: “This procedure gives surgeons feedback during the surgery to give them the certainty they need to spare as many nerves as possible and give men increased hope of recovering their sexual potency after their cancer is surgically removed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Prostate cancer is the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/jan/28/prostate-cancer-becomes-most-common-cancer-diagnosis-in-england" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;most common form of cancer in men in England&lt;/a&gt;, with 50,000 cases diagnosed each year. Worldwide, nearly 1.5 million men are diagnosed and 375,000 die annually. The disease is most common in over-50s and is often called a silent killer because it causes no symptoms in the early stages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="0d76a7d4-b28c-4851-849c-741dd023209a" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class=" dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":5,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"Black men in England more likely to be diagnosed with late-stage prostate cancer, analysis shows","elementId":"0d76a7d4-b28c-4851-849c-741dd023209a","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/jan/09/black-men-in-england-more-likely-to-be-diagnosed-with-late-stage-prostate-cancer-analysis-shows"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":0,"display":0,"theme":0}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Recent developments in robotic surgery have allowed doctors to perform precision “nerve-sparing” operations in prostate cancer patients. This involves removing the diseased prostate while leaving the outer layers and the nerves running through them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;However, doctors must be sure that no cancer cells are left behind, and this can be difficult to assess. If the cancer is advanced, surgeons will err on the side of caution and remove the prostate with its outer layers to reduce the risk of missing any tumour cells and the disease returning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;In the NeuroSafe procedure, doctors remove the prostate while preserving as much nerve tissue around it as possible. Slices of the prostate are then frozen, stained and examined for cancer cells. If the tumour reaches the surface of the prostate, the outer layers and its nerves may need to be removed. But if the tumour stops short, the surgery is considered complete.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The trial assessed 344 men with prostate cancer who had no history of erectile dysfunction. Half received the NeuroSafe procedure and half underwent standard surgery. A year later, 56% of men who had standard surgery reported severe erectile dysfunction, compared with 38% who had NeuroSafe surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Less than a quarter (23%) who had standard surgery reported no or only mild erectile dysfunction, compared with 39% who had the NeuroSafe procedure. Details were presented at the 2025 European Association of Urology congress in Madrid and are published in &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanonc/article/PIIS1470-2045(25)00091-9/fulltext" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;the Lancet Oncology&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Dr Matthew Hobbs, the director of research at Prostate Cancer UK, said: “Prostate cancer surgery is a life-saving option for lots of men, but it’s a major procedure that can cause side-effects like erection problems. A major challenge we face is how to cure men but also ensure they can live life to the full afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“This study is promising and provides evidence that innovative types of surgery can reduce erectile dysfunction in some men. However, more research is needed to prove whether NeuroSafe is as effective as traditional techniques at delivering a complete cure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“We also need to understand exactly which men could benefit from this new technique and, crucially, whether this technique could be delivered at scale across the NHS to make it accessible to men across the UK.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Mon, 24 Mar 2025 14:59:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMioAFBVV95cUxQeXh6cFdSLUNSYk5hQ2xkSVp6T2l3Uno2ZkN2emhjT0FiNmtPaE5XZWdrYkh5b3JWb3VjWGFUbmc5UXhlblpVZWpOZG1QcUtva2VpSDYtR0ctTS1ISVU4WmtuaUJpRnNZeTIyZkJDNTl4QnAtZWowSFlucFgyZjJsZHE2LUZCWS1PQlpLbXVYbk4zZmtHWldZWUhYWnZ1ZHRH</guid></item><item><title>This Poop Habit May Make Your Brain And Muscles Work Better - HuffPost UK</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimAFBVV95cUxQRlRITldDamMwejYzblRRWkJGb1RqVEZIbjExbUZ1aFA1b1lMcUs3aFRYVzlOUUQ3RUJYdW9wZ0VfV2FZeTFqQnYxNGlYVkRTWU5hanVVNEhLRC1IU3FfanEzbVNnRHZYeXN2ZXlzR2l5Z2RnM25vR3o5bG1tUl9YczlpWXRKa0k1cWdoN3hmWE5oOXZ5WjRhZNIBnwFBVV95cUxNVmtLNjRnYk5jWHZDUTZZQUV4ZWRyRFhVamVkbmRWeU5VZzNiMXEyUkdMVW96SlhORHlsZ1RIMTNkRnlIUldmVmdZQ25iNkRxZF9VYVRIM2Vkc2JMelZCRGlqTHZkcHNTQW0tcGlNTTdabGVXV0NmWnVfZEJQNWlQSFVyc2N6eUtmZ0xOeXByR2dLcWNSbFB1RXk1MTVRWHM?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="entry__content-list js-entry-content js-cet-subunit"&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;I write a lot about both&lt;a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/neuroscientist-morning-routine_uk_67d15ac2e4b0668b4e9cd9fc" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name=" brain health" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67e1600de4b0bd547770f019" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="67d15ac2e4b0668b4e9cd9fc" data-vars-target-content-type="buzz" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="0"&gt; brain health&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/v" target="_blank" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="fitness" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67e1600de4b0bd547770f019" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="/v" data-vars-target-content-type="feed" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="1"&gt;fitness&lt;/a&gt; for work.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Combined with a healthy diet and lifestyle, some supplements may support gut health.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dietitians say certain probiotics, prebiotics and digestive enzymes may be useful. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Consult with your health care provider before adding new supplements to your routine.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Nurturing a healthy gut is like tending to a garden. Both require the right balance of nutrients and care to flourish. While a well-rounded diet lays the foundation for a healthy gut, sometimes it takes more than food to restore balance and relieve digestive discomfort.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When used properly to target specific needs and conditions, supplements can play a supportive role in gut health. However, they’re not a quick fix. Instead, dietitians like to think of them as a complement to a balanced diet. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re searching for solutions for your digestive woes, these six dietitian-approved supplements may help improve digestion, ease stomach pain and nurture your gut health.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-1-l-glutamine"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 1. L-Glutamine &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Glutamine, the most abundant amino acid in the body, is essential for nourishing and protecting the gut. It is usually sold in supplement form as L-glutamine. “It fuels intestinal cells and helps protect against damage from stress, infections and inflammatory conditions,” says&lt;a href="https://nutritionrewired.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt; Erin Kenney, M.S., RD&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian and CEO of Nutrition Rewired.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; She adds that it supports gut lining repair and reduces intestinal permeability, commonly known as “leaky gut.” However, the dose and duration may matter. One systematic review and meta-analysis of 11 studies found that taking 30 milligrams of glutamine daily for less than two weeks significantly reduced intestinal permeability.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; This may be especially beneficial for people with chronic gut conditions like &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/ibs-symptoms-8654975" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)&lt;/a&gt;, Kenney explains.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-2-digestive-enzymes"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 2. Digestive Enzymes &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Digestive enzymes help break down carbohydrates, fats and proteins from food into their simpler forms for easy absorption.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  Without enough enzymes, the digestive process becomes less efficient, leading to bloating, gas, diarrhea and nutrient imbalances, explains&lt;a href="https://www.nutrition-thyme.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt; Tara Durden, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian and founder of Nutrition Thyme. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In some cases, some supplements can come in handy for calming simple digestive issues. These include the enzyme lactase for &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290640/lactose-intolerance-symptoms-causes-what-to-eat-and-more/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;lactose intolerance&lt;/a&gt; and another enzyme called alpha-galactosidase that can help ease the gas and bloating that happens to some people when they eat beans.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; However, navigating the plethora of digestive enzymes available online and on drugstore shelves can be overwhelming. That’s because dietary supplements are not strictly regulated by the FDA the same way that food is. “That means there is no guarantee of their quality, effectiveness or safety,” says Kenney. So, reading labels carefully is critical. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Additionally, some digestive enzymes are marketed for serious health conditions—like chronic pancreatitis, cystic fibrosis and exocrine pancreatic deficiency—that require care and treatment from a physician. If you think you have an issue that would benefit from taking a digestive enzyme, don’t self-diagnose. Schedule an appointment with your health care provider for a workup to diagnose and treat the issue correctly.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-3-probiotics"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 3. Probiotics &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Naturally found in fermented foods like yogurt, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8037462/benefits-of-taking-probiotics/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;probiotics&lt;/a&gt; are live bacteria and yeasts that have multiple health benefits.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; They are also available as supplements. When used appropriately, “probiotics can help to balance gut bacteria, improve digestion and support immune health,” says Kenney. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As encouraging as this may be, probiotics’ benefits strongly depend on the strain, dose and amount of time they are used. For instance, specific strains like &lt;em&gt;Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Saccharomyces boulardii&lt;/em&gt; have been shown to reduce antibiotic-related diarrhea. Then, &lt;em&gt;Bifidobacterium breve, Bifidobacterium infantis, Lactobacillus casei&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Lactobacillus plantarum &lt;/em&gt;may alleviate IBS-related gas and abdominal distention.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Promising research also suggests that next-generation probiotics like &lt;em&gt;Akkermansia muciniphila &lt;/em&gt;may strengthen the gut lining. However, more study is needed.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; As such, you should always check the label to ensure that yours lists the specific strains that have been shown to help with your individual needs. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-4-prebiotics"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 4. Prebiotics &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/291159/what-are-prebiotics/#:~:text=Prebiotics%20aren't%20one%20type,like%20those%20found%20in%20walnuts" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Prebiotics&lt;/a&gt; are compounds that feed the friendly bacteria in your gut. They include indigestible carbohydrates, such as inulin, fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS) and galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS).&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Foods rich in prebiotics include chicory root, Jerusalem artichokes, garlic, onions and wheat, barley and rye. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In a perfect world, we’d all eat enough of these foods to get a wide complement of prebiotics. When that’s not possible, supplements may help. Yet, like probiotics, there is much that we still don’t know about the types of prebiotics that are best suited for specific health conditions. Right now, the best evidence is for the ability of GOS and inulin to ease constipation. They aren’t for everyone, though. Anyone with IBS or a sensitive digestive tract should be cautious with prebiotic supplements, as they can cause gas, bloating and diarrhea.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-5-magnesium"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 5. Magnesium &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Magnesium is a vital mineral that supports gut health by promoting regular bowel movements.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Despite its importance, many of us do not get enough of it. This can set the stage for digestive issues like constipation and abdominal discomfort. Fortunately, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8012002/can-magnesium-help-you-poop/#:~:text=Magnesium%20citrate%20is%20considered%20safe,to%20identify%20the%20root%20cause" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;magnesium supplements &lt;/a&gt;can help bridge nutritional gaps and provide relief from constipation. Durden explains that supplements do this by relaxing the muscles in the colon and drawing water into the bowel, making it easier to pass stools. For the best results for occasional constipation, look for products that contain magnesium citrate. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This form has been well-studied for its ability to get things moving. However, it is powerful and is not recommended for long-term use. For gentler relief, consider magnesium oxide.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-6-peppermint-oil"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 6. Peppermint Oil &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Peppermint oil offers a natural way to soothe digestive discomfort, particularly for those with IBS. Kenney explains that it works by relaxing the intestinal muscles, helping to reduce bloating, cramping and abdominal pain. Specifically, research shows that peppermint oil supplements reduce IBS symptoms by calming smooth muscle spasms.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; For the most benefit, Kenney recommends opting for enteric-coated capsules, as these ensure the oil is protected from stomach acid and reaches the intestines, where it’s most effective.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-other-strategies-to-support-a-healthy-gut"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Other Strategies to Support a Healthy Gut &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Supplements to support gut health may be worthy of a spot in your cupboard. However, they’re not a magic fix. Instead, think of them as one tool in your toolbox that can be helpful when needed. For a lasting fix, focus on diet and lifestyle habits like these.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Think Fiber. &lt;/strong&gt;“A diverse, plant-forward diet, rich in a variety of fruits, vegetables, whole grains and legumes, is essential for nourishing the gut,” says Kenney. “Aim to consume at least 25 to 35 grams of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/287742/10-amazing-health-benefits-of-eating-more-fiber/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;fiber&lt;/a&gt; each day, as fiber not only supports a healthy gut lining but also acts as fuel for the beneficial bacteria in your microbiome.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Slow Down and Enjoy Meals. &lt;/strong&gt;How we eat can be as important as what we eat. “Eating slowly, mindfully and in a relaxed, joyful environment can have a profound impact on digestion,” Kenney explains. “When we take the time to savor our food and engage our senses, it encourages proper digestion and allows our bodies to fully absorb nutrients.” This &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290947/mindful-eating-the-key-to-eating-what-you-want-and-fully-enjoying-it/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;mindful approach&lt;/a&gt; also supports the nervous system, which plays a key role in gut health, helping to create a harmonious gut-brain connection, she says.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_49-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Take Time to Rest and Relax. &lt;/strong&gt;Along with proper nutrition and eating habits, Kenney adds that &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/ways-to-relieve-stress-in-10-minutes-8739935" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;stress management&lt;/a&gt; and quality sleep are crucial for gut health. “Chronic stress and insufficient sleep can significantly disrupt the delicate balance of bacteria in the gut, leading to imbalances that can trigger inflammation and digestive disturbances,” she explains. So, pencil in some time to decompress every day, even if it’s only for a few minutes.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Research also shows that a lack of restorative sleep can impair gut function and overall immune health, says Kenney.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; This makes it even more crucial to prioritize self-care for your gut and overall well-being. Try to aim for seven to nine hours of sleep per night.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_50-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_52-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A healthy diet and lifestyle are the foundation for optimal gut health. However, targeted supplements may help give your gut the extra boost it needs. According to dietitians, supplements like L-glutamine, digestive enzymes, probiotics, prebiotics, magnesium and peppermint oil capsules can offer valuable support. Depending on the supplement, they may reduce digestive distress, help maintain a balanced gut microbiome or improve digestion. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_54-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; However, if digestive discomfort is more than the occasional nuisance, don’t self-diagnose. Speak to your health care provider, who can help you determine the cause of your discomfort and provide the safest, most effective treatment for your unique needs.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beekeeping isn’t for the faint of heart. Honey bees battle a constant onslaught of threats, from pesticide-resistant &lt;em&gt;Varroa&lt;/em&gt; mites to habitat loss and chemical exposure. Any one of these challenges can spell disaster for a hive. Fortunately, there is a lot of research being done to develop methods that are not only good for the bees, but good for the beekeepers, too!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A Waste Product Turned Superfood&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/jee/toae303"&gt;study published in December in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Economic Entomology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; examines the nutritional value of a novel pollen supplement made from larval male bees, or drone brood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supplemental macronutrients are often essential to keep honey bee hives thriving during winter, droughts, or times when nectar and pollen are scarce. Carbohydrates are supplied through excess honey or syrup mixtures, and pollen patties can provide proteins and fats for the colony. However, pollen patties can be expensive and may not always provide the right micronutrients honey bees need to stay healthy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers at the University of Belgrade studied how a common beekeeping waste product could impact honey bee health. Drones—male bees that are necessary to fertilize the queen but which do not produce honey—are typically culled from colonies because they sap resources. They only reproduce with virgin queens in nuptial flights, and when they begin leaving the hive, they consume a portion of the honey reserves. Drones are also more susceptible to &lt;em&gt;Varroa&lt;/em&gt; mites. Thus, removing a portion of drone brood cells can improve the health of the colony and is a common practice among beekeepers in spring or early summer. The University of Belgrade researchers decided to use this drone brood to create a flour that can then be used as a pollen substitute in feeding the rest of the hive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Bees Already Eat Their Own Brood, So Why Not Feed It to Them?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ratko Pavlović, a professional beekeeper and Ph.D. candidate, addresses the concern that some may have with bees eating their own brood. “It’s a documented behavior that honey bees will eat drone larvae when pollen sources are low, but not very many beekeepers know about it,” he says. “When honey bees are lacking some nutrients or there is a long period of rain and bees can’t forage, they will eat their own brood. It’s a very common, everyday behavior. For example, if there are multiple eggs or larvae in one cell, the bees will consume them to ensure there is only one per cell.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This behavior sparked Pavlović’s curiosity: If bees already eat drone brood, could processed drone larvae serve as a viable pollen substitute? The answer, it turns out, is promising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His research found that drone brood flour is a rich source of protein, fats, and essential minerals that honey bees need to stay healthy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How Beekeepers Can Make Their Own Drone Brood Flour&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pavlović developed a simple method that any beekeeper could follow to create this nutrient-dense, free supplement. All you need is a pot for boiling and a strainer. Removing capped drone brood is a standard procedure for many beekeepers, but capped drone brood is usually discarded because the efforts to extract wax are too costly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The procedure includes boiling the capped drone brood twice, straining the brood out each time and extracting the wax. The drone brood can then be processed into a type of flour. So, from a typical beekeeping waste product, a beekeeper can get pure wax and a pollen substitute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s a simple process that can be combined with a sugar patty to keep your bees healthy. I know many beekeepers who do a lot more complicated things. This is quite simple,” Pavlović says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A Natural Solution for the &lt;em&gt;Varroa&lt;/em&gt; Mite Problem&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, research has shown that this practice of removing drone brood can improve honey yields and reduce &lt;em&gt;Varroa&lt;/em&gt; mite populations in a hive. &lt;em&gt;Varroa&lt;/em&gt; mites originally evolved to parasitize &lt;em&gt;Apis cerana&lt;/em&gt;, the honey bee species native to Asia, and only affected drones of that species. When &lt;em&gt;Varroa&lt;/em&gt; mites infect worker brood in Asian bees, the larva dies and the &lt;em&gt;Varroa&lt;/em&gt; mite can’t reproduce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As they adapted to the honey bees (&lt;em&gt;Apis mellifera&lt;/em&gt;) common in Europe and North America, however, &lt;em&gt;Varroa&lt;/em&gt; mites became able to parasitize drone, queen, or worker bees. However, there is a still a large preference for drone brood. &lt;em&gt;Varroa&lt;/em&gt; mites are often 5–10 times more abundant in drone brood cells than worker or queen cells. Since drones take longer to mature into adults and the drone brood are bigger, the &lt;em&gt;Varroa&lt;/em&gt; mites can produce more offspring in these cells. By removing excess drone brood, a beekeeper can eliminate a large portion of their &lt;em&gt;Varroa&lt;/em&gt; mite population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There can easily be 1,000 to 2,000 drone cells in a hive. Not only will they be full of &lt;em&gt;Varroa&lt;/em&gt; mites, but the drones will eat honey when they go on their nuptial flights,” Pavlović says. “If you remove drone brood, they won’t be using up the honey supplies. By removing them from colonies with unwanted traits, you can select for better disease resistance, healthier queens, or whatever traits you want. This can have lots of benefits for the beekeeper.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How Drone Brood Might Boost Bee Immunity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While drone brood flour can provide the protein and fats for honey bee nutrition, it may also play a role in reducing diseases in a hive. Nenad Zarić, Ph.D., senior author on the study, suggests that overlooked micronutrients are an important aspect of honey bee health that needs more attention. “There is evidence that certain diseases can be prevented with proper nutrition,” Zarić says. “For example, studies have shown that chalkbrood disease mummies are much lower in silver compared to healthy bees. We found that silver was very high in drone brood, so there is some hope that feeding drone brood to honey bees could possibly have some antimicrobial effects on the bees.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This could mean that drone brood supplementation could do more than just replace expensive pollen patties. It might actively support bee immune health by providing key trace elements that help fight off infections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A Win-Win for Beekeepers and Bees&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the scientific evidence, many beekeepers hesitate at the thought of bees eating their own brood, believing it could lead to the spread of disease. However, this is a misunderstanding of how honey bee colonies function as a hive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I would love to have beekeepers become more aware of this interesting habit in bees,” Pavlović says. “Most beekeepers will say that bees don’t cannibalize their brood and that this would result in more diseases. But this isn’t true. You have to think of the bees as a superorganism, and this natural process of culling larva or eggs is healthy for them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This natural behavior helps colonies conserve resources, regulate brood numbers, and optimize their health. By understanding and harnessing this process, beekeepers can turn what was once a waste product into a valuable tool for sustainable hive management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In earlier work, the scientists &lt;a href="https://alsnewstoday.com/news/apob100-protein-csf-may-be-sporadic-als-strongest-trigger/"&gt;discovered&lt;/a&gt; that mice injected with cerebrospinal fluid, or CSF — the fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord — from &lt;a href="https://alsnewstoday.com/sporadic-als/"&gt;sporadic ALS&lt;/a&gt; patients developed classic signs of the disease, and that the cholesterol transporter protein apolipoprotein B-100, called ApoB for short, seemed to be driving this effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, the team has found that ApoB exerts its neurotoxic effects in these mice by binding to LDLR, which normally helps regulate cholesterol levels in the blood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new findings were discussed in an oral presentation at the Muscular Dystrophy Association’s 2025 MDA Clinical &amp;amp; Scientific Conference, held last week in Dallas and virtually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The LDL receptor is critical for mediating ApoB-induced neurotoxicity,” Jamie Wong, PhD, a researcher at Tisch Multiple Sclerosis Research Center of New York, said in the presentation, titled “&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mdaconference.org/abstract-library/low-density-lipoprotein-receptor-is-critical-for-sporadic-als-csf-induced-neurotoxicity/"&gt;Low-density lipoprotein receptor is critical for sporadic ALS CSF-induced neurotoxicity&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Scientists used mouse model they developed of sporadic ALS&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ALS is a neurodegenerative disease in which motor neurons — the nerve cells involved in muscle control — progressively degenerate. The resulting muscle weakness drives &lt;a href="https://alsnewstoday.com/symptoms-of-als/"&gt;symptoms&lt;/a&gt; including movement problems and difficulties with swallowing, speaking, and breathing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 10% of ALS cases are &lt;a href="https://alsnewstoday.com/forms-of-als-familial-als/"&gt;familial&lt;/a&gt;, meaning more than one person in a family is affected by the disease. This likely is due to the inheritance of disease-related genetic mutations. The remaining majority of cases, however, are sporadic, where there’s no known family history of ALS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The underlying &lt;a href="https://alsnewstoday.com/causes-of-als/"&gt;cause&lt;/a&gt; of sporadic ALS is believed to involve complex interactions between genetic and environmental factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wong noted that although it’s the more predominant form, sporadic ALS remains “relatively understudied.” The scientist attributed this in part to the fact that it’s harder to develop animal models for this disease type.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few years ago, the research team did in fact develop a mouse model of sporadic ALS, made by injecting CSF from sporadic ALS patients into the spinal canal of healthy mice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mice quickly developed hallmark signs of ALS, such as motor impairments, motor neuron, or nerve cell, loss, and the abnormal accumulation of the TDP-43 protein in the wrong place within cells. These disease-related changes were not observed when mice were injected with CSF from familial ALS patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As such, according to the researchers, ApoB seemed to be an underlying driver of the observed neurotoxicity. When it was depleted from patient CSF, the bodily fluid was no longer neurotoxic in mice or in human-derived motor neurons. Moreover, administering just ApoB with no other CSF components, was “able to recapitulate all of the neurotoxic effects that [were] observed with sporadic ALS CSF,” Wong said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scientist explained that ApoB normally resides in the blood, but not in the CSF. Previous work has &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00415-024-12665-x"&gt;associated elevated blood levels&lt;/a&gt; of ApoB with a higher risk of developing ALS.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Blocking LDLR seen to prevent neurotoxic effects in mice&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the body, ApoB binds to two different receptor proteins — LDLR and sortilin — both of which have been previously linked to nerve cell death. In their experiments, the scientists set out to investigate if either of these receptors mediate the neurotoxic effects of ApoB.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The team found that mice injected with sporadic ALS CSF or ApoB alone exhibited increased levels of both LDLR and sortilin in the spinal cord. This did not occur, however, in mice given ApoB-depleted CSF.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the human-derived motor neurons, ApoB treatment similarly increased levels of the two receptor proteins and was associated with a reduced size of motor neuron clusters. Importantly, per the team, this effect of ApoB on motor neuron clusters was still observed when sortilin was blocked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This suggests that the ApoB-induced neurotoxicity is not mediated by sortilin,” Wong said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blocking LDLR prevented the neurotoxic effects of ApoB on motor neuron clusters. Moreover, mice genetically engineered to lack LDLR were not sensitive to the neurotoxic effects of sporadic ALS CSF or ApoB — they did not develop significant motor disability, motor neuron loss, or TDP-43 abnormalities as normal mice had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“So this suggests that Apob-induced neurotoxicity is mediated through the LDL receptor,” Wong noted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="bio-blockquote bio-blockquote--align-left"&gt;
  &lt;p class="bio-blockquote-text"&gt;[These findings] suggest that ApoB binding to LDLR is a critical step for inducing motor neuron degeneration in [sporadic] ALS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scientist said that the team is now doing a pilot study to look at gene activity changes in the spinal cords of the mouse model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Hopefully this will give us some further insight into the mechanisms downstream of LDLR and ApoB which are contributing to motor neuron degeneration in sporadic ALS,” Wong said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, according to the researchers, the findings presented at the MDA conference “suggest that ApoB binding to LDLR is a critical step for inducing motor neuron degeneration in sALS.” The team added that “future studies … [into] motor neuron death” will be aimed at providing elucidation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>ALS News Today</author><pubDate>Mon, 24 Mar 2025 14:01:58 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilAFBVV95cUxPVjY1djI1bTRkMFEwTWlGQllHbGRmNzJ5ZEc5dDVYamFDZEZnSG8zRngyVWhUM0xFTHZEYlRxZXhqVEg0eWJQRXJFcWtBNF9Ld2xZQkl3Mmc4ZDJrUXFLbXFTWU5Jalh6MkNEdUVhM1hMM0F1Z0dobWxZV1gtQjdhblZsMEtidWZ2NEhEU3hHcUJmd0Ru</guid></item><item><title>Adenomyosis, the 'silent illness' plaguing their lives, goes undiagnosed for decades - USA TODAY</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMivwFBVV95cUxQS3JEOUpsWjhCbzJIU2FDbjNEUERqa1RJYm45RVhoWm9Lc1ZyX1FNcElHSkNGVnVPaXUtd1B2RUwwQ2o4d2RnMDU4N0xsU3ROcjUwYmFlektCeWFtdVJsWWxSSU40UDZESDlzdnBrbUllSnVVMUhiOWpCV3NPYndTaEx1MG02bXpPZG1adi0zNzZnRUQwdEl5U3M4WldVc1I0YTZsVl9OVnNYMndZTUN6Y0E2M2dNU1QzYlFmcmhfaw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gnt_ar_b"&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;A painful, never-ending period sent Kristina Adams to the emergency room for the first time when she was in college. It was the kind of pain that takes your breath away. The bleeding was so severe that she went through a maxi pad every hour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Two decades later, at age 38, she had another period that “felt like having your intestines grabbed and squeezed on the inside.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;She called her gynecologist, and recalls that a nurse told her it was “just a bad period.” As the pain and abnormal bleeding raged on, she called again and was told to come in for an appointment the following week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“I feel like this is where everything went downhill,” Adams, now 46, says. At her appointment, she found out she was having a miscarriage. She didn't know she was pregnant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The miscarriage, she suspects, escalated the &lt;a href="/story/life/health-wellness/2024/08/19/what-helps-with-period-cramps/74639317007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;heavy and painful periods&lt;/a&gt; she had experienced since her first menstruation.

She was taking the maximum doses of Advil and Tylenol every day "and it didn’t even touch the pain,” she remembers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;When her doctor retired, she found a new doctor who ordered tests to assess her abnormal uterine bleeding. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Adams was finally diagnosed in 2023 with adenomyosis, a gynecological condition once thought to impact only 1-5% of women, but recent estimates suggest it likely affects &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK539868/#:~:text=Accurate%20demographics%20and%20disease%20prevalence,more%20insight%20about%20affected%20populations." data-t-l=":b|z|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;at least 1 in 5 women&lt;/a&gt;. Due to underdiagnosis, &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK539868/#:~:text=Accurate%20demographics%20and%20disease%20prevalence,more%20insight%20about%20affected%20populations." data-t-l=":b|z|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;the actual prevalence may be higher&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Adenomyosis is referred to as the "silent disease," as &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/14167-adenomyosis" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;many women experience mild or no symptoms&lt;/a&gt;, and it often goes undetected on ultrasounds. However, some women present with symptoms like Adams, but are misdiagnosed for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;a href="https://innovativegyn.com/staff/natalya-danilyants/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Dr. Natalya Danilyants&lt;/a&gt;, a board-certified gynecologic surgeon and the director of &lt;a href="https://innovativegyn.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;The Center for Innovative Gyn Care&lt;/a&gt;, says many OBGYNs and researchers are either unaware of the condition or fail to take it seriously. Adams had never heard of the condition before being diagnosed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“Common conditions in men and women, like cancer, diabetes or hypertension, get a lot of attention, but things like adenomyosis do not,” says Danilyants, who specializes in complex gynecological conditions. “Patients don’t know about it. The OBGYNs maybe know about it, but don't educate the patients. This leads to delay in care and underdiagnosis.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="gnt_em gnt_em_img gnt_em_img__inset"&gt;&lt;img class="gnt_em_img_i" fetchpriority="high" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/03/21/USAT/82591403007-20240406-130530.jpg?crop=2544,3121,x0,y272&amp;amp;width=300&amp;amp;height=369&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp" data-gl-srcset="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/03/21/USAT/82591403007-20240406-130530.jpg?crop=2544,3121,x0,y272&amp;amp;width=600&amp;amp;height=738&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp 2x" decoding="async" alt='Kristina Adams says the doctor who diagnosed her with adenomyosis "saved her life."'&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_em_img_ccw gnt_em_img_ccw__cap gnt_em_img_ccw__crd" data-c-caption='Kristina Adams says the doctor who diagnosed her with adenomyosis "saved her life."' data-c-credit="Courtesy Of Kristina Adams"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;What is adenomyosis? Symptoms, causes explained&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Adenomyosis occurs when tissue from the lining of the uterus, called endometrial tissue, grows into the uterine wall. It can cause the uterus to double or triple in size, &lt;a href="/story/life/health-wellness/2022/04/18/period-flu-ill-nauseous-before-menstruation/7275020001/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;painful menstrual cramps&lt;/a&gt; (dysmenorrhea) and heavy menstrual bleeding (menorrhagia). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Other symptoms include irregular periods, pelvic pain, painful intercourse, bloating (nicknamed "adenomyosis belly") and infertility. The abnormal bleeding can increase a person’s risk of anemia and fatigue. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Adenomyosis has related symptoms but is distinct from &lt;a href="/story/entertainment/celebrities/2024/11/19/florence-pugh-endometriosis-pcos-egg-freezing/76429194007/#:~:text=Endometriosis%2C%20meanwhile%2C%20is%20a%20condition,Fertility%20problems%20also%20may%20develop.%22" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;endometriosis&lt;/a&gt;, in which endometrial tissue grows outside of the uterus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;MRIs are more likely than ultrasounds to pick up adenomyosis, but insurance doesn't always approve them and it can cost patients thousands of dollars out-of-pocket. Danilyants says even when adenomyosis markers are found, doctors don't always take it seriously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“Sometimes patients come in with a copy of their ultrasound or MRI, and on that report, there are findings suspicious of adenomyosis, and the patient didn’t even realize because the OBGYN never highlighted it as a significant finding,” Danilyants explains. “So there’s already the diagnosis, but still no one’s stressed that that’s the cause of the issue.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The cause of adenomyosis is unknown, but Danilyants says risk factors include being in your 40s and having a history of multiple C-sections. Childbirth, prior uterine surgeries, such as a uterine fibroid removal or a dilation and curettage (D&amp;amp;C), and a history of endometriosis are also risk factors, according to &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/14167-adenomyosis#symptoms-and-causes" data-t-l=":b|z|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Medication can help manage pain, but the only way to fully stop adenomyosis is a hysterectomy, a surgical procedure to remove the uterus. Most insurances cover a hysterectomy for adenomyosis if it is deemed medically necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Surgery is a big decision, but Danilyants says a vaginal or laparoscopy hysterectomy done by a specialist is a &lt;a href="https://www.uchicagomedicine.org/conditions-services/obgyn/minimally-invasive-gynecologic-surgery/hysterectomy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;minimally invasive procedure&lt;/a&gt; that takes only 45 minutes under general anesthesia. Within 7 days, patients can return to work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;She lost her job due to untreated adenomyosis&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;After Adams’ symptoms escalated, the school day she once looked forward to became increasingly challenging to get through. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Her doctor advised her to get a hysterectomy, and in 2024, she joked to her students that she was going away to get “old woman surgery.” But on the backend, she was pleading her case to human resources. She had run out of sick days. She couldn’t afford her bills and was living off credit cards. At the end of the school year, she left her job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“Teaching gave me purpose, it was my identity,” she says. “Adenomyosis has gotten into all aspects of my life. My career, my relationships, my lifestyle.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="gnt_em gnt_em_img gnt_em_img__inset"&gt;&lt;img class="gnt_em_img_i" fetchpriority="high" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/03/21/USAT/82590767007-kristina-adams-before-surgery.jpg?width=300&amp;amp;height=400&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp" data-gl-srcset="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/03/21/USAT/82590767007-kristina-adams-before-surgery.jpg?width=600&amp;amp;height=800&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp 2x" decoding="async" alt="Kristina Adams before her hysterectomy on October 27, 2024.

After switching from oral contraception to an &lt;a href="/story/life/health-wellness/2024/10/24/women-birth-control-iud-pain-cdc/75805591007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;intrauterine device&lt;/a&gt; (IUD) in 2016, she experienced an escalation of symptoms in 2017. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“I started having really bad cramps all the time, even when I wasn't bleeding,” she recalls. “I would just get this sharp stabbing pain on my right side that would leave me just completely incapacitated.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Doctors kept telling her to give her body a few months to adjust to the switch. For a year, Poffenroth pushed off asking them about her symptoms, even though she was leaving work early or waking up in the middle of the night, crying in pain, multiple times a month. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;After finally receiving an ultrasound in 2018, the doctors said “everything was normal,” and didn’t discuss her results in depth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Poffenroth decided to make a color-coded calendar for her doctor that showed how many days she was bleeding when she shouldn’t have been and rated her pain on a pain scale daily. After taking it to his office, she pleaded, “This is not normal. Please fix this.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Her IUD was removed that same day. She eventually switched to continuous birth control, which stops periods, but started bleeding through that. In October 2024, an ultrasound under a new doctor detected markers for adenomyosis. She had a thicker endometrial lining than the average person and was a candidate for a hysterectomy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“When (my doctor) walked into the room with the results, the first thing she said was, ‘Good news. It's not all in your head.’ I immediately started crying because I was so relieved,” Poffenroth says. “The worst part was when I wasn’t getting answers, because that’s when I felt the most invalidated.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Her hysterectomy is set for June 12. She has a countdown on her phone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“I still feel like I've had it easier than a lot of people,” she says. “But I also think that is related to how women minimize their pain and suffering a lot of the time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Darlene Valencia wasn’t diagnosed with adenomyosis until after her surgery, despite suffering from painful and heavy periods for 10 years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“The doctor recommended a hysterectomy. He never said why,” the 45-year-old says. At least three months passed before the procedure, and she was bleeding the whole time. When the report came back that she had adenomyosis, the doctor said, “I knew that’s what it was going to be all along.” She asked what it was and he gave her the "textbook definition," but left it at, “It’s gone now.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“I felt really uncomfortable,” she says. “I feel fantastic now, (but) I kind of mourn my 30s, because I could have been feeling this way a long time ago.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="gnt_em gnt_em_img"&gt;&lt;img class="gnt_em_img_i" fetchpriority="high" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/03/21/USAT/82590768007-dee-photo.jpeg?width=660&amp;amp;height=660&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp" decoding="async" alt="Darlene &amp;quot;Dee&amp;quot; Valencia didn't know she had adenomyosis until after her hysterectomy."&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_em_img_ccw gnt_em_img_ccw__cap gnt_em_img_ccw__crd" data-c-caption="Darlene &amp;quot;Dee&amp;quot; Valencia didn't know she had adenomyosis until after her hysterectomy." data-c-credit="Courtesy Of Darlene Valencia"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Jennifer Fleming, 52, is an active mother of two who enjoys sailing and hiking. At 30, her ultrasound showed markers for adenomyosis, but she didn't want a hysterectomy — she was busy with her career, traveling and taking care of two young kids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;But in January 2023, she had a period that lasted for a month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“The blood loss is crazy,” she says. “Tampons don’t even matter, because you’re gonna stick them in and you’re going to pull them out in 15 minutes. It’s scary when you’re looking at it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Her doctor dismissed her concerns. "He just chalked it up to being close to menopause,” she says. “There was no, ‘Hey, you don’t have to go through this.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;She took a trip to the UC Davis Medical Center's emergency room in Sacramento, California. A uterine biopsy confirmed that she did not have cancer, but adenomyosis. She’s tried progesterone pills and an IUD to manage her symptoms, but the IUD isn’t working.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“I feel like crying, because I’ve been trying to hold out from major surgeries,” she says. “This bleeding situation sucks because I’ve stopped sailing because of it. I was trying to go on this 40-mile backpacking trip. I can’t do any of that right now.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="gnt_em gnt_em_img"&gt;&lt;img class="gnt_em_img_i" fetchpriority="high" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/03/21/USAT/82590769007-jennifer-fleming-in-hospital.jpg?crop=3257,2362,x0,y0&amp;amp;width=660&amp;amp;height=479&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp" data-gl-srcset="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/03/21/USAT/82590769007-jennifer-fleming-in-hospital.jpg?crop=3257,2362,x0,y0&amp;amp;width=1320&amp;amp;height=958&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp 2x" decoding="async" alt="Jennifer Fleming believes going to the emergency room was why she was able to get the proper care from gynecological specialists at UC Davis Medical Center."&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_em_img_ccw gnt_em_img_ccw__cap gnt_em_img_ccw__crd" data-c-caption="Jennifer Fleming believes going to the emergency room was why she was able to get the proper care from gynecological specialists at UC Davis Medical Center." data-c-credit="Courtesy Of Jennifer Fleming"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;'Hysterectomy is the gold standard'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The issue with adenomyosis care, Danilyants says, is that the doctors often treating patients are OBGYNs who “like to treat everything medically" by prescribing birth control and pain medications. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“Birth control pills are not effective. It's treated by surgery,” she explains. “Hysterectomy is the gold standard for treating adenomyosis.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;There is also an economic burden of untreated disease — chronic pain, infertility treatments and lost wages, Danilyants adds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“This disease affects millions of women, and they're going to the ER getting blood transfusions. They're seeing a hematologist to get iron infusions,” she says. “So this is years and years of spending money to treat this condition that could have easily been treated with surgery. OBGYNs should be referring to specialists who can provide better treatment options.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Adams can’t help but wonder what her life would have been like if she had a different doctor or known about adenomyosis sooner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“Periods shouldn't be that painful. This is real and you need to go to a doctor who will take you seriously,” she says. “I will never have a child now. I have my brother, but it's been a journey. I want women to believe in themselves, trust themselves, and seek a second opinion.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_s gnt_ar_s0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_s gnt_ar_s25"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_s gnt_ar_s50"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_s gnt_ar_s75"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_s gnt_ar_s100"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>USA TODAY</author><pubDate>Mon, 24 Mar 2025 14:01:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMivwFBVV95cUxQS3JEOUpsWjhCbzJIU2FDbjNEUERqa1RJYm45RVhoWm9Lc1ZyX1FNcElHSkNGVnVPaXUtd1B2RUwwQ2o4d2RnMDU4N0xsU3ROcjUwYmFlektCeWFtdVJsWWxSSU40UDZESDlzdnBrbUllSnVVMUhiOWpCV3NPYndTaEx1MG02bXpPZG1adi0zNzZnRUQwdEl5U3M4WldVc1I0YTZsVl9OVnNYMndZTUN6Y0E2M2dNU1QzYlFmcmhfaw</guid></item><item><title>There's an AI physio seeing patients in the UK.

Perhaps, something went awry while hoisting one of my young nephews in the air. Or, more likely, I messed my back up while lifting a bed so my wife could slide a rug underneath.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Whatever the trigger, my overconfidence in my own strength left me with a lower back injury. Days later, the pain began radiating down the sciatic nerve in my left leg. Standing was fine, sitting was torture. In order to sleep, I had to slide a pillow underneath my legs to keep the downward-pulsing shockwaves at bay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;By mid-December, I saw a pain medicine specialist in the area of Washington, DC where I live. He ran some movement tests, sent me for X-rays, and wrote me a referral for physical therapy with a diagnosis of "&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.uchealth.com/en/conditions/lumbar-radiculopathy" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;lumbar radiculopathy&lt;/a&gt;". In the United States, this is a relatively quick process – I went from pain to starting treatment in about three months. But that's still a very long time for something so common – and debilitating – as lower back pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Since early January, I have seen human physical therapists who work wonders. Once a week, I go in, discuss my pain, get a soft-tissue massage, and do well-supervised exercises and stretches. My pain isn't gone, but it's finally under control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;I specified that these physical therapists are human because, well, I've also been seeing a new physio in the UK. But my new British physio is only partly human. Rather, she's a series of pre-recorded videos made by a real physiotherapist, powered by artificial intelligence that I can access via an app on my phone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Flok's promise is to start seeing patients immediately, relieve the burden on the NHS, and head off patients' back pain before they go untreated and deteriorate. It's a noble mission, but I had one question: Was AI really the answer?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 jFCfG"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-a34861b-1 jxzoZC"&gt;&lt;img src="/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-a34861b-0 cOpVbP hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0kzp596.png.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0kzp596.png.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0kzp596.png.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0kzp596.png.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0kzp596.png.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0kzp596.png.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0kzp596.png.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0kzp596.png.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0kzp596.png.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0kzp596.png.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Estudio Santa Rita/BBC By guiding users through a series of stretches and movements, the app is designed to help patients manage their own pain (Credit: Estudio Santa Rita/ BBC)" class="sc-a34861b-0 efFcac"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-a34861b-2 hesJxn"&gt;Estudio Santa Rita/BBC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 bdPeAJ"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-8353772e-0 iUqqeb"&gt;By guiding users through a series of stretches and movements, the app is designed to help patients manage their own pain (Credit: Estudio Santa Rita/ BBC)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;In addition to being a trained doctor, Finn Stevenson spent time as a professional rower in Great Britain's Olympic development programme. Anyone who has rowed before – or even spent time on a rowing machine at a gym – knows that the sport can be an incredible workout but also brutal on the back if your form isn't perfect. While a professional athlete, Stevenson had access to top doctors and physiotherapists who could treat his ailments immediately. But when he left rowing and his back pain flared up, he realised what it's like for everyone else trying to receive care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"It was quite a big shock in terms of what access to care looked like for 99.5% of people," says Stevenson, now Flok's chief executive. "In theory, I should be pretty well placed to manage this. I had an academic background, I'd had three years of professional physio. If I was struggling, other people probably were too."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Stevenson and Ric da Silva, now his co-founder and Flok's chief technology officer, met when they were early employees at a company called CMR Surgical, a British startup where the pair worked on building robotics for soft-tissue surgery. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;But with Flok, they are aiming to provide treatment to people who don't need surgery. They are looking to help people with the easiest and most manageable cases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"There are quite a few conditions where that's true, where you don't need a scan, you don't need hands-on manipulation, you don't need medication," says da Silva. "What you need is 10 minutes of stretches a few times a week, and that will solve the problem."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The idea is that this should then free up clinicians to focus on the patients with more complex problems who really need their help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="quote-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-9967660-0 WkJHg"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-9967660-2 kcfPbO"&gt;This AI is more like a choose-your-own-adventure book where there are more than one billion intervention combinations&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;When I first open Flok, I'm greeted by Kirsty, my physiotherapist. She appears in a minimalist setting with all of the accoutrements befitting a yoga instructor: black workout outfit, bamboo-coloured exercise mat, contemporary office chair, and a Monstera plant. She asks me questions about myself and my pain, and I respond by clicking multiple-choice options. Each response triggers a follow-up question or instruction as the underlying AI adapts to my answers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;But rather than being a live video call, this interaction is a series of pre-recorded video that are stitched together by AI based on my answers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;While the artificial intelligence boom of the past few years has been spurred by advances in generative AI from large language models, Flok has a different use for AI. "We essentially developed a domain specific language for describing clinical reasoning," says Stevenson. Because it's not a ChatGPT-like chatbot predicting the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://cset.georgetown.edu/article/the-surprising-power-of-next-word-prediction-large-language-models-explained-part-1/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;next word in a sequence&lt;/a&gt;, there isn't a risk of the so-called &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/ai-hallucinations" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;hallucination problem&lt;/a&gt; in AI where an &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-67986611" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;algorithm makes things up&lt;/a&gt; – a major concern about &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.02.28.25323115v1" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;AI in the medical field&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Instead, this AI is more like a choose-your-own-adventure book where there are more than one billion "intervention combinations", says Stevenson. The power of AI makes it possible to deliver this in a seamless way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;It's a "perfect software problem", says Stevenson. "Software is an extremely good delivery model if you know what you're trying to deliver, and if you just need to do that in a more scalable way."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 jFCfG"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-a34861b-1 jxzoZC"&gt;&lt;img src="/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-a34861b-0 cOpVbP hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0kzp59s.png.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0kzp59s.png.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0kzp59s.png.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0kzp59s.png.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0kzp59s.png.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0kzp59s.png.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0kzp59s.png.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0kzp59s.png.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0kzp59s.png.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0kzp59s.png.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Estudio Santa Rita/BBC Lower back pain is one of the leading causes of disability around the world (Credit: Estudio Santa Rita/ BBC)" class="sc-a34861b-0 efFcac"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-a34861b-2 hesJxn"&gt;Estudio Santa Rita/BBC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 bdPeAJ"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-8353772e-0 iUqqeb"&gt;Lower back pain is one of the leading causes of disability around the world (Credit: Estudio Santa Rita/ BBC)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Flok is currently expanding its operations. Its service launched first in Scotland at the end of last year and has recently signed contracts to add locations in England, though Stevenson isn't yet able to reveal where. In the next 12 months, Stevenson said he hopes to cover at least half of the UK. And they're also expanding what pain areas they're treating hip and knee osteoarthritis and women's pelvic health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;But it is also not alone in trying to use AI to tackle musculoskeletal pain. Another AI-based app that helps patients manage pain in the lower back and neck called selfBACK has been undergoing &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://humanfactors.jmir.org/2024/1/e55716" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;clinical trials in the US&lt;/a&gt; as an add-on to more typical care services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Not entirely unlike Flok's approach, selfBACK works by analysing what treatments worked well for previous patients with similar conditions, then recommending personalised exercise plans. Studies have indicated that &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2782459" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;it can help to reduce pain&lt;/a&gt; among those who use it. But a &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://humanfactors.jmir.org/2024/1/e55716" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;recent trial&lt;/a&gt; found slow adoption rates – nearly one-third of trial participants never used the app, and another third only used it a few times. Patients and practitioners concluded that the app should be used to supplement traditional care rather than replace it. Other studies have also cautioned that self-management apps need to be provided in addition to care &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2772628223000559" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;not as a replacement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Even so, research seems to suggest that mobile health apps of this nature are a &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://mhealth.jmir.org/2024/1/e53262" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;potentially promising approach&lt;/a&gt; to helping patients manage their back pain. But there are also no shortage of questions about AI's integration into healthcare more broadly. Elizabeth A. Stuart, a professor and chair of the biostatistics department at the Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health, says that AI healthcare tools should undergo the same rigorous evaluations as traditional medical interventions, such as regulatory approvals and peer review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"In some ways, these AI tools are no different from other healthcare interventions that we want to learn about the effects of," says Stuart. "We need to assess how well they work, do they work, who do they work for, just as carefully as we have done for other healthcare interventions." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Stuart says that while we don't need to reinvent the wheel when it comes to AI, we do need to recognise when these systems keep evolving even after they're deployed. "With some AI tools, they are sort of self-adapting," she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;She contrasts AI tools with the annual flu vaccines, which undergo deliberate assessment processes each year to ensure they're targeted to the latest viral strain. But sometimes AI tools are a black box, "changing under the hood" in real-time and it's not always clear how, she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Pranav Rajpurkar, an assistant professor of biomedical informatics at Harvard Medical School, says he sees promise in AI applications that help triage care for patients. "What's counterintuitive is that forced collaboration between AI and clinicians often underperforms compared to a &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-03456-y" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;clear division of labor&lt;/a&gt;," he says. "When doctors and AI review the same cases side-by-side, their &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-02850-w" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;combined accuracy&lt;/a&gt; is sometimes barely better than doctors alone. &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13347-022-00506-6" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;Clean separation of responsibilities&lt;/a&gt; side steps these issues."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="quote-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-9967660-0 WkJHg"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-9967660-2 kcfPbO"&gt;Her pre-recorded videos don't watch my movements and stretches – they rely on me following her instructions correctly and reporting if something is amiss&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;In Flok's case, the company employs professional physios who appear in the videos that patients see, but are available to answer patient questions after their AI-enabled video sessions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Rajpurkar predicts that eventually "we'll move from narrow AI tools to generalist medical AI systems capable of handling multiple tasks across different domains". It's an approach he's working on with his own company, a2z Radiology AI, which is developing AI-powered analytics for radiologists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"The systems that succeed won't be those claiming to 'replace doctors', but those that thoughtfully redistribute clinical work to make healthcare more accessible, efficient, and human-centered," says Rajpurkar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;In our first 20-minute session, Kirsty asks me a long list of questions about myself, about my pain, and asks me to stretch in different ways – following her careful lead on the screen – in order to decide the best course of treatment. She gives me stretches and exercises to try for the week ahead, with careful instruction not to push too hard or do anything that feels uncomfortable. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;This isn't the experience I have in-person with my team of human physical therapists in the US. They frequently correct my posture and tell me when I'm doing something wrong – which is often. The big difference here is that Kirsty can't see me. Her pre-recorded videos don't watch my movements and stretches. They rely on me following her instructions correctly and reporting if something is amiss. There's also an option at the end of the session to leave a voice note for a real physiotherapist who will respond to my personal needs or questions – a real voice behind the curtain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;My back felt better after my sessions with Flok, but the app likely isn't for me. I'm clumsy and uncoordinated and need someone watching my form at all times – if not, I'm likely to hurt myself further. That ability to watch patients and offer feedback on posture could be something AI will enable in the future – but until then, I'll be sticking with the humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;&lt;i id="for-more-science,-technology,-environment-and-health-stories-from-the-bbc,-follow-us-on" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt;For more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;&lt;b id="facebook" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kVRnKf"&gt;&lt;i id="facebook" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt;Facebook&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i id="," class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt;, &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://x.com/BBC_Future" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;&lt;b id="x" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kVRnKf"&gt;&lt;i id="x" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt;X&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b id="" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kVRnKf"&gt;&lt;i id="" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i id="and" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt;and &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/bbcfuture_official/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;&lt;b id="instagram" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kVRnKf"&gt;&lt;i id="instagram" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt;Instagram&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b id="." class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kVRnKf"&gt;&lt;i id="." class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 24 Mar 2025 14:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMivgFBVV95cUxNeVFJRkFYVjdyOS1QN0w5RTk3UXhtZzVZMXlmOExZaXUyWUo5QmZVTnBlR2kyTFQyRUJ0N1RiRGFuclU3aHYzYk1kZHU0QVFSbEJBWmxQTXQ3SHBLczcxMG9ic3FSb0dVUF9FREhFeFozV1B4blpDY3RrV3ZvRjhuSnl1NHRIanFvWGo5OGxmM09jelpNZE4xTEJGdk9OOU9ESHZCMklNRGpZQThwYUVmS0VtOHpuanZmSm9neE9B</guid></item><item><title>11 Signs A Woman Is Emotionally Drained But Keeps Pushing Through - YourTango</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikgFBVV95cUxNMW1Ia0lkc2R2OHkwRHE0eVRGYTgtelpnZkg5WlRsRUJKaG93aUc5SHBVdjVxZkZ6OGF1ME1TajUxNFdFLTNHTFNuR012MjBxOWdaanRQdVp6bFl0Wm5OYjFzenZUa2cxRUp3NVYtbXp0UUhvVzlTNHR3RFhvNHFCdVlGR1UybDcyRVE5SEJhTENkQQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We all go through times when we feel burned out and exhausted. It's just part of life. Sometimes we feel like we've lost our spark and need some help finding it again. While this can happen to anyone, it's especially troublesome for women, who are expected to handle everything at work and at home with perfect ease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://berlincameron.com/research/2022/3/7/the-exhaustion-gap" rel="nofollow"&gt;A collaborative survey&lt;/a&gt; from Berlin Cameron, Eve Rodsky's "Fair Play," and Kantar, 68% of women in the U.S. felt burned out in the last week. On the other hand, only 50% of American men felt the same way. This 18% difference is telling, and is evidence of the signs a woman is emotionally drained but keeps pushing through. Women are struggling, but how do you know what to look for to know if this is the case?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Here are 11 signs a woman is emotionally drained but keeps pushing through&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;1. She just doesn't care anymore&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="media media--type-image media--view-mode-default"&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" src="/sites/default/files/image_blog/2025-03/signs-woman-emotionally-drained-keeps-pushing-through-doesnt-care.png" alt="emotionally drained woman shrugging" title="signs a woman is emotionally drained but keeps pushing through she doesn't care anymore" class="img-fluid" typeof="foaf:Image"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-credit field--type-string field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;Cast Of Thousands | Shutterstock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If she just doesn't care about things like she used to, it's one of the sure signs a woman is emotionally drained but keeps pushing through. Not caring means she feels like giving up, but she still hasn't. Whether it's part of her professional or personal life, she has let go of the expectations she set for herself and the ambition she has and is simply coasting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it may seem like it's not a huge deal, &lt;a href="https://www.verywellmind.com/i-don-t-care-about-anything-why-you-might-feel-this-way-5215747"&gt;psychology educator Kendra Cherry&lt;/a&gt; pointed out that not caring can actually be a sign of something more serious. It could mean &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/health-wellness/behaviors-linked-hidden-depression"&gt;you are experiencing apathy&lt;/a&gt;, which means you feel indifferent, or that you are experiencing anhedonia, which means you can't feel pleasure. Both are signs of mental health conditions like depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some may feel perfectly happy, or at least okay, to continue pushing through while feeling like they don't care. However, this can be an indicator of a more worrisome condition that needs to be addressed with medical attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/love/good-husbands-support-stressed-exhausted-wives"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10 Ways Good Husbands Support Their Stressed-Out, Exhausted Wives&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;2.

The human brain certainly allows for distraction pretty easily, and getting distracted is less challenging for some than it is for others. But if a woman is starting to seek distractions from everyday tasks she would normally complete without problems, it's not a good sign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mental health writers &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/mental-exhaustion"&gt;Adrienne Santos-Longhurst and Crystal Raypole&lt;/a&gt; explained that "mental exhaustion can happen when your brain receives too much stimulation or has to maintain an intense level of activity without rest." If you have too much to focus on at the moment, then distraction would certainly be tempting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everyone gets distracted from time to time, or &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/distraction-good-your-mental-health"&gt;wants to be distracted by something more interesting&lt;/a&gt; than whatever is necessary at that point in time. But actively seeking out these distractions repeatedly is a sign that a woman is really struggling. She can't deal with what's necessary, so she looks for alternative options for her attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/subtle-signs-woman-who-has-been-through-lot-life-according-research"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;11 Subtle Signs Of A Woman Who Has Been Through A Lot In Life, According To Research&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="player-wrapper-outer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;3.

Most people would admit to enjoying their rest, but checking out so much that sleep becomes your favorite activity isn't normal at all. It's easy to assume that this is happening because of a lack of sleep, but it &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/signs-burned-out-according-psychologist"&gt;can really be a sign of burnout&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.michiganmedicine.org/health-lab/sleep-deprivation-or-burnout" rel="nofollow"&gt;Sleep psychologist and wellness advocate Deidre Conry, PhD&lt;/a&gt; explained that feeling like you could fall asleep instantly is a &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/signs-sleep-deprived-not-tired"&gt;sign that you're not getting enough sleep&lt;/a&gt; or have a sleep disorder. On the other hand, if you're dealing with mental illness, nutritional problems, taking certain medications or pushing too hard or not hard enough with physical activity, you're likely dealing with the exhaustion that comes from burnout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sleep is also a distraction in its own way. Unless you dream about your problems when you're asleep, you don't have to think about them. In that sense, it's definitely one of the signs a woman is emotionally drained but keeps pushing through, just wanting to escape the present moment and its worries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/subtle-signs-woman-who-never-had-struggle-day-her-life"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;11 Subtle Signs Of A Woman Who Never Had To Struggle A Day In Her Life&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;4.

However, if a woman is emotionally drained, she'll likely make even more mistakes than the average person. As part of not caring anymore, she won't be careful. This will lead to a lack of accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href="https://www.webmd.com/mental-health/ss/slideshow-signs-youre-mentally-exhausted"&gt;mental health journalist Keri Wiginton&lt;/a&gt; put it, "It's impossible for your work to be perfect all the time. But mental fatigue lessens your ability to catch and fix your mistakes quickly or at all. That can cause serious problems in certain jobs, such as ones where you use machines, drive a vehicle or fly a plane."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If someone is &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/symptoms-of-emotional-exhaustion-mental-burnout"&gt;dealing with true mental and emotional exhaustion&lt;/a&gt;, they're naturally going to be less accurate and more prone to mistakes. They don't really have the mental capacity to be overly careful anymore. Unfortunately, this can lead to a vicious cycle, as they blame themselves for not doing a good enough job and then spiral further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/mistakes-make-someone-look-deeply-desperate"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10 Mistakes That Make Someone Look Deeply Desperate&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;5.

Even the ones she loves the most aren't immune to her apathetic and disgruntled attitude. She has become so unhappy with life that it's spreading to those around her like a contagion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/what-is-resentment" rel="nofollow"&gt;the Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;, "Resentment can be described as a complex, multilayered emotional reaction to being mistreated or wronged by another person, situation or series of circumstances." It is closely related to irritability, which &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/emotional-exhaustion-during-times-of-unrest" rel="nofollow"&gt;Jolene Hanson, LICSW&lt;/a&gt; listed as a symptom of emotional exhaustion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chances are, a woman is not really angry at those who are on the receiving end of her resentment. Rather, she's angry at life in general and how she feels about it. This can be tricky as it means feelings are bound to get hurt, and people whose support she needs may push her farther away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/behaviors-seem-rude-are-actually-signs-smart-woman"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;11 Behaviors That Seem Rude But Are Actually Signs Of A Smart Woman&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;6.

Unfortunately, our emotional and physical health are closely linked and one can impact and change the other. So, if you're in emotional distress, you're bound to feel it physically as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hanson said that some of the physical symptoms of emotional exhaustion can include headaches, stomachaches, nausea and muscle aches. One's body undergoing this kind of tension can lead to longer-term problems like chronic stress and burnout, according to &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/emotional-exhaustion"&gt;research analyst Jacquelyn Cafasso&lt;/a&gt;. That's why it's important to take care of it as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In some cases, &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/signs-youre-burned-out-not-lazy"&gt;being emotionally drained&lt;/a&gt; actually requires medical care. It's easy to put that care off because you think you're "just tired" or "just upset." But it runs so much deeper. When it starts to affect you physically, it can be especially dangerous, so it's best to consult with a professional.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/types-pain-direclty-linked-how-person-handles-emotions"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9 Types Of Pain That Are Directly Linked To How A Person Handles Their Emotions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;7.

What makes that even worse is that anyone in a relationship can actually feel drained because of the relationship. Relationships themselves can be causes for burnout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Relationship burnout can occur when relationship stress becomes chronic, resulting in exhaustion, similar to other forms of burnout," &lt;a href="https://www.choosingtherapy.com/relationship-burnout/" rel="nofollow"&gt;licensed clinical social worker Michelle Risser&lt;/a&gt; said. "While burnout is often associated with work, it can also infiltrate relationships."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While relationship burnout is real, it's also possible that a woman might feel disinterest in romantic relationships because of being emotionally drained in other areas of her life, or just in general. Because of this, &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/heartbreak/early-signs-relationship-bad-news-according-psychology"&gt;relationship apathy can be difficult to pin down&lt;/a&gt; since there are multiple factors that can contribute to it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/subtle-signs-woman-been-misunderstood-her-whole-life-according-research"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;11 Subtle Signs Of A Woman Who Has Been Misunderstood Her Whole Life, According To Research&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;8.

Someone could choose to turn to unhealthy coping mechanisms like drinking or smoking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cafasso urged people to not do this, saying, "Alcohol may temporarily boost your mood, but the feeling will quickly wear off, leaving you more anxious and depressed than before." Other forms of substance abuse are also not the answer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If she's using substances or doing similar things more often than she normally does, it's one of the glaring signs a woman is emotionally drained but keeps pushing through. She probably thinks that doing these things will help her push through and make life easier. Unfortunately, they only make it harder in the end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/phrases-offend-emotionally-fragile-people-dont-bother-normal-thinkers"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;11 Phrases That Offend Emotionally Fragile People But Don't Bother Normal Thinkers At All&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;9.

Even for people who love their jobs, there are still low days that feel awful. But the people who do value their job are typically able to bring at least a little bit of self-expression to the role. They make it uniquely their own amidst the monotony of a nine-to-five.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if a woman is emotionally drained, that's no longer a priority for her anymore. Instead, she's simply focused on getting through each day, which is hard enough without adding an extra burst of creativity. Instead, her creative juices feel absolutely zapped out and she has nothing left to give.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/323441" rel="nofollow"&gt;Counselor and psychotherapist Jayne Leonard&lt;/a&gt; specifically listed "working long hours" as something that can cause emotional exhaustion.

One of those things is how vigilant she is about her physical fitness. When you're dealing with emotional exhaustion, eating healthy and staying active really isn't a priority. It's all you can do to get out of bed and make it through each day, really.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.mountsinai.org/health-library/special-topic/break-the-bonds-of-emotional-eating" rel="nofollow"&gt;Mount Sinai&lt;/a&gt;, there is indeed a link between what you eat and how you feel. "Foods high in fat, sugar and salt can become more appealing when you are under stress, are in a bad mood or feel bad about yourself," they said. Much like alcohol, food can relieve stress, but only temporarily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, it can be difficult to find the motivation to exercise when you don't really have the motivation for, well... anything. Cafasso pointed out that exercising will release endorphins and increase your serotonin levels, which will actually help with emotional exhaustion in the long run. Unfortunately, finding the will to power through and get it done is the hardest part of the battle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/small-ways-take-better-care-yourself-nothing-do-diet-exercise"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;11 Small Ways To Take Better Care Of Yourself That Have Nothing To Do With Diet And Exercise&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;11.

We weren't meant to do life on our own. But for women who are emotionally drained, reaching out to others, even those closest to them, can just feel like too much. Slowly but surely, they will isolate themselves from family and friends who just want to help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Isolation or avoidance are both signs of emotional exhaustion, but this is the exact opposite of what you should be doing. According to Cafasso, "Talking face-to-face with a friend is a wonderful way to relieve stress." In situations where a friend is not readily available, she recommended looking into employee assistance programs that offered counseling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a woman who is emotionally drained, not reaching out to loved ones and &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/signs-someone-deeply-lonely"&gt;isolating herself will feel like the best thing to do&lt;/a&gt; because it's further avoidance of the problem. But really, the issue needs to be faced head-on.

					&lt;p id="page-position-marker_id_100240" class="page-position-marker"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aide Moreno remembers how Valley fever claimed her mother’s last year of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carlos and Roselia Aguirre raised Moreno and three boys in Westway, a small unincorporated community in the northwestern part of El Paso County. Roselia was a cafeteria worker in the Canutillo Independent School District and had a habit of “adopting” schoolchildren – buying jackets for students who didn’t have any, keeping an extra eye on the ones who didn’t have mothers at home, Moreno said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then in the summer of 2015, Roselia started getting sick. She developed a cough that wouldn’t go away and headaches so severe she couldn’t work. Strokes would cause half her face to droop. But doctors couldn’t figure out the source of these symptoms, Moreno recalled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About a year of hospital visits later – including with one doctor who said “it was all in her head” – Roselia finally got the answer she was looking for in 2016: Coccidioidomycosis, a fungal infection known as Valley fever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nobody in her family had heard of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roselia started antifungal medication to treat the infection, but died less than a few months later Aug. 24, 2016, from a heart attack. Her death certificate attributed the cause to coccidioidomycosis. She was 52 years old. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coccidioidomycosis affects humans and susceptible animals that inhale airborne fungal spores found in soil, stirred up by disturbances such as construction, agriculture and wind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://elpasomatters.org/2025/03/12/el-paso-air-quality-rank-dust-pollution-wind-weather/"&gt;Intense dust storms and high winds engulfed El Paso&lt;/a&gt; this month, though scientists have not come to a consensus on the possible link between dust storms and Valley fever transmission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Physicians and researchers who spoke to El Paso Matters did agree on one thing, however: Knowledge of the disease is the first and perhaps best defense against life-threatening complications of coccidioidomycosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;El Paso has reported more than 320 cases of Valley fever since 2013, the first year the local &lt;a href="https://elpasomatters.org/2025/02/09/el-paso-public-health-director-vinny-taneja-job-vacancies-challenges/"&gt;public health department&lt;/a&gt; began surveilling the disease. That is likely an undercount as an estimated tens of thousands of Valley fever cases in the country go unreported, never diagnosed or misdiagnosed, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since her mother’s death, Moreno said she tries to ask every doctor and nurse practitioner she meets if they have heard of Valley fever. Maybe two out of three she’s encountered don’t know what it is, she estimated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s just to spread awareness,” Moreno said. “Maybe somebody else doesn’t have to go through what my mom did, all the experimenting, wondering if it’s this or that. Maybe they can figure it out faster.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why Valley fever disease goes undetected&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;University Medical Center of El Paso treated 66 patients diagnosed with coccidioidomycosis in 2024, the most in a single year since 2016, according to data provided by the hospital. UMC has also seen 15 Valley fever patients in January through February of this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Valley fever is not a communicable disease, meaning it does not transmit from person to person, or animal to person. Symptoms typically show up one to three weeks after breathing in fungal spores, but not everyone who’s exposed becomes sick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evidence suggests the fungus that causes Valley fever lives in the soil of the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/valley-fever/areas/index.html"&gt;U.S. Southwest, including a swath of West and South Texas&lt;/a&gt;. The “valley” in the name comes from the San Joaquin Valley in California, where the disease was first identified and studied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vast majority of coccidioidomycosis cases are reported in Arizona and California. Texas is one of the states that does not require reporting and the number of Valley fever incidents across Texas is unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though not required, El Paso is the only county in Texas that reports Valley fever cases, according to a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9863933/"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; advocating for coccidioidomycosis to be a reportable disease nationwide. The El Paso Department of Public Health publishes new diagnoses of coccidioidomycosis in its monthly notifiable conditions report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fungus that causes Valley fever is endemic to El Paso and causes significant illness in the community, said Dr. Hector Ocaranza, El Paso city-county health authority. The health department added coccidioidomycosis to its notifiable conditions list in 2013 to improve disease surveillance and response efforts, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://elpasomatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/usavalleyfevermap-cdc-1024x576.avif" alt="" class="wp-image-99911" srcset="https://elpasomatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/usavalleyfevermap-cdc-1024x576.avif 1024w, https://elpasomatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/usavalleyfevermap-cdc-300x169.avif 300w, https://elpasomatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/usavalleyfevermap-cdc-768x432.avif 768w, https://elpasomatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/usavalleyfevermap-cdc-400x225.avif 400w, https://elpasomatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/usavalleyfevermap-cdc-706x397.avif 706w, https://elpasomatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/usavalleyfevermap-cdc.avif 1200w, https://elpasomatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/usavalleyfevermap-cdc-1024x576.avif 370w" sizes="(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The endemic region of coccidioidomycosis, a fungal infection known as Valley fever, in the United States.

In the other visits, patients were diagnosed with conditions related to coccidioidomycosis infection, including sepsis, pneumonia and respiratory failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreno said doctors prescribed her mother, Roselia, pain medication before she was diagnosed, but the headaches didn’t go away. A doctor at one El Paso hospital told Moreno there was nothing wrong with her mother and they should seek a psychiatric evaluation for Roselia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My mom doesn’t play around like this,” Moreno said. “I told them, ‘I don’t understand why you’re saying this. If you’re not going to believe her, there’s no reason to stay here.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eventually Roselia was hospitalized at Las Palmas Medical Center in El Paso in 2016 after a stroke led to brain swelling. Roselia needed a shunt to drain excess brain fluid and was put in an induced coma to reduce swelling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By chance, a weekend physician who saw Roselia for the first time asked Moreno and her father if Roselia had ever been tested for Valley fever, Moreno said. The family didn’t know what that was, but two weeks after testing Roselia’s brain fluid, doctors finally learned she had Coccidioidal meningitis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;&lt;figure class="alignright size-full is-resized"&gt;&lt;img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/elpasomatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Armando-Meza-1.jpg?resize=360%2C360&amp;amp;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-5201" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/elpasomatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Armando-Meza-1.jpg?w=360&amp;amp;ssl=1 360w, https://i0.wp.com/elpasomatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Armando-Meza-1.jpg?resize=300%2C300&amp;amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/elpasomatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Armando-Meza-1.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/elpasomatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Armando-Meza-1.jpg?resize=80%2C80&amp;amp;ssl=1 80w, https://i0.wp.com/elpasomatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Armando-Meza-1.jpg?resize=159%2C160&amp;amp;ssl=1 159w, https://i0.wp.com/elpasomatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Armando-Meza-1.jpg?resize=24%2C24&amp;amp;ssl=1 24w, https://i0.wp.com/elpasomatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Armando-Meza-1.jpg?resize=48%2C48&amp;amp;ssl=1 48w, https://i0.wp.com/elpasomatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Armando-Meza-1.jpg?resize=96%2C96&amp;amp;ssl=1 96w, https://i0.wp.com/elpasomatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Armando-Meza-1.jpg?w=370&amp;amp;ssl=1 370w, https://i0.wp.com/elpasomatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Armando-Meza-1.jpg?w=400&amp;amp;ssl=1 400w" sizes="(max-width: 360px) 100vw, 360px"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Dr. Armando Meza, infectious disease specialist at Texas Tech Health El Paso&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than half of people with Valley fever don’t show symptoms and most people who do have a cough and fever, like any other common respiratory illness, said Dr. Armando Meza, an infectious disease physician at Texas Tech Health El Paso. These milder cases could resolve on their own, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in 5-10% of cases, the infection can progress and cause more severe complications, from pneumonia to cavities in the lungs, according to the CDC. The infection can also turn into disseminated Valley fever, which means the disease has spread from the respiratory system to other body parts – the bones, skin, brain. Coccidioidal meningitis such as Roselia’s, a fatal form of the disease if left untreated, attacks the central nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disseminated Valley fever requires longer antifungal treatment that can take years and for meningitis, treatment is lifelong, Meza said. The meningitis vaccine required for Texas college students treats bacterial infection, so it would not work on Coccidioidal meningitis, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meza said he tends to see patients who are already diagnosed and have more advanced cases of Valley fever. The infection usually doesn’t strike twice, but immunocompromised patients should also get additional checkups after they recover because they are at risk of recurrence, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/elpasomatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roselia-Aguirre.jpg?resize=780%2C585&amp;amp;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-99954" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/elpasomatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roselia-Aguirre.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&amp;amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/elpasomatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roselia-Aguirre.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/elpasomatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roselia-Aguirre.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/elpasomatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roselia-Aguirre.jpg?resize=1536%2C1152&amp;amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/elpasomatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roselia-Aguirre.jpg?resize=1200%2C900&amp;amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/elpasomatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roselia-Aguirre.jpg?resize=800%2C600&amp;amp;ssl=1 800w, https://i0.wp.com/elpasomatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roselia-Aguirre.jpg?resize=600%2C450&amp;amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/elpasomatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roselia-Aguirre.jpg?resize=400%2C300&amp;amp;ssl=1 400w, https://i0.wp.com/elpasomatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roselia-Aguirre.jpg?resize=200%2C150&amp;amp;ssl=1 200w, https://i0.wp.com/elpasomatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roselia-Aguirre.jpg?resize=1568%2C1176&amp;amp;ssl=1 1568w, https://i0.wp.com/elpasomatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roselia-Aguirre.jpg?resize=2000%2C1500&amp;amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i0.wp.com/elpasomatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roselia-Aguirre.jpg?resize=706%2C530&amp;amp;ssl=1 706w, https://i0.wp.com/elpasomatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roselia-Aguirre.jpg?w=2048&amp;amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/elpasomatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roselia-Aguirre-1024x768.jpg?w=370&amp;amp;ssl=1 370w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Roselia Aguirre was a mother of four, and grandmother, who lived in the El Paso area.

Storms are only a small slice of soil disturbances. Human activities and breezes throughout the year have more or less potential to spread spores in the air, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That’s because the spores are only in certain parts of the dirt,” Galgiani said. “Most of the Sonoran Desert doesn’t have spores in it. There are colonies here and there, like wildflowers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/elpasomatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_5854.jpg?resize=780%2C585&amp;amp;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-99958" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/elpasomatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_5854-scaled.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&amp;amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/elpasomatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_5854-scaled.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/elpasomatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_5854-scaled.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/elpasomatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_5854-scaled.jpg?resize=1536%2C1152&amp;amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/elpasomatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_5854-scaled.jpg?resize=2048%2C1536&amp;amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/elpasomatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_5854-scaled.jpg?resize=1200%2C900&amp;amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/elpasomatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_5854-scaled.jpg?resize=800%2C600&amp;amp;ssl=1 800w, https://i0.wp.com/elpasomatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_5854-scaled.jpg?resize=600%2C450&amp;amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/elpasomatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_5854-scaled.jpg?resize=400%2C300&amp;amp;ssl=1 400w, https://i0.wp.com/elpasomatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_5854-scaled.jpg?resize=200%2C150&amp;amp;ssl=1 200w, https://i0.wp.com/elpasomatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_5854-scaled.jpg?resize=1568%2C1176&amp;amp;ssl=1 1568w, https://i0.wp.com/elpasomatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_5854-scaled.jpg?resize=2000%2C1500&amp;amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i0.wp.com/elpasomatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_5854-scaled.jpg?resize=706%2C530&amp;amp;ssl=1 706w, https://i0.wp.com/elpasomatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_5854-scaled.jpg?w=2340&amp;amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i0.wp.com/elpasomatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_5854-1024x768.jpg?w=370&amp;amp;ssl=1 370w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;A dust storm, one of several that week, obscures a school as it swept through El Paso and parts of southern New Mexico on March 6, 2025.

Most dust events occurred in spring to early summer, with &lt;a href="https://elpasomatters.org/2025/02/20/el-paso-weather-high-winds-bring-dust-epa/"&gt;drought conditions&lt;/a&gt; correlating with more dust events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A dust event refers to blowing dust with one to 10 kilometers of visibility, while a dust storm is a more severe event with less than one kilometer of visibility. &lt;a href="https://www.azcentral.com/in-depth/news/local/arizona-environment/2019/06/18/arizona-monsoon-dust-storms-haboobs-raise-environmental-and-health-issues/3272677002/"&gt;Haboobs&lt;/a&gt; – towering walls of dust and debris – originate from thunderstorm winds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gill said that while there are many ways to become exposed to spores, the science community should be careful about dismissing windblown dust as a potential health risk for Valley fever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Coccidioides spores probably don’t care what the actual visibility is when they’re floating in the wind,” Gill said. “Some of them get in some events, some spores get in some dust and some don’t get in others. That’s kind of the big mystery I think a lot of us are trying to drill down to – exactly what sort of conditions of windblown dust might be most prone to distribute these Valley fever spores.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spores appear to thrive in semi-arid and arid soil, rather than more fertile soil with a lot of organic material, Gill said. Some of El Paso’s recent dust storms had a reddish color rather than the usual white-gray, suggesting the dust came from an area rich in iron, but he doesn’t know yet how the mineral makeup of soils affects Valley fever spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/elpasomatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_6460.jpg?resize=780%2C520&amp;amp;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-99777"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;A thick layer of dust clouds South El Paso Street in Downtown El Paso after a dust storm set in across the city on March 6, 2025. (Diego Mendoza-Moyers / El Paso Matters) &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers will try to answer at least one question in a study that’s currently in peer review. Ibarra-Mejia presented a poster of the study last year at the annual American Geophysical Union meeting, suggesting there is a higher incidence of Valley fever in El Paso following months of certain high temperatures, high &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/pm-pollution/particulate-matter-pm-basics"&gt;PM 10 pollution&lt;/a&gt; or strong wind gusts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The impact of human-driven &lt;a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2017GL073524"&gt;climate change on soil conditions and dust trends&lt;/a&gt; could also encourage Valley fever to proliferate across Texas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;El Paso County has been in a continuous drought since August 2013, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor. Drought loosens soil, allowing the wind to kick up spores, Ibarra-Mejia said. Fungal spores do depend on rainfall and the right conditions to germinate, so a wet spell followed by hot, dry period and winds could disseminate those spores, he explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s unclear how long exactly coccidioides spores can survive, but they can remain dormant for a long time before germinating – and they might not germinate until they’re inside someone’s lungs, Ibarra-Mejia said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prioritizing Valley fever testing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;One thing is certain: The El Paso community won’t know how prevalent Valley fever cases are if doctors don’t test for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gill recalled attending a symposium in Las Cruces about the health impact of dust storms sometime in the last decade. He was shocked to learn many people from the El Paso medical community were not familiar with Valley fever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You have to wonder, for every case that’s diagnosed, how many cases go undiagnosed or misdiagnosed?” Gill said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem is doctors who trained where Valley fever is rare might not know to test because it’s not part of their practice, Galgiani said. Even Phoenix and Tucson suffer from massive underreporting, despite people in Arizona having more awareness, he said. This not knowing can lead to anxiety in patients, in addition to unnecessary medical procedures and medications that don’t work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you’re in an endemic region and you have pneumonia, you should test for Valley fever because that’s a possible cause,” Galgiani said. “Even if you get over it on your own, people can make more rational decisions to manage it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Valley Fever Center for Excellence is working with Banner Health to ramp up testing, mostly in Maricopa County so far – an initiative El Paso County health leaders could try to follow. Banner Health’s urgent care clinics went from testing about 2% of pneumonia patients for coccidioidomycosis to testing 40% or more last year, Galgiani said. He found about 3% of those pneumonia patients had Valley fever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a patient’s X-ray shows a lung cavity, that should be an automatic trigger for Valley fever testing, Meza said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Animals can catch Valley fever and test for infection, too, though some are more susceptible to disease than others. Sheep and cattle are fairly resistant to illness, while dogs show more obvious symptoms. Dogs likely inhale fungal spores when they’re outside digging in the dirt, rolling around and sniffing low to the ground, Ardon-Dryer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no cure for the infection, but a new &lt;a href="https://azcir.org/news/2021/10/28/valley-fever-vaccine-dogs-promising-humans-next/"&gt;Valley fever vaccine for dogs&lt;/a&gt; could become available to veterinary clinics as early as this year  – and mark a potential step closer to a human vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/elpasomatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roselia-Aguirre-and-baby-Aide-Moreno.jpg?resize=780%2C585&amp;amp;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-99955" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/elpasomatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roselia-Aguirre-and-baby-Aide-Moreno.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&amp;amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/elpasomatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roselia-Aguirre-and-baby-Aide-Moreno.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/elpasomatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roselia-Aguirre-and-baby-Aide-Moreno.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/elpasomatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roselia-Aguirre-and-baby-Aide-Moreno.jpg?resize=1536%2C1152&amp;amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/elpasomatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roselia-Aguirre-and-baby-Aide-Moreno.jpg?resize=1200%2C900&amp;amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/elpasomatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roselia-Aguirre-and-baby-Aide-Moreno.jpg?resize=800%2C600&amp;amp;ssl=1 800w, https://i0.wp.com/elpasomatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roselia-Aguirre-and-baby-Aide-Moreno.jpg?resize=600%2C450&amp;amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/elpasomatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roselia-Aguirre-and-baby-Aide-Moreno.jpg?resize=400%2C300&amp;amp;ssl=1 400w, https://i0.wp.com/elpasomatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roselia-Aguirre-and-baby-Aide-Moreno.jpg?resize=200%2C150&amp;amp;ssl=1 200w, https://i0.wp.com/elpasomatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roselia-Aguirre-and-baby-Aide-Moreno.jpg?resize=1568%2C1176&amp;amp;ssl=1 1568w, https://i0.wp.com/elpasomatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roselia-Aguirre-and-baby-Aide-Moreno.jpg?resize=2000%2C1500&amp;amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i0.wp.com/elpasomatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roselia-Aguirre-and-baby-Aide-Moreno.jpg?resize=706%2C530&amp;amp;ssl=1 706w, https://i0.wp.com/elpasomatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roselia-Aguirre-and-baby-Aide-Moreno.jpg?w=2048&amp;amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/elpasomatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roselia-Aguirre-and-baby-Aide-Moreno-1024x768.jpg?w=370&amp;amp;ssl=1 370w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Roselia Aguirre (left) with her daughter Aide Moreno, now 35, who she raised in the El Paso area.

(Courtesy of Aide Moreno)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;To this day, Moreno feels upset about the months of uncertainty that plagued her family as her mother’s health declined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before she got sick, Roselia liked choreographing dances to Spanish-language Christian music for her grandchildren and organizing summer activities for the children at her church in Anthony, Iglesia Novia del Cordero. There were schoolchildren in Canutillo who even called Roselia mom, Moreno remembered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weakened by brain damage and unable to walk on her own after the coma, Roselia began attending physical therapy and taking antifungal medicine – first intravenously, then orally by pills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What damaged my mom more was we didn’t know what it was, so we didn’t know how to treat it,” Moreno said. “Mom felt like she was going crazy… Now I want everyone to know it doesn’t just happen to people living in California, Nevada, Arizona. It’s present here, too.”&lt;/p&gt;	&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A New York hospital has declared a patient cured of sickle-cell anemia, a debilitating genetic disorder that mostly affects individuals of African heritage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Considered to be cured, other genetic treatments have proven successful in reducing or ending the bouts of pain and occasional surgeries that plague the lives of those who suffer from the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cohen Children’s Medical Center said their patient Sebastien Beauzile, 21, is the first New Yorker to have received the breakthrough Lyfgenia treatment, according to the New York Post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developed by Bluebird Bio., Beauzile received the treatment in December of 2024. Since then, the young man has been seemingly cured of the disease which caused him skin ulcers, back pain, hip pain, joint pain, and severe chest pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Growing up with sickle cell, it’s kind of been over all my life,” Sebastien said, &lt;a href="https://www.geneonline.com/gene-therapy-achieves-complete-cure-for-sickle-cell-anemia-in-new-york-patient/"&gt;according to Gene Online&lt;/a&gt;. “So now that I’m cured, I’d say it’s my new birthday, because now nothing’s going to stop me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pgs-dpg-flex" data-pgs-partner-id="good-news-network"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part of a genetic mutation that humans developed to protect themselves against the malaria parasite, sickle cell disease occurs when blood cells, through forming sickle shapes, have trouble reaching the heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Jeffrey Lipton, the center’s director for pediatric hematology, predicts Lyfgenia will replace bone marrow transplants as the primary method for addressing sickle cell anemia, and &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/03/13/us-news/long-island-patient-gets-breakthrough-sickle-cell-treatment-called-a-cure-im-not-in-pain-anymore/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;called&lt;/a&gt; the treatment “a fix.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lygenia takes a sample of the patient’s bone marrow and introduces healthy adult hemoglobin from a donor. Hemoglobin is a protein that helps transport oxygen through the body via red blood cells, and is at the heart of sickle cell disease. Tinkering the two, they are then infused back into the patient’s body, where the donor hemoglobin is gradually coded for rather than the affected hemoglobin of the patient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BEATING DISEASES: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a title="13-year-old Successfully Undergoes World-First Treatment to Cure Rarer-Than-Rare Wild Syndrome" href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/13-year-old-successfully-undergoes-world-first-treatment-to-cure-rarer-than-rare-wild-syndrome/" rel="bookmark"&gt;13-year-old Successfully Undergoes World-First Treatment to Cure Rarer-Than-Rare Wild Syndrome&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sebastien’s recovery has been amazing, and we hope he is just the first of many patients we treat with Lyfgenia,” said Charles Schleien, MD, senior vice president of Cohen Children’s Medical Center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January, &lt;a href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/new-base-editing-gene-therapy-cures-its-first-patient-a-sickle-cell-sufferer-now-in-the-gym-every-day/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;GNN reported that base editing&lt;/a&gt;, another form of gene therapy that, like Lygenia, doesn’t involve the more famous CRISPR technology, was able to seemingly cure 20-year-old Brandon Baptiste, who is now “going to the gym every day, doing cardio and weight lifting.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OTHER CURES: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a title="Cure for Pre-Eclampsia is On Horizon as Researcher Discovers Lipid Nanoparticle to Deliver Directly to Placenta" href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/cure-for-pre-eclampsia-is-on-horizon-as-researcher-discovers-lipid-nanoparticle-to-deliver-directly-to-placenta/" rel="bookmark"&gt;Cure for Pre-Eclampsia is On Horizon as Researcher Discovers Lipid Nanoparticle to Deliver Directly to Placenta&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baptiste became eligible for an experimental trial of base editing called BEACON. By October 2023, after a year of tests to ensure he was physically capable in his diminished state to handle the procedure, it began with a sample of his blood stem cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These were then transferred to a separate facility where the base editing would take place. Using chemotherapy, his team then killed off all the diseased blood stem cells in his bone marrow, after which he was ready to receive his own stem cells back in November.&lt;/p&gt;

ROACH: Our adult daughter was recently diagnosed with COVID psychosis. Evidently, it is so rare that many people, including medical personnel, have never heard of it. She is being held in a mental facility where she is in a manic state most of the time and very psychotic. She is finally taking her medicine, so she seems to be returning back to herself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="BODHXQGRWRC2JBVQSRI4HQIPGY"&gt;Do you have any information on this condition? Is it curable? Will she ever be able to return to her normal existence? They are wanting to release her, but we have yet to talk to any doctor or nurse who can just explain what the prognosis is. -- H.M.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="NMZONIGSUVA5BC5FJ7YCJC5PFY"&gt;ANSWER: Because so many people were diagnosed with COVID, there have been many reports of conditions that occurred after the infection. However, it can be hard to determine whether these happened by chance or whether they were due to the infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="RY3MOJWNYNAJVLEPFP66XBWTXY"&gt;Well-designed studies to determine whether the risk of an outcome is higher after an infection have been done for many conditions, and there are quite a few conditions that a person is clearly at a higher risk for after a bout of COVID-19. These are sometimes called “long COVID” symptoms. However, it isn’t completely clear whether psychosis is related to COVID, although I think it is likely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="XENJZCS2HBFM3JCIA4RYZBVFEA"&gt;Common symptoms of psychosis include hallucinations (often auditory); delusions (fixed, false beliefs); disorganized speech (often tangential to the point where it’s hard to keep track of what they are saying); and disorganized behavior, especially an inability to keep oneself properly dressed and cleaned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="RAXOCEX7ZJBXHKOPGSUP3CL5KA"&gt;I did find a 2023 review of 57 cases of COVID psychosis, two-thirds of whom had never had any symptoms of psychiatric disease before their bout of COVID. (The authors noted that COVID isn’t unique, and other infections such as influenza also have an increased risk of psychosis.) The average range of people with a diagnosis of COVID psychosis was the 40s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="3N63O5TRVRBENODJLAFCEYHDWA"&gt;COVID is known to affect many pathways in the brain through low oxygen levels, inflammation, and an enzyme called ACE2. It is reasonable to think that these changes could result in multiple psychiatric symptoms. As far as a prognosis, over 70% of the cases resulted in a complete recovery, but most people with this condition required antipsychotic drugs. (Though they were able to get off of the drugs.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="FRJI3BUMM5EXNB2XTTLEAU57NY"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-8" class="middleParagraph"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-enter:CKO4P4ZQQVGLJG2F6XF7ROMKAI" data-fusion-component="CKO4P4ZQQVGLJG2F6XF7ROMKAI"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-exit:CKO4P4ZQQVGLJG2F6XF7ROMKAI" data-fusion-component="CKO4P4ZQQVGLJG2F6XF7ROMKAI"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="R4Z5AASXJRBQBHR2KQGEMWQJNA"&gt;DEAR DR. ROACH: In a recent column, you OK’d stevia, which I had heard could negatively impact our microbiomes. I am borderline prediabetic, and I had stopped using stevia accordingly. However, I hate unsweetened coffee. Can you comment on stevia’s impact on our microbiomes in your column? -- M.M.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-10"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="JVTLXJ3ASZHR7N7GPQ6RDRKNUM"&gt;ANSWER: I wish I could give you an answer that everyone would agree with, but the literature is conflicting. I found a well-done trial from 2024 showing that there were no significant changes in the microbiome (a term for the whole complex array of bacteria and other tiny life forms in our intestines) among volunteers taking five drops of stevia twice daily for 12 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-11"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="PS5KNCAQLBAKXNZ3ESE4FZUAEA"&gt;Another study (from before the trial) showed increased diversity in a laboratory model, which is generally a good thing. Finally, a 2022 analysis of all trials found no evidence of harm to the microbiome. Based on this, I think it unlikely that stevia has a serious adverse effect on the microbiome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-12"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="EIWVWHWDMFATFGGNHLUHA4FLS4"&gt;Multiple studies have found that sugar has adverse effects on the microbiome, so if your main concerns are diabetes and your microbiome, the evidence at the present time supports stevia rather than sugar in your coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-13"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="KVF24K3KTZDAFKOSBLDSBTYRO4"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dr. Roach regrets that he is unable to answer individual letters, but will incorporate them in the column whenever possible.

Before that, the reflux was so bad it was going into my Eustachian tubes like a volcano and setting my ears on fire. I thought I was exploding. At that point, I was taking Prilosec twice a day with no relief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="MG6V2ZM7YBDCNEZ7E6YDIWPUPU"&gt;When my symptoms first began, I tried drinking water and not eating to avoid the horrible reflux. That didn’t work, so I turned to grape juice and was disappointed again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="OAW3VR6FBFDDVILFWDWGUXNKSY"&gt;Dexilant saved me. My doctor said it would reduce the risk of Barrett’s esophagus turning into cancer. Recently the reflux has returned somewhat, and I would welcome any suggestions on managing it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="76AUVM76ONBQBDVHOXDN6DWXK4"&gt;&lt;b&gt;A.&lt;/b&gt; Barrett’s esophagus is a condition in which the cells lining the swallowing tube (esophagus) change to more closely resemble cells in the intestines. There is an increased risk for esophageal cancer if these cells continue to be exposed to stomach acid splashing up into the esophagus. However, the increased risk is modest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="HVHFVCBY65AZVFIMEGZDQQJDPI"&gt;Taking Prilosec (omeprazole) with grape juice is not ideal, because grape juice reduces the amount of omeprazole that can get into the bloodstream (Frontiers in Pharmacology, Dec. 4, 2024). The authors of this study warn that when people have conditions that require treatment with omeprazole, they should avoid drinking a glass of grape juice every day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="CV5MMLFJS5F7HDLPQ553KF4J3E"&gt;We do not know if grape juice might interact with Dexilant (dexlansoprazole). However, the intestines employ some of the same enzymes to metabolize these drugs, so we can’t rule that possibility out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-6" class="middleParagraph"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="DF3DQP72CFDCVM3K4SJYNGEDC4"&gt;You will find many lifestyle measures for managing heartburn in our “eGuide to Overcoming Digestive Disorders.” This online resource is located under the Health eGuide tab at &lt;a href="https://www.PeoplesPharmacy.com" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.PeoplesPharmacy.com"&gt;www.PeoplesPharmacy.com.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-enter:LNLEL3DNLBDJ5CKZZJJ6WNDNUU" data-fusion-component="LNLEL3DNLBDJ5CKZZJJ6WNDNUU"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-exit:LNLEL3DNLBDJ5CKZZJJ6WNDNUU" data-fusion-component="LNLEL3DNLBDJ5CKZZJJ6WNDNUU"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="XGURVYUN6VAFLJBTB2HBSBKTVM"&gt;* * * &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="DHWHNI32IRFSBHG3FVQIYBB2PQ"&gt;In their column, Joe and Teresa Graedon answer letters from readers.

You could just be short on sleep, or you could have a vitamin deficiency (or something else entirely!).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin D is talked about a lot because it affects so many parts of the body. “Vitamin D plays a crucial role in bone health and immune function,” says &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/vinguyenatl/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Elizabeth Vi Nguyen, Pharm.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Elizabeth Vi Nguyen, Pharm.D.&lt;/a&gt;, a clinical pharmacist at &lt;a href="https://www.cedars-sinai.org/med-pros/pharmacy.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Cedars-Sinai;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Cedars-Sinai&lt;/a&gt;.

Pay attention to your body and if you experience any of the symptoms mentioned below, ask your doctor if your vitamin D levels should be tested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Symptoms&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Studies have suggested links between vitamin D deficiency and certain health problems, including &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37852593/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:depression;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5359504/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:fractures;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;fractures&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9671203/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:diabetes;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2851242/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:heart disease;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/diet/vitamin-d-fact-sheet" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:cancer;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://ccforum.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13054-014-0660-4" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:infection;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;infection&lt;/a&gt;,” says Nguyen.

Here are some potential culprits:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lack of foods that contain vitamin D in one’s diet&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Low synthesis of vitamin D from ultraviolet rays&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conditions that make it difficult for the body to absorb vitamin D (such as small bowel disease or pancreatic insufficiency)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conditions that make it difficult for the body to convert certain compounds into the active form of vitamin D (like cirrhosis)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medications that make it difficult for the body to absorb or convert vitamin D (including some used to treat seizures, high cholesterol and weight loss)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Risk factors&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;People are more likely to develop a vitamin D deficiency if they:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don’t get much sun (or are diligent about sun protection)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have darker skin&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are older&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have extra body weight&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Follow a vegan diet&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have a condition that makes it difficult to absorb nutrients (including Crohn’s disease, celiac disease or a history of bypass surgery)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have a condition that makes it difficult to synthesize vitamin D (such as liver or kidney problems)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are a breastfed infant&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diagnosis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A simple blood test can measure the amount of 25-hydroxyvitamin D you have circulating in your body. “However, the &lt;a href="https://www.endocrine.org/clinical-practice-guidelines/vitamin-d-for-prevention-of-disease" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Endocrine Society;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Endocrine Society&lt;/a&gt; no longer endorses specific levels to define vitamin D sufficiency, insufficiency and deficiency due to lack of defined levels and outcomes,” says Nguyen. “Routine testing is not necessary for everyone and is reserved for those who are at high risk for deficiency.” If you think you’re at risk, mention it to your doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Treatment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Management of vitamin D deficiency depends on individual factors but typically involves a combination of food and supplements because most patients do not get enough vitamin D from food or sun exposure alone,” says Nguyen. If you suspect you could benefit from a boost of vitamin D, consult with your doctor before you start taking a supplement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Vitamin D3&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link athena-button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B006H9T5YK?tag=syn-yahoo-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5Bartid%7C10055.a.64245175%5Bsrc%7Cyahoo-us" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:$20.99 at amazon.com;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;$20.99 at amazon.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Vitamin D3 Softgels&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link athena-button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002QO00YO?tag=syn-yahoo-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5Bartid%7C10055.a.64245175%5Bsrc%7Cyahoo-us" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:$6.14 at amazon.com;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;$6.14 at amazon.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Vitamin D3&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link athena-button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004XLRTUQ?tag=syn-yahoo-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5Bartid%7C10055.a.64245175%5Bsrc%7Cyahoo-us" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:$10.98 at amazon.com;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;$10.98 at amazon.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Extra Strength Vitamin D3 Softgels&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link athena-button" href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/hearstcorp_9eb67_ghk?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F3006986%2F565706%2F9383%3Fveh%3Daff%26sourceid%3Dimp_000011112222333344%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.walmart.com%252Fip%252FKirkland-Signature-Extra-Strength-Vitamin-D3-600-Softgels%252F919995094%26subId1%3Dghk%7C&amp;amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.goodhousekeeping.com%2Fhealth%2Fa64245175%2Fsigns-of-vitamin-d-deficiency%2F&amp;amp;utm_source=yahoo-us&amp;amp;utm_campaign=65&amp;amp;utm_medium=syn" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:$14.95 at walmart.com;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;$14.95 at walmart.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Vitamin D-3&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link athena-button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003OS9P4C?tag=syn-yahoo-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5Bartid%7C10055.a.64245175%5Bsrc%7Cyahoo-us" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:$7.33 at amazon.com;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;$7.33 at amazon.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Adults 1000IU 365 Drops&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link athena-button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003IGDLB8?tag=syn-yahoo-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5Bartid%7C10055.a.64245175%5Bsrc%7Cyahoo-us" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:$21.98 at amazon.com;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;$21.98 at amazon.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other FAQs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When is the best time to take vitamin D?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin, it’s best to &lt;a href="https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/health/a43893459/best-time-to-take-vitamin-d/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:take it with food;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;take it with food&lt;/a&gt;, so the fat in the food can make it easier for your body to absorb. You might also want to take it with calcium or foods that contain calcium because “vitamin D helps the body absorb calcium, and they are frequently taken together to help build and maintain muscle and bone health,” says Nguyen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How much vitamin D should you take?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-HealthProfessional/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA);elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA)&lt;/a&gt; for healthy people age1 to 70 years old is 15 mcg (600 IU) per day. For infants, the RDA is 10 mcg (400 IU) and for people older than 70, it’s 20 mcg (800 IU) daily. Of course, before you pop a pill, you have to consider how much vitamin D you’re already getting from the food you eat. For instance, if you’re already getting 10 mcg from your diet, then you might only need to supplement 5 mcg. As with any supplement, it’s best to ask your doctor and follow their recommendation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can you take too much vitamin D?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes! High levels of vitamin D can lead to nausea, vomiting, low appetite, constipation, weakness and weight loss while “very” high levels can damage kidneys, cause confusion and trigger an irregular heartbeat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the best food sources of vitamin D?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Very few &lt;a href="https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/health/diet-nutrition/a36096366/high-vitamin-d-foods/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:foods naturally contain vitamin D;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;foods naturally contain vitamin D&lt;/a&gt;,” says Nguyen. That’s why people often need to lean on supplements to get enough in their bodies. However, oily fish (such as salmon, mackerel and herrings) and dairy products fortified with vitamin D are dietary sources, according to Nguyen. Mushrooms, eggs and fortified cereal and soy drinks are good options as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can you get vitamin D from sun exposure?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, when skin is exposed to ultraviolet rays it triggers the body to begin a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25207357/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:process that creates vitamin D;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;process that creates vitamin D&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s not a good idea to depend on the sun for your supply of the vitamin. “Relying exclusively on sunshine exposure to meet vitamin D needs is not advisable due to unreliability and potential harm,” says Nguyen.

I’m an oncologist and a cancer epidemiologist, which means I investigate patterns and causes of cancers. As &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/01/12/alcohol-consumption-industry/" target="_blank"&gt;more Americans drink less&lt;/a&gt;, one question that has come up is whether casual drinking, or drinking alcohol infrequently, increases cancer risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-subscribe-cta" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="HBHN2SYTVNGSNPHETMMSPUJSSM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The answer is “probably,” though at a very low level. Cancer risk is not binary: Having one drink, or smoking one cigarette, will not cause cancer. In general, the more you’re exposed to a risk factor, the higher your likelihood of developing cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="SXKR6HA7ZZFGTH7T5KK2XMFAKM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The data have &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-84181-1" target="_blank"&gt;clearly shown&lt;/a&gt; that your risk for cancer increases the more you drink, and the best way to eliminate your risk of alcohol-related cancers is to stop drinking. Personally, I keep my alcohol intake to no more than one or two drinks per week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="VH6X4TJJJZBNHMA4KF7CISI2JA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In January, when the surgeon general released an &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/surgeongeneral/reports-and-publications/alcohol-cancer/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;advisory about alcohol and cancer risk&lt;/a&gt;, some people I know eliminated or reduced their own alcohol intake, while others scrutinized the data on which the advisory was based.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="5RUJSBZUDJH4PGESBZ46V22YD4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;To help you make your own decisions about alcohol, I &lt;a href="https://www.cebm.ox.ac.uk/resources/ebm-tools/critical-appraisal-tools" target="_blank"&gt;critically appraised&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;the&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;scientific research on alcohol and cancer risk — which&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;sounds negative but is actually a formal, systematic approach to evaluate the quality of scientific research. Here are three key takeaways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="WMR4IH65FRCNXNJKGYMGOV4QYY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Several cancers — but not all of them — have been linked to drinking.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="KYUM7NIHQZF43OOCYQRQ5OGUBM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Alcohol consumption has been linked to cancers of the oral cavity, throat, voice box, esophagus, breast, colon and rectum, and liver. In the report, the surgeon general said that the risk for certain cancers may start to increase with one or fewer drinks per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="MRHETKAG75CVDGE6XMLTGCVCCQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;One &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/ije/article/45/3/916/2572556" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; that is cited in the advisory asked whether alcohol consumption increases risk of two types of breast cancer. The answer is “yes” to both — with a 35 percent increased risk for estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer and a 28 percent increased risk for estrogen receptor-negative breast cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="XWI7CZTQQFBDHAWF7P67476NF4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But it is much less clear whether increased alcohol intake is &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24986108/" target="_blank"&gt;associated&lt;/a&gt; with some other cancers, such as leukemia. So, when a patient asks me whether alcohol consumption causes cancer, the answer must go beyond “yes” or “no.” For some cancers, the answer is “no” or “we don’t think so,” but for others, the research clearly indicates the answer is “yes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ZN5AYRWXZNHZDBYJNI7H3JV55U" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Researchers can’t tell people to start drinking for the sake of science.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ERDF6HOTNBEINPXXONY2T7GZXQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The “&lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(15)60742-5/fulltext" target="_blank"&gt;gold standard&lt;/a&gt;” for study designs are randomized controlled trials, in which some people are randomly assigned to one intervention, others to another intervention, and then outcomes between the two groups are compared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="46KQHSNJM5AW5B5MR5RW5XUMKE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;For most epidemiological research, this ideal study design is impossible and may be unethical. For example, in the study looking at alcohol and breast cancer risk, over 26,000 women with breast cancer were included from a variety of other studies looking at diet and health outcomes, in which alcohol intake was assessed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="EH5IDMC52JGNPMLAINCQKWUIU4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;It would have been unethical to design a study in which women were randomized to drink a lot of alcohol or none at all, to then determine who developed breast cancer, and it would take decades to answer the question.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ECL5U2CQEJFOBJCLWDMFVGNQPY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;So for this type of epidemiological question, a so-called &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/cohort-study" target="_blank"&gt;cohort study&lt;/a&gt;, in which a group of people with a common characteristic (women who drink alcohol) is followed over time for a particular outcome (breast cancer), is the best path forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="LEKR7JNOQBD37CJCDNOOMZ7LRY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Multiple studies have reached the same conclusion. But unanswered questions remain.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="LUNTE267BVDW3MIBKA5CEGOE7U" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;When critically appraising the quality of studies, epidemiologists analyze individual studies within the context of the larger scientific evidence. And when it comes to alcohol, what we do know — after multiple studies in hundreds of thousands of people reaching the same conclusion — is that alcohol is a risk factor for certain cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="FCWYOVPJ6ZHX5J76PZYAWWOY7U" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But that doesn’t mean the data are perfect. One&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4453639/" target="_blank"&gt; study&lt;/a&gt; cited in the surgeon general’s advisory included over 485,000 cancer cases from more than 500 other studies looking at several cancer types. If you take a closer look at the included studies, some information was collected in real time, but some was retrospective, which may be prone to errors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="SSTZDFYAERGDLGVA44WPK7PQAU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Imagine if you had cancer and someone asked you, on average over your entire life, how much alcohol you drank each week. How accurate would your estimate be? Some might undercount their intake, while others might overcount.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="UMQM2H7P7VCURLENJGR4ERLNSY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Now let’s explore how the amount of &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/alcohol/standard-drink-sizes/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;drinking was defined&lt;/a&gt;. Light drinking was approximately one glass of beer, wine, or alcohol per day or less; moderate was less than four drinks daily; and heavy was more than four drinks daily. For some cancers, such as esophageal and breast, the cancer risk was higher for light, moderate and heavy drinkers, compared to nondrinkers. But for others, such as colorectal, the risk was higher only for moderate and heavy drinkers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="TPF5Z2YTTFB6JKFR2IID3LNAGY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Some of the included studies defined light, moderate and heavy drinking differently, so the investigators sometimes had to average alcohol intake reported in those studies to include them in their analyses. Additionally, there was no distinction between types of alcohol intake and cancer risks, leaving open the question of whether cancer risk is similar for people who drink wine and those who drink hard liquor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="76HVKLRXJNBQ7J5E5ZJB2OGJUY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Finally, let’s consider the scene. Do people tend to enjoy a glass of wine before dinner? Or do they drink beer at a bar while consuming a cheeseburger with fries? Or maybe smoke a pack of cigarettes with their whiskey? If it’s one of the latter two scenarios, the food and the smoking may contribute to cancer as much or more than the alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="JETLGYJH3JDCDCAD2WSYFHNJNU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Even taking into consideration all of these factors affecting study quality, the totality of the data point to alcohol causing cancer. Less alcohol is better, and each of us must determine our own tolerance for cancer risk when deciding how much alcohol to drink.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="CDUNFBICXBFB7CFM33CCURKZGY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mikkael A.

Nor did he envision that the scientist, Dr. &lt;a href="https://www.aai.org/About/History/Past-Presidents-and-Officers/JohnFEnders" target="_blank"&gt;John Enders&lt;/a&gt;, would one day become his own mentor, opening the door to a remarkable career in science for Miller as well.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Enders conducted this extraordinary research at Boston Children’s Hospital (then known as Children’s Hospital Medical Center) in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Miller was in his senior year at Harvard Medical School in 1961 when he was introduced to Enders. A few years before, Enders had won the &lt;a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/1954/enders/facts/" target="_blank"&gt;Nobel Prize&lt;/a&gt; for trailblazing work that allowed &lt;a href="https://www.salk.edu/about/history-of-salk/jonas-salk/" target="_blank"&gt;Jonas Salk&lt;/a&gt; to develop a vaccine against another childhood scourge: polio.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Thanks to Enders’ work on vaccines, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;measles,&lt;/a&gt; one of the world’s most contagious viruses, was declared eliminated in the United States in 2000. And yet today, it is making a resurgence: More than 370 confirmed cases have been reported this year in 17 states, with most of them, at least 309, from an &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025" target="_blank"&gt;outbreak in Texas&lt;/a&gt; where nearly all were either unvaccinated or their vaccination status is unknown.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="" class="image | relative margin_bottom_16

Then in 1949, Enders and colleagues Frederick Robbins and Thomas Weller successfully grew the polio virus by pioneering a technique that made it much easier and faster to reproduce viruses than had been used by scientists.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Shortly after, Jonas Salk used the Enders’ team technique to create the polio vaccine now widely associated with Salk, which was licensed in 1955.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;By then, Enders' team, working to build on their colleagues’ success with polio, had &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19198559/" target="_blank"&gt;isolated the measles virus&lt;/a&gt; from a schoolboy, David Edmonston, from a 1954 outbreak in a boarding school near Boston. They used a method similar to the one Enders employed in his Nobel-winning polio work to grow measles virus in tissue in the lab.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;A front-page 1959 Boston Globe headline captured the excitement of the measles breakthrough. “Safe, Effective Measles Vaccine Found in Tests on Children Here,” proclaimed the story, which said that adult volunteers at Children’s Hospital took the vaccine before it was tried on 11 Boston-area children. After further successful trials, a September 1961 New York Times article declared, “Dr. Enders' second triumph over a major disease will be hailed everywhere as one of the greatest achievements of medicine.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;And yet, even when Miller first met Enders&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;in 1961, the lab at Children’s still occupied four rooms in an old building in Longwood Medical Area.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The measles vaccine would be licensed two years later, and the vaccine available today contains the same strain of virus isolated by the Enders team so many decades ago.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;Enders’ technique for growing viruses made it possible for many scientists to later develop other common vaccines on a large scale.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Years later, after Enders' death in 1985, Miller was going through his late mentor’s papers and discovered a&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;trove of letters from pharmaceutical companies asking for batches of the measles virus to help them create additional measles vaccines. Enders and his colleagues, Miller learned, were just giving away copies of the virus, mailing samples to help out other scientists.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“There wasn’t the era of intellectual property,” Miller said. “They didn’t harvest any money from measles or from the polio.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Enders, a modest man with a magnetic personality, an unquenchable curiosity, and a penchant for wearing vests, was affectionately called “Chief” by his lab colleagues. He was thrifty by nature, packing his lunch daily, but was known to lavish time on his students, asking about their lives, as well as their research. Miller bonded with him over their shared passion for fishing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="" class="image | relative margin_bottom_16

That, and the country’s launch in 1964 of a military draft for its expanding war in Vietnam, inspired Miller to enroll in an alternative: a program at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to help vaccinate thousands of children against measles in Panama and Africa.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“It’s the story of my life,” Miller said of his opportunity to use a vaccine his mentor created to vaccinate so many children against a disease often lethal in developing countries.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;His time in Panama’s remote Veraguas province stands out.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“You had to take a horse up there. The roads weren’t passable,” he said. “We’d show up at this site that had been established for vaccination against measles. And these mothers would come with their babies. They may have walked for three days to get it.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Miller returned to Enders lab in the late 1960s for about three years of post-doctoral research working on the Epstein-Barr virus, a common virus that causes mononucleosis or “mono.” At Enders' suggestion, Miller coaxed the virus to grow indefinitely in a cell and then demonstrated that such an “immortalized” Epstein-Barr virus can turn cancerous, paving the way for researchers today who are linking some viruses to cancer, such as the &lt;a href="https://www.cancercenter.com/risk-factors/viruses-and-cancer" target="_blank"&gt;human papillomaviruses, or HPV, link&lt;/a&gt; to cervical cancer, or Hepatitis B and liver cancer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Soon after, Miller was recruited to Yale School of Medicine, where his groundbreaking Epstein-Barr research continues to fuel his life’s work.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="" class="image | relative margin_bottom_16

More&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="expanded-caption"&gt; for specific activities an individual wants to be able to do when they turn 100.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/fbs-accordion&gt;&lt;small&gt;SXSW Conference &amp;amp; Festivals via Getty Images&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Longevity is measured in years lived. But what truly matters is healthspan—how long we maintain strength, mobility, and independence. That’s the foundation of physician, author and popular podcaster Dr. Peter Attia’s &lt;a class="color-link" href="https://longevity.stanford.edu/lifestyle/2024/07/02/how-to-build-your-own-centenarian-decathlon/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://longevity.stanford.edu/lifestyle/2024/07/02/how-to-build-your-own-centenarian-decathlon/" aria-label="Centenarian Decathlon"&gt;Centenarian Decathlon&lt;/a&gt;, a deliberate approach to fitness that trains for the future, ensuring we not only live longer but better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="article_paragraph_2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is Peter Attia’s Centenarian Decathlon?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A centenarian is 100 years old or more. A decathlon is a track and field event consisting of ten separate events. The Centenarian Decathlon is a structured plan to train for the ten key actions or activities a person wants to be able to do at that age. Rather than simply hoping to stay active, the Centenarian Decathlon asks: What do you want to be able to do when you’re 100?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether it’s lifting a suitcase into an overhead bin or hiking a steep trail, the idea is to train today for abilities you’ll need decades from now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attia, a longevity expert, explores this concept in his bestseller Outlive and on his &lt;a class="color-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NivjpZ0VBro" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NivjpZ0VBro" aria-label="podcast"&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt;. Drawing from scientific research and personal experience, Attia outlines four pillars of longevity-focused exercise: aerobic efficiency (Zone 2 training), peak aerobic output (VO2 max), strength, and stability. Training deliberately within these categories may just redefine aging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="vestpocket nsO6K"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What Happends When We Age Poorly&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For most, aging is synonymous with decline—loss of mobility, frailty, and withdrawal from daily activities. The final decade of life, which Attia calls the marginal decade, is often marked by severe physical deterioration. But this decline isn’t just due to genetics, it’s the result of decades of poor preparation for old age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exercise is often seen as a short-term pursuit—for weight loss, athletic performance, or general fitness. Attia’s approach suggests training for longevity requires a different mindset: reverse-engineering what you want to be able to do in your 80s and 90s and systematically building those abilities today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="fbs-ad--nativeinbody-d-wrapper fbs-ad--progressive"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Training for the Future: The Centenarian Decathlon&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Centenarian Decathlon is a tactical approach to aging that involves a personalized set of physical tasks typically falling into two categories:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="article_paragraph_7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Activities of daily living (ADLs): Things like picking up groceries, carrying a grandchild, climbing stairs, or getting up off the floor unassisted.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Recreational activities: Hobbies and sports people want to continue doing, such as golfing, swimming, hiking, or biking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For every patient, the ten activities may be different. In &lt;em&gt;Outlive&lt;/em&gt;, Attia describes meeting with patients to determine their personal list and developing a strategic, long-term training plan focused on four domains:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;1. Zone 2 Training (Aerobic Efficiency)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zone 2 training is low-intensity endurance exercise, such as brisk walking, cycling, or swimming at a pace where you can still hold a conversation but feel slightly challenged. This type of training improves mitochondrial function and metabolic efficiency, which are critical for long-term health. It can also help with &lt;a class="color-link" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jessepines/2025/03/04/effective-exercises-for-better-sleep/" data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/jessepines/2025/03/04/effective-exercises-for-better-sleep/" target="_self" aria-label="sleep"&gt;sleep&lt;/a&gt; which is critical to brain health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Centenarian Decathlon Goal&lt;/strong&gt;: Maintain the ability to walk three miles comfortably and sustain low-intensity movement for extended periods without exhaustion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2. VO2 Max (Peak Aerobic Performance)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VO2 max, a measure of maximal oxygen consumption, is one of the &lt;a class="color-link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36069964/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36069964/" aria-label="strongest predictors"&gt;strongest predictors&lt;/a&gt; of longevity. Training VO2 max requires high-intensity interval training (HIIT), pushing the cardiovascular system to its limits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your VO2 max is measured in &lt;a class="color-link" href="https://www.omnicalculator.com/sports/vo2-max" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.omnicalculator.com/sports/vo2-max" aria-label="several ways"&gt;several ways&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Lab testing (gold standard) using a treadmill or stationary bike with a mask.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Rockport Walking Test – Walk a mile as fast as possible, record the time and heart rate, and use a formula to estimate VO2 max.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Cooper Test – Run as far as possible in 12 minutes and use the distance to calculate VO2 max.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Wearables which are less accurate but useful for tracking trends.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Importantly, according to the American College of Sports Medicine, older individuals (men ≥45, women ≥55) and those at higher risk should be cleared by a doctor before engaging in vigorous activity like HIIT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Centenarian Decathlon Goal&lt;/strong&gt;: Maintain a VO2 max above 30 mL/kg/min in later life, allowing for activities like hiking uphill, jogging, or carrying groceries without fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3. Strength Training&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strength is also one of the most predictive markers of longevity. As people age, they naturally lose muscle. This contributes to frailty, falls, and loss of independence. This decline accelerates in the 50s, 60s, and beyond, making resistance training one of the most effective interventions to preserve function and mobility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attia recommends compound movements like squats, deadlifts, and lunges to build full-body strength and improve balance. In addition, explosive exercises like sprinting and &lt;a class="color-link" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jessepines/2025/03/21/why-to-start-skipping-today-according-to-the-huberman-lab-podcast/" data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/jessepines/2025/03/21/why-to-start-skipping-today-according-to-the-huberman-lab-podcast/" target="_self" aria-label="skipping"&gt;skipping&lt;/a&gt; help retain fast-twitch muscle fibers, crucial for power and reaction time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Centenarian Decathlon Goal&lt;/strong&gt;: Maintain the ability to lift and carry a 30-pound suitcase or to be able to get up off the ground without assistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;4. Stability and Mobility&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Falls are one of the leading causes of disability in older adults, often resulting in fractures, hospitalizations, and loss of independence. To mitigate this risk, balance and stability training should be a core component of any longevity-focused fitness routine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exercises like single-leg stands, walking backward, and functional core movements improve coordination, balance, and postural control. Additionally, mobility work (e.g. the “&lt;a class="color-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CiWQ2IvY34" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CiWQ2IvY34" aria-label="world’s greatest stretch"&gt;world’s greatest stretch&lt;/a&gt;" and dynamic movement drills (e.g. leg swings), keeps joints supple and prevents stiffness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Centenarian Decathlon Goal&lt;/strong&gt;: Balance on one leg for at least 30 seconds or move freely without stiffness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Minimum Effective Dose For Training&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A common question: &lt;em&gt;How much exercise is really needed? &lt;/em&gt;Attia recommends a minimum recommended weekly exercise regimen for longevity:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;1 hour of Zone 2 training (steady-state cardio)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;1 hour of strength training (resistance exercises)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;20-30 minutes of VO2 max training (high-intensity intervals)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;10 minutes daily of stability/mobility exercises&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those short on time, something is always better than nothing. Even just three hours per week can significantly reduce the risk of chronic disease and the mobility decline that occurs with old age. Additionally, exercising more than this minimum can achieve better results, up to a point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What makes the Centenarian Decathlon different from a traditional approach to fitness is its long-term perspective. Instead of training for aesthetics or short-term performance, people can think of every workout as an investment in their future. Ultimately, the Centenarian Decathlon isn’t just a fitness program—it’s a blueprint for aging with strength, independence, and vitality.&lt;/p&gt;

Around 85% of mental health tech startups are still in the early development stages, a much higher percentage than in the general health tech sector, where 65% are in the early stages.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="e80fj" data-offset-key="djj64-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="djj64-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="djj64-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;By comparison, only 60% of companies are in early development across the entire Israeli tech ecosystem.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="e80fj" data-offset-key="euk6h-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="euk6h-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="euk6h-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;This early-stage focus also means most of the companies are small.

Another 25% have between 11 and 50 employees, and just 10% have grown to more than 50.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="e80fj" data-offset-key="31c6u-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="31c6u-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="31c6u-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;To make the mental health tech landscape easier to understand, the team divided the sector into four categories: self-care, managed care platforms, workflow automation and mental health research.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="e80fj" data-offset-key="61vvb-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="61vvb-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="61vvb-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Self-care refers to tools that help individuals manage their mental well-being. These include biofeedback devices, peer-support apps and AI-guided therapy platforms that offer structure and coping tools.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="e80fj" data-offset-key="cdddo-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="cdddo-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="cdddo-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;One example is Dugri, a digital platform that provides structured, anonymous peer support.

It’s an AI-based mental health platform rooted in cognitive behavioral therapy and positive psychology. The company works with Israeli universities to support thousands of reservists. Another company, GrayMatters Health, uses brain-computer interface tech to help people with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) regulate brain activity by targeting biomarkers linked to the amygdala.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="e80fj" data-offset-key="c08dq-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="c08dq-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="c08dq-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Workflow automation tools aim to ease clinicians’ administrative load, allowing them to focus more on therapy and less on paperwork. This is especially important in Israel, where the mental health system has long been underfunded. According to the Health Ministry, there is only one public-sector psychiatrist for every 11,705 people.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="e80fj" data-offset-key="b3fj-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="b3fj-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="b3fj-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;“Automation tools help streamline services, reducing wait times and allowing clinicians to focus on treatment rather than administration,” the report explained. “AI-driven automation solutions also ensure that individuals in crisis receive timely interventions, making the system more efficient and effective.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="e80fj" data-offset-key="3t8if-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="3t8if-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="3t8if-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;One company leading this area is Eleos Health. Its AI platform automatically captures key moments in therapy sessions and generates clinical documentation, streamlining workflows and helping therapists reduce symptoms faster. Eleos is among the most advanced mental health startups in Israel. According to Startup Nation Central, it has raised $128 million to date, including $60 million in a Series C round in January 2025.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="e80fj" data-offset-key="3d7a0-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="3d7a0-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="3d7a0-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Mental health research is the final category. This field focuses on early diagnosis, personalized psychiatry and machine learning tools that improve diagnosis accuracy, predict patient response to treatment and tailor care to the individual.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="e80fj" data-offset-key="72e6q-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="72e6q-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="72e6q-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;One company in this space is NeuroKaire, which uses patients’ blood cells to create brain models. These lab-grown neurons allow medications to be tested outside the body, offering a faster, more precise way to treat PTSD, depression and anxiety.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="e80fj" data-offset-key="bp93t-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="bp93t-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="bp93t-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Tolub said the idea for iCAR—Israel Collective Action for Resilience—came after the war when it became clear that trauma care in Israel was fragmented. Even patients struggling to find help didn’t know where to turn.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure data-block="true" data-editor="e80fj" data-offset-key="59gbm-0-0" contenteditable="false"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="e80fj" data-offset-key="8ft5j-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="8ft5j-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="8ft5j-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Beyond that, Israel still lacks national protocols for mental health or trauma healing. And today, with nearly 10 million people affected by some form of trauma simply by living through October 7 and the ongoing seven-front war, iCAR saw an urgent need to accelerate recovery efforts.

&lt;p&gt;In the near future, drug injections could be less painful and less frequent.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Many medications, like contraceptives or treatments for chronic conditions, require regular, painful injections. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;MIT engineers have developed a new, less painful drug delivery system using injectable crystal suspensions. These crystals form a long-lasting “depot” under the skin, releasing medication over months or years, and reducing the need for frequent injections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="body-content true    body-medium-medium  t-text-text-secondary"&gt;&lt;div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We showed that we can have very controlled, sustained delivery, likely for multiple months and even years through a small needle,” said Giovanni Traverso, an associate professor of mechanical engineering at MIT.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-drug-depot-under-skin"&gt;Drug depot under skin&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This research focuses on developing improved contraceptive options for women, especially in developing nations. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some injectable suspensions exist, but they are short-acting. Other long-lasting injectable depots require high concentrations of polymers, making them difficult to inject. This new development aims to address these limitations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The objective was to produce a drug delivery system that could be administered via a thin needle and provide sustained release for six months to two years.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For the development, the team used levonorgestrel, a crystal-forming contraceptive. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It was found that suspending it in biocompatible benzyl benzoate solvent allowed the crystals to form a compact, long-lasting implant after injection. This acted like a self-assembling drug depot under the skin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="body-content true    body-medium-medium  t-text-text-secondary"&gt;&lt;div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers discovered that the solvent’s inability to mix with bodily fluids is key for the drug &lt;a href="https://interestingengineering.com/health/wireless-patch-drug-delivery-system" rel="dofollow"&gt;cryst&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://interestingengineering.com/health/wireless-patch-drug-delivery-system" target="_blank" rel="dofollow"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://interestingengineering.com/health/wireless-patch-drug-delivery-system" rel="dofollow"&gt;ls&lt;/a&gt; to clump together and form a long-lasting drug reservoir (depot) beneath the skin post-injection.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This method enables easier injection through a thin needle.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The solvent is critical because it allows you to inject the fluid through a small needle, but once in place, the crystals self-assemble into a drug depot,” Traverso added. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-shows-promise-in-rats"&gt;Shows promise in rats &lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So how does it work? Researchers can control how quickly the drug is released from the implanted depot by changing its density. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They demonstrated this control by adding small amounts of a biodegradable polymer, polycaprolactone, to the drug formulation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“By incorporating a very small amount of polymers — less than 1.6 percent by weight — we can modulate the drug release rate, extending its duration while maintaining injectability. This demonstrates the tunability of our system, which can be engineered to accommodate a broader range of contraceptive needs as well as tailored dosing regimens for other therapeutic applications,” said Sanghyun Park, MIT graduate student.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="body-content true    body-medium-medium  t-text-text-secondary"&gt;&lt;div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In rat studies, the injected drug depots proved stable and released medication steadily for three months.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With 85% of the drug remaining after this period, the results indicate the depots could potentially provide drug release for significantly longer durations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If necessary, these compact drug depots can be surgically extracted to halt the treatment before full drug depletion.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The benefits include minimized pain, reduced injection frequency, and consistent &lt;a href="https://interestingengineering.com/health/healthcare-targeted-drug-delivery" target="_blank" rel="dofollow"&gt;drug delivery&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We anticipate that the depots could last for more than a year, based on our post-analysis of preclinical data. Follow-up studies are underway to further validate their efficacy beyond this initial proof-of-concept,” added Park in the &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1077654?" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;press release.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers believe this drug delivery method could be applied to treat various conditions, including neuropsychiatric disorders, HIV, and tuberculosis. They are now conducting further preclinical studies to prepare for human trials, focusing on how the drug depot assembles in realistic skin

denunciation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“Generally, people are weak, lazy,” said Vic Mellor, an activist based near Sarasota, and a close ally of former Trump national security adviser Michael Flynn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Mellor owns the We the People &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/health" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt; and Wellness Center in nearby Venice. Mellor, in a shirt that shouts “VIOLENCE MIGHT BE THE ANSWER”, is a self-professed attendee of the January 6 insurrection at the US Capitol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“And that lazy part just makes them ignorant … Covid has proven that obviously this is true. I mean, all the facts are starting to come out on Covid now – that it was a hoax. That is just an extension of where this hoax began decades earlier with the vaccines, OK? This is all a money grab, this is all a power grab.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-nyoej5"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 22 14" class="dcr-scql1j"&gt;&lt;path d="M5.255 0h4.75c-.572 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941H0C.792 9.104 2.44 4.53 5.255 0Zm11.061 0H21c-.506 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941h-8.686c.902-4.837 2.485-9.411 5.3-13.941Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;blockquote class="dcr-zzndwp"&gt;This is not an isolated, rural, religious community.

Where he once opposed only the Covid-19 shots, he now opposes vaccines entirely – arguing they harm children despite experts on vaccines considering them one of mankind’s greatest medical achievements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“This is not an isolated, rural, religious community, which I think is what a lot of people associate with an anti-vaccine mentality,” said Kathryn Olivarius, author of Necropolis: Disease, Power, and Capitalism in the Cotton Kingdom, and historian of disease at Stanford University. “This is in the heart of everything.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Sarasota has become a &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/style/power/interactive/2023/sarasota-maga-dream/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;proving ground&lt;/a&gt; for the Maga right. Among nail salons, mom-and-pop Cuban restaurants and roadside motels lining US 41, known locally as the Tamiami Trail, a visitor can find the gates of New College. This was once a public university prized for its progressive liberal arts education. Now it is part of the new conservative experiment in remaking higher education led by &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/11/new-college-of-florida-rightwing-takeover" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;activists&lt;/a&gt; aligned with Donald Trump and the Republican Florida governor, Ron DeSantis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Along the same road is the Sarasota memorial hospital, an aberration in American healthcare – it is publicly owned with open board elections. The normally sleepy election became contentious when insurgent &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/12/21/1144798353/in-florida-health-freedom-activists-exert-influence-over-a-major-hospital" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;“health freedom”&lt;/a&gt; candidates, supported in part by Mellor, entered the race. Three &lt;a href="https://www.heraldtribune.com/story/news/politics/elections/2022/08/23/sarasota-election-sarasota-county-hospital-board-health-freedom/10291181002/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;won seats&lt;/a&gt; on the nine-member board in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Even the name of this stretch of sun-bleached asphalt is up for debate. This year, a state Republican lawmaker – who has also &lt;a href="https://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2023/222" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;introduced bills&lt;/a&gt; to limit vaccine requirements – briefly proposed changing its name to the&lt;a href="https://www.heraldtribune.com/story/news/politics/2025/02/25/bill-would-rename-us-41-road-tamiami-trail-to-gulf-of-america-trail/80264969007/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt; “Gulf of America Trail”&lt;/a&gt; – a nod to Trump’s renaming of the Gulf of Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Arguably the most salient artifact of this activism in Sarasota is the least visible: vaccination rates against measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Measles vaccination rates for kindergarteners have plummeted over the last two decades – from 97% in 2004 to 84% in 2023, according to state health records. Sarasota is roughly on par with the vaccination rates in rural Gaines county, Texas – the center of the ongoing measles outbreak that sickened 279 people in &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;in that state alone&lt;/a&gt;. Notably, both Gaines county and &lt;a href="https://www.heraldtribune.com/story/news/local/2023/12/25/why-do-these-sarasota-manatee-parents-choose-to-homeschool-their-kids/71976358007/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Sarasota&lt;/a&gt; have large home-schooling communities, meaning vaccination rates could in fact be lower.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-nyoej5"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 22 14" class="dcr-scql1j"&gt;&lt;path d="M5.255 0h4.75c-.572 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941H0C.792 9.104 2.44 4.53 5.255 0Zm11.061 0H21c-.506 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941h-8.686c.902-4.837 2.485-9.411 5.3-13.941Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;blockquote class="dcr-zzndwp"&gt;These are diseases that have killed hundreds of millions of people – and quite horribly too&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;It is well known in research circles that &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/12/trump-adminstration-health-policy" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;right-leaning states&lt;/a&gt; across the US south and west have worse health metrics – from obesity to violence to diseases such as diabetes. That reality was supercharged during the pandemic; as vaccine mandates became a fixation on the right, Republican-leaning voters became more skeptical of vaccines. In turn, places with politically conservative leaders &lt;a href="https://hsph.harvard.edu/news/political-ideology-of-u-s-elected-officials-linked-with-covid-19-health-outcomes/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;experienced more Covid-19 deaths&lt;/a&gt; and greater stress on hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Measles is one of the most contagious diseases known to medicine. At least 95% of the population needs to be vaccinated to prevent outbreaks of the disease. But despite a supremely effective vaccine that eliminated the disease from the US in 2000, vaccine hesitancy has increasingly taken hold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class=" dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-19" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;skip past newsletter promotion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;aside aria-label="newsletter promotion" class="dcr-av5vqf"&gt;&lt;div class="dcr-10et71f"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-rsfwa"&gt;Sign up to &lt;span&gt;This Week in Trumpland&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-1xjndtj"&gt;A deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SecureSignup" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"newsletterId":"the-stakes-us-election-edition","successDescription":"A deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1eusqlu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy Notice: &lt;/strong&gt;Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The measles vaccine in particular has been subject to a sustained &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/nov/13/majority-antivaxx-vaccine-ads-facebook-funded-by-two-organizations-study" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;firehose of misinformation&lt;/a&gt; stemming from a &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2011/jan/12/andrew-wakefield-fraud-mmr-autism" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;fraudulent paper&lt;/a&gt; linking the vaccine to &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/07/cdc-study-vaccines-autism" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;autism in 1999&lt;/a&gt;. For years, this misinformation was largely nonpartisan. And Florida’s anti-vaccine movement was active even before the pandemic – with a vocal contingent of parents arguing against strengthening school vaccine standards &lt;a href="https://www.gainesville.com/story/news/state/2019/10/13/anti-vaccine-movement-derails-bill/2544195007/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;in 2019&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;What appears new in Sarasota is how local conservative activists have brought opposition to vaccines into the heart of their philosophy. By Mellor’s telling, he and a loosely affiliated group of Maga activists began to adopt anti-vaccine beliefs as the pandemic wore on – helping organize major health protests in the area in recent years, such as mask mandate opt-outs and the “health freedom” campaign for hospital board seats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Mellor said his nearby property, the Hollow, was a&lt;a href="https://www.thehollow2a.com/event-details/sarasota-memorial-hospital-board-meeting-2" data-link-name="in body link"&gt; gathering place&lt;/a&gt; during the pandemic (it is also a part-time gun range). He cites ivermectin, an &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/ivermectin-and-covid-19" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;anti-parasitic drug&lt;/a&gt; that became a fascination of the right, as the reason “we didn’t lose people at all” during the height of the pandemic. Available clinical evidence shows it is not effective against Covid-19.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Kennedy has fit neatly into this realignment. He enjoys trust ratings among Republicans nearly as high as Trump, according to polling from the health-focused &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/health-information-and-trust/press-release/poll-trust-in-public-health-agencies-and-vaccines-falls-amid-republican-skepticism/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Kaiser Family Foundation&lt;/a&gt;. Kennedy has already spread dubious information about measles vaccines in public statements (notably: from a&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/12/rfk-jr-hannity-interview-beef-tallow" data-link-name="in body link"&gt; Steak ’n Shake&lt;/a&gt; in Florida) – a response one vaccine expert said “couldn’t be worse”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“While children are in the hospital suffering severe measles pneumonia, struggling to breathe, [Kennedy] stands up in front of the American public and says measles vaccines kill people every year and that it causes blindness and deafness,” said Dr Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center and an attending physician in the division of infectious diseases at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. Severe side effects from the vaccine are possible, but they are much rarer than disability and death from measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“This is what happens when you have a virulent anti-vaccine activist, a science denialist, as the head of the most important public health agency in the United States,” said Offit. “He should either be quiet or stand down.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The same poll found trust in public health agencies has fallen precipitously amid Republican attacks. More than a quarter of Republican parents report delaying childhood vaccines, the poll found, a rate that has more than doubled since 2022. There is no analogous trend among Democratic parents.

But doctors say that it’s important to pursue natural ways to manage your blood sugar, even if you’re on medication. “Lifestyle modification, which includes natural ways to lower blood sugar, is always recommended in combination with medication for treatment of diabetes,” &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:6;pos:1" class="link " href="https://www.pennmedicine.org/providers/profile/serena-cardillo" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Serena Cardillo;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:6;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;Dr. Serena Cardillo&lt;/a&gt;, professor of clinical medicine in endocrinology, diabetes and metabolism at Penn Medicine, tells Yahoo Life. “The effects of medication alone will be limited if the lifestyle piece isn’t optimized.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Getting a lab test is the best way to know where things stand with your blood sugar (aka glucose), but Cording says you don’t necessarily need to go that route if you don’t have an underlying health condition like type 2 diabetes. Instead, she recommends being on the lookout for signs of unstable blood sugar throughout your day, like feeling irritable or anxious, struggling with food cravings, having regular mood swings and dealing with energy crashing. “These are all signs to pay attention to your blood sugar levels,” Cording says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Whether you’re trying to make smarter lifestyle choices for your health or just feel like you could be doing better on the blood sugar management front, experts say these are the best natural ways to lower your blood sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="ramp-up-your-fiber-intake"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ramp up your fiber intake&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Fiber-rich foods will help with glucose spikes after meals,” &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:7;pos:1" class="link " href="https://www.feinberg.northwestern.edu/faculty-profiles/az/profile.html?xid=12810" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Anthony Pick;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:7;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;Dr. Anthony Pick&lt;/a&gt;, clinical assistant professor of endocrinology at Northwestern Medicine, tells Yahoo Life.

As a result, it moves slowly through the stomach, helping you to feel fuller longer, Beth Mitchell, a dietitian nutritionist and diabetes education manager at &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:9;pos:1" class="link " href="https://wexnermedical.osu.edu/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:9;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center&lt;/a&gt;, tells Yahoo Life.

That’s why dietitians generally recommend trying to have protein throughout your day. Foods like meats, poultry, fish, beans, eggs, nut butter and tofu are all good sources of protein, according to the &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:13;pos:1" class="link " href="https://www.myplate.gov/eat-healthy/protein-foods" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dietary Guidelines for Americans;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:13;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;Dietary Guidelines for Americans&lt;/a&gt;. “Pairing carbohydrates with protein slows the digestion of food, reducing the post-meal blood sugar spike,” Cardillo says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Having &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:14;pos:1" href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/how-much-protein-does-your-body-need-its-a-bit-complicated-our-guide-can-help-235954440.html" data-ylk="slk:plenty of protein in your day;cpos:14;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;plenty of protein in your day&lt;/a&gt; — the recommended amount is &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:15;pos:1" class="link " href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/how-much-protein-do-you-need-every-day-201506188096" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:0.36 grams per pound of body weight;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:15;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;0.36 grams per pound of body weight&lt;/a&gt; — can also help stave off cravings that happen with blood sugar fluctuations, Cardillo says. You just don’t want to go overboard with protein. “Excess protein can be converted to glucose,” which can make your blood sugar management even harder, Mitchell says. But if you stick within the recommended amounts or even go slightly over, you should be fine, Cording says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="take-in-plenty-of-water"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Take in plenty of water&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Everyone’s hydration needs are slightly different, but women should aim to have 11.5 cups (92 ounces) of fluids a day, while men should strive for 15.5 cups (124 ounces) of fluids a day, according to the &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:16;pos:1" class="link " href="https://www.nationalacademies.org/news/2004/02/report-sets-dietary-intake-levels-for-water-salt-and-potassium-to-maintain-health-and-reduce-chronic-disease-risk" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:U.S. National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:16;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;U.S. National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine&lt;/a&gt;.

But there are also lasting blood sugar management benefits to regular exercise. “Increasing lean muscle mass can also provide long-term benefits in helping your body process insulin and glucose more efficiently,” Cardillo says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="consider-taking-up-yoga"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consider taking up yoga&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;It seems a bit random, but emotional stress can influence your blood sugar. Specifically, stress hormones like cortisol can make your blood sugar rise or fall unpredictably, according to the &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:30;pos:1" class="link " href="https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/living-with/mental-health.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:CDC;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:30;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;. Cardillo says emotional stress is a common reason why your blood sugar might go up, and that it can be tough to predict or manage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;That’s why she recommends the practice of yoga. “Yoga is one form of exercise that can help lower blood sugar levels through muscle strengthening and breathing,” she says. (It also helps to hit those exercise goals, Mitchell says.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Meditation is also helpful for managing stress, Cardillo adds.

But Cardillo notes the importance of talking to a health care professional before starting any supplement, including these.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;If you have diabetes, Cardillo says it’s crucial to come up with a blood sugar management plan under the care of a doctor. “While natural methods are always a beneficial and healthy way to manage blood sugar, they may not be enough as a stand-alone approach,” she says. “You should consult with your health care provider regarding the need for medication in addition to lifestyle modification for safe and effective comprehensive treatment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;But if you’re just looking to better manage your blood sugar and are otherwise healthy, Mitchell says natural methods are a great way to go. “These are good recommendations for everyone,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo Life</author><pubDate>Mon, 24 Mar 2025 10:00:41 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMivAFBVV95cUxPbVBybDZFMHdqam1udFIxVXBxYmRncG9EandQSzlwRUlNVE9uTTc1OWJZRUNhT0ZLeVoxZ2F3Q0FiY2hNdmpTbzVtUGx4anVSWVFjblJtd1Zqb3pXMGt2dUdRejBzYnJLXzFlZDVIM0U5YnlpZGJ2SEJyX0hkWTFIU01FR2xjajQ5alhJR3JlandhbVNMTzlkXy1uVWRNTFliYUNweFZaRVQwdjFEWG9iTEI2el9FOU1TcTQ5cA</guid></item><item><title>How often should you wash your feet? - BBC.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihgFBVV95cUxQazFQajFYcmxJaWhwUV9aaUh3YXc4VjRSYmhRMllXXzU3cTJUWFozUk9QaUNzV0NRcW5Nd1drczR4RElUMzBvbzYweE51bGt5WWIzNW9lVkRETV9UOFF0aXh6TEItV2pmVm9FbkFnME5qVFZOQ1J6WVRfMEkzMW8zcmx3NkZCdw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article&gt;&lt;p data-component="headline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eeiVGB"&gt;&lt;h1 class="sc-518485e5-0 itISwu"&gt;Your feet are home to billions of bacteria.

The underarm region no doubt gets the full lather, rinse, repeat treatment. Your feet, by virtue of being located at the end of your body, can be easy to overlook. However, according to some experts, your feet are just as, if not more, deserving of attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Both the UK's National Health Service (&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/smelly-feet/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt;) and US &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.cdc.gov/hygiene/about/foot-hygiene.html" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;Centre for Disease Control (CDC)&lt;/a&gt;, for example, advise washing feet daily with soap and water. One reason for this meticulous care is to prevent odour. The soles of the foot contain &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20150730-the-disgusting-secrets-of-smelly-feet." class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;600 sweat glands&lt;/a&gt; per square centimetre of skin, more than any other region of the body.  Although sweat itself doesn't smell, it contains a &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23328940.2019.1632145#d1e150" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;nutritious broth&lt;/a&gt; of salts, glucose, vitamins and amino acids, which serves as an &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://journals.asm.org/doi/full/10.1128/spectrum.04180-22" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;all-you-can-eat buffet&lt;/a&gt; for bacteria that live there. And there a lot of bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"The foot – especially between the toes – is quite a moist, humid, and warm environment, so it can be a breeding ground for microbes," says Holly Wilkinson, a lecturer in wound healing at the University of Hull in the UK. This is exacerbated by the fact that most people encase their feet in socks and shoes, trapping the moisture inside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;If you zoom in on any square centimetre of human skin you will find between 10,000 to one million bacteria &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2493393/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;living there.&lt;/a&gt; Warm and moist areas of the skin, such as the feet, are considered prime real estate and are home to the greatest numbers of species.

In fact, the human foot contains &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature12171" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;a greater biodiversity of fungal species&lt;/a&gt; than any other body region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;This is probably a good reason to clean your feet. In one study, researchers &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/16/18/3503" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;swabbed the soles&lt;/a&gt; of 40 volunteers. They found that foot washing had a significant impact on bacteria numbers. People who washed their feet twice a day had around 8,800 bacteria living in each square centimetre of skin. Those who reported washing every other day had over one million bacteria per square centimetre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;However just because the soles of your feet are brimming with microbial life, that doesn't mean that they are necessarily smelly or that there is anything to worry about. As always, it's not just the number, but the type of bacteria that's important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="quote-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-9967660-0 WkJHg"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-9967660-2 kcfPbO"&gt;The human foot contains a greater biodiversity of fungal species than any other body region&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;&lt;i id="staphylococcus" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt;Staphylococcus&lt;/i&gt; are the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mark-Harker/publication/271213529_Spatial_variations_in_the_microbial_community_structure_and_diversity_of_the_human_foot_is_associated_with_the_production_of_odorous_volatiles/links/5657182e08aeafc2aac0bad5/Spatial-variations-in-the-microbial-community-structure-and-diversity-of-the-human-foot-is-associated-with-the-production-of-odorous-volatiles.pdf" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;key players&lt;/a&gt; when it comes to producing the volatile fatty acids (VFAs) responsible for foot odour. Sweat glands on the skin of the feet release a heady mix of electrolytes, amino acids, urea and lactic acid. The &lt;i id="staphylococcus" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt;Staphylococcus &lt;/i&gt;bacteria consider this a veritable feast and, in the process of feeding, convert amino acids into VFAs. The main chemical culprit is isovaleric acid, which has an unpleasant odour which has been described as having a "&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ffj.3136" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;distinct cheesy/acidic note"&lt;/a&gt;. The comparison is apt, as many cheeses contain a similar &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022030218302984" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;mix of volatile chemicals&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;In one &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mark-Harker/publication/271213529_Spatial_variations_in_the_microbial_community_structure_and_diversity_of_the_human_foot_is_associated_with_the_production_of_odorous_volatiles/links/5657182e08aeafc2aac0bad5/Spatial-variations-in-the-microbial-community-structure-and-diversity-of-the-human-foot-is-associated-with-the-production-of-odorous-volatiles.pdf" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;2014 study,&lt;/a&gt; researchers swabbed the feet of 16 subjects and found that 98.6% of the bacteria present on the soles of the feet were &lt;i id="staphylococci" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt;Staphylococci&lt;/i&gt;. The levels of VFAs, including the key foot odour compound isovaleric acid, were also significantly increased on the sole of the foot compared to the bridge (top) of the foot. Overall, the study concluded that the intensity of foot malodour was correlated to the total number of &lt;i id="staphylococcus" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt;Staphylococcus&lt;/i&gt; present – another reason to reach for the soap. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;However, washing your feet isn't just about preventing cheesy foot odour. Many diseases and foot problems can be prevented through good foot hygiene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"Because of the small space between the toes, these areas are particularly at risk for microbial infections," says Joshua Zeichner, associate professor of dermatology at the Mount Sinai Hospital in New York. "This can lead to itching, swelling, and a foul smell. As the skin barrier becomes disrupted, this can also increase the risk of microorganisms invading the skin and causing more significant soft tissue infections known as cellulitis," he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;According to Zeichner, the most common problem is the development of athlete's foot, which is a superficial fungal infection of the skin on the feet. The fungi that cause athlete's foot&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.pennmedicine.org/for-patients-and-visitors/patient-information/conditions-treated-a-to-z/athletes-foot" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt; thrive in warm, dark, and moist environments&lt;/a&gt; – hence why this condition most commonly affects the spaces in-between the toes. Keep this area clean and dry and you deprive the fungi of their perfect home. This is a good thing, as athlete's foot can cause a series of &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/athletes-foot/symptoms-causes/syc-20353841" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;unpleasant symptoms&lt;/a&gt; such as itchiness, a scaly rash, flaky skin and cracking on the soles of your feet and between your toes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 jFCfG"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-a34861b-1 jxzoZC"&gt;&lt;img src="/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-a34861b-0 cOpVbP hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0kzn8xf.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0kzn8xf.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0kzn8xf.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0kzn8xf.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0kzn8xf.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0kzn8xf.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0kzn8xf.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0kzn8xf.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0kzn8xf.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0kzn8xf.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Gorka Olmo/BBC Our feet are home to a surprisingly diverse array of fungi that make their home in the many microscopic folds and creases of these appendages (Credit: Gorka Olmo/ BBC)" class="sc-a34861b-0 efFcac"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-a34861b-2 hesJxn"&gt;Gorka Olmo/BBC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 bdPeAJ"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-8353772e-0 iUqqeb"&gt;Our feet are home to a surprisingly diverse array of fungi that make their home in the many microscopic folds and creases of these appendages (Credit: Gorka Olmo/ BBC)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Keeping your feet clean could also prevent skin infections, such as those caused by &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1586/14787210.2015.1023291" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;&lt;i id="staphylococcus" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt;Staphylococcus&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i id="pseudomonas" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt;Pseudomonas&lt;/i&gt; bacteria&lt;/a&gt;. While these bacteria exist naturally on your skin, if they get into your bloodstream via a cut then it can lead to a serious infection. Even a minor staph infection can lead to &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/staph-infections/symptoms-causes/syc-20356221" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;boils&lt;/a&gt; – bumps of pus that form under the skin around hair follicles or oil glands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"The feet are more prone to infections because there's quite a lot of biomass of bacteria there, and also if you do have cracks or injuries to your feet, it tends to heal much more slowly than other areas of the body," says Wilkinson. "In a situation like that, there's a greater chance that if you have an injury, pathogens could get into that wound, populate and overgrow."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;While skin infections can still occur if you have good foot hygiene, regularly washing your feet reduces the number of bacteria present. So, if you happen to get a cut, there will be less microbes around to get into the bloodstream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"They are there waiting for an opportunity to cause an infection.

Diabetes patients are also prone to cuts, wounds, and sores in the feet that &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(05)67700-8/abstract" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;don't heal&lt;/a&gt;.

"Just the act of washing allows you to properly check your feet for any minor abrasions or dryness that might contribute to having an infection."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="quote-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-9967660-0 WkJHg"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-9967660-2 kcfPbO"&gt;A lot of people think that if you have a shower and you kind of just let the water trickle, that that's washing feet, but it isn't – Holly Wilkinson&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;But what about everyone else? Some experts argue that for most people, washing the feet every day has little health benefit, and can even raise the risk of &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/instance/2631732/pdf/11294712.pdf" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;skin problems&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"Overwashing the skin can disrupt the skin barrier, stripping the skin of natural oils, contributing to dryness and inflammation," says Zeichner. This leads to itchy, dry skin and can &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/eczema-from-overwashing-hands#overwashing-hands-and-eczema" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;exacerbate conditions like eczema&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"It is also important not to overly scrub or exfoliate the skin on the feet," says Zeichner. "Calluses develop because of daily trauma. But they actually protect the feet from the environment. Removing calluses takes away that protection."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;There is also a concern that &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/are-antibacterial-products-with-triclosan-fueling-bacterial-resistance-2019080617473" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;antibacterial soaps&lt;/a&gt; could upset the delicate balance of microorganisms on the skin, killing the beneficial species and allowing the emergence of hardier, pathogenic strains that are resistant to antibiotics. Finally, our immune system needs to be challenged to a certain extent by microbes in order to do its job. If we don't come into contact with a steady stream of bacteria and viruses in childhood, then our bodies don't learn how to &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/showering-daily-is-it-necessary-2019062617193" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;properly respond to attack&lt;/a&gt;. Some experts believe that &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/culture/article/20240423-theres-no-need-to-shower-every-day-heres-why" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;bathing or showering too frequently&lt;/a&gt; could actually be counterproductive for you for this very reason.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 jFCfG"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-a34861b-1 jxzoZC"&gt;&lt;img src="/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-a34861b-0 cOpVbP hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0l017sg.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0l017sg.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0l017sg.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0l017sg.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0l017sg.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0l017sg.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0l017sg.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0l017sg.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0l017sg.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0l017sg.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Gorka Olmo/BBC The microbes that live on our feet are actually serve an important purpose, helping to repel harmful bacteria (Credit: Gorka Olmo/ BBC)" class="sc-a34861b-0 efFcac"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-a34861b-2 hesJxn"&gt;Gorka Olmo/BBC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 bdPeAJ"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-8353772e-0 iUqqeb"&gt;The microbes that live on our feet are actually serve an important purpose, helping to repel harmful bacteria (Credit: Gorka Olmo/ BBC)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;So that leaves us with the perennial question, how often should we wash our feet? The answer depends to some extent on the individual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"For people with diabetes, it is 100% advised that you wash your feet every day," says Wilkinson. "But if you don't have any underlying conditions, then dermatologists tend to advise that every couple of days is more than enough to maintain good hygiene, without stripping too much of the natural oils on your skin."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;However, Wilkinson points out that if you're somebody likes to run or work out at the gym, then you will obviously need to wash your feet more regularly than somebody who is less active. It's also not just the frequency of washing that's important either. How you wash and dry your feet also has health implications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"A lot of people think that if you have a shower and you kind of just let the water trickle, that that's washing feet, but it isn't – you need to actually physically wash your feet with soapy water," says Wilkinson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;However, according to Dan Baumgardt, a GP and lecturer in neuroscience and physiology at the University of Bristol in the UK, the most important thing he stresses to patients is to make sure you dry your feet properly. "When you've got wetness or dampness in between the toes that's allowed to just remain there in a warm environment, that's when you're prone to developing things like athlete's foot and other fungal infections," says Baumgardt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;&lt;i id="for-more-science,-technology,-environment-and-health-stories-from-the-bbc,-follow-us-on" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt;For more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;&lt;b id="facebook" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kVRnKf"&gt;&lt;i id="facebook" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt;Facebook&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i id="," class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt;, &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://x.com/BBC_Future" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;&lt;b id="x" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kVRnKf"&gt;&lt;i id="x" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt;X&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i id="and" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt; and &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/bbcfuture_official/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;&lt;b id="instagram" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kVRnKf"&gt;&lt;i id="instagram" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt;Instagram&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b id="." class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kVRnKf"&gt;&lt;i id="." class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 24 Mar 2025 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihgFBVV95cUxQazFQajFYcmxJaWhwUV9aaUh3YXc4VjRSYmhRMllXXzU3cTJUWFozUk9QaUNzV0NRcW5Nd1drczR4RElUMzBvbzYweE51bGt5WWIzNW9lVkRETV9UOFF0aXh6TEItV2pmVm9FbkFnME5qVFZOQ1J6WVRfMEkzMW8zcmx3NkZCdw</guid></item><item><title>Dentists Recommend The Dental Products They Can't Live Without - HuffPost</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMingFBVV95cUxQbS15MmY0SEs3RmZTb3NsNlQwU0pHT0NIOXIwNVVHZXpvRkMwenZicVYtQ29tMFhHbTc1YjY0MC1obGxJZHFSZ1lBMC1tRnNHbVprdTdCZVgxMlk0aGRsRkRvczAwek8xblVuOVpJRl9qV0ZmaDZjUWVZdnFYd3VpTnpjaFVQSV8zN0lPZHh3UlZNalNpQVgwa3BLS1BYd9IBowFBVV95cUxNZWNiOTRDZmJZZG1ZUzZUbW5uTThaTktUYkxITTRXdTEzdmF4cWVEdWw5ckcxNWhnRGIya3BzVHlnNEdidU9YR2lYOVdDUkZkNFBpd2QyZ0lvWVhXUERFWUkwNHRnNkZtcmExMlhTMUdlM0VGck1idlNxS1J5Z0FydVhFSzRINk1aTGFVS1h5TEtwYU1CTGdnZ0ZmUDhRWjdad0JR?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taking proper care of your teeth is quite possibly one of the most important things you can do for your health.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;As more Americans suspect they have ADHD — &lt;a href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-adhd" target="_blank"&gt;attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder&lt;/a&gt; — social media platforms have become go-to spots for sharing symptoms and getting advice.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That's especially true on TikTok.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;On the app, popular content on #ADHD and related hashtags have amassed hundreds of millions of views, tapping into humor or themes that feel relatable to many who live with the mental health condition. And therapists say it's undoubtedly helped &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/01/23/nx-s1-5272801/adhd-research-shorter-life-expectancy-attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder" target="_blank"&gt;lead many adults to a diagnosis&lt;/a&gt; after years of being overlooked.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0319335" target="_blank"&gt;new research&lt;/a&gt; also carries a warning.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Fewer than half of the claims in the top videos accurately match the scientific criteria that form an ADHD diagnosis. Many oversimplified or &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2017/05/29/527654633/adult-adhd-cant-be-diagnosed-with-a-simple-screening-test-doctors-warn" target="_blank"&gt;overstated the symptoms of ADHD&lt;/a&gt;, and weren't backed up by reliable sources.&lt;/p&gt;   
   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Many content creators were also selling something related to ADHD via links in their profiles or posts.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And even more concerning: The study suggests a heavy diet of this TikTok content shapes how people perceive ADHD, and not necessarily for the better.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"People who consumed more also felt worse about their own symptoms," says &lt;a href="https://psych.ubc.ca/profile/vasileia-karasavva/" target="_blank"&gt;Vasileia Karasavva&lt;/a&gt;, the study's author and a postdoctoral student at the University of British Columbia. "They thought they were worse and harder to cope with."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The work expands on &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/article-abstract/2831638" target="_blank"&gt;previous research&lt;/a&gt; that has identified the spread of misleading content related to ADHD on TikTok.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"If you spend enough time on TikTok, you're going to find hundreds of videos that you could walk away from saying, 'That's me, I think I have ADHD," says &lt;a href="https://artsandsciences.syracuse.edu/people/faculty/antshel-phd-kevin-/" target="_blank"&gt;Kevin Antshel, a clinical psychologist at Syracuse University&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;At the same time, there's also a growing recognition of ADHD in adults, including many who weren't diagnosed as children. The U.S. has no guidelines specifically for adults with ADHD, and efforts are underway to roll those out later this year.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Therapists acknowledge social media is meeting a very real need, especially for people who've been traditionally overlooked. "It's a mixed bag," says &lt;a href="https://psychiatry.uw.edu/profile/maggie-sibley/" target="_blank"&gt;Maggie Sibley&lt;/a&gt;, a clinical psychologist at the University of Washington School of Medicine. "It's a great thing when people who have experiences with ADHD that have been unrecognized for decades finally get the care they need,&lt;em&gt;" she says.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;What TikTok gets wrong&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In the study, two experienced psychologists ranked the top 100 TikTok videos, which at the time had nearly half a billion views. They gave each a score based on how closely the claims aligned with the&lt;a href="https://www.psychiatry.org/psychiatrists/practice/dsm" target="_blank"&gt; Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&lt;/a&gt;, known as the DSM 5.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"A lot of them lacked nuance," says Karasavva. "Some of the things they were describing wouldn't apply to all people with ADHD or also could apply to people without ADHD."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Next, close to 850 college students were asked to watch and score the five most and least accurate videos as ranked by the clinicians. Then they answered questions about their TikTok habits.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Those who watched more of this content were more likely to recommend these videos, regardless of their accuracy. They also tended to overestimate the prevalence of ADHD as nearly 30%.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In reality,&lt;a href="https://caddac.ca/about-adhd/#:~:text=Attention%20Deficit%20Hyperactivity%20Disorder%20(ADHD,the%20country%20has%20the%20disorder." target="_blank"&gt; it's roughly 5% &lt;/a&gt;in Canada, and&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/adhd/php/adults/index.html" target="_blank"&gt; 6% in the U.S.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Karasavva says their findings raise questions about how TikTok is shaping views of ADHD more broadly.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A constant stream of this content could lead people "to become hyper aware of lapses in concentration or small mistakes that we all make," she says. That might explain why people view symptoms as more severe and widespread when they watch more videos.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;TikTok meets a need&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But it's not exactly a mystery why these videos resonate. They can be funny and entertaining.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Going through a list of diagnostic symptoms, I imagine that's kind of boring for people to watch," Karasavva says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In fact, Sibley, at the University of Washington, recalls how early on some "well-meaning clinicians" tried to get on TikTok with a more conventional approach.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"But who wants to watch them? Nobody," she says, "Social media algorithms like TikTok reward novelty. The tried-and-true science is probably not going to be as popular."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Clinicians who focus on treating ADHD say they regularly encounter the downstream effects of this social media ecosystem that has sprung up around ADHD, when patients show up at their clinics.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"They already have a self-diagnosis that's been made based on this content, and arrive at our office telling us they have ADHD," Antshel says. "In fact, quite often now they're telling us the type and the dose of medication they want to treat this."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;As he sees it, the major concern is that people end up pursuing unnecessary treatment. For adults under 65 who use stimulants, &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/article-abstract/2831638" target="_blank"&gt;more than a quarter report misuse&lt;/a&gt; — a well-known problem on college campuses.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;He says some of this TikTok content also tends to blur the line between ADHD and symptoms that may actually point to other mental health conditions like anxiety, depression and trauma.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But Antshel stresses social media is clearly "filling a void" and for some people it can provide answers after struggling for decades.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;By &lt;a href="https://health.osu.edu/health/mental-health/survey-adults-and-undiagnosed-adhd" target="_blank"&gt;some accounts&lt;/a&gt;, one in four adults in the U.S suspect they have ADHD. Social media is likely one of many factors at play.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;ADHD exists on a spectrum, Sibley says. The average American may have two or three symptoms, but this doesn't mean they have the diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"ADHD isn't a temporary response to your environment," she says, &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/01/23/nx-s1-5272801/adhd-research-shorter-life-expectancy-attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder" target="_blank"&gt;"It's a largely genetic condition&lt;/a&gt; that you'll see the thread of throughout someone's life."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;While there are certainly some concerns, Sibley — who's involved in developing the new ADHD adult guidelines — welcomes the novel ideas coming from places like TikTok.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"That is just fodder for us," she says,&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Sibley believes researchers should listen with an open-mind — and then rigorously study what holds up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;Early in the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, scientists predicted the coronavirus would &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/03/26/822107691/the-coronavirus-is-mutating-relatively-slowly-which-may-be-good-news"&gt;mutate slowly&lt;/a&gt;. They were wrong. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2665928X23000132?via%3Dihub"&gt;Hundreds of thousands of viral mutations&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/08/15/nx-s1-5075060/covid-summer-wave-variants-vaccine"&gt;multiple seasonal waves&lt;/a&gt; later, researchers now know why.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Turns out, SARS-CoV-2 — the virus that causes the disease COVID-19 — was making evolutionary leaps and bounds in one specific group of people.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt; "When the virus jumps from person to person, it gets about two mutations a month," says &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/author/sarah-zhang/"&gt;Sarah Zhang&lt;/a&gt;, a health writer for The Atlantic, who has been covering the coronavirus pandemic since it began. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In February, she &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2025/02/covid-virus-evolution/681798/"&gt;wrote a piece&lt;/a&gt; comparing several studies indicating that in the immune system of an immunocompromised person, the SARS-CoV-2 virus might survive for weeks, even months.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"The more time you have, the more mutations you can accumulate," Zhang says. "It's almost like a training camp for the virus to find ways to hide from our immune system."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In other words, the virus has the opportunity to "try out" different mutations, different attacks against the human immune system. Those mutations, in turn, may help it spark a new wave of infections. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That's almost certainly what happened with omicron. Understanding it could help us predict the evolution of other viruses in the future.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="hr"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Want to hear more virology or human biology stories?

Swelling in the abdomen or other accompanying symptoms. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In addition to stomach pain, if you have other worsening symptoms like swelling, that means you should go to the emergency room straight away. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Abdominal pain associated with swelling of the abdomen, abdominal tenderness ― that is, touching or pushing on the abdomen worsens the pain, or chest pain, persistent vomiting or yellowing of the skin (jaundice) is concerning,” Raufman said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Pain with fever or bleeding.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“If abdominal pain is associated with rectal bleeding or vomiting blood, or severe abdominal pain with concomitant fever, sweats and chills, these are times to consider going to the ER/hospital for medical evaluation, blood testing and ultrasound testing,” Sprung said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are there cases where you should try to treat your pain at home first?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If your stomach pain doesn’t exactly match the descriptions above ― or you don’t think it’s severe enough to warrant a trip to the emergency room right away ― then there’s some things you can try at home first to see if it helps.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;For starters, Raufman suggested going easy on your diet to see if it helps your symptoms.

In contrast, professional treatments are much stronger, up to 800 microamps, and have to be used by trained professionals in order to avoid overstimulating the muscles. Overstimulation has many side effects, like muscle twitching and drooping — we’ll talk more about that later. To note, at-home devices won’t provide the same efficacy as in-office treatments due to their strength and technology, but are a more affordable and easy-to-use alternative. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“[At-home devices] are supportive but not transformative, especially after the age of 30.

It can cause facial muscle weakness or paralysis.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Galina Zhigalova via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Galina Zhigalova via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;Considering using your device on a lower setting for some areas of the face and neck, due to delicate blood vessels or thyroid glands.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But although Bell’s Palsy is mainly linked to viral infections, a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8267038/" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="2021 study" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67d849ace4b0dade360ce268" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8267038/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="21"&gt;&lt;span&gt;2021 study&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; found that on rare occasions (in this case, getting slapped in the face), it can be connected to minor trauma. However, there is no specific mention of devices in the study. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“While the risk is very low, improper use of the devices (such as over-stimulation or incorrect placement) could potentially lead to temporary facial nerve irritation and issues similar to Bell’s Palsy. To avoid this, use any given device with proper technique and avoid overstimulation of facial muscles or nerves by using appropriate energies and proper technique,” said &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.parkderm.com/bradley-glodny-md/" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Bradley Glodny" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67d849ace4b0dade360ce268" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.parkderm.com/bradley-glodny-md/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="22"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr. Bradley Glodny&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, a cosmetic and general board-certified dermatologist at Park Avenue Dermatology.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the real risks associated with these devices?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Beauty devices, microcurrent or EMS, aren’t known to cause this condition directly, but there are theoretical risks if the facial nerve is overstimulated or irritated, especially if someone is already predisposed to nerve issues,” Halim explained. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If you have any past nerve damage issues, you should avoid using such devices altogether. This includes anyone with preexisting muscle conditions like drooping or ptosis, where a consultation with a medical professional is needed before using any device of that kind, Halim said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Also, devices should be used on a lower setting for some areas of the face, due to the delicate blood vessels: “Some of these areas include around the eyes, over the thyroid gland (on the neck) and near the ears. That being said, if the device is used correctly, any of these areas could be treated safely with any given device,” Glodny explained. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Also, you should avoid these devices in the following cases: if you are pregnant or breastfeeding (due to a lack of studies on safety), if you have a pacemaker or other implanted medical devices (avoid going over that area), and if you have any active inflammatory or infectious skin conditions like acne, eczema or psoriasis flare-ups. Lastly, anyone with a history of seizures or neurological conditions should check with their neurologist, Glodny advised. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The side effects that can occur may include: “Swelling, pain, skin irritation, muscle fatigue/strain and nerve irritation. Generally, these effects are not permanent but could absolutely lead to pain and dissatisfaction,” said Glodny.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is FDA approval essential for such devices? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;While FDA approval isn’t always essential for beauty devices, it can offer peace of mind in terms of safety and efficacy. Still, you can also check the clearance of other official bodies, like CE approval in Europe or KFDA in Korea, if the devices are produced outside of the U.S.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Generally, FDA approval is a positive thing, and while not entirely foolproof, it is somewhat helpful in telling if a device is, at the very least, dangerous. Whether or not it is effective is an entirely different consideration,” added Glodny. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The following devices hold FDA approval: NuFACE Trinity, Foreo Bear, Ziip Halo, TheraFace Pro. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do a little research before using your device.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If you are considering purchasing a new device, first ensure it works for your skin type and any pre-existing conditions, then read through reviews and clinical studies.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Look for evidence of efficacy and safety that are not published or paid for by the company manufacturing the device,” Glodny said. “If you dig even a little bit, you can typically find who funded the study or report and what their intentions might be.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Always start slowly, using the lowest settings, and test it on a small area first. When in doubt, consult with a board-certified professional before use. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>HuffPost</author><pubDate>Mon, 24 Mar 2025 07:00:34 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikgFBVV95cUxQWll3bmFnSkpUbW1NUE1lOXhuYUZSSmZHR1FOUXBWUGFpT0NWOGZPdHVGSGZwd2NmeFpjTER2TTBmaS1EdGE5QnoyeThDbXdXMVBuR3pxdEM0TWN6WXNVSWN4VWdSMGRmdzdGaWhYWTBEVUpuSjJIWHJnRlVqMmRBTktBN2ZYX3VubEZSdW1XMXg2Z9IBlwFBVV95cUxOa1E5OXYtRU5SWDVXOWEwaVRxNW5nenJ5ZVE0OTJmMU84NWl1RXVBd0Nob1c0Wk92SVYyUmpybG5XdV9YUE5RRkxMN0Uyc3VwMF9rZ3YwRng3djVYWmFRY3BsRjBaVU5ZWDFhanJRNFVWOFBtWWV6WUVWRXp4VVBVaExuS3JVaVNjZkVER1Z4UW9JaWUwMTM4</guid></item><item><title>Oxfordshire mum with brain tumour backs research funding calls - BBC.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWkFVX3lxTE9LSWY2eVVGbl9ncUQ0elRnOUUyWjZHbkp1YU9WeTNOS3JaUzh0SFNDNENFSFNyanpmM09IaUlUYWdCQzZRQ1JyQVR2Wmh6U0ZwNTFUWm5NZDZUQdIBX0FVX3lxTE15dXZ0WUV6S3ltZkl2U3EtNGMzTlNpaG9qdTdNZDA0RXpPNnE0eWpzeGo0N0lNaU9KeUlaUmhLUDZRcXJ1aEtZN1RuQ0dEYVBfdENpU2UzaVJhQmxuQW1B?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article&gt;&lt;p data-component="headline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eeiVGB"&gt;&lt;h1 class="sc-518485e5-0 itISwu"&gt;'I'm living with the worst type of brain tumour'&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 ejjhCR"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="hero-image" class="sc-a34861b-1 jxzoZC"&gt;&lt;img src="/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-a34861b-0 cOpVbP hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/0d47/live/e5fe7a80-0583-11f0-8b1c-4bf7984ce1c5.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/0d47/live/e5fe7a80-0583-11f0-8b1c-4bf7984ce1c5.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0d47/live/e5fe7a80-0583-11f0-8b1c-4bf7984ce1c5.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/0d47/live/e5fe7a80-0583-11f0-8b1c-4bf7984ce1c5.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/0d47/live/e5fe7a80-0583-11f0-8b1c-4bf7984ce1c5.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/0d47/live/e5fe7a80-0583-11f0-8b1c-4bf7984ce1c5.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/0d47/live/e5fe7a80-0583-11f0-8b1c-4bf7984ce1c5.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0d47/live/e5fe7a80-0583-11f0-8b1c-4bf7984ce1c5.jpg.webp" loading="eager" alt="BBC Georgie Maynard is wearing a red jumper and sitting in her conservatory at home" class="sc-a34861b-0 efFcac"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-a34861b-2 hesJxn"&gt;BBC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 bdPeAJ"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-8353772e-0 iUqqeb"&gt;Georgie Maynard was diagnosed with an aggressive brain tumour in May 2023&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Georgie Maynard has suffered from regular migraines all her adult life but one Saturday lunchtime in May 2023 she knew something was not right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"I went out to the garden to get some fresh air and I thought 'no, this light is doing my head in' so I walked inside, sat on the sofa and then it just went bang," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"It was excruciating...

It's not doing any good sitting in a bank and I really want some answers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"Does it exist... and then what are we going to do to spend it and start saving some lives?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 jFCfG"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-a34861b-1 jxzoZC"&gt;&lt;img src="/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-a34861b-0 cOpVbP hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/be1a/live/a772e000-0671-11f0-8777-f3a97186d396.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/be1a/live/a772e000-0671-11f0-8777-f3a97186d396.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/be1a/live/a772e000-0671-11f0-8777-f3a97186d396.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/be1a/live/a772e000-0671-11f0-8777-f3a97186d396.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/be1a/live/a772e000-0671-11f0-8777-f3a97186d396.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/be1a/live/a772e000-0671-11f0-8777-f3a97186d396.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/be1a/live/a772e000-0671-11f0-8777-f3a97186d396.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/be1a/live/a772e000-0671-11f0-8777-f3a97186d396.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Georgie Maynard Georgie with her sisters, brother and mother at the Twilight Walk for charity last year" class="sc-a34861b-0 efFcac"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-a34861b-2 hesJxn"&gt;Georgie Maynard&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 bdPeAJ"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-8353772e-0 iUqqeb"&gt;Georgie and her family took part in the Twilight Walk last year to raise money for the Brain Tumour Charity&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;A spokesperson for the Brain Tumour Charity said: "A sustainable and strategic approach to government funding for research into brain tumours is long overdue in order to make progress. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"This should include a broad range of research projects from early-stage understanding - like Prof Ebner's - to late-stage trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"At The Brain Tumour Charity we are proud to fund a comprehensive and robust research programme and can only do so thanks to supporters like Georgie."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: "We will build on Tessa Jowell's powerful legacy to improve both research and care for brain cancer patients across the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"We spend more than £1.6bn annually on health research and have recently launched &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nihr.ac.uk/blog/how-nihr-committed-improving-and-expanding-brain-tumour-research-through-new-package-funding-calls" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;two new calls for studies unlocking the next generation of treatments for brain cancer."&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="embed-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 jVHuOl"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 24 Mar 2025 06:39:25 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWkFVX3lxTE9LSWY2eVVGbl9ncUQ0elRnOUUyWjZHbkp1YU9WeTNOS3JaUzh0SFNDNENFSFNyanpmM09IaUlUYWdCQzZRQ1JyQVR2Wmh6U0ZwNTFUWm5NZDZUQdIBX0FVX3lxTE15dXZ0WUV6S3ltZkl2U3EtNGMzTlNpaG9qdTdNZDA0RXpPNnE0eWpzeGo0N0lNaU9KeUlaUmhLUDZRcXJ1aEtZN1RuQ0dEYVBfdENpU2UzaVJhQmxuQW1B</guid></item></channel></rss>
