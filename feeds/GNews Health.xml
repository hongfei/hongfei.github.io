The reason you decide to postpone household chores and &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/sleep-procrastination-psychology-tips/"&gt;spend your time browsing social media&lt;/a&gt; could be explained by the workings of a &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/brains"&gt;brain&lt;/a&gt; circuit. Recent research has identified a neural connection responsible for delaying the start of activities associated with unpleasant experiences, even when these activities offer a clear reward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;The study, led by Ken-ichi Amemori, a neuroscientist at Kyoto University, aimed to analyze the brain mechanisms that reduce motivation to act when a task involves stress, punishment, or discomfort. To do this, the researchers designed an experiment with monkeys, a widely used model for understanding decisionmaking and motivation processes in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;The scientists worked with two macaques that were trained to perform various decisionmaking tasks. In the first phase of the experiment, after a period of water restriction, the animals could activate one of two levers that released different amounts of liquid; one option offered a smaller reward and the other a larger one. This exercise allowed them to evaluate how the value of the reward influences the willingness to perform an action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-VgtPr ekoLDG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;In a later stage, the experimental design incorporated an unpleasant element. The monkeys were given the choice of drinking a moderate amount of water without negative consequences or drinking a larger amount on the condition of receiving a direct blast of air in the face. Although the reward was greater in the second option, it involved an uncomfortable experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;As the researchers anticipated, the macaques' motivation to complete the task and access the water decreased considerably when the aversive stimulus was introduced. This behavior allowed them to identify a brain circuit that acts as a brake on motivation in the face of anticipated adverse situations. In particular, the connection between the ventral striatum and the ventral pallidum, two structures located in the basal ganglia of the brain, known for their role in regulating pleasure, motivation, and reward systems, was observed to be involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;The neural analysis revealed that when the brain anticipates an unpleasant event or potential punishment, the ventral striatum is activated and sends an inhibitory signal to the ventral pallidum, which is normally responsible for driving the intention to perform an action. In other words, this communication reduces the impulse to act when the task is associated with a negative experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="paywall"&gt;The Brain Connection Behind Procrastination&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;To investigate the specific role of this connection, as described in the study published &lt;a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2025.12.035"&gt;in the journal Current Biology&lt;/a&gt;, researchers used a chemogenetic technique that, through the administration of a specialized drug, temporarily disrupted communication between the two brain regions. By doing so, the monkeys regained the motivation to initiate tasks, even in those tests that involved blowing air.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Notably, the inhibitory substance produced no change in trials where reward was not accompanied by punishment. This result suggests that the EV-PV circuit does not regulate motivation in a general way, but rather is specifically activated to suppress it when there is an expectation of discomfort. In this sense, apathy toward unpleasant tasks appears to develop gradually as communication between these two regions intensifies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Beyond explaining why people tend to unconsciously resist starting household chores or uncomfortable obligations, the findings have relevant implications for understanding disorders such as &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/depression/"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/mutations-in-a-single-gene-have-been-linked-to-mental-illness/"&gt;schizophrenia&lt;/a&gt;, in which patients often experience a significant loss of the drive to act.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;However, Amemori emphasizes that this circuit serves an essential protective function. “Overworking is very dangerous. This circuit protects us from burnout,” he said in comments reported by Nature. Therefore, he cautions that any attempt to externally modify this neural mechanism must be approached with care, as further research is needed to avoid interfering with the brain's natural protective processes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story originally appeared in &lt;a href="https://es.wired.com/articulos/neurocientificos-descifran-la-procrastinacion-un-mecanismo-cerebral-explica-por-que-dejamos-ciertas-tareas-para-despues"&gt;WIRED en Español&lt;/a&gt; and has been translated from Spanish.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WIRED</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 20:09:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikgFBVV95cUxPMVQ4OWVYX194ZnFoYzBWWmFwbHlKQmVkNEQ5bHZMM1drMU5SWDNRTm1Eb0RVSDY4Vlg3WUhlamVzOU1ZWmYzblktMVdqMURLbWc1QWdKWWZnMGJTSmFIMHBIOHQ4LUhwazllLWp3VExwdHc3ek5XZm1xZ2Y4Yi1QdWlWUVBSbHpmTVVQYVRXaExodw</guid></item><item><title>卫生部长小RFK任命两名疫苗怀疑论者加入CDC咨询小组-卫报</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/jan/14/rfk-cdc-vaccine-advisory-panel</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body-commercial-selector article-body-viewer-selector dcr-hdpgoq"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The health and human services secretary, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/robert-f-kennedy-jr" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Robert F Kennedy Jr&lt;/a&gt;, has appointed two new obstetrician-gynecologists to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s vaccine advisory committee. Both are physicians who have publicly disputed prevailing scientific views on vaccines and the use of antidepressants during pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Kennedy announced on Tuesday that the two doctors will join the advisory committee on immunization practices (ACIP), which advises the CDC on vaccine recommendations. The additions bring the committee’s membership to 13, following Kennedy’s controversial decision in June to &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/09/rfk-cdc-panel-vaccines-removed" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;dismiss the previous panel&lt;/a&gt; and replace it with 11 new members of his choosing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The newly appointed members are Dr Adam Urato, a maternal-fetal medicine specialist with academic experience at Harvard Medical School and Tufts University, and Dr Kimberly Biss, who has held leadership roles at Bayfront Health in Florida and has published research examining Covid-19 vaccine safety in pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/secretary-kennedy-appoints-two-ob-gyns-cdc-advisory-committee-immunization-practices.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; announcing the appointments, Kennedy praised their qualifications. “ACIP serves as Americans’ watchdog for vaccine safety and transparency,” Kennedy said. “Dr Urato and Dr Biss bring the scientific credentials, clinical experience, and integrity this committee requires.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Appearing to align with Kennedy’s own views, Biss has been outspoken in her criticism of Covid vaccines. During testimony before a Republican-led House subcommittee in 2023, she said patients in her practice experienced significant menstrual irregularities after vaccination, some of which she said were severe enough to require surgeries and hysterectomies. Her claims were &lt;a href="https://pauloffit.substack.com/p/vaccine-safetyby-marjorie-taylor" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;met with pushback&lt;/a&gt; from other medical experts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Her skepticism has extended beyond congressional testimony. In a December 2022 &lt;a href="https://www.learnpolishpodcast.com/195-womens-health-risk-harmed-by-design-what-we-can-do-to-protect-it-dr-kimberly-biss/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;podcast interview&lt;/a&gt;, Biss said “prior to Covid I was not an anti-vaxxer, but I am now because I’ve gone down the rabbit hole, and I would love to be able someday to meet Robert F Kennedy Jr.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Biss &lt;a href="https://rumble.com/v2r9elx-ob-gyn-dr.-kimberly-biss-i-was-not-anti-vaccine-i-am-now.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;echoed those remarks&lt;/a&gt; at a May 2023 panel hosted by the Vaccine Safety Research Foundation, an organization critical of coronavirus vaccines, stating, “I was not anti-vaccine. I am now.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Last October, Biss appeared on a &lt;a href="https://ket.org/program/kentucky-tonight/vaccines-and-medications/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;panel discussion&lt;/a&gt; where she argued against what she described as a reflexive dismissal of alternative medical perspectives. She cited skepticism of vaccine safety and referenced guidance from the Trump administration advising pregnant women to avoid Tylenol due to potential autism links.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Most &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/24/world-health-organization-trump-autism-tylenol" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;scientific evidence&lt;/a&gt; indicates moderate Tylenol use during pregnancy is safe and does not demonstrate a connection to autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Urato has similarly challenged mainstream medical conclusions. He has &lt;a href="https://x.com/AdamUrato1/status/1845461085106626880" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;questioned the safety&lt;/a&gt; of vaccines given during pregnancy. He has also raised concerns about antidepressant use in pregnancy, particularly a class known as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or SSRIs. Urato &lt;a href="https://x.com/AdamUrato1/status/1973157978930028720" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;petitioned&lt;/a&gt; the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to require warning labels on SSRIs, arguing they cause pregnancy complications and affect fetal brain development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKQLRuYZ87E" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;podcast interview&lt;/a&gt; last June, Urato said there was a “huge problem” with “over-intervention in medicine”, adding that he believes there is “too much testing, too many drugs, too many vaccines”. He later compared vaccine makers with cigarette manufacturers, accusing them of trying to intentionally “underplay the risks”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Protect Our Care, a healthcare advocacy group, sharply criticized the health secretary’s new appointments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“The more RFK Jr stacks his immunization advisory panel with anti-vaccine activists, the more its recommendations will undermine our public health to advance conspiracy theories and anti-science ideology,” Kayla Hancock, director of Public Health Watch, a project of Protect Our Care, said in &lt;a href="https://www.protectourcare.org/rfk-jr-packs-acip-with-even-more-vaccine-skeptics-setting-stage-for-more-dangerous-and-unfounded-attacks-on-our-public-health/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;a statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“One of secretary Kennedy’s new ACIP members is perhaps best known for spreading misinformation that the Covid vaccine is somehow magically contagious to unvaccinated women – flying in the face of scientific evidence,” she added. “It’s clear secretary Kennedy is only comfortable in an anti-vax echo chamber with as little input as possible from respected medical experts and peer-reviewed data.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 17:37:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihAFBVV95cUxOZlRlaXpVOFozVWlTUUFNdDBXbklKVmRtdFpfVUtTZWJOVGQ4dGZiSWtlV3Zlb1BLemtaeWdyTlJkbnU0SmVyWkpVR0xuNkhsN1Y4WllkTVJxbHNvSlNvUjFqVDMtb0xxY1ZrSXVGOEpTdnp2b2xhblZZQmEwWjF6SjB2Uno</guid></item><item><title>美国疫苗接种率低的漏洞越来越大，风险也越来越高- CNN</title><link>https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/14/health/vaccine-exemptions-county-risk-measles-vis</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;

            Opting out of childhood vaccines is becoming more common across most of the United States, leaving larger shares of the population vulnerable to preventable diseases like measles, which is continuing its record-breaking spread across the country.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmke2kzeo00043b6pq2cp7ljv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Exemption rates for vaccines that are typically required to attend&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;school have increased in more than half of US counties since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, according to new &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/10.1001/jama.2025.24407?guestAccessKey=310c24bc-8a41-42b2-9d62-9cc5824b4882&amp;amp;utm_source=For_The_Media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;amp;utm_term=011426" target="_blank"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; published Wednesday in the medical journal JAMA.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmke2z18e00013b6snchv5f5v@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            What’s driving the trend: nonmedical reasons for exemptions — often described as religious or personal beliefs. However, exemptions for medical reasons – among those who are &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/imz-best-practices/contraindications-precautions.html" target="_blank"&gt;immunocompromised&lt;/a&gt;, for example, or those who have a severe allergy to a vaccine component or – have remained stable.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmke2kzeo00053b6plyh3gtdv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The science behind immunizations has not changed in the past five years,” said ​Dr. Jesse Hackell, a pediatrician in New York. He is the lead author of a &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/156/2/e2025072714/202656/Medical-vs-Nonmedical-Immunization-Exemptions-for" target="_blank"&gt;policy statement&lt;/a&gt; from the American Academy of Pediatrics that says that nonmedical exemptions to school immunization requirements should be eliminated.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmke2kzeo00063b6pydv0pdc4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “What has changed is the politics and the misinformation behind the discussion,” Hackell said. “But the science about the immunizations — that they’re safe, that they’re effective, that they reduce disease, that they reduce morbidity and mortality – there are no changes in that science.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmke2kzeo00073b6phxjrk3h0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In the new analysis, researchers compared the average rate of vaccine exemptions among kindergartners at the county level during a period before the Covid-19 pandemic to more recent years. Nearly 90% of counties had sufficient data to be included in the analysis. They found that the median rate of nonmedical exemptions increased from an average of 0.6% in 2010-2011 to more than 3% in 2023-2024, while medical exemptions remained stable.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmke2kzeo00083b6p8iwe2rjr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            About 53.5% of US counties saw nonmedical vaccine exemptions rise at least 1% when comparing between 2010-2020 and 2021-2024, and more than 5% — about 1 in every 20 counties — saw nonmedical exemptions rise at least 5% in that time.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmke9vbei00003b6rqjkok1nu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the increase in vaccine exemptions may be “due to an increase in vaccine hesitancy.” A &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/schoolvaxview/pubs-resources/parental-attitudes-toward-vaccination-requirements.html" target="_blank"&gt;survey&lt;/a&gt; of parents conducted by the agency in the summer of 2024 found that most supported vaccine requirements to attend school. But among those seeking an exemption, the most commonly reported reason – cited more than a third of the time – was a philosophical or personal belief objection to vaccination. Difficulty meeting school requirements by the deadline was also reported as a reason for exemption by about 23% of parents. Medical reasons were cited by more than a quarter of parents, but the CDC said that might include parents who consider concerns about vaccine safety or side effects as a “medical” reason to request an exemption.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmke2kzeo00093b6pb0g70p89@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Nathan Lo, an infectious disease physician and scientist with Stanford and author of the new research, says that small differences in vaccine coverage can make a big impact — and understanding local trends is important.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmke2kzeo000a3b6px2c1lpt2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “When you look at national trends, or even state level trends, in many ways they’re very optimistic because they miss whole pockets of communities and counties where vaccine coverage may be low and vaccine exemptions may be high,” Lo said. “Really it’s those pockets that drive the outbreaks of vaccine preventable diseases that we see across the nation.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmke2kzeo000b3b6pn9q76t9l@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In Spartanburg County, South Carolina – the center of a large, ongoing measles outbreak – nearly 8% of children had nonmedical exemptions for vaccines that are required to attend school in 2024, up from 2% in 2014, the new research shows.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmke2kzeo000c3b6pfxhwiwtg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The South Carolina measles outbreak has doubled in size over the past week, with state health officials now reporting more than 400 cases. At least 400 others remain in quarantine after they were exposed to a known measles case without the protection of vaccination, and the state health department expects more cases to come from that group.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmke2kzeo000d3b6prsv5j4qs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The outbreak has been growing rapidly since early October. Exposures have been reported at multiple schools, churches and other public locations over the past few months. The latest public exposures include the South Carolina State Museum in Columbia, which is one of the state’s most populous cities.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmke2kzeo000e3b6p11efzoc3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The state health department says that holiday activities — including school breaks, gatherings and travel — have contributed to the spread of the outbreak, particularly in areas with lagging vaccination rates.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmke2kzeo000f3b6py0ewmyvl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The (undervaccinated) pockets are all interconnected,” Lo said, through geographic proximity and the nature of our society. “When you think about the places with really large (vaccine exemption rates), I think the pockets are getting a little bit bigger and are becoming more numerous.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmke2kzeo000g3b6pzvr4j50o@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The vast majority of measles cases in the current outbreak have been among children (92%) and nearly all have been unvaccinated with the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, according to data shared by the state health department.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmke2kzeo000h3b6p7bufzqo7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Communities with particularly high exemption rates — and, therefore, lower vaccination rates — are most susceptible to a “localized epidemic” of preventable infectious diseases, Hackell said. But it raises the risk for others, too.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmke2kzeo000i3b6p0xh3ftmr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “If you’ve got a whole bunch of kids in one of these counties with high exemption rates who are getting sick and have the opportunity to travel the surrounding areas, even those counties with lower exemption rates are going to see a rise in cases,” he said. “You’ve got a lot more people around who can spread the diseases to people who may be susceptible.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmke2kzeo000j3b6pf0j5rcp9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Multiple cases in North Carolina have been linked to family travel to Spartanburg County, South Carolina, and the New Mexico health department warned of possible measles exposure in Albuquerque from someone visiting from South Carolina.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmke2kzeo000k3b6pkjwccmkd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A handful of states, including California, Connecticut, Maine and New York, have passed laws that remove the option for nonmedical vaccine exemptions. The new research shows that counties in these states saw a decrease in overall exemptions, or essentially an increase in vaccine coverage. Florida, on the other hand, has recently moved to &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/03/health/florida-vaccine-mandates"&gt;end all vaccine mandates&lt;/a&gt; in the state, including for children to attend school.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmke2kzeo000l3b6pfglxjpbn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Experts say that legislative action is the only large-scale intervention that has been shown to effectively change vaccination trends. Instead, increasing vaccination coverage will depend more on individual conversations between families and their doctors and consistent messaging over time.

            “The vast majority of parents in most places choose to immunize,” Hackell said. Nationally, 3.6% of kindergartners in the 2024-25 school year had an exemption for a required vaccine, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/31/health/vaccination-school-requirements-cdc"&gt;federal data shows&lt;/a&gt; — but that means that more than 96% were vaccinated.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “A parent who chooses to vaccinate their child is not being careless or thoughtless or weird,” he said. “The social norm is to immunize and protect your child and, by extension, protect the children around them. The social norm is vastly in favor of immunizations, and that reflects the science.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Some people can get drunk without consuming alcohol. While that might sound like the ultimate life hack to some, it’s actually a rare medical condition called auto-brewery syndrome (ABS) that’s difficult to diagnose.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-025-02225-y"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published Thursday in the journal &lt;em data-start="118" data-end="139"&gt;Nature Microbiology&lt;/em&gt;, researchers pinpointed gut bacteria and biological pathways that trigger alcohol production in ABS, shedding light on an often misunderstood syndrome. A &lt;a href="https://taylorandfrancis.com/knowledge/Medicine_and_healthcare/Physiology/Biological_pathway/"&gt;biological pathway&lt;/a&gt; is a series of biochemical processes that carry out functions in a cell or organism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“By determining the specific bacteria and microbial pathways responsible, our findings may lead the way toward easier diagnosis, better treatments, and an improved quality of life for individuals living with this rare condition,” Elizabeth Hohmann, co-senior author of the study from the Infectious Disease Division in the Mass General Brigham Department of Medicine, said in a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/01/260113220920.htm"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; by Mass General Brigham.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;Poop samples&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;ABS occurs when particular gut microbes convert carbohydrates into ethanol—an alcohol that then enters the bloodstream. Anyone’s digestion can produce small amounts of alcohol; ABS can make a person noticeably drunk. Diagnostic issues, social stigma, and limited awareness often leave the condition undiagnosed, according to the researchers. Diagnosis is complicated because the standard method requires closely monitored blood alcohol testing, which is often hard to get.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;In fact, many patients go undiagnosed for years, often facing medical complications, social stress, and legal problems. Imagine being charged with drunk driving without having consumed alcohol!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hohmann and her colleagues investigated the gut microbes of 22 people with ABS, 21 household partners without ABS, and 22 healthy control individuals. They found that stool (poop) samples from patients during ABS flare-ups produced ethanol to a significantly greater extent than the samples from the other two groups. This points to the potential for creating a stool test that could lead to more reliable diagnoses.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;Bacteria involved in ABS&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Stool analysis indicated that several bacteria, such as &lt;em&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Klebsiella pneumoniae&lt;/em&gt;, play major roles in ABS. Furthermore, when symptoms flared, some participants revealed significantly greater amounts of enzymes related to pathways of fermentation than members of the control group. However, the team reports that finding the specific microbes that cause ABS in individual people is still a long and complicated endeavor.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The scientists also worked with a patient whose symptoms improved after a &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/25202-fecal-transplant"&gt;fecal transplant&lt;/a&gt; (putting someone else’s medically processed sample of feces into the gut) and had ameliorated symptoms. Other previous approaches had not been successful. Shifts in particular bacterial strains and metabolic activity in the individual’s gut aligned with their relapse and recovery, further supporting the biological basis of the syndrome. A second transplant with a differing antibiotic pretreatment saw the patient remain without symptoms for over 16 months.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Auto-brewery syndrome is a misunderstood condition with few tests and treatments. Our study demonstrates the potential for fecal transplantation,” explained Hohmann, who is participating in another study investigating fecal transplantation in ABS patients.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="67" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmke8rdm100183b798z4ubodq@published"&gt;I’m a gay man in my late 50s, and I’ve dealt with erectile dysfunction for years. I am versatile, but I’ve been bottom more than top, especially over the last few years due to the ED. I’m on multiple medications (ADHD, blood pressure, antidepressant) that can impact erections, and have tried different medications to reduce this problem with little success. My testosterone levels are fine on supplementation.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="137" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmke8rdns00193b79rznucsim@published"&gt;I’ve taken Viagra and Cialis for years with diminishing effectiveness, so I saw a urologist, and he proposed an inflatable penile prosthesis. This was a shock to me because I did not think I would qualify or that my insurance would cover it, but he assured me that it did. Insurance initially rejected it, but I did try a vacuum pump and injections in the interim, both of which work, but neither is conducive to spontaneous sex. I can still get an erection 90 percent of the time by myself, and a fair amount of time with a partner; however, most of the erections are not strong enough for anal, or if they are, they soften up after a few minutes, and it ends up not being something that will take me all the way to climax.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="97" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmke8rdpg001a3b7926rybgw7@published"&gt;I’m currently scheduled for surgery in a couple of months, but I keep wondering if I am rushing things and should wait until it is the only alternative. I also don’t want to spend the next 10 years sticking myself in the dick with a needle every time I want to have sex, when I could be having awesome “on demand” sex. It is an irreversible procedure, so I’m, of course, having natural hesitancy, but I also feel like I’m going to do it unless you wise people tell me that it would be a big mistake.&lt;/p&gt;

You have tried many options and haven’t yet been satisfied with any. There’s probably some room for you to experiment (a cock ring in combination with medications/injections could help, for example), but not very much. Regarding your mindset, I generally caution against prioritizing spontaneous sex because it upholds an unrealistic ideal in the face of actual, practical help. But look, you’ve found a solution for someone who, in fact, prioritizes spontaneous sex while experiencing erectile dysfunction. In that respect, you seem to be a prime candidate for the procedure.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="196" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmke8rdwa001e3b79u7iprj3i@published"&gt;A few years ago, &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2021/05/girlfriends-fetish-offensive-advice.html"&gt;I interviewed a doctor&lt;/a&gt; who frequently performs implant surgeries (to the tune of 80 a year, at least at the time of the interview in 2021). You should read that column. One of the facts I’d like to highlight from it is just how irreversible the procedure is. “You can’t say, ‘I’ll try a prosthesis, if I don’t like it, in two years from now, I’ll just try some Viagra,’” Dr. Arthur Burnett told me. “Your penis structure will have changed, so medications or other, more minimal options are likely to be unsuccessful.” He also said that the surgery comes with the risk of infection (like &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12229807/"&gt;virtually all surgeries&lt;/a&gt;), but in this case, it happens in around &lt;a href="https://journals.lww.com/ijoru/fulltext/2024/02020/penile_implant_infection__risk_factors,.2.aspx"&gt;one of every 100 implants&lt;/a&gt;. Burnett described implants as “something that can restore a man’s sense of wholeness, not to mention his function,” which is to say that the psychological benefits are very clear. As someone who is pro-medicine and trusting of doctors, I think you’ve been put on a good path. Definitely be sure that this is exactly what you want before you go through with the procedure, but I am all for it.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="136" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmke8u0cb002q3b7957t8ip38@published"&gt;It always helps to go in with a semblance of a plan. If you can verbalize to them what you’d like to do ahead of time, go for it. Also include hard nos and plans for contraception and precautions against STIs. If you absolutely don’t want any form of double penetration, state that clearly before you get started, and they won’t be surprised. (If they attempt to do so anyway, you have every right to shut it down then and there—and you’ll know you’re with inconsiderate partners who don’t deserve a second round.) It’d also be useful to ask the guys (preferably together, but individually could work, too) what they would like to happen during this encounter. Will they want to play together? Are there preferred positions? Do they favor oral over penis-in-vagina or vice versa?&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="77" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmke8u0cc002r3b792x0zsk40@published"&gt;Once you have a good sense of boundaries and preferences, approach what is on the table with abandon. This is supposed to be fun. Connection means different things to different people, and in a casual situation like this, it can seem appealing or off-putting, depending on taste. But if connection is something that you’re looking for, know that it’s possible to achieve even in a group setting (via things as simple as eye contact or encouraging language).&lt;/p&gt;

It’s not always easy or even possible (sometimes you may find yourself gravitating to one dick over the other or just realize that you vibe with one of the guys more once you’re all naked), but it’s worth striving for. Going in with a good attitude and resolve to ensure that everyone comes out feeling great will set you up for success.&lt;/p&gt;

We have been together since we were 18 and got married at 23. In most aspects, our lives are great.

We seem to have great, but vanilla sex on vacation. Years ago, we experimented with tantric massages. When we’re at home, we don’t have sex, which I attribute mostly to the daily stresses of life and busy schedules. But I also want more. I want to be able to explore together, learning new things about sex and pushing our boundaries. I have tried to engage a little bit about our fantasies, but that hasn’t really gone anywhere. We’ve bought toys, but usually those are used once and then stored away. I know I watch porn and masturbate too much, and this has jaded my expectations of what sex is supposed to be. But I know we can do better. How do we get out of this rut, reignite our sex lives, and explore together?&lt;/p&gt;

One of her suggestions that leaps out as a potential helper here is to get a hotel room with some regularity, specifically for sex sessions. Try this. You have the funds, and you’ve seen that your sex life thrives outside of your typical environment. Of course, getting a hotel room nearby where you live isn’t quite the same thing as going on vacation, but perhaps the change of scenery will be all you need to mutually turn on. If you find yourself still saddled by the stressors of life despite the venue change, consider working on relaxing—introducing meditation, a fitness regimen, or even some spa time might do the trick.&lt;/p&gt;

You can’t sit around expecting your sex life to magically improve. Why are you treating sex toys like single-use plastics? Bring them out again! What does it mean that you “tried to engage a little bit about our fantasies, but that hasn’t really gone anywhere?” Don’t let that conversation fall to the wayside so easily. Don’t be annoying or badger your wife, but be persistent enough to gain an understanding of where her mind is regarding the topic of your sex life and fantasies that could yet be realized. You’ll need her participation and effort, too, so if she’s not willing to do that, you can at least probe as to why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Over the past several decades, a hopeful story has played out across southern Uganda.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The number of children who've lost a parent has plummeted, from nearly one in four in the early 2000s to just 6% in 2022.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;New research suggests the decline in orphanhood – defined as the loss of at least one parent – was driven by HIV foreign aid programs.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I'm about 70 now," says study co-author Dr. David Serwadda of Makerere University in Uganda. "I've never seen a program intervention that has had this huge impact."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Serwadda was working in Uganda during the mid-1990s, when the HIV pandemic was claiming more than 100,000 lives each year.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"I remember visiting what looked like an abandoned household, we just kept shouting 'is anybody home,' " he says. Three children came out, aged 9, 7 and 6. "We asked, 'Where are the parents?' The parents were gone."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Back then, a child whose mother had HIV was about 20 times more likely to become orphaned than a child with an HIV-negative mom. Kids orphaned by AIDS suffer many consequences, says Aleya Khalifa, an epidemiologist at Columbia University and study co-author. They're more likely to face stigma, drop out of school or live in poverty, she says. "You start to see a cycle of vulnerability."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;U.S.-funded aid programs, primarily the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR, &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X(25)00440-1/fulltext" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;broke that cycle&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for many kids, according to Khalifa and Serwadda's study published in &lt;em&gt;The Lancet Global Health&lt;/em&gt;. Now, children living with HIV-positive moms are just twice as likely to be orphaned, down from 20 times more likely.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The findings are just so clear," says &lt;a href="https://publichealth.stonybrookmedicine.edu/faculty/RachelKidman" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Rachel Kidman&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a social epidemiologist at Stony Brook University who wasn't involved in the research. While she says the study can't draw a definitive causal link, "this decline in orphanhood due to HIV is absolutely because adults have access to life-saving antiretroviral drugs."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The results also underline what's now at risk because of the &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goats-and-soda/2025/01/25/g-s1-44762/pepfar-trump-hiv-foreign-aid" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Trump administration's cuts&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to foreign aid and &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goats-and-soda/2025/07/26/g-s1-79083/pepfar-hiv-aids-rescission" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;uncertainty around the future&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of HIV funding, says Kidman.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Domestic governments and charitable foundations only have so many resources to sort of plug those holes, and I'm not seeing other high income countries stepping up," says Kidman. "I think the consequences for children are going to be very dire."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tracking orphanhood&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;To understand how HIV treatments affected orphanhood, Khalifa and her colleagues turned to a &lt;a href="https://www.rhsp.org/rccs-study-1" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;long-running study&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in Rakai District, a rural region of southern Uganda that abuts Lake Victoria. Since 1995, researchers there have been gathering data about births, deaths and HIV status among households. All told, the team followed over 90,000 kids, tracking the number of new orphans up to 2022.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Before 2004, these HIV treatments weren't available, and orphanhood in the area was very high. Afterwards, these drugs started to trickle out to communities, but only to the very sick. In 2014, the World Health Organization expanded eligibility to everyone living with HIV.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"That steep, steep drop was actually quite impressive to see after ART became universally available from 2014," says Khalifa.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Of course, parents can die from causes other than HIV. But roughly 70% of new orphans had HIV-positive parents before 2004. That dropped to about 11% after 2015.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"This outstanding paper is testament to the incredible impacts of PEPFAR, the Global Fund and the global HIV response," says &lt;a href="https://www.spi.ox.ac.uk/people/professor-lucie-cluver" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Lucie Cluver&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a social scientist at the University of Oxford who wasn't involved in the study. Over the past two decades, PEPFAR invested &lt;a href="https://ug.usembassy.gov/the-u-s-presidents-emergency-plan-for-aids-relief-pepfar/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;$3 billion dollars&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in Uganda — and over $100 billion around the globe.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But the future of PEPFAR is in doubt after the Trump administration's dismantling of foreign aid.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Protecting PEPFAR now will protect millions of children from orphanhood," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The future of PEPFAR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The Trump administration's abrupt and drastic cuts to foreign aid last year, disrupted many HIV treatment programs across Africa, including in Uganda.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"The speed at which this came down completely took us off guard," says Serwadda. Health care workers in these programs could no longer deliver drugs because they weren't getting paid, he says. "The drugs were in stock, but people were not available."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That meant many went without treatment, he says. Eventually, many programs resumed, he says, albeit with tighter budgets. Some programs completely shut down, he says. He and other researchers are assessing the fallout.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I'll be very surprised if we don't see the impact, mainly through patients losing their treatment," he says – leading to a rebound of HIV that can increase transmission and death.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In a statement, the State Department told NPR that "PEPFAR continues to provide life-saving HIV testing, care, and treatment services for anyone living with HIV, and anyone already receiving treatment through PEPFAR can remain on treatment."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The statement added: "The most effective way to prevent HIV-related orphanhood is to keep parents alive. The new global health [agreements] do just that by prioritizing lifesaving HIV medicines – including antiretroviral therapies like Lenacapavir – and the frontline workers who deliver them."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The U.S. is currently negotiating health agreements with individual countries that transition responsibility for HIV program funding to national governments. In December, it signed an agreement with Uganda to invest up to &lt;a href="https://www.state.gov/releases/office-of-the-spokesperson/2025/12/strengthening-health-ties-with-uganda-and-lesotho-under-the-america-first-global-health-strategy" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;$1.7 billion&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; over the next five years to combat infectious diseases.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In terms of sheer dollars, it's about a 25-30% reduction compared to PEPFAR funding, says Serwadda. Major questions remain about how the transition could go, but he holds out hope.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"If, and this is a big if, this is actually implemented according to the memorandum, it will be very good for Uganda," he says, since country-level ownership of the program would make it more sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But he's worried. "Our valley of death is in the transition," he says. "There's so many things that can go wrong. It may not go at the speed it should be, or with the attention, the resources that we will need and the political support and leadership that it will require. Many dots need to be well aligned for us to do this."&lt;/p&gt;

It had become her home base — the place she kept returning to between travels — and she was finally easing into a routine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her days were slow and intentional. She’d start her mornings with yoga and a nourishing breakfast before riding her motorcycle to the beach, where she’d walk along the shore and lie in the sun. Later, she’d head home to edit videos or work with clients, squeeze in a gym session, then return to the beach once more for sunset — a daily ritual she rarely missed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was perfect,” she tells PEOPLE exclusively. “I was finally building a routine and a sense of stability that felt really good.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vivian Nosovitsky&lt;/p&gt; Vivian Nosovitsky snaps a selfie&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;She was also building something else: community. Nosovitsky had grown close to the people around town and always looked forward to seeing familiar faces. Free-spirited and open to new opportunities, she was just about to launch a new coaching offer when everything changed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One morning around 2 a.m., Nosovitsky woke up with intense pain in her eye.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was watering, swollen and extremely uncomfortable,” she recalls. “I thought it might go away if I slept it off — but I never fell back asleep. The pain just kept getting worse.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Light sensitivity quickly became unbearable. She put on sunglasses immediately, unable to tolerate even minimal brightness. After a few days with no improvement — and no relief from the drops prescribed at a small urgent care clinic — she knew something was seriously wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She traveled 40 minutes to a larger hospital, where doctors told her she had an ulcer in her eye and prescribed additional medication. But her condition rapidly worsened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My eye was turning gray,” she says. “I knew something was extremely off.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vivian Nosovitsky&lt;/p&gt; Vivian Nosovitsky's eye&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;When she returned the next day, doctors urged her to seek urgent, intensive care in another city three hours away. Unwilling to go through it alone, Nosovitsky instead flew to Querétaro to stay with a friend, who helped care for her and took her to a specialized eye hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There, doctors performed a corneal scraping. Days later, lab results confirmed the diagnosis: &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/21560-acanthamoeba-keratitis" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:acanthamoeba keratitis;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;acanthamoeba keratitis&lt;/a&gt;, a rare and aggressive eye infection caused by a parasite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I honestly didn’t even know what that meant at first,” Nosovitsky says. “I had never heard of it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She soon learned the parasite likely entered her eye through tap water and an opening caused by contact lens use, and that it was, quite literally, eating away at her cornea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pain was excruciating. Light became intolerable. She was forced to stay in complete darkness, stripped of everything she loved: movement, the beach, working out and running her online business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’ve had very low energy,” she says. “Physically, mentally, it’s affected every part of me. There were days I didn’t want to do anything but lie there and wish it would be over.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Treatment required medicated eye drops every single hour, around the clock. Even at night, she had to wake herself to administer them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I haven’t slept properly in weeks,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vivian Nosovitsky&lt;/p&gt; Vivian Nosovitsky at the doctor&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The experience pushed her to some of the lowest points she’d ever known. Even hospital appointments were overwhelming, with bright lights leaving her drained and overstimulated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When I realized I couldn’t see out of my right eye, that was terrifying,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Never miss a story — sign up for &lt;a href="https://people.com/people-news-daily-newsletter-sign-up-8692701" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:PEOPLE's free daily newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;PEOPLE's free daily newsletter&lt;/a&gt; to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throughout it all, Nosovitsky chose to share her journey online. Vulnerability, she says, has always mattered to her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re so drowned in fake content and filtered lives,” she says. “I wanted to be real.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She posted on TikTok — the platform where her social media career first took off — and felt a strong intuition that the videos would resonate. They did. Her story quickly went viral, amassing millions of views and drawing an outpouring of support to her &lt;a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-me-save-my-eye-from-this-eye-eating-parasite?attribution_id=sl:0b5d4f73-28bf-4459-8c18-2378d34f4bc5&amp;amp;lang=en_US&amp;amp;ts=1767657984&amp;amp;utm_campaign=man_today_first_time_share&amp;amp;utm_content=amp17_control&amp;amp;utm_medium=customer&amp;amp;utm_source=sms" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:GoFundMe;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;GoFundMe&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People also flooded her comments and DMs with prayers, encouragement and stories of their own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I didn’t expect this level of kindness,” she says. “People just want to connect.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ironically, she says, even as she lost her vision, she gained visibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Even though I can’t see, I’m being seen more than ever,” she says. “It stripped away all the masks and brought me back to myself.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead, Nosovitsky holds onto hope, both for healing and awareness. She believes mindset and surrender will carry her through whatever comes next, whether that means avoiding surgery or accepting a longer road to recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Above all, she hopes people take away a renewed sense of gratitude and a warning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You don’t realize how much you should’ve appreciated something until it’s gone,” she says, urging others to take eye health and contact lens hygiene seriously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And she credits one thing above all else for getting her through the darkest moments: community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I wouldn’t have survived this without it,” she says. “The women who cared for me in Mexico, the people cooking for me, supporting me — and even the online community praying and visualizing my healing. The power of community is stronger than anything.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://people.com/21-year-old-woman-learns-eye-pain-is-actually-a-parasite-eating-her-cornea-exclusive-11882329" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:People;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;People&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 14:10:44 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMie0FVX3lxTE9tT1BQVUhKTC0xNlNjZGtwX0lsUzlWLV9fRVVxWHZDS2w4S3JYemFHanNsbXhxeE9KbURIYnlhSGpoYUJMUl9RanJJWU5kVDA4Y3VYQWwwd2wydngtTmlneU1FbDFVT0hLRndBelZRTmVick9YdU4xaGxEYw</guid></item><item><title>随着另一个国家开始进行前列腺癌筛查， NHS面临压力-《每日电讯报》</title><link>https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2026/01/14/nhs-yet-another-country-begins-prostate-cancer-screening/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="component article-body-text    " data-test="article-body-text"&gt;
  
  

	

	
	

	
	



  
  
    &lt;p&gt;The announcement in Croatia was made by Marija Bubaš, a health minister, and Krunoslav Capak, director of the Croatian Institute of Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr Capak said: “In the two-year pilot project for prostate cancer, we achieved the goals and defined the weak points, and we know what needs to be prepared for a successful national programme – from administration, through diagnostics and the division of roles in each step of screening.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Velimir Korak, president of the Croatian Society of Prostate Cancer Patients, said: “We are very pleased to welcome the launch of the national screening programme next year because early detection enables more effective treatment and significantly improves the quality of life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Department of Health and Social Care spokesman said: “The Secretary of State has been clear he wants to see screening in place for the most common cancer in men, provided this is backed by evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He is examining the evidence and arguments in the draft recommendation thoroughly, bringing together those with differing views, ahead of the final recommendation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In the meantime, we will keep making progress on cutting cancer waiting times and investing in research into prostate cancer detection – in the last 12 months, 195,000 more patients received a diagnosis for suspected cancer on time. We are also providing funding to the £42 million TRANSFORM trial, which has the potential to revolutionise prostate cancer screening, cutting out harmful side effects and making screening far more accurate.”&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;More than 9 out of 10 &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimer-s-disease"&gt;Alzheimer's cases&lt;/a&gt; could be driven by specific variations in a single gene and the protein it produces, a new study reveals, suggesting that treatments targeting this well-known gene could prevent the disease from developing in the majority of instances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The gene in question, &lt;em&gt;APOE&lt;/em&gt;, has &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/this-rare-gene-variant-seems-to-protect-you-from-alzheimers-disease"&gt;long been associated&lt;/a&gt; with  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="188646" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; risk. What's new here is the way the different variations of the gene have been analysed and mapped against the chances of developing Alzheimer's. It turns out that the &lt;em&gt;APOE&lt;/em&gt; combination we're born with could be even more important than previously realized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers led by a team from University College London (UCL) took a fresh look at the three main variations of the &lt;em&gt;APOE&lt;/em&gt; gene: ε2 (linked to a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3233/JAD-201205"&gt;protective effect&lt;/a&gt; against cognitive decline), ε3 (historically considered the normal or neutral version), and ε4 (already known to significantly increase Alzheimer's risk).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/junk-dna-could-hide-switches-that-allow-alzheimers-to-take-hold"&gt;'Junk' DNA Could Hide Switches That Allow Alzheimer's to Take Hold&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found, based on four genetic datasets covering almost 470,000 people, that ε3 isn't actually neutral – it can be considered a major &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/the-1-risk-factor-for-alzheimers-disease-may-not-be-what-you-think"&gt;risk factor&lt;/a&gt;. Part of the reason this hasn't been flagged before is that it's the most common variant of &lt;em&gt;APOE&lt;/em&gt;, found in around three-quarters of the population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When we consider the contributions of ε3 and ε4, we can see that &lt;em&gt;APOE&lt;/em&gt; potentially has a role in almost all Alzheimer's disease," &lt;a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/2026/jan/most-alzheimers-cases-linked-variants-single-gene"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; genetic epidemiologist Dylan Williams, from UCL.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The ε4 variant of &lt;em&gt;APOE&lt;/em&gt; is well recognised as harmful by dementia researchers, but much disease would not occur without the additional impact of the common ε3 allele, which has been typically misperceived as neutral in terms of Alzheimer's risk."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_188649" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-188649" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/AlzheimersChart.jpg" alt="Alzheimer's chart" class="wp-image-188649 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/AlzheimersChart.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/AlzheimersChart-569x675.jpg 569w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/AlzheimersChart-600x711.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-188649" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Population estimates of the proportion of Alzheimer's disease attributable to different risk-associated genes suggested certain &lt;em&gt;APOE&lt;/em&gt; variations (far left, ε3 &amp;amp; ε4) are linked to most cases. (Williams et al., &lt;em&gt;NPJ Dement.&lt;/em&gt;, 2026)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everyone inherits two copies of the &lt;em&gt;APOE&lt;/em&gt; gene, one from each parent, meaning six combinations are possible: ε2 / ε2 is the most protective against Alzheimer's, while ε4 / ε4 &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimers-gene-doesnt-guarantee-dementia-heres-what-you-can-do-to-reduce-risk"&gt;raises the risk of the disease&lt;/a&gt; the most. The majority of people are somewhere in between, depending on the&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;combination they inherit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crucially, this &lt;em&gt;APOE&lt;/em&gt; combination alters the structure and function of the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apolipoprotein_E"&gt;protein produced&lt;/a&gt;. Those proteins then influence certain brain activities already linked to Alzheimer's, including neuron repair, inflammation control, and the clearing away of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-alzheimers-treatment-clears-plaques-from-brains-of-mice-within-hours"&gt;amyloid-beta protein plaques&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers suggest that targeting this gene or its protein products may be a way to stop Alzheimer's from happening in the first place – and bring more people down to the risk level associated with ε2 / ε2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Intervening on the &lt;em&gt;APOE&lt;/em&gt; gene specifically, or the molecular pathway between the gene and the disease, could have great, and probably under-appreciated, potential for preventing or treating a large majority of Alzheimer's disease," &lt;a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/2026/jan/most-alzheimers-cases-linked-variants-single-gene"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Williams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"The extent to which &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;APOE&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt; has been researched in relation to Alzheimer's or as a drug target has clearly not been proportionate to its full importance."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There could be implications for &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/almost-half-of-dementia-cases-avoidable-by-addressing-14-risk-factors-major-study-finds"&gt;dementia&lt;/a&gt; more broadly, too: Almost half of all dementia cases could be attributed to this &lt;em&gt;APOE&lt;/em&gt; gene, the data shows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_188824" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-188824" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/DementiaUmbrellaTerm-642x361.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-188824 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/DementiaUmbrellaTerm-642x361.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/DementiaUmbrellaTerm-1200x675.jpg 1200w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/DementiaUmbrellaTerm-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/DementiaUmbrellaTerm-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/DementiaUmbrellaTerm-600x338.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/DementiaUmbrellaTerm.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-188824" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Alzheimer's disease is the most common type of dementia.

Other environmental and lifestyle factors linked to the disease – such as &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/the-1-risk-factor-for-alzheimers-disease-may-not-be-what-you-think"&gt;obesity&lt;/a&gt;, social isolation, and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/lead-alzheimers-risk-for-under-65s-could-be-reduced-with-good-curtains"&gt;a lack of sleep&lt;/a&gt; – likely add to genetic risks through complex interactions, although we don't know how.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regardless, the new study suggests that if present, &lt;em&gt;APOE&lt;/em&gt; ε3 and ε4 have a stronger influence than previously thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Wi&lt;span&gt;thout the contributions of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;APOE&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt; ε3 and ε4, most Alzheimer's disease cases would not occur, irrespective of what other factors are inherited or experienced by carriers of these variants throughout life," Williams &lt;a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/2026/jan/most-alzheimers-cases-linked-variants-single-gene"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;, based on the team's population estimates.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's a lot of work ahead if researchers are to pursue &lt;em&gt;APOE&lt;/em&gt; because &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/world-first-us-baby-treated-with-personalized-crispr-gene-editing"&gt;targeting genes&lt;/a&gt; and proteins with treatments isn't easy – and any kind of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/breakthrough-gene-therapy-slows-huntingtons-disease-by-75"&gt;gene therapy&lt;/a&gt; must be carefully controlled and assessed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But with these new findings, we may be looking at a significant shift &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/one-of-our-biggest-hopes-for-alzheimers-treatment-doesnt-seem-to-work"&gt;in Alzheimer's research&lt;/a&gt; that has so far struggled to make much headway in finding ways to effectively treat the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"With complex diseases like Alzheimer's and other diseases that cause dementia, there will be more than one way to reduce disease occurrence," &lt;a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/2026/jan/most-alzheimers-cases-linked-variants-single-gene"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Williams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We should explore many options by which we might modify Alzheimer's and dementia risk, including but not limited to strategies related to &lt;em&gt;APOE&lt;/em&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s44400-025-00045-9"&gt;&lt;em&gt;NPJ Dementia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE — Flu season is gaining momentum across the country, including in King County, where health officials say the warning signs are impossible to ignore.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In early December, King County Public Health reported approximately 300 emergency department visits per week for flu-like illnesses. By early January, that number had climbed to more than 560.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re seeing emergency department visits for flu. We’re seeing hospitalizations for flu. And we’ve had 10 deaths so far in King County due to flu, all in adults,” said Dr. Sandra Valenciano, health officer and interim director of King County Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vaccination rates remain a concern. Just over 31% of King County residents have received a flu shot so far this season, slightly lower than at this point last year and part of a longer-term downward trend in flu vaccination, Valenciano said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A mutated strain of influenza A, H3N2 subclade K, is surging worldwide. This highly contagious strain spreads easily and changes rapidly. Historically, H3N2-dominated seasons have led to higher hospitalization rates, especially among young children, older adults, and people with underlying health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the circulating strain has drifted slightly from the one targeted by this year’s vaccine, doctors emphasize the flu shot remains one of the most effective tools for preventing severe illness.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It still does what it’s supposed to do — keep you out of the hospital,” said Dr. Vin Gupta, a public health physician. “It’s not perfect, but it reduces the risk of hospitalization by 40 to 50%, especially for people who are medically higher risk.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Children are a particular focus this season, especially as vaccination rates continue to lag. According to&lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/aapnews/news/34114/CDC-9-children-have-died-of-flu-this-season?autologincheck=redirected"&gt; the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)&lt;/a&gt;, nine children have already died from the flu nationwide this season.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year was one of the deadliest on record for pediatric patients nationwide. The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7436a2.htm"&gt;CDC reports&lt;/a&gt; that 289 children died from the flu, which is the highest number since tracking began in 2004. Nearly nine in 10 of those children were not fully vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;King County Public Health data shows that flu shots are highest among infants, with about 43% vaccinated so far. However, rates drop for older kids, with 32% of 5- to 11-year-olds and 27% of teens vaccinated. Vaccination rates have declined each season since 2022–2023, leaving many children more at risk. Parents should also keep in mind that kids between 6 months to 8 years old may need two doses, four weeks apart, to be fully protected, especially if it is their first time or their vaccination history is unclear.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Flu is a risk every year,” Valenciano said. “Every year, people are hospitalized. Every year, people die. Many of those outcomes are preventable. Getting vaccinated is the best way to protect yourself and your family.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flu season often peaks later in the winter and can stretch into March. Since it takes about two weeks for the body to build immunity after vaccination, health officials urge people to get their shot as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They recommend staying home if you feel sick, getting tested if symptoms like fever, body aches, or a cough develop, and considering wearing a mask in crowded indoor spaces. These precautions are especially important for people at higher risk, including children under 2, adults 65 and older, pregnant people, and those with conditions such as heart disease or chronic lung disease.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doctors also note that antiviral medications like Tamiflu can lessen the severity and shorten the length of illness when taken within the first 48 hours.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those who still need a flu shot, free vaccination options are available across King County.

From objects that disappear to injuries that require surgery, doctors say the biggest problem isn’t curiosity or experimentation. It’s waiting too long to get help because you feel ashamed. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Most sex-related injuries are preventable, and none of them should be a source of shame,”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://drtelx.com/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Martina Ambardjieva" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="69655155e4b0f3f37e7791bd" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://drtelx.com/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="0"&gt; &lt;span&gt;Dr. Martina Ambardjieva&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, a urologist and ER physician, told HuffPost&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. “&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;What does cause problems is waiting too long to seek care because of embarrassment.

It most often happens when the penis slips out during thrusting and forcefully hits a partner’s pelvis.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“A penile fracture occurs when the tunica albuginea, the tough fibrous sheath surrounding the erectile tissue, tears,” she explains. “When the penis is erect, that tissue becomes thin and stretched, making it vulnerable to sudden bending or impact — even though there’s no bone inside.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If someone delays seeking care, the torn tissue can heal improperly. “That can lead to permanent curvature, painful erections, or long-term erectile dysfunction,” Ambardjieva said. “This is the one sexual injury where time really matters.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Objects That Get ‘Lost’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Ambardjieva said foreign objects getting “lost” in the body are a routine part of ER and gynecology work.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I’ve removed all kinds of items that weren’t designed to go inside the body — cucumbers, carrots, sprays — and I’ve also seen objects in the male urethra, like a pencil,” she said. “People are usually terrified and embarrassed, but it’s more common than they think.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The problem often comes down to&lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/best-anal-sex-toys_l_64640ccfe4b056fd46d62ce8" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name=" using objects without a flared base" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="69655155e4b0f3f37e7791bd" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="64640ccfe4b056fd46d62ce8" data-vars-target-content-type="buzz" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="2"&gt; using objects without a flared base&lt;/a&gt;, smooth shape, or any kind of safety stop.

The vaginal canal is a closed space, so objects can get stuck but won’t travel deeper into the body. “The rectum, however, has no anatomical stop and creates suction, meaning objects can be pulled further inside,” Ambardjieva explains. “The urethra is narrow and delicate, making insertions particularly dangerous.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re embarrassed to come into the hospital because you’ve inserted something that’s become stuck, Ambardjieva hopes you’ll reconsider and not let the stigma keep you from getting care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“It’s important to normalize this. We remove lost objects every week in the emergency and urology practice,” Ambardjieva said. “It’s a common medical issue — not something to be ashamed of.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vaginal Tears And Bleeding After Sex&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Small vaginal tears are another frequent reason for ER visits, especially among &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/sex-over-50-women_l_690f9c2ce4b03cb129003a74" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="postmenopausal women" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="69655155e4b0f3f37e7791bd" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="690f9c2ce4b03cb129003a74" data-vars-target-content-type="buzz" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="3"&gt;postmenopausal women&lt;/a&gt; or anyone dealing with vaginal dryness.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Even a small tear can bleed more than people expect, which really scares them,” Ambardjieva said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Friction, &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/the-best-lubes-for-women-vaginal-dryness_l_5e3aea99c5b6b5fb438b4dd3" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="insufficient lubrication" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="69655155e4b0f3f37e7791bd" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="5e3aea99c5b6b5fb438b4dd3" data-vars-target-content-type="buzz" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="4"&gt;insufficient lubrication&lt;/a&gt;, or a tense pelvic floor can all cause micro-tears. She notes that water-based lubricants can dry out quickly, increasing friction, while silicone-based lubes stay slippery longer and can reduce tearing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Bleeding, Ambardjieva said, becomes more concerning if it doesn’t slow, comes with large clots, severe pain, lightheadedness or difficulty urinating.

Without treatment within about four to six hours, the testicle can be permanently damaged or lost. Some men are more vulnerable because of anatomical variations that allow the testicle to rotate more freely inside the scrotum.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Circulation is blocked due to the twisting of the spermatic cord,” Ambardjieva explains. “Without rapid treatment, usually within four to six hours, there is a real risk of permanently losing the testicle, because of lost lasting ischemia (insufficient blood flow).” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Condom Mishaps&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Broken condoms or&lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/condom-stuck-what-to-do_l_5cb72174e4b098b9a2dd5d5c" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name=" condoms that get stuck inside" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="69655155e4b0f3f37e7791bd" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="5cb72174e4b098b9a2dd5d5c" data-vars-target-content-type="buzz" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="5"&gt; condoms that get stuck inside&lt;/a&gt; are another source of anxious ER visits.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“These are usually very easy for us to remove safely,” Ambardjieva said, adding that problems tend to come from incorrect sizing, not enough lubrication, expired condoms, heat exposure, or using oil-based products that weaken latex.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bruising from Oral Sex&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Not all sex injuries come from penetration.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I’ve seen bruising and swelling just from overly enthusiastic suction,” Ambardjieva said&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;. “&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;It’s usually harmless, but if the swelling is severe or the penis starts bending, get checked.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Broken capillaries can leave marks that look alarming but usually fade within days.

Ross,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; an assistant professor at the University of Missouri, has seen some extreme cases.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several years ago in St. Louis, he said he treated a patient who inserted his pet gerbil into his rectum with lubrication: “He ended up in the ER with rectal bleeding. We were able to get the gerbil out, but unfortunately, the gerbil wasn’t so lucky; he had already suffocated.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In December 2024, Ross said he treated two patients on the same Christmas shift whose wives were out of town. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“One had inserted a full-sized LED lightbulb into his rectum. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;It required anesthesia and surgical removal,” he said. “Shortly after, another patient arrived with his wife’s vibrator lodged inside. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Both myself and the other ER doc on shift tried again, but no luck, we had to call the surgeon back. I remember he remarked it was a pretty fancy one, rechargeable batteries. I can’t imagine how those conversations went when their wives got back in town.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;So it’s unsurprising that Ross encourages people to come to the ER if they run into an issue like this (or a less extreme one), but also to be more proactive about safety when it comes to the rear end. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;“If you’re into inserting things into your rectum, use devices designed for that so they don’t get lost,” he said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Bottom Line&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Both doctors stress that shame is what causes the real harm, wacky hijinks aside.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Sexual injuries and accidents are far more common than people realize,” Ambardjieva said. “Emergency clinicians truly aren’t judging.

It was the early 1980s, and a young boy had been brought in with symptoms of a severe infection that was spreading through his body, damaging multiple organs and tissues. But his doctors could find no trace of a pathogen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05889-1" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-026-00082-1/d41586-026-00082-1_16014370.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;The ghost of influenza past and the hunt for a universal vaccine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The boy was flown to Levin’s hospital for further tests. To the surprise of Levin and his colleagues, the culprit was a common bacterium: &lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium fortuitum&lt;/i&gt;, which lives in water and soil, and is usually harmless. “Everyone’s exposed to them, but almost no one gets ill,” says Levin, who is now at Imperial College London. Despite aggressive treatment, the boy eventually passed away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This case illustrates a question that has plagued doctors for decades: &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-01655-0" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-01655-0" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;why do some people become severely ill from infections&lt;/a&gt; that leave others unscathed? What is it about some &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00128-w" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00128-w" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;people’s immune systems&lt;/a&gt; that makes them susceptible? And how might these variations affect how doctors try to prevent or treat disease?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As it turned out, the boy from Malta had a brother and a cousin who had also fallen severely ill with mycobacteria infections. After years of searching, Levin and his colleagues eventually identified what made these children so sick: a genetic mutation affecting a receptor for interferon-γ, an immune molecule with myriad functions, including regulating inflammation&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Not long after that, a group in France discovered that similar mutations were responsible for rare cases of severe disease caused by another mycobacterial species — this time, a weakened form used as a tuberculosis vaccine&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR2" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers have since amassed a broad library of mutations in hundreds of genes that underlie ‘inborn errors of immunity’ (IEIs) and that make millions of people around the world susceptible to a wide range of infectious diseases and &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03885-w%5d%20that" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03885-w%5d%20that" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;immune-linked ailments&lt;/a&gt; that many people can simply shrug off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It might seem obvious that differences in each person’s immune system can affect how well they fight off pathogens. But uncovering the specific causes of this variation has enabled researchers to find ways to treat — and even prevent — severe infections that used to seem like random cases of bad luck, says Isabelle Meyts, an oncologist and immunologist who studies IEIs at the university KU Leuven in Belgium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The discoveries have already begun to change clinical practice, for instance allowing doctors to genetically screen people for relevant mutations or supplement missing immune factors. And scientists are continuing to piece together the many ways in which genetic factors contribute to infectious diseases — especially in life-threatening cases. “What we’re realizing more and more is that there are probably inherited factors that predict who’s going to have severe reactions,” says Michael Abers, a physician-scientist studying infectious disease at Montefiore Einstein in New York City.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;From germ to host&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The germ theory of disease, popularized by Louis Pasteur in the nineteenth century, was revolutionary. The realization that microorganisms, invisible to the naked eye, could make people ill spurred public-health measures such as better hygiene, vaccines and anti-microbial drugs, which drastically improved outcomes for people with infectious diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But even with these tools, there are still people — particularly some children and older people — who become sick and die from infections that are typically preventable or treatable, suggesting that there are limitations to focusing mostly on pathogens in the fight against infectious disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the 1950s, some scientists were already drawing attention to the importance of the host, especially in cases in which ordinarily harmless microbes caused disease. Researchers have since discovered that one of the most important determinants of infection susceptibility might be a person’s genes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;picture class="embed intensity--high"&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="//media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-026-00082-1/d41586-026-00082-1_51939358.jpg?as=webp 767w, //media.nature.com/lw319/magazine-assets/d41586-026-00082-1/d41586-026-00082-1_51939358.jpg?as=webp 319w" sizes="(max-width: 319px) 319px, (min-width: 1023px) 100vw,  767px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img class="figure__image" alt="Coloured scanning electron micrograph showing a blue sphere with yellow tiny spots." loading="lazy" src="//media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-026-00082-1/d41586-026-00082-1_51939358.jpg"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;p class="figure__caption u-sans-serif"&gt;&lt;span class="mr10"&gt;SARS-CoV-2 virus particles (yellow) infect a cell (blue).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Credit: NIAID/NIH/SPL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the most famous demonstrations of genetic mutations driving infection outcome is &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-01257-9" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-01257-9" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID)&lt;/a&gt;, an inherited disease that leaves people without a functioning immune system and that is linked to mutations in more than a dozen genes. If left untreated, it typically leads to death before the age of two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, SCID is rare, occurring in an estimated 1 in 50,000 or so births. But inherited mutations that can cause problems in the immune system are much more common. Over the past few decades, researchers have found inborn errors of immunity linked to more than 500 genes&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR3" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. In addition to infectious-disease susceptibility, these mutations are involved in other immune-system abnormalities, including autoimmune diseases and allergies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some mutations dampen the immune system and diminish its ability to fight off infections. But others can cause people to be hyper-responsive to infection, which can lead to runaway immune reactions that can turn deadly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although some IEIs can cause a generalized vulnerability to pathogens, most of them put people at risk from specific microbes, such as mycobacteria, avian influenza virus, herpes simplex virus and the bacterium &lt;i&gt;Neisseria meningitidis&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Each infection has a different set of mechanisms,” says Steven Holland, physician-scientist specializing in infectious disease at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in Bethesda, Maryland. “And unsurprisingly, there are different genes that speak to” different infections. The mutations known so far tend to cause severe disease, although some have been linked to recurrent milder infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On top of that, there are genes that can boost a person’s ability to fend off pathogens. For example, a mutation in the gene encoding CCR5, a receptor on the surface of white blood cells, makes people resistant to HIV&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR4" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; (although it increases the risk of severe infection with West Nile virus). And mutations in the gene encoding FUT2, a protein located in the mucosa of the gut, helps people to fend off norovirus, a highly contagious gastrointestinal infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;An expanding universe&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2020, during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, it was clear that some infected people became severely ill, whereas others got barely a sniffle. A massive consortium of scientists, led by paediatrician and immunologist Jean-Laurent Casanova at the Rockefeller University in New York City, discovered that around 10% of people with severe COVID-19 harboured autoantibodies — rogue proteins that turn against a person’s own body. These autoantibodies attacked signalling molecules that help to mobilize the immune response, tamping down the immune defences&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR5" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Casanova and his colleagues have since found the same autoantibodies in a subset of people who develop severe disease from seasonal influenza, West Nile and many other diseases, as well as in those who experience rare adverse reactions to live vaccines, such as the yellow fever vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-00086-1" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-026-00082-1/d41586-026-00082-1_23944226.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;How your first brush with COVID warps your immunity&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s not known exactly why and how autoantibodies develop. Some scientists, including Casanova, suspect that they might be the result of inherited or acquired mutations. He and others have identified some mutations that can give rise to these autoantibodies, such as deficiencies in various interferon-related genes. Whether such mutations can account for the majority of severe cases of these diseases remains to be seen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers are still working out the complex ways in which genetics contributes to infection outcome. Having a mutation doesn’t always make someone vulnerable: IEIs can behave unpredictably. Many people carry immunodeficiency-related mutations without ever experiencing their effects — a phenomenon known as ‘incomplete penetrance’. And although most IEIs with severe effects become apparent in childhood, some might lie dormant for decades. In unpublished work, Meyts and her team identified a person who has a mutation that is linked to inflammatory disease, but whose symptoms emerged only after a SARS-CoV-2 infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists are still working to identify which factors influence the severity of IEIs. In a 2025 study, Dusan Bogunovic, a paediatric immunologist at Columbia University in New York City, and his colleagues discovered that, in about 4% of IEIs, the disease-causing variant can be expressed differently in different cells&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR6" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. The team also found evidence that this process might be regulated by epigenetic mechanisms, which are influenced by environmental factors — suggesting that, not only might the same IEIs manifest differently in different people, but the effects of these mutations could change over a person’s lifetime. Bogunovic’s team is currently searching for the factors, such as inflammation or certain infections, that might control this variable allele expression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Treat and prevent&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think ahead!&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s important to treat your brain like a retirement fund — the earlier you invest, the better it pays off. Building brain health with movement and mental curiosity helps keep your mind’s wiring strong and resilient over time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doctors.catholichealthli.org/provider/bruce-mayerson/2404955" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Dr. Bruce Mayerson&lt;/a&gt;, co-chair of neurosciences at &lt;a href="https://www.catholichealthli.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Catholic Health&lt;/a&gt; and the chief of neurology at &lt;a href="https://www.catholichealthli.org/st-catherine-siena-hospital" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;St. Catherine of Siena Hospital&lt;/a&gt;, shares six major ways to mind your gray matter well before your hair goes gray.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;There are six major ways to mind your gray matter well before your hair goes gray. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Jack Forbes / NY Post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Eat this, not that…&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mayerson is a fan of the anti-inflammatory &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2023/11/01/health/6-easy-hacks-for-success-with-the-mediterranean-diet/"&gt;Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt;, which emphasizes fruits, vegetables, whole grains, beans, nuts and olive oil, with fish and poultry in moderation.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nuts, in particular, are &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/11/14/health/5-popular-nuts-ranked-by-nutritional-value-the-winner-is-clear/"&gt;packed with heart-healthy unsaturated fats&lt;/a&gt;, plant-based protein, fiber, vitamins and minerals. The doc recommended cashews, almonds and peanuts specifically.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Mediterranean diet also limits ultra-processed foods, refined grains like white bread and rice, unhealthy fats like butter, added sugars, alcohol and &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/08/20/health/red-and-processed-meats-linked-to-type-2-diabetes-risk-new-study/"&gt;red meat&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I don’t think it necessarily needs to be completely excluded,” Mayerson said of red meat. “It is a very good source of protein, but it’s also a high-fat food.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“So, in general, things like chicken and poultry are probably better, not to mention that in terms of cholesterol, red meat can also be an issue for people who are managing that lipid problem,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Stay social and optimistic&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A recent study out of the University of Florida found that your brain’s “true age” can shift dramatically&lt;br&gt;based on how you live — with optimism, restorative sleep, stress management and strong&lt;br&gt;social connections acting like powerful anti-aging tools.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This research underscores that optimism and stress management can meaningfully slow brain aging, while strong social connections play a powerful role in supporting brain health, especially as we grow older,” Mayerson noted.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Walk this way&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Aerobic (cardio) and anaerobic (strength/HIIT) exercises significantly benefit the brain by boosting blood flow, promoting new brain cells, enhancing the brain’s ability to change, improving memory and reducing cognitive decline — but that doesn’t mean you need to go nuts at the gym.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For aerobic activity, &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/10/30/health/all-the-benefits-you-get-from-walking-ranked-by-step-count/"&gt;walking at a brisk pace&lt;/a&gt; can be just as good as running. Mayerson recommends setting a daily walk goal — and sticking to it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“For my patients, I find that if you give them a goal, [like] you’re going to walk 2 miles every day or 3 miles every day, you’re going to do it at the same time each day,” he said. “You get into that sort of rhythm.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But if you’re thinking 18 holes at the local country club is meeting your movement quota, think again.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“A lot of people golf, and I think that’s great for your mind,” Mayerson said. “For the body, it may not be quite as effective because I think it’s hard on necks and backs, and you don’t really get any significant aerobic or anaerobic [benefit] unless you walk the golf course.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Exercise is important — but you don’t have to push yourself to your limit to reap the benefits. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;peopleimages.com – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Protect your head&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Seems pretty obvious — hitting your skull on pavement? Not so great for your brain. But too many people skip helmets when riding bikes and scooters.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I think that’s probably one of the riskiest behaviors you can do,” Mayerson said. “Even if you think you’re not going quickly on one of these things, if you’re doing 15 or 20 miles an hour and you hit your head, you can have a serious traumatic brain injury, not to mention, broken bones.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;E-bikes are often 5-10 miles per hour faster than regular bikes, while powerful e-scooters can reach 40 to 55 mph. Mayerson said he’s seen &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/07/23/health/e-bike-and-e-scooter-injuries-are-soaring-in-us-heres-why/"&gt;brain injuries&lt;/a&gt; range from concussions to hemorrhages and skull fractures.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“So helmets are very, very important, I can’t overemphasize that enough,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Keep reading!&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sure, it can be tempting to tune out — but staying informed on the news engages your mind and potentially lowers your risk of dementia, Mayerson said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Keeping yourself apprised of current events and being able to discuss these things with [family members] can lead to a little bit of controversy or something adversarial,” he added, “[but] keeping yourself in the loop, so to speak, is very important.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mayerson isn’t as sold on crosswords, Sudoku and other word games as a way to delay cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“You’ll be great at crosswords and things like that if you practice them — not so sure that it translates into a dramatic effect on your dementia or slowing [it] down,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Mayerson recommends regular sleep, but don’t take drugs to ease you into slumber.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Rawpixel.com – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Snooze without the booze&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Getting a good night’s rest is truly the coziest, comfiest way to stay healthy. &lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;REM sleep, in particular, helps the brain process and store new information and sort through emotional experiences. This is the sleep stage when most vivid dreaming occurs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you’re not catching enough ZZZs on your own, it may be tempting to raid your medicine cabinet to help yourself relax — but resist the urge.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“A lot of people use drugs like Xanax and Klonopin and things like that to sleep, and that’s not really a good idea,” Mayerson said. “Fatigue is a side effect of those medicines. They’re [anti-anxiety] drugs and should be used as such.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mayerson also &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/09/28/lifestyle/doctor-reveals-the-devastating-effects-wine-and-other-treats-can-have-on-your-sleep/"&gt;recommends against hitting the bottle&lt;/a&gt; before hitting the hay, as alcohol suppresses REM sleep.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“People think you sleep better after a few drinks; you actually sleep worse, and you probably don’t even realize it,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

In the &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/golden-retriever" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Golden Retriever;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Golden Retriever&lt;/a&gt; video, Teddy’s owner strings together small moments that look harmless, but feel wildly dramatic. The pooch poses, pouts, and flops with total commitment, like he knows he is being watched. Set to Daryl Hall &amp;amp; John Oates’ “You Make My Dreams (Come True),” quick cuts make each habit funnier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Owner proves Golden Retriever is a ‘weird pup sometimes’ in video&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The reel was shared by @aguyandagoldenn, a digital creator based in Greenville, South Carolina. Teddy is the star of the account, which boasts over 5.5 million followers. The latest post featuring the Golden Retriever went up one day ago with the caption, “He’s a weird pup sometimes…” It had 326.7K likes and 4.4K comments at the time of writing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Teddy’s video opens with the on-screen line, “Weird things I’ve caught my dog doing…” First comes “Staring at me like this…,” as the dog drops low and locks eyes. Next is “Holding his toy like a human…,” and the segment shows the pooch on a bench with paws up. He grips a plush like a trophy, and in a weird comic timing, the toy slips and falls like a normal human moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Then the edit jumps to “Sleeping in the bathtub…,” with Teddy curled into the tub like it is his bed. After that, “Stealing my socks…,” catches him carrying a sock, eyes wide. “Having a mirror stare off…” follows, as Teddy squares up to his own reflection. The final beat reads, “Whatever this is…,” while he rolls outside, legs in the air.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Fans replied fast in the comments. One user wrote, “Normal is boring!” too. Another said, “Teddyisms.” A third added, “Love that face.” One viewer asked, “I need to know what was going on when he decided to nap in the tub.” Another joked, “His face in the beginning like: oh no, hope this video doesn’t go viral.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The post &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com/news/202494-owner-catches-golden-retriever-doing-weirdest-things-video" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Owner Catches Golden Retriever Doing the ‘Weirdest Things’;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Owner Catches Golden Retriever Doing the ‘Weirdest Things’&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:DogTime;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;DogTime&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 10:39:30 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilwFBVV95cUxON0FtTHJBdTFFQzFJaG9LYUhqaHRGSU0tWER2dGIzZ3FWNl9yOU4zRTJPWjhTUjR5T3liS3ZkOHp4ZHE3YWdOakxQQlFJWm8xZlg1WFhSOEM0RERRcEpfRDlYVDZFNTJOTVZSMXNuSy0zeDFlQ0tfcW0xOHVkUjFrN1k1Yi1uT0pOSFFpbmpwQUVtVjVScnFR</guid></item><item><title>更好的癌症诊断结果：十分之七的患者存活5年或更长时间- Newsday</title><link>https://www.newsday.com/news/health/cancer-odds-improving-fcqsgl08</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="continue-reading ContinueReading_continue-reading__uTArZ active ContinueReading_active__SOMMR"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Less than a year ago, Jane Schlossman noticed pain in her leg she thought was due to a nerve issue. When it was followed by aches in her back and ribs, she got a PET scan in hopes of ruling out cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, the test confirmed the 61-year-old former marketing professional from Massapequa had adenocarcinoma of the lung — stage 4 and spread throughout her body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eating well and exercising, along with a positive attitude and a strong group of supportive friends, are helping her handle treatments and pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She's also undergone targeted therapies because doctors were able to map out her specific gene mutation — EGFR.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="summary secondaryBox_summary__WyWVT"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;WHAT NEWSDAY FOUND&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new data report from the American Cancer Society&lt;/strong&gt; found around 70% of people diagnosed with cancer are living five years or more, an increase from about 50% in the 1970s.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The increase is dramatic&lt;/strong&gt; for some cancers: 7% to 22% for people with liver cancer, 32% to 62% for myeloma and 15% to 28% for lung cancer.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Genetically profiling an individual’s tumor&lt;/strong&gt; and then using targeted therapies has helped lead to the increase in survival rates.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I have a family that needs me, things to do, things to accomplish," she said in an interview Tuesday. "What I have is terminal but it's not terminal right now."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chances cancer patients like Schlossman will live longer after diagnosis are better than ever before, according to &lt;a class="nd-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.cancer.org/research/cancer-facts-statistics/all-cancer-facts-figures/2026-cancer-facts-figures.html"&gt;a new report&lt;/a&gt; released Tuesday from the American Cancer Society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 70% of people diagnosed with cancer in the United States now survive for five years or more, a milestone experts said is due to improvements in treatments and screening. In the 1970s, about 50% of people diagnosed with cancer survived five years.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class="img Image_img__VNXHO landscape lazy"&gt;&lt;img alt="Jane Schlossman, of Massapequa, was diagnosed with a type of..." loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.newsday.com%2Fimage-service%2Fversion%2Fc%3AMWVmNzI5YjMtNDVkYS00%3AM2Y2NmMxYzItMTIyYy00%2Fcopy-of-licancer260114.jpg%3Ff%3DLandscape%2B16%253A9%26w%3D768%26q%3D1&amp;amp;w=828&amp;amp;q=80 1x, /_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.newsday.com%2Fimage-service%2Fversion%2Fc%3AMWVmNzI5YjMtNDVkYS00%3AM2Y2NmMxYzItMTIyYy00%2Fcopy-of-licancer260114.jpg%3Ff%3DLandscape%2B16%253A9%26w%3D768%26q%3D1&amp;amp;w=1920&amp;amp;q=80 2x" src="/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.newsday.com%2Fimage-service%2Fversion%2Fc%3AMWVmNzI5YjMtNDVkYS00%3AM2Y2NmMxYzItMTIyYy00%2Fcopy-of-licancer260114.jpg%3Ff%3DLandscape%2B16%253A9%26w%3D768%26q%3D1&amp;amp;w=1920&amp;amp;q=80"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jane Schlossman, of Massapequa, was diagnosed with a type of lung cancer less than a year ago. Credit: Courtesy Jane Schlossman&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts said steady funding for research and clinical trials — which have faced federal cuts in recent months — are key to continued progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the more striking findings, doctors said, were among people with high-risk cancers. For example, in the 1990s, people diagnosed with liver cancer had a 7% chance of living five years. Now it's 22%. For people diagnosed with myeloma, that survival rate almost doubled from 32% to 62%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The American Cancer Society’s annual &lt;a class="nd-link" target="_blank" href="https://acsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.3322/caac.70043"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; focuses on the survival rate among people with all cancers diagnosed between 2015 and 2021.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rebecca Siegel, lead author of the report and the senior scientific director of surveillance research at the American Cancer Society, said in a statement the "stunning victory" is the result of "decades of cancer research that provided clinicians with the tools to treat the disease more effectively, turning many cancers from a death sentence into a chronic disease."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Richard Barakat, physician in chief and executive director of the Lake Success-based Northwell Health Cancer Institute, said the gains highlight the importance of innovative therapies for patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Nowadays, you select appropriate treatments for cancer patients by profiling their tumors to determine if a particular genetic mutation is driving the growth of their cancer," said Barakat, who was not involved with the American Cancer Society report. "Once you determine which mutations are driving their cancer, you can select a drug that targets that mutation and potentially reverses its effect. That's what's known as precision medicine."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barakat also credited a "flood of immunotherapies" &lt;b&gt;—&lt;/b&gt; treatments that&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;help use the body’s own immune system to fight cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He noted the five-year survival rate for regional lung cancer nearly doubled, from 20% in the 1990s to 37%. Regional lung cancer includes cancer in the lungs, lymph nodes and other nearby parts of the body as opposed to distant or metastatic cancer, where the disease has spread far beyond the primary cancer site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Ryan Sugarman, a gastrointestinal medical oncologist and medical site director for Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center Nassau in Uniondale, said reduction in smoking and access to health care also helped drive up the survival rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Several of the cancers with [the] highest death rate have modifiable risk factors, and individuals can lower their risk by avoiding tobacco, minimizing alcohol, maintaining a healthy [weight] and receiving HPV vaccination, if age appropriate," he said in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The five-year survival rate for people with localized cancer increased from 54% to 69%. For people with metastatic cancer, where the disease has spread to other parts of their body, the survival rate increased from 17% to 35%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors emphasized the five-year survival rate does not mean the individual is cured of the disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The American Cancer Society estimates there will be 2.1 million new cancer diagnoses in the United States this year and more than 626,000 people will die from the disease. In New York, those estimates are 125,860 new cases of cancer and more than 31,140 deaths in 2026.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cancers with the highest mortality rates are lung, colorectal and pancreatic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sugarman pointed to several concerning trends such as the rise in incidence of colorectal cancer in people younger than 50 and disparities such as Black men having more than twice the risk of prostate cancer death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Continued progress is dependent on support for cancer research, as well as public awareness of risk factors for developing cancer," Sugarman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="byline Byline_byline__7W6Ao ux Byline_ux__K0907 bot Byline_bot__Vn8AK"&gt;&lt;span class="author-image Byline_author-image__kHthS"&gt;&lt;img alt="Lisa L.

                Wildfire smoke towered over burned houses from the Palisades Fire on Jan. 10, 2025. The fires burned for days, blanketing the region in toxic smoke. The health effects are just beginning to become clear.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Last January, fires were raging across Los Angeles, smothering some 20 million people across the region in toxic smoke and ash.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;LA residents worried that the air was toxic, the soil contaminated, and the water poisoned. Questions swirled about the health risks created by the burns — and there were few answers at hand from city, state or federal leaders.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Scientists from Los Angeles and around the country quickly scrambled into action as fires burned through the Pacific Palisades and Altadena. The priority, says UCLA physician and disaster researcher David Eisenman, was keeping people safe in the short term. But the fires also presented a moment to learn crucial missing information about the health effects of wildfires to help those affected and to better protect people's health from the inevitable next ones.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"This won't be the last wildfire that Los Angeles sees," says Eisenman. "Part of the community recovery process is to learn from what we experienced."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Researchers fanned out across the city to collect what data and samples they could. Doctors started thinking of ways to collect patient data to better understand the immediate and long-term health impact. They soon joined together to form &lt;a href="https://lafirehealth.org/" target="_blank"&gt;a consortium that tied together 10 research institutions&lt;/a&gt;, developing a phalanx of research studies to explore some of the most pressing questions brought up by affected community members.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Some questions were simple but frustratingly hard to find answers to, like: What was in the smoke? Other questions, like those exploring the long-term health impacts, will take years to untangle. But answers are beginning to emerge.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Extra-dangerous smoke&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Wildfire smoke is dangerous under any conditions. Exposure to &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/09/19/nx-s1-5544451/wildfire-smoke-death-increases" target="_blank"&gt;high smoke levels&lt;/a&gt; is linked to respiratory problems such as&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/08/04/nx-s1-5492448/health-michigan-canada-smoke-minnesota-air-quality-wildfire" target="_blank"&gt;asthma and COPD&lt;/a&gt;, cardiovascular issues and even &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/11/26/nx-s1-5205298/exposure-to-wildfire-smoke-increases-the-risk-of-developing-dementia-study-says" target="_blank"&gt;dementia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But from the first moment the Palisades and Eaton fires took hold last January, UCLA air pollution expert Yifang Zhu knew they were different. Because it wasn't just trees and plants burning: There was plastic from people's houses, and car batteries and asbestos tiles — a "toxic soup" of air pollutants, she says.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;What was in that soup, and how dangerous it might be to human health — that wasn't clear. Official air quality monitors in downtown Los Angeles, miles away from the heart of the fires in Altadena and Pacific Palisades, &lt;a href="https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/sites/default/files/2025-02/Final-LAFireAQWebinar-Presentation.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;recorded high levels of lead and arsenic&lt;/a&gt; in the air during the burns. Researchers from Caltech and the Georgia Institute of Technology&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;later measured lead concentrations in air samples both near and far from the fires. Lead levels, they found, were elevated, even miles away, signaling that smoke and ash from the burns spread the dangerous heavy metal widely.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But many scientists suspected the smoke and ash spread other toxic particles and gases widely, too — chemicals that standard EPA and state monitors didn't test.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We need to test more than just what the EPA calls for. And the EPA has limited resources," says Kari Nadeau, an environmental health scientist at Harvard University and one of the leads for the new research consortium. "But as academics, we can test for hundreds of things all at once, which helps the community. Because what you don't know, you don't know, but it can still hurt you."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Before the fires, Zhu and her team had been getting ready to sample the air at Aliso Canyon, where a &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/02/18/467230988/leaking-natural-gas-well-in-california-is-permanently-sealed" target="_blank"&gt;natural gas leak&lt;/a&gt; in 2015 had caused major health problems for nearby residents. When the fires broke out, the team pivoted, taking their sampling equipment as close to the fires as they could. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That opportunity was special. Researchers are rarely ready to deploy at a moment's notice to capture samples during disasters such as the LA fires. The special circumstances let Zhu's team "set the stage about what's going on during this active fire burning all week," Zhu says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-105373" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

                Dust and ash from the Palisades and Eaton fires spread across the Los Angeles region. Scientists are still learning about the contaminants and toxic components in the debris left behind after the fires and the health consequences of being exposed to it.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Zhu's team set up air filters to capture the ash, and they captured air samples inside and outside homes in the Palisades and Eaton fire regions. In the air samples, they looked for more than 20 different volatile organic compounds — gases, many of which harm human health, and are likely to be produced by the fires. And while the fires were still burning, they &lt;a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.estlett.5c00919" target="_blank"&gt;measured high levels of benzene&lt;/a&gt;, a carcinogen, at their outdoor sites.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lingering risks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The high benzene levels dissipated after the burning stopped, Zhu found. But other dangerous gases actually increased later on, especially indoors. A few health-harming gases, including toluene and carbon tetrachloride, became &lt;em&gt;more &lt;/em&gt;concentrated inside people's homes a few weeks after the fire.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The message was clear. "The fire impact doesn't really disappear with the active flame," Zhu says. Homes themselves can absorb dangerous gases in the drywall, furniture and other soft materials, releasing them for days and weeks after the smoke has dissipated. People need to know that their homes might be contaminated long after the fire is out, she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That wasn't the only lingering risk. Another research team started to look for a contaminant called hexavalent chromium, which c&lt;a href="https://www.osha.gov/hexavalent-chromium/health-effects#:~:text=Adverse%20health%20effects%20associated%20with,pitted%20ulcer%20covered%20with%20fluid." target="_blank"&gt;an cause cancer&lt;/a&gt;, sometimes known as the "Erin Brockovich" contaminant, made famous by the movie of the same name. It can be produced when fires burn through certain types of soil or rock, as well as during industrial processes like welding. It's not often searched for after wildfires, but the researchers &lt;a href="https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-7401328/v1" target="_blank"&gt;found it lingering in the air&lt;/a&gt; around cleanup sites long after the fires were out.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's actually one of those things that … makes you pay attention differently," says Joe Allen, an exposure scientist at Harvard University, who has been conducting ongoing research on building safety after the fires. And the contaminant was found in tiny particles so small that they can penetrate deep into people's lungs, bodies, and even directly to their brains.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We've seen hexavalent chromium in soils after fires. I don't think anybody expected to see it in air. I don't think anybody expected to see it exclusively in the nanoparticle size range," Allen says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Ash also contaminated people's homes, as well as soil and water across the region. The water impacts seemed to clear quickly, though longer-term effects are still being tracked. But &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41370-025-00796-w" target="_blank"&gt;levels of lead&lt;/a&gt; and other heavy metals inside people's homes and in the soil around them often remained high, even after cleanup was supposedly done.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"That is an ongoing question," says Allen. "Do we have enough funds to remediate all these properties, or are we just putting some people back into properties that are not properly cleared?"&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Zhu was impressed by how much she and others learned about the dangerous smoke and ash. But she also worries they probably only scratched the surface. "We are only detecting things that our method allows us to detect. So even though we learn a lot from that, you know, I wonder what we missed," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does this all mean for people's health?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Scientists have known that in the short term, wildfire smoke exposure leads to more respiratory issues, such as asthma and COPD; increases the risk of developing dementia; and affects&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-03777-6" target="_blank"&gt; people's immune responses&lt;/a&gt;. But the full array of impacts, and the long-term costs of exposure, are still muddy.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We know a lot about the health effects of wildfire smoke," says Allen. But "we don't know all that much about urban wildfire smoke. We certainly don't know what happens when you expose a population of 20 million people in the greater Los Angeles area to smoke like this, enriched in these toxic metals and other pollutants. "&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The research is beginning to uncover some of the health impacts.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Cheng and colleagues collected data from the emergency room at Cedars-Sinai, one of the busiest in the region, and particularly close to the Palisades fire. In the 90 days following the fires, they saw a 24% increase in respiratory issues — and a &lt;a href="https://www.jacc.org/doi/10.1016/j.jacc.2025.10.079" target="_blank"&gt;47% jump in heart attacks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It was "very striking," she says. "This actually surpassed heart attack rates during January of all prior years, even during the worst years of COVID."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-105374" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;
                Homes and businesses in parts of Los Angeles were reduced to rubble and ash. The fires caused a spike in visits to some emergency rooms for issues such as respiratory problems and heart attacks. And many people's blood showed signs of health disruptions. Scientists are tracking many local residents to understand the long-term health impacts of the fires.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Abnormal blood tests also spiked, increasing by more than 100% over previous levels. That included unexpected blood sugar readings, signs of a disrupted immune system, and changes to people's metabolic profiles — signals, Cheng says, of bodywide stresses that could be precursors to many different health problems down the line.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"For a very large number of people who lived through these January wildfires, the wildfire exposures led to some kind of a biochemical or metabolic stress in the body that likely affected not just one, but many organ systems," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The team is now tracking some of those patients, trying to understand what health issues their unusual bloodwork might have signaled coming.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The ER data is likely just skimming the surface, says Eisenman. Longer-term health problems, from heart issues to mental health stresses, are likely to linger or develop in the coming years.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Ongoing research will explore the different health outcomes for people who experienced different levels of smoke and toxin exposure. A UCLA-led study has enrolled over 4,000 people from across the city to follow their health changes long-term. Another study will focus on the specific health outcomes for those who stayed behind at their homes to fight the fires, giving them extraordinarily high smoke doses. The &lt;a href="http://lafirehealth.org" target="_blank"&gt;LA Fire Health study consortium&lt;/a&gt; is also tracking the long-term health impacts on firefighters and first responders.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Much of the emerging research is being supported by private philanthropy, says Eisenman. The wildfires happened just before the Trump administration began its campaign to tighten budgets for many of the science agencies that have historically funded post-disaster research, like the National Science Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"That gap was really filled in by the research community, who did ongoing and extensive and really thoughtful testing of air, of water, of soil, of debris for toxins, and really rapidly communicated those results back to the community," he says. But how to financially support the long-term future of some key studies, he says, is still uncertain, because many major federal research funding resources — like NSF and the National Institute of Health — have shifted priorities under the Trump administration.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to protect yourself and your family&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The biggest questions for the ongoing research, many of the researchers say, are about how best to protect yourself from similar fires in the future.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Allen says there are some clear lessons. Overall, the less smoke one inhales, the better. So while outside, he says it's crucial to wear an N95 mask, or even a respirator that can protect you from the fire's gases.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Indoors, keeping clean air is crucial, says Zhu. Using air filters, ideally HEPA-rated, can lower indoor pollution significantly. Carbon filters are particularly effective at removing the gases, Allen says. People can also install HEPA filters in a car's air-handling system to keep the air clean while they drive.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"You want to control what you can control," says Allen. So inside your space, clean up dust and ash thoroughly. Filter the air. And consider a low-cost air monitor to keep track of the air quality inside.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For people most impacted by the fires, Allen stresses that adequate &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41370-025-00796-w" target="_blank"&gt;cleanup of soil and buildings is critical&lt;/a&gt;. "It was a bit of the Wild West out there" after the fires, he says. A lack of standardized testing protocols and a hodgepodge of policies from different insurers "really harmed the survivor community."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That lack of guidance left many unsure whether their homes were safe to live in again, and many others were forced to go back to homes that were &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/12/29/us/insurers-smoke-damaged-homes-toxins.html" target="_blank"&gt;demonstrably still unsafe&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We need more coordinated recommendations and rules to help people know whether their homes are safe," Allen says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It will take years to get a full picture of the health impacts of the LA fires, many of the researchers say. But it's critical to learn from the tragedy, says Nadeau, the Harvard environmental health scientist — to "be able to say, OK, in the future, here's what to do to protect your children or protect your elderly community against stroke," or lung cancer, or the myriad other risks from the wildfires that will, inevitably, come again.&lt;/p&gt;

You can be standing right in front of them, speaking clearly, and still receive no response. Yet, the faintest sound from the kitchen can instantly grab their full attention. It’s as though dogs operate with two completely different listening modes. One Golden Retriever’s owner proves that the “selective hearing” theory in a video that many viewers are relating to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Golden Retriever has two very different types of hearing in cute video&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The account @hudsonbegood posted &lt;span&gt;a video f&lt;/span&gt;eaturing Hudson, a &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/golden-retriever" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Golden Retriever;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Golden Retriever&lt;/a&gt;, whose selective hearing is on full display. On-screen text explains that Golden Retrievers have “two types of hearing,” and the clip quickly proves the point with a side-by-side comparison of Hudson’s reactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In the first example, Hudson is stretched out on the floor, looking completely relaxed and uninterested in his surroundings. His owner calls his name and asks if he wants to go outside for a walk. Despite the familiar words, Hudson doesn’t move a muscle. He remains sprawled on the floor, appearing content to ignore the suggestion entirely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;That indifference disappears almost instantly in the next moment. As soon as the sound of a peanut butter jar opening echoes through the kitchen, Hudson springs into action. The dog, who was lounging just seconds earlier, quickly gets up and heads straight toward his owner. His posture and focus make it clear that this is a sound worth responding to. His owner then presents the peanut butter jar, confirming exactly what caught his attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In the caption, Hudson’s owner adds that this special type of hearing isn’t limited to peanut butter alone. She notes that Hudson can also detect the sound of banana peels, suggesting his ears are finely tuned to anything remotely related to snacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Viewers found the video extremely relatable and filled the comments with stories of their own dogs’ selective listening habits. One person joked that those food-related sounds are “like music to their ears.” Meanwhile, another said Hudson clearly knows what he wants and when to respond. Others shared similar experiences, including dogs who appear instantly at the sound of a cheese drawer opening or an ice dispenser running.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The post &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com/news/202418-video-owner-reveals-golden-retrievers-two-types-hearing" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Video: Owner Reveals Golden Retriever’s Two Types of Hearing;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Video: Owner Reveals Golden Retriever’s Two Types of Hearing&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:DogTime;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;DogTime&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 09:26:53 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilwFBVV95cUxNQjlDSnZRdDl0b3FyMENYUWRnb2tzMWpLWkl4YTRKZXhhYzktb1FkMjZMUVlvRXhWemtvcXpXWEJHUm1nVG5nS2dhRXo5NFVaLVVzV3lmQU5xaWpkLVF4Sng5eVkwNEFpZjdGaURta2V0VFJfaWg0UXU2ZE5LTEhuZjhEV1pnaElBaVJJakprQTV4dDdGd3Rv</guid></item><item><title>视频：金毛猎犬让陌生人快乐并获得粉丝-雅虎</title><link>https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/articles/video-golden-retriever-makes-strangers-085744152.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="" data-article-body="true"&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Walking through Belfast, you might run into the city’s most popular local celebrity. Maddie, the friendly face at @maddiethebad.e, is essentially a one-dog welcoming committee for her neighborhood. A recent video shows her holding court in her yard with her favorite plushie, Tiger. She’s just a &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/golden-retriever" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Golden Retriever;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Golden Retriever&lt;/a&gt; doing what she does best: existing warmly, wagging happily, and pulling people into her orbit while her mom watches nearby, probably used to this by now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Golden Retriever’s friendly nature makes strangers’ days more delightful&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The clip starts with a mailman stopping his route just to give Maddie some attention. She stands by the ledge, tail wagging, while receiving some top-tier neck scritches. She even places a paw on his arm to make sure he doesn’t leave too soon. When the man offers her a treat, she accepts it after briefly dropping her Tiger. Even with a bag full of parcels, he can’t seem to resist her charm. He truly looks like he’d stay all day if he could.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Things get even busier when a second worker joins the huddle. Suddenly, Maddie is being fussed over by two people at once, and she is loving every second. She leans into the pets, soaking up the attention. Soon, a group of four strangers walking by spots the love fest. They can’t help but cross the lane to see what all the excitement is about. Maddie’s owner joked that Maddie and Tiger weren’t sure how to handle the sudden fame.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Before long, the crowd grows to four new fans. Maddie handles the “paparazzi” with total grace, accepting head scratches from everyone. She eventually flops over for some high-quality belly rubs on the grass. It’s the kind of interaction that probably made everyone’s afternoon significantly better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;With over 7,400 likes, it’s clear Maddie has a global fanbase now, too. Commenters are joking that the Belfast Tourist Board needs to put her on the payroll. Some people say that if they were there, they would never leave. We’re not sure we would either!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The post &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com/news/202441-video-golden-retriever-makes-strangers-happy-gains-fans" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Video: Golden Retriever Makes Strangers Happy &amp;amp; Gains Fans;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Video: Golden Retriever Makes Strangers Happy &amp;amp; Gains Fans&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:DogTime;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;DogTime&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 08:57:44 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimgFBVV95cUxOTlEwTjVsdnRyLVNidHZqY1AxdnZpamNremZZT0hMOTB3SHo3elFGVUFMTkoyampCejUxWGx1c1ZNTGN6SWxmYUdmcEZIOWpFcUdJVm94NlEtMF8wdEo5WjBremxsczdMTGtNUy1xTkhwNk00ZDA0dmpoandFakpjQVA3d3lSMU5HcFcwTkxoaVFNSUdMWDE5VjZB</guid></item><item><title>你的大脑什么时候才是真正的“成人” ？ ：短波- NPR</title><link>https://www.npr.org/2026/01/14/nx-s1-5668450/science-brain-development-aging</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="storytext" class="storytext storylocation linkLocation"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;For some neuroscientists, the question of when the brain "stops" developing is headache-inducing.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It was kind of this unfathomable question," &lt;a href="https://www.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/people/duncan.astle/" target="_blank"&gt;Duncan Astle, a researcher&lt;/a&gt; at the University of Cambridge says. "It's this question neuroscientists hate to be asked."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;There's this in pop culture that something happens in the human brain at 25 years-old. Suddenly, we're developed. We can finally make rational decisions. We might even regret some of our past…indiscretions.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But a recent paper in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-65974-8" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;the journal &lt;/u&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;Nature&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;from Astle's lab suggests that may not be the case.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The team found four distinct turning points in brain development across people's lifespan. Specifically, they found that the brain may be in its "adolescent" phase until the age of 32.&lt;/p&gt;

For stress and mental health, evidence-based interventions like cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), mindfulness meditation, and regular physical activity are highly effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="content "&gt;Prioritising quality sleep through consistent sleep schedules, limiting screens before bed, and treating sleep apnea is also essential. Building social connections, whether through community groups, friendships, or therapy, reduces isolation and supports emotional resilience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="content "&gt;For individuals with autoimmune or inflammatory diseases, timely medical treatment and anti-inflammatory diets (such as the Mediterranean diet) help lower cardiovascular risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="content "&gt;Reducing exposure to environmental pollutants, such as through the use of air purifiers and avoiding high-traffic areas during exercise, is also beneficial. Emotional well-being plays a vital role in heart health. &lt;span class="highlight"&gt;Activities that bring meaning or connection, such as walking with a friend or focusing on purpose in daily life, can lower stress and support healthier behaviors.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="content "&gt;Caring for your emotional health isn't separate from caring for your heart; both are deeply interconnected. Taking medications as directed is another key factor in preventing heart attacks or stroke. &lt;span class="highlight"&gt;If you have been prescribed treatment for high blood pressure, high cholesterol or other risk factors, following your clinician's guidance and monitoring your numbers ensures those risks stay under control.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="content "&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This article is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.

Well, Comet doesn’t just beg; she puts on a full-blown production. This Michigan pup, known on Instagram as @peachycomet22, is a total character. When she’s not busy &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/articles/video-toilet-paper-chase-between-112437074.html" data-ylk="slk:stealing toilet paper;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;stealing toilet paper&lt;/a&gt; (her usual hobby), she’s 100% focused on her one true love: peanut butter. You have to see the way she works for it in this video. It’s not just a look, though; she has a whole “prayer ritual” involving her hind legs and the air that makes it impossible to say no to this &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/golden-retriever" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Golden Retriever;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Golden Retriever&lt;/a&gt; in need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Golden Retriever’s refill request to owner in cute video melts hearts&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The clip starts with Comet walking up to her mom, carrying an empty peanut butter jar in her mouth. When she gets asked why she brought the jar over, she launches her signature move. She hops up on her back legs and waves her front paws toward the sky, like she’s summoning the peanut butter gods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;It is not every day that you see such a level of dedication to getting what you want. Even when her mom points out the obvious fact that the jar is empty, Comet just stares back with those massive, pleading eyes as if to say, “Yeah, that’s exactly why we’re having this meeting, Mom.”&lt;br&gt;The negotiation continues with Comet sitting as sweetly as possible, clutching the jar in her mouth while her mom asks if it’s her job to provide a refill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;This kicks off another round of the “pleading dance,” where Comet starts bouncing up and down in this hilarious, full-body “yes!” motion. Just in case anyone was still confused, she lets out this sharp little bark to officially seal the deal. Her mom just loses it, and honestly, once you see that performance, you’ll be right there with her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The post has over 16,000 likes, and the internet is fully on Comet’s side. One commenter joked that Comet is basically at a peanut butter bar, and her mom is just a very slow bartender. Others suggested setting up an automatic dispenser to keep up with her demands.

					&lt;p&gt;Israeli scientists have developed an innovative method to track the human body’s circadian rhythms, finding in a new peer-reviewed study that female sex hormones have a dramatic effect on the setting of these internal circadian clocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every human body has a central circadian clock in the brain that helps control its daily rhythms — but there are also circadian clocks within almost every cell in the body that follow their own tick-tocking beat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers mapped circadian clocks across many cells using their method, called CircaSCOPE, to find that these female sex hormones — especially progesterone — along with the stress hormone cortisol, have a dramatic effect on the setting of these internal timers.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;p id="gpt-passback"&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;When these clocks are not coordinated, people can experience serious health problems, including sleep disorders, diabetes and cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The body “needs to synchronize millions of clocks because they are present in every cell in our body,” said Prof. Gad Asher of the Weizmann Institute of Science’s Asher lab, recently speaking to The Times of Israel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter newsletter-article" data-website="timesofisrael" data-from="New study shows that female sex hormones can impact the body’s inner clocks"&gt;

	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;p class="newsletter-error newsletter-article-error"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
		
&lt;p&gt;“Sex hormones are very important in shifting the clock,” Asher said. “Female hormones have a much more prominent effect compared to male hormones.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said that the researchers still “don’t know how this influences men.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asher noted that the experiments were done in cell cultures and have not yet been tested in animals or humans.&lt;/p&gt;
               
           
           
        
&lt;p&gt;However, he said, “We now know how these clocks communicate, so maybe we can explain their involvement in various disorders and pathologies, and help patients whose internal timing is disrupted.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research could also shed light on disruptions to circadian clocks during menstruation, pregnancy and menopause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study, led by Dr. Gal Manella, Dr. Saar Ezagouri, and Nityanand Bolshette, was published in the scientific journal &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-67349-5"&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Our internal clocks sometimes beat to different times&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past, Asher said, “people thought that there is only one main clock in the brain which responds to light and dark and coordinates our daily physiology, metabolism, and behavior.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, about 25 years ago, scientists discovered that there are “clocks in every cell, in every tissue” in the body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Circadian clocks are affected not only by external signals such as sunlight but also by signals carried through the bloodstream.&lt;/p&gt;
               
           
           
        
&lt;p&gt;When the body’s internal time is not aligned with the environment, it could lead to many pathologies, Asher said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The best example is jet lag or shift workers, in which the person’s internal time is not in accordance with the environmental time,” he explained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The brain receives information from the eyes about light and darkness,” Asher said. “Light and dark are the main time signals for the brain. But now, in the past year, it’s becoming more and more evident that illnesses might be related to the fact that clocks in different organs are not synchronized with each other.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, he said, “The clock in the liver should be synchronized, or should show a similar time as the clock in the kidney or the clock in the brain, but this is not always the case.”&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Prof. Gad Asher of the Weizmann Institute of Science’s Asher Lab notes measurements in an experiment on how low oxygen affects the body’s circadian clocks in La Rinconada, Peru, the highest permanent settlement in the world, in 2020. (Courtesy/Asher Lab)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
	&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Low oxygen levels impact circadian rhythms&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a series of studies on animal models, researchers in Asher’s lab showed that oxygen acts like a signal helping internal clocks know what time it is. When oxygen levels change, cells use that information to adjust internal clocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2020, Asher joined an expedition to La Rinconada, Peru, the highest inhabited settlement in the world, located 5,300 meters (17,388 feet) above sea level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this high altitude, Asher said the lower levels of oxygen altered the daily rhythm of many genes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These findings might be of relevance to the fact that many low oxygen-related pathologies, such as heart disease and asthma exacerbation, show daytime occurrence, in particular during the early morning hours,” Asher said.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A wall of clocks&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are other signals carried through the blood that might serve as time tellers for internal clocks, Asher said, “yet their identity was only partially known.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before Asher’s work, these blood-borne signals had not been fully mapped because researchers lacked a precise and efficient method for tracking the clock’s response to different signals over a full 24-hour cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Weizmann scientists’ &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-26210-1"&gt;CircaSCOPE&lt;/a&gt; uses an array of human cells, each representing a different time of day, resembling a wall lined with clocks showing the current time in major cities around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asher’s lab was not damaged during the Iranian ballistic missile strike in June 2025, though he noted that some of the experiments used for the research paper were delayed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the researchers were able to monitor the clock in every cell in a petri dish in the culture. When they exposed the cell to a signal, they could “characterize if the clock was moving forward, backward, or not responding,” Asher said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past, it would have taken the researchers months to do this work. He said that the novel method enables them to screen for dozens of compounds within a single week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If we suspect that a certain compound affects the clock, we add it to the cells, and we can see exactly where their clocks are moving in each cell,” said Asher. “This is a very powerful approach which can generate a lot of information about how the clock is responsive to different signals.”&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The importance of the Cry2 protein&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to uncovering the influence of sex hormones, Asher’s study revealed that the clock component receiving these signals in the blood is the protein CRY2 (Cryptochrome 2), rather than PER2 (Period 2), as previously believed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It seems that the sex hormones, as well as many other signals, are acting through the CRY2 protein,” he said. “It probably transfers the information into the clock in the cell.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“From an evolutionary angle, that’s intriguing,” said Prof. Yoav Gothilf of Tel Aviv University’s School of Biochemistry, Neurobiology and Biophysics, whose lab explores various aspects of the circadian clock and its significance in the life of the organism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gothilf, who was not involved in the study, explained that in early, simple organisms, CRY2-like proteins responded directly to light, acting like a light sensor. As animals became more complex, CRY2 kept its job of synchronizing internal clocks, but the signal it listened to changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It seems the role of CRY2 in synchronizing clocks has been conserved, but the signal it responds to has changed, from light in early life forms to hormones in mammals,” Gothilf said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gothilf said that Asher’s study suggests that “daily, age-specific waves of hormones can shift the timing of our internal clocks.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings offer a “compelling” biological explanation for “how a morning-loving child will turn into a night-owl teenager, and later drift back toward morningness as an adult.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asher said that his lab will continue to research the roles of these hormones in circadian clocks, perhaps testing the idea on lab animals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We can now identify compounds, and we identify that the sex hormones are important, changing throughout life,” he said. “Identifying molecules that are potent time signals for clocks has major importance in treatments in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Older adults can dramatically reduce the amount of &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1017/S1368980018003762"&gt;ultra-processed foods&lt;/a&gt; they eat while keeping a familiar, balanced diet – and this shift leads to improvements across several key markers related to how the body regulates appetite and metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's the main finding of a new study my colleagues and I &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clnu.2025.10.010"&gt;published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Clinical Nutrition&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultra-processed foods are made using industrial techniques and ingredients that aren't typically used in home cooking. They often contain additives such as emulsifiers, flavorings, colors, and preservatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/major-studies-link-food-preservatives-to-higher-risk-of-cancer-and-diabetes"&gt;Major Studies Link Food Preservatives to Higher Risk of Cancer And Diabetes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Common examples include packaged snacks, ready-to-eat meals, and some processed meats.

One included lean red meat (pork); the other was vegetarian with milk and eggs. For two weeks in between, participants returned to their usual diets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A total of 43 people began the dietary intervention, and 36 completed the full study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In both diets, ultra-processed foods made up less than 15% of the total calories – a significant reduction from &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.15620/cdc/174612"&gt;the typical American diet&lt;/a&gt;, where more than 50% of total calories come from ultra-processed foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The diets were designed to be realistic for everyday eating, and participants were not instructed to restrict calories, lose weight, or change their physical activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_186951" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-186951" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/HealthyFoodDisplay-642x361.jpg" alt="Flatlay of various fresh healthy foods" class="size-medium wp-image-186951" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/HealthyFoodDisplay-642x361.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/HealthyFoodDisplay-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/HealthyFoodDisplay-600x338.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/HealthyFoodDisplay.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-186951" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Maintaining metabolic health promotes healthy aging.

Both diets emphasized minimally processed ingredients and aligned with the &lt;a href="https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/sites/default/files/2020-12/Dietary_Guidelines_for_Americans_2020-2025.pdf"&gt;2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans&lt;/a&gt;, the US government's nutrient-based recommendations for healthy eating, while providing similar calories and amounts of key nutrients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://realfood.gov/"&gt;The 2025-2030 Dietary Guidelines for Americans&lt;/a&gt;, released on Jan. 7, 2026, &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/new-us-dietary-guidelines-recommend-more-protein-and-whole-milk-less-ultraprocessed-foods-272990"&gt;explicitly recommend eating less ultra-processed food&lt;/a&gt;, but the &lt;a href="https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/sites/default/files/2020-12/Dietary_Guidelines_for_Americans_2020-2025.pdf"&gt;previous versions of the guidelines&lt;/a&gt; did not specifically address food processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our feeding study design allowed us, for the first time, to examine the health effects of reducing ultra-processed foods while keeping nutrient levels consistent with recommended targets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We compared how participants fared while eating their habitual diets with how they responded to the two diets that were low in ultra-processed foods. During the periods when participants ate fewer ultra-processed foods, they naturally consumed fewer calories and lost weight, including total and abdominal body fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond weight loss, they also showed meaningful improvements in insulin sensitivity, healthier cholesterol levels, fewer signs of inflammation, and favorable changes in hormones that help regulate appetite and metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These improvements were similar whether participants followed the meat-based or the vegetarian diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why it matters&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultra-processed foods &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1017/S0007114523003033"&gt;make up more than half the calories&lt;/a&gt; consumed by most US adults. Although these foods are convenient and widely available, studies that track people's diets over time increasingly link them with &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(25)01565-X"&gt;obesity and age-related chronic diseases&lt;/a&gt; such as Type 2  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="188723" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; and heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With older adults making up a growing share of the global population, strategies that preserve metabolic health could support healthy aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most previous feeding studies testing how ultra-processed foods affect people's health &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmet.2019.05.008"&gt;haven't reflected real-world eating&lt;/a&gt;, especially among Americans. For example, some studies have compared diets made up almost entirely of ultra-processed foods with diets that contain little to none at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our study aimed to more closely approximate people's experience while still closely tracking the foods they consumed. It is the first to show that for older adults, a realistic reduction in ultra-processed foods, outside the lab, has measurable health benefits beyond just losing weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s12603-021-1609-3"&gt;For older adults especially&lt;/a&gt;, maintaining metabolic health helps preserve mobility, independence, and quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What's still unknown&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our study was small, reflecting the complexity of studies in which researchers tightly control what participants eat. It was not designed to show whether the metabolic improvements we observed can prevent or delay diseases such as diabetes or heart disease over time. Larger, longer studies will be needed to answer that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/ultra-processed-foods-linked-to-early-signs-of-parkinsons-disease"&gt;Ultra-Processed Foods Linked to Early Signs of Parkinson's Disease&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the practical side, it's still unclear whether people can cut back on ultra-processed foods in their daily lives without structured support, and what strategies would make it easier to do so. It's also not fully understood which aspects of processing – for example, additives, emulsifiers, or extrusion – matter more for health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Answering these questions could help manufacturers produce foods that are healthier but still convenient – and make it easier for people to choose healthier food options.

"This is not just a semantic debate. If the purpose of the Dietary Guidelines is to improve population health, there should have been a clear definition and robust public education effort rolled out alongside the 2025--2030 edition. Instead, the current language puts the onus squarely on individuals, as if people simply don't know better, without grappling with the broader forces that shape food choice."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The lack of definition, she added, also makes it difficult for public health agencies to assess how much ultra-processed foods people consume and raises obstacles for researchers creating studies, and for policymakers setting labeling or marketing standards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;White House spokesman Kush Desai told ABC News that the dietary guidelines are foundational for American nutrition decisions and help shape public policy for "dozens of federal feeding programs ranging from childhood nutrition assistance initiatives to the meals served to our nation's schoolchildren and military."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"The Trump administration's reformed Dietary Guidelines are a scientifically unimpeachable overhaul of how our country approaches diet and nutrition, an overhaul that over the coming years will transform key federal programs by promoting affordable, whole, healthy, and nutrient-dense foods for countless everyday Americans," Desai said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="oLzSq QrHMO fnRUo pvsTF EhJPu vPlOC zNYgW OsTsW RMeqy daRVX ISNQ sKyCY eRftA acPPc MENS nFwaT MCnQE mEeeY SmBjI xegrY rPLsU iulOd NIuqO zzscu lzDCc aHUBM IEgzD OjMNy eQqcx SVqKB GQmdz jaoD VWDdR ONJdw vrZxD OnRTz gbbfF roDbV GPGwb oMlSS gfNzt oJhud eXZcf zhVlX "&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="InlineImage GpQCA lZur asrEW " data-testid="prism-inline-image"&gt;&lt;figure class="kzIjN GNmeK pYrtp dSqFO " data-testid="prism-figure"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="nMMea bNYiy Mjgpa dGwha DDmxa jgKNG RGHCC aBIU PriDW lZur " data-testid="prism-caption"&gt;&lt;p class="HXPPJ barbu yKsXL IzgMt VcHIt uhSzI YGNMU cRAsZ xqMcl QtRul "&gt;&lt;span class="hsDdd OOSI GpQCA lZur VlFaz " data-testid="prism-truncate"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="gtOSm FbbUW tUtYa vOCwz EQwFq yCufu eEak Qmvg nyTIa SRXVc vzLa jgBfc WXDas CiUCW kqbG zrdEG txGfn ygKVe BbezD UOtxr CVfpq xijV soGRS XgdC sEIlf daWqJ "&gt;Snacks on display in a supermarket in Orlando, Florida, Nov. 8, 2025.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="qinlA IpWvx oqZz tylGM lyWxS nWcVF UhTug PPcLh YxlyB "&gt;&lt;span class="gtOSm FbbUW tUtYa vOCwz EQwFq yCufu eEak Qmvg nyTIa SRXVc vzLa jgBfc WXDas CiUCW kqbG zrdEG txGfn ygKVe BbezD UOtxr CVfpq xijV soGRS XgdC sEIlf daWqJ YNujN JGtjI aZFDu rkKLh "&gt;Alexandre Rotenberg/Adobe Stock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Wood noted that while the guidelines are correct to call on Americans to eat less ultra-processed foods, it can be difficult for the average consumer to fully decipher which store-bought items are potentially unhealthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"What's confusing to a lot of people -- and what we're kind of grappling with in the nutrition community -- is that we understand that not all ultra-processed foods are bad," he said. He added that things like whole-grain bread or tofu, while considered processed foods, are still "health promoting," which the guidance does not fully explain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Wood believes front-of-label packaging would be a pivotal next step for U.S. food policy, referencing examples like Europe that have enforced simplified nutrition information on the front of packaged foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;According to Wood, a quick way for consumers to avoid ultra-processed foods is to read the ingredients list on packaged foods closely.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"You have to check if it's high in fat, sugar, or salt, because if it's high in even one, but especially two or three of those, then you know that's probably not going to be health promoting," Wood said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Some public health experts, including Cather and Wood, argue that calling on Americans to eat less processed foods ignores the broader forces that make those foods cheap and accessible for many Americans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"There's little discussion in the guidelines about the role of food systems, subsidies, corporate practices, or economic inequities in driving overconsumption of ultra-processed foods," Cather said. "These products dominate shelf space, advertising, price promotions, and even federal nutrition programs, not necessarily because people want them, but because they're engineered to be profitable and cheap, especially in communities with fewer healthy options. A public health approach that ignores these structural drivers will always fall short."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;According to Cather, there are limited policies currently aimed at helping consumers navigate the ultra-processed food environment in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC eTIW sUzSN "&gt;"A few localities and states have experimented with front-of-pack labeling or marketing restrictions that could indirectly help consumers identify products with excessive additives, sugars, and sodium, key ingredients in ultra-processed foods," Cather said. "Though these policies are not widespread."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>ABC News</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 02:07:16 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipwFBVV95cUxOMnM4aHB6bUExdDhyam9ZVm1XelEyc2xjMERkZk1rNkxJZDNBYVVLMjBKaWVBdHpaYVliR0JUUUVvdWRfZUVGNHpMRVpQYTczYlRVRG5nRWRnNDJqLVRtSXprT3FoVHJhMTlpTTUwaFdZaTFueXUtQ3V4Q2NYY2J4YW53UFcwX3BNcVRTUzNQdl9hbWo4MDc2VzVXTXlvX0NvZXlKZ2x0UdIBrAFBVV95cUxNbTlBQlQyNWk4XzVDdG5OLW9nNXl3aVNMZXlvZWNVWFpTbkFrb0hKb29DSFJhU1RRNzg1RXZXZGRna0lLX1U1Y0dYT1JucEpJYWNuVjF4STd6NU4tUk5zWklwOS0xVzZLWGdyMGhrSFpvbGpmU1Z4OWxiZVM5dEdwa29XOU5IYVBiUURmb3dPWFU5ZUxPVU9ZYU9MS3poSF85eElTYmFvbFdFZkRj</guid></item><item><title>第八营地和哈里森营地附近发现钩端螺旋体病疫情-伯克利赛德</title><link>https://www.berkeleyside.org/2026/01/13/eighth-harrison-lepto-outbreak-northwest-berkeley-bhu</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Berkeley’s public health officer says people and pets in Northwest Berkeley are at risk from an outbreak of leptospirosis that has circulated among dogs and rats at the &lt;a href="https://www.berkeleyside.org/2025/02/14/berkeley-unhoused-residents-eighth-harrison-civic-center-park"&gt;longstanding encampment of tents&lt;/a&gt;, RVs and other shelters around Eighth and Harrison streets.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Veterinarians found leptospirosis in two dogs living in the camp in November, so county health workers began trapping and testing rats living in the area, &lt;a href="https://berkeleyca.gov/sites/default/files/2026-01/January%2012%2C%202026%20Lepto%20Health%20Alert%20Final.pdf"&gt;according to a notice posted Monday&lt;/a&gt; by Dr. Noemi Doohan, Berkeley’s public health officer. Those tests found the bacterium in rats for the first time anywhere in Alameda County in the last five years, Doohan said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Berkeley officials have long wanted to remove the encampment, but a federal judge has &lt;a href="https://www.berkeleyside.org/2025/06/10/berkeley-homeless-encampment-harrison-eighth-ruling-chen"&gt;temporarily blocked the city&lt;/a&gt; from ousting a few of the camp’s residents since June, pending the resolutions of their disability accommodations claims — a process that has missed deadline after deadline. Theoretically the city is free to evict other campers, but city health officials and attorneys say that unless the entire camp leaves for at least 30 days, health workers cannot fully eradicate the rat burrows in the area, meaning the outbreak will persist.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It is important to note that leptospirosis is considered a ‘neglected tropical disease’ which is prevalent in underdeveloped tropical countries,” Doohan, who has worked in Haiti and Ethiopia and said she was quite familiar with this type of illness, wrote in a court filing. “Leptospirosis is rare in developed countries … the exception is homeless encampments in the U.S. which are considered high risk for rat infestations.”&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Judge Edward Chen left the prohibition in place during a hearing about the encampment in federal court Tuesday, but said that a final determination was likely soon.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Anthony Prince, an attorney for the Berkeley Homeless Union, which filed the Americans with Disabilities Act lawsuit last year, said the only reason disease-bearing rats were gathering near the camp in the first place was that the city removed a dumpster in June and never brought it back.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“For the profoundly disabled residents of the Harrison Corridor, the trauma and instability of forced displacement — including the loss of shelter, community and medical equipment — poses a far more immediate and severe threat to life and health” than the outbreak, Prince and BHU President Yesica Prado wrote in a court filing Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Berkeley has not yet tested Codornices Creek for leptospirosis, Doohan wrote in a court filing. However the city recommended that people consider the creek and any standing water within a third of a mile of the camp as contaminated. The bacterium travels through water by way of infected urine, and infects people and animals who come into contact with contaminated water or urine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In humans, leptospirosis typically causes fevers and headaches, aches, chills, nausea and vomiting, jaundice, red eyes, diarrhea and rashes, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Many people never show symptoms, but since so many of the symptoms are common in other illnesses, the disease is sometimes misidentified. It can be treated with antibiotics but, if untreated, can result in organ failure, meningitis and occasionally death.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Leptospirosis can be fatal to dogs as well, presenting first with excessive thirst, vomiting, shivering and lethargy, Doohan wrote in a Jan. 6 court filing. The city has recommended dog owners make sure their pets are up to date with vaccines, and has offered vaccine vouchers for camp residents.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Infected animals can continue to urinate the bacterium for months or even years, and it can live on in contaminated water for months longer, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/leptospirosis/about/index.html"&gt;according to the CDC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The encampment, which some neighbors and nearby businesses have complained has been the epicenter of dangerous fires, rampant drug use and other dangers, has been the subject of several lawsuits. Some have sought to block attempts to clear out the camp. Another &lt;a href="https://www.berkeleyside.org/2024/09/11/berkeley-unhoused-encampments-harrison-street-dwight-way-cordonices-creek"&gt;still-pending lawsuit in state superior court&lt;/a&gt;, filed by a coalition of business owners and residents, has accused Berkeley of allowing public nuisances to persist at the camp.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Three disabled camp residents filed a lawsuit in early 2024 accusing the city of violating ADA requirements when it ordered everyone to leave the area, and the BHU joined the case as a plaintiff. When the city &lt;a href="https://www.berkeleyside.org/2025/06/04/berkeley-eighth-harrison-homeless-encampment-sweep"&gt;moved to clear the camp last June&lt;/a&gt;, Judge Edward Chen granted BHU’s request to temporarily put a stop to the closure.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Chen later pared back that order by saying the sweep could go ahead, but ordering that campers with outstanding ADA claims &lt;a href="https://www.berkeleyside.org/2025/06/10/berkeley-homeless-encampment-harrison-eighth-ruling-chen"&gt;be allowed to remain&lt;/a&gt;. The grace period for those campers was meant to last 60 days, but those claims remain unresolved seven months later.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the hearing Tuesday, Chen said that whatever the holdup was in the ADA negotiations, the time was near for him to rule one way or another on whether the city could close the camp. He ordered the attorneys for BHU and Berkeley to submit arguments for a hearing March 20. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I think we’ve spent enough time going back and forth,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;There's &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/losing-your-teeth-could-be-a-deadly-warning-study-finds"&gt;growing evidence&lt;/a&gt; that the number of missing teeth a person has is an indicator of their risk of dying earlier than expected, and new research suggests the condition of their remaining teeth may also be significant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A team led by researchers at the University of Osaka in Japan studied health and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/neanderthal-dental-plaque-shows-they-took-painkillers-for-toothaches"&gt;dental records&lt;/a&gt; of 190,282 adults aged 75 and older. Each tooth position was marked as missing, sound (healthy), filled (repaired by a dentist), or decayed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results showed that sound and filled teeth were about equally associated with lower mortality risk. A greater number of missing or decayed teeth was linked with increased mortality risk, reinforcing &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fcvm.2021.621626"&gt;previous findings&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/toothpick-grooves-in-neanderthal-teeth-arent-what-we-thought"&gt;'Toothpick Grooves' in Neanderthal Teeth Aren't What We Thought&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The total number of sound and filled teeth predicted all-cause mortality more accurately than the number of sound teeth alone, or the number of sound, filled, and decayed teeth combined," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12903-025-07275-6"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers in their published paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All-cause mortality measures the likelihood of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/brighter-nights-and-darker-days-can-have-a-serious-effect-on-mortality-risk"&gt;someone dying earlier&lt;/a&gt; than they would typically be expected to, due to any reason.

A lack of proper dental care could reflect low socioeconomic status, for example, which can also affect &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/poverty-may-accelerate-brain-aging-study-shows"&gt;how long you live&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research aligns with another recent study in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/ggi.70230" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Geriatrics &amp;amp; Gerontology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, by a team at the Institute of Science Tokyo. It looked more broadly at oral frailty, which encompasses missing teeth, problems with chewing and swallowing, dry mouth, and difficulty speaking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with three or more of these symptoms were 1.23 times more likely to require long-term care and 1.34 times more likely to die across the study period, based on an analysis of 11,080 older adults. It's another indication that &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/21-year-study-links-gum-disease-and-cavities-to-higher-stroke-risk"&gt;looking after your oral health increases your chances of a longer, healthier life.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future studies, the University of Osaka researchers say, should examine not only how many teeth people have, but also their condition. There's still lots more to learn about why those of us in older age with fewer teeth are more likely to die sooner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The mechanism underlying the association between the number of decayed and filled teeth and all-cause mortality should be carefully investigated in well-designed cohort studies," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12903-025-07275-6"&gt;conclude&lt;/a&gt; the authors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12903-025-07275-6"&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Oral Health&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

They added that exposures may have occurred during school hours at South Summit Elementary School on Jan. 5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere in the state, the Utah County Health District has reported 24 cases, with Wasatch County at nine and Salt Lake County with six cases.

    &lt;p&gt;It’s 7:45am. You grab a takeaway coffee from your local cafe, wrap your hands around the warm cup, take a sip, and head to the office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To most of us, that cup feels harmless – just a convenient tool for caffeine delivery. However, if that cup is made of plastic, or has a thin plastic lining, there is a high chance it’s shedding thousands of tiny plastic fragments directly into your drink.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Australia alone, we use a staggering &lt;a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/environment/protection/waste/publications/australian-plastic-flows-and-fates-national-report-2021-22"&gt;1.45 billion single-use&lt;/a&gt; hot beverage cups every year, along with roughly 890 million plastic lids. Globally, that number swells to an estimated &lt;a href="https://www.lifecycleinitiative.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/UNEP-D002-Beverage-Cups-Report_lowres.pdf"&gt;500 billion cups&lt;/a&gt; annually. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In new &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.hazmp.2025.100028"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; I coauthored, published in Journal of Hazardous Materials: Plastics, we looked at how these cups behave when they get hot. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The message is clear: heat is a primary driver of microplastic release, and the material of your cup matters more than you might think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What are microplastics?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microplastics are fragments of plastic ranging from about 1 micrometre to 5 millimetres in size – roughly from a speck of dust to the size of a sesame seed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They can be created when larger plastic items break down, or they can be released directly from products during normal use. These particles end up in our environment, our food, and eventually, our bodies. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2026/jan/13/microplastics-human-body-doubt"&gt;we don’t have conclusive evidence&lt;/a&gt; on just how much of that microplastic remains in our bodies. Studies on this subject are highly prone to contamination and it’s really difficult to accurately measure the levels of such tiny particles in human tissue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, scientists &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-025-03902-5"&gt;are still piecing together&lt;/a&gt; what microplastics might mean for human health in the long term. More research is urgently needed, but in the meantime, it’s good to be aware of potential microplastic sources in our daily lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Temperature matters&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My colleagues and I first conducted a meta-analysis – a statistical synthesis of existing research – analysing data from 30 peer-reviewed studies. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We looked at how common plastics such as polyethylene and polypropylene behave under different conditions. One factor stood out above all others: temperature. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the temperature of the liquid inside a container increases, the release of microplastics generally increases too. In the studies we reviewed, reported releases ranged from a few hundred particles to more than 8 million particles per litre, depending on the material and study design. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, “soaking time” – how long the drink sits in the cup – was not a consistent driver. This suggests that leaving our drink in a plastic cup for a long time isn’t as important as the initial temperature of the liquid when it first hits the plastic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Testing 400 coffee cups&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To see how this works in the real world, we collected 400 coffee cups of two major types around Brisbane: plastic cups made of polyethylene and plastic-lined paper cups which look like paper but have a thin plastic coating inside. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We tested them at 5°C (iced coffee temperature) and 60°C (hot coffee temperature). While both types released microplastics, the results revealed two major trends. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, material matters. The paper cups with plastic linings released fewer microplastics than the all-plastic cups at both temperatures. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, heat triggers a significant release. For the all-plastic cups, switching from cold to hot water increased the microplastic release by about 33%. If someone drinks 300 millilitres of coffee in a cup made of polyethylene per day, they could ingest 363,000 pieces of microplastic particles every year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But why exactly does heat matter so much?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using high-resolution imaging, we examined the inner walls of these cups and found that all-plastic cups had much rougher surfaces – full of “peaks and valleys” – compared to the plastic-lined paper cups. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This rougher texture makes it easier for particles to break away. Heat accelerates this process by softening the plastic and causing it to expand and contract, creating more surface irregularities that eventually fragment into our drink.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Managing risks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We don’t have to give up our morning takeaway habit, but we can change how we approach it to manage the risk. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For hot drinks, the best option is to use a reusable cup made of stainless steel, ceramic, or glass, as these materials do not shed microplastics. If we must use a disposable cup, our research suggests that plastic-lined paper cups generally shed fewer particles than pure plastic cups, though neither is microplastic free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, since heat is the factor that triggers plastic release, avoid putting boiling liquids directly into plastic-lined containers. Telling the barista to make our coffee slightly cooler before it hits the cup can reduce the physical stress on the plastic lining and lower the overall exposure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By understanding how heat and material choice interact, we can design better products and make better choices for our daily caffeine fix.&lt;/p&gt;

Kennedy Jr. on Tuesday expanded a key federal vaccine advisory panel to include more critics of vaccines who have contradicted mainstream medical guidance, including one who has described herself as an “anti-vaxxer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;His new appointments, Kimberly Biss and Adam Urato, are OB/GYNs who were outspoken critics of coronavirus vaccines during pregnancy. A Washington Post review of their past comments in interviews, podcast appearances and social media found their criticism of vaccines, particularly for pregnant women, goes deeper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://subscribe.washingtonpost.com/newsletters/#/bundle/postmost?method=SURL&amp;amp;location=YAHOO&amp;amp;initiative=feed" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Subscribe to The Post Most newsletter for the most important and interesting stories from The Washington Post.;cpos:1;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Subscribe to The Post Most newsletter for the most important and interesting stories from The Washington Post. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Kennedy has directed a wholesale change in the composition and direction of the once-obscure committee that influences which vaccines doctors administer and compels insurers to cover them. Departing from long-standing federal immunization guidance, the advisers last year made changes to recommendations on hepatitis B, influenza and covid. The shifts have alarmed medical groups, state health departments and public health experts, who say the changes put children at greater risk for vaccine-preventable diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Biss is a physician based in St. Petersburg, Florida, who, according to federal officials, has held leadership positions at Bayfront Health/Orlando Health Bayfront Hospital. Biss has broadly questioned the safety of vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In a December 2022 podcast interview, Biss said “prior to covid I was not an anti-vaxxer, but I am now because I’ve gone down the rabbit hole, and I would love to be able someday to meet Robert F. Kennedy Jr.” She repeated those comments during a May 2023 panel discussion hosted by the Vaccine Safety Research Foundation, an organization critical of coronavirus vaccines: “I was not anti-vaccine. I am now.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In that discussion, she said her two grown children, in their 20s, received all their childhood shots, including for HPV, and that she and her husband routinely received flu shots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“My grandchildren will not get any shots if I can help it,” she said. “The vaccine industry is disgusting.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Urato, a Harvard-trained specialist in maternal-fetal medicine who has practiced in Massachusetts, has primarily been outspoken on the use of antidepressants and other medication during pregnancy. He has also questioned vaccination during pregnancy and whether Americans are over-vaccinated more broadly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;During a December 2023 podcast interview, he said he asks people to imagine a chemical manufacturing plant and a prenatal clinic outside the gates of the plant. The vaccines and drugs are “coming fresh out of the chemical, manufacturing facility” and “then they’re going into the prenatal clinic, and then they’re being injected into the pregnant women,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Their questioning of vaccines aligns closely with those of Kennedy and his allies, including some vaccine critics on the committee who have repeatedly questioned the necessity and safety of some vaccines, and decried the influence of the pharmaceutical industry. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP, has said it plans to review the safety of vaccines given during pregnancy, and a committee work group on maternal vaccines has been set up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Biss and Urato did not return requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Andrew Nixon, a spokesman for the Department of Health and Human Services who responded on their behalf, did not answer questions about their past comments. He said Kennedy appointed Biss and Urato “because of their extensive clinical experience and their commitment to evidence-based medicine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“ACIP benefits from clinicians who engage patients honestly, respect informed consent, and evaluates the science rigorously,” Nixon said in a statement. “We look forward to their valuable insight and perspective on the committee.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;A public health group blasted the latest appointments, highlighting past comments by Biss including her claims that coronavirus vaccination may lead to a “huge spike in cancer” in children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“The more RFK Jr. stacks his immunization advisory panel with anti-vaccine activists, the more its recommendations will undermine our public health to advance conspiracy theories and anti-science ideology,” said Kayla Hancock, director of Public Health Watch, a project of Protect Our Care, a liberal advocacy group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The new members are expected to participate in the now 13-person committee’s next meeting, which is scheduled Feb. 25-26.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology (ACOG) and the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine have strongly supported vaccination during pregnancy, saying the science demonstrates the safety and effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;- - -&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Biss’s comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Biss has spoken extensively on podcasts to criticize the use of coronavirus vaccines during pregnancy, claiming they increased the risk of miscarriages, a connection that has been rebutted by several studies. She shared these claims while speaking at a November 2023 congressional hearing held by then-Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Georgia) on alleged injuries caused by coronavirus vaccines. The HHS announcement of her appointment highlighted her publications on coronavirus vaccine safety for pregnant women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Biss has also questioned the practice of giving flu shots to pregnant women. In a June interview, she said warnings that pregnant women are more likely to get sick from the virus because they have suppressed immune systems are a “shtick to get all these women injected with flu vaccines for many, many decades.” She said she never had a pregnant patient die of the flu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In August, ACOG released updated clinical guidance about vaccination during pregnancy against covid-19, influenza and RSV, recommending immunization. Pregnant women who develop symptomatic covid cases are more likely to develop severe illness and are at higher risk for ICU admission compared with women who are not pregnant, according to ACOG.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“It is well documented that respiratory conditions can cause poor outcomes during pregnancy, with pregnant women facing both severe illness and threats to the health of their pregnancy,” ACOG president Steven J. Fleischman said in a statement. “Thanks to vaccines, severe outcomes from respiratory infections are largely preventable.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In a May 2024 interview, Biss questioned the practice of vaccination during pregnancy to pass along antibodies from mother to baby, arguing that the antibody component of the immune system is “not really the important one.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Maybe we’re causing a lot of these things that women have problems with in pregnancy simply because we’re giving them these vaccines,” Biss said, naming the flu and Tdap (tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis) shots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Biss has expressed regret for providing patients with the Gardasil vaccine for HPV, questioning the safety and efficacy data. As part of an unprecedented overhaul of the childhood immunization schedule last week, federal health officials maintained the recommendation for adolescents to be vaccinated for HPV but to receive one dose instead of two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;- - -&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Urato’s comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;When ACOG promoted vaccination for respiratory viruses during pregnancy in October 2024, Urato replied on X by raising concerns about the four vaccines during pregnancy recommended by ACOG and CDC: Flu, respiratory syncytial virus, covid and Tdap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“My patients often ask: ‘How do we know that all these vaccines won’t have adverse effects on my baby &amp;amp; me?’ The answer is: ‘We don’t,’” Urato tweeted. “Women’s vax concerns should be acknowledged &amp;amp; their choices supported.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In a June interview, Urato said there is a “battle” between the forces that prioritize medical interventions and those who want to do “more watchful waiting or less intervention.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“This is a huge problem for us just with over-intervention in medicine, too much testing, too many drugs, too many vaccines,” Urato said, later comparing vaccine makers to cigarette manufacturers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“They’re going to underplay the risks,” he said. “Often you find out that it wasn’t as safe as first promoted. It wasn’t as effective as they said it was going to be, and that it was causing real damage and real harm. And a lot of these products go on to the dustbin of history.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;He also said pharmaceutical companies stoke fear to promote their products, including vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“What they’ve been doing is often selling sickness or selling the illness,” Urato said in an April interview. “And this is true, certainly with a lot of the pharmaceuticals, the vaccines, this idea of pushing like you could die, you could be dead tomorrow if you get this disease, so you’ve got to do what pharma wants.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;—&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Video Embed Code&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Video: On Jan. 13, Robert F.

                &lt;p&gt;Berkeley officials are warning the public about leptospirosis, a bacterial disease that can be fatal in dogs and humans, after animals in the &lt;a href="https://www.berkeleyscanner.com/topic/harrison-street-corridor/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Harrison Street corridor&lt;/a&gt; tested positive in recent months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Numerous rats" and at least two dogs in the area — the site of a longstanding homeless encampment linked to an &lt;a href="https://www.berkeleyscanner.com/topic/harrison-street-corridor/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;ongoing court battle&lt;/a&gt; — have already tested positive for the disease, the city says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The absence of confirmed human cases is reassuring but does not remove the risk of undiagnosed cases or future cases," the city's public health officer said in a Jan. 6 court filing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leptospirosis, also called 'lepto," spreads through contact with infected water and mud, according to a &lt;a href="https://berkeleyca.gov/sites/default/files/2026-01/January%2012%2C%202026%20Lepto%20Health%20Alert%20Final.pdf?ref=berkeleyscanner.com" rel="noreferrer"&gt;city public health alert issued Monday&lt;/a&gt;. Rats and their urine are vectors for the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.berkeleyscanner.com/content/images/2026/01/IMG_9998.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" srcset="https://www.berkeleyscanner.com/content/images/size/w600/2026/01/IMG_9998.jpg 600w, https://www.berkeleyscanner.com/content/images/size/w1000/2026/01/IMG_9998.jpg 1000w, https://www.berkeleyscanner.com/content/images/2026/01/IMG_9998.jpg 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span&gt;Part of the Harrison encampment last week. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.berkeleyscanner.com/support/#become-a-scanner-insider-by-sharing-tips" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;em class="italic"&gt;Scanner Insider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result of the positive tests, the city has "strongly" urged encampment residents to move at least one-third of a mile away from a "red zone" where leptospirosis has been found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This 1/3 mile safety buffer will be a focus of prevention activities to block the further spread," the city wrote, urging "immediate departure" from the zone. "Any items removed from encampments and exposed to mud and standing water should be disinfected."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the city, the unsafe area is bounded by San Pablo Avenue, Gilman Street, Codornices Creek and the railroad tracks in &lt;a href="https://www.berkeleyscanner.com/topic/northwest-berkeley/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;northwest Berkeley&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Current Harrison Street encampment conditions (tents, refuse, uncontained food, RVs, standing water) prevent standard vector control teams from accessing and destroying rat nesting sites," the city says. "Rodent eradication, ongoing rat testing for Leptospirosis, and remediation of the area to prevent a growing rat infestation is a medical and public health safety necessity that cannot be successfully completed while the encampment is occupied."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This week, city of Berkeley officials said all community members should avoid touching the water in Codornices Creek and "walking or biking through standing water" in the area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The city said the creek has not been tested for leptospirosis — while noting that "the presence of Lepto so close to the creek means that there is also a significant risk of the disease spreading to the creek and wildlife if the nearby infected rodent population is not controlled." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Monday evening, &lt;a href="https://www.berkeleyscanner.com/topic/uc-berkeley-crime/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;UC Berkeley&lt;/a&gt; sent the city's health alert to residents of University Village on the Albany-Berkeley border on the north side of the creek.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.berkeleyscanner.com/content/images/2026/01/berkeley-leptospirosis-1.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" srcset="https://www.berkeleyscanner.com/content/images/size/w600/2026/01/berkeley-leptospirosis-1.jpg 600w, https://www.berkeleyscanner.com/content/images/size/w1000/2026/01/berkeley-leptospirosis-1.jpg 1000w, https://www.berkeleyscanner.com/content/images/2026/01/berkeley-leptospirosis-1.jpg 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span&gt;Leptospirosis notices are now posted in northwest Berkeley. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.berkeleyscanner.com/support/#become-a-scanner-insider-by-sharing-tips" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;em class="italic"&gt;Scanner Insider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In humans, leptospirosis can cause &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/leptospirosis/about/index.html?ref=berkeleyscanner.com" rel="noreferrer"&gt;flu-like symptoms&lt;/a&gt;, such as "sudden high fever, throbbing headache, severe calf/leg pain, and red eyes," according to the city. "Without treatment, leptospirosis … can progress to kidney damage, meningitis (inflammation of the membrane around the brain and spinal cord), liver failure, trouble breathing, and even death."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And local doctors may not readily recognize it, since it is "usually associated with tropical conditions."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Animals began testing positive for leptospirosis in November, the city wrote, when veterinarians found it in two sick dogs at the Harrison Street encampment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In December, &lt;a href="https://acvcsd.org/?ref=berkeleyscanner.com" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Alameda County Vector Control&lt;/a&gt; confirmed the disease's presence in neighborhood rats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This was of particular concern," the city wrote, because it was the first time the potentially deadly bacteria has been found in the area despite five years of testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At least one dog, a 5-month-old puppy, is believed to have died from leptospirosis, although the bacteria's presence was not confirmed by testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The city has now launched "an ongoing public health investigation" into lepto's spread in the encampment and nearby.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Cleanup will take at least 30 days because that is how long Lepto can live in the soil," the city wrote. "Additionally, eradication of rats requires many cycles of baiting the rats with poison in their underground burrows, removing the carcasses and rebaiting over a period of time."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials have also posted notices in the neighborhood, with the help of Alameda County Vector Control, to alert residents to the risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Berkeley's &lt;a href="https://berkeleyca.gov/sites/default/files/2026-01/January%2012%2C%202026%20Lepto%20Health%20Alert%20Final.pdf?ref=berkeleyscanner.com" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Jan. 12 public health alert&lt;/a&gt;, local dog owners should be sure to vaccinate their pets for leptospirosis and owners of "free roaming cats" should consider the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Keep pets on a short leash; bring water on walks, do not allow them to drink from other sources," the city said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Signs of pet illness may include "excessive thirst, vomiting, shivering, and lethargy and can progress to liver failure if untreated. Lepto can also be fatal to dogs."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gardeners should also take precautions, particularly if they grow fruit and vegetables: "Wear gloves and protective foot coverings, such as rubber boots. Wash all fruits and vegetables thoroughly before consumption."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other precautions such as safe food storage and "continuous disposal of garbage" can limit the spread of leptospirosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Jan. 6 court filing, the city's public health officer said an ongoing &lt;a href="https://www.berkeleyscanner.com/2025/06/10/community/berkeley-cant-close-harrison-homeless-camp-yet-judge-says/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;federal injunction&lt;/a&gt; stopping Berkeley from clearing the Harrison Street camp has blocked the city "from implementing fully effective eradication efforts" in its battle with leptospirosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, the judge who issued that injunction last year said the time has come to resolve the matter. Almost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a brief hearing over Zoom, &lt;a href="https://cand.uscourts.gov/judges/emc/chen-edward-m?ref=berkeleyscanner.com" rel="noreferrer"&gt;U.S. District Judge Edward M Chen&lt;/a&gt; ordered both parties, the Berkeley Homeless Union and attorneys for the city of Berkeley, to produce a series of briefs in the coming months, culminating in a March 20 hearing where he will rule on what the city must do if it hopes to clear the encampment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;" I need to adjudicate this thing," Chen said. " We can get this thing closed one way or another."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="kg-card kg-signup-card kg-width-wide kg-style-accent" data-lexical-signup-form=""&gt;

            Small changes in diet, exercise and sleep may extend life by a year when put into practice together, while making larger changes could provide more than nine additional years of life, according to a new study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkczca5h000f3b6pv58fotwf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Combining changes in &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/09/01/health/mediterranean-diet-recipes-wellness"&gt;diet&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/05/health/importance-of-exercise-sleep-wellness"&gt;sleep&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/14/health/mind-body-fitness-routine-wellness"&gt;exercise&lt;/a&gt; also increased “health span,” or the number of years a person may live without major health complaints.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkczca5h000g3b6pn0yg0e5g@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “These findings highlight the importance of considering lifestyle behaviors as a&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;package rather than in isolation,” said lead study author Nick Koemel, a research fellow in physical activity, lifestyle and population health at the University of Syndey’s main campus in Camperdown, Australia.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkczca5h000h3b6pugkdk3g6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “By targeting small improvements across multiple behaviors simultaneously, the required change for any single behavior is substantially reduced, which may help overcome common barriers to long-term behavior change,” Koemel said in an email.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            However, that finding is far from conclusive, said Kevin McConway, professor emeritus of applied statistics at the Open University in Milton Keynes, United Kingdom, who was not involved in the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkczca5h000k3b6psbqix2g6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “A snag is that the paper uses complicated statistical methods that are not always described clearly,” McConway said in an email. “It’s therefore difficult to tell to what extent the findings have emerged from the researchers’ choice of statistical analyses, rather than things that are clearer from the data.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkczca5h000l3b6pabhnjycf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Using scientific modeling, Koemel and his team found combining as little as five additional minutes of sleep, two minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity (such as &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/cnn-underscored/health-fitness/our-favorite-comfortable-running-shoes-releases-2025?utm_source=internal&amp;amp;utm_medium=mainsite&amp;amp;utm_id=features"&gt;brisk walking&lt;/a&gt; or taking the stairs), and an additional ½ cup of vegetables a day might lengthen life by a year.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            However, this predicted outcome was only for people who had an extremely poor diet, slept less than &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/04/20/health/sleep-dementia-risk-study-wellness"&gt;six hours per night&lt;/a&gt; and only exercised about seven minutes a day. In addition, it wasn’t until the model’s lifestyle improvements greatly increased that the results became scientifically significant.

            “All of the gains reported in this study are theoretical,” Koemel said. “We cannot claim a direct causal effect from the lifestyle patterns. These findings should therefore be interpreted as expected or projected benefits under assumed behavioral variations, rather than confirmed effects of an intervention.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkczca5h000o3b6py8rov2u9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The greatest gain in longevity — 9.35 years — and health span&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;— 9.46 years — came with the combination of an addition of 42 to 103 minutes of exercise and &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/cnn-underscored/reviews/ozlo-sleepbuds?utm_source=internal&amp;amp;utm_medium=mainsite&amp;amp;utm_id=features"&gt;sleeping between seven and eight hours&lt;/a&gt; a day, while also eating an extremely healthy diet that included fish, whole grains, vegetables and fruits.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Adding exercise to the mix moved the longevity needle the most — a fact that did not surprise preventive cardiologist Dr. Andrew Freeman, director of cardiovascular prevention and wellness at National Jewish Health in Denver.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “Exercise is the elixir of youth,” said Freeman, who was not involved in the study. “But let me be clear — this study should not be interpreted as exercising for exactly two minutes and stop, you’ve accomplished a goal.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “Rather, you should aim to get 20 to 30 minutes of &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/11/health/walking-fast-benefits-study-wellness"&gt;brisk, breathless physical activity&lt;/a&gt;, combining strength and cardio in every day. That advice has not changed over decades of study.”

            The study, &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/eclinm/article/PIIS2589-5370(25)00676-5/fulltext" target="_blank"&gt;published Wednesday&lt;/a&gt; in the journal eClinicalMedicine, looked at almost 60,000 participants from England, Scotland and Wales in the  &lt;a href="https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/" target="_blank"&gt;UK Biobank&lt;/a&gt;, a longitudinal health study, who were followed for an average of eight years. Everyone in the study provided information on their diet — including ultraprocessed foods, such as sugar-sweetened beverages. A subset of the group also wore wrist watches that provided more objective measurements of movement and sleep.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Researchers gathered this medical data and used it to form theoretical scenarios of improved longevity and health span, which was defined as the number of years free of &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/29/health/heart-disease-risk-factors-wellness"&gt;cardiovascular disease&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/29/health/exercise-midlife-dementia-risk-wellness"&gt;dementia&lt;/a&gt;, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/25/health/mediterranean-diet-type-2-diabetes-wellness"&gt;type 2 diabetes.&lt;/a&gt;

            Enjoying a longer life and a longer health span, or remaining free of disease, aren’t the same thing, Koemel said. “Combined improvements in sleep, physical activity, and diet were associated with longer lifespans, even if people still developed some chronic conditions later in life.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            After adjusting the findings for many variables — such as the amount of &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/08/health/aha-ultraprocessed-food-guidelines-wellness"&gt;ultraprocessed foods&lt;/a&gt;, smoking, alcohol use, body mass index, insomnia, snoring and daytime sleepiness — the results differed depending on how much of each behavior change was accomplished.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            In addition to the lowest and highest levels of the lifestyle changes discussed above, researchers also found lower levels of exercise — less than 23 minutes a day — sleeping seven to eight hours a night, and an excellent diet were associated with nearly four more years of life and three years of health, the study found.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkczca5h000z3b6poihfxmbh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Moderate levels of exercise (between 23 and 42 minutes a day), sleeping up to eight hours per night, and a high-quality diet were associated with a greater improvement of an additional seven years of life and just over six years of good health. So many calculations! What does it all mean?
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “This is not about the absolute minutes you exercise or sleep or the number of pieces of broccoli you eat. It’s about making sure that all the things you do in your life are synonymous with health,” Freeman said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “This is a great time of year to reflect on how you live and make big changes that will set you up for a life of wellness by modifying your life’s trajectory,” he said. “The overall signal in the noise is if you live well, your health span and then your lifespan will be longer.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

And if we want to reduce sitting by 30 minutes a day, this can be swapped for light activities like pottering around the house or a slow walk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Meanwhile, a second study, &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/eclinm/article/PIIS2589-5370(25)00676-5/fulltext" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;published in the eClinicalMedicine journal&lt;/a&gt;, found that when combined, small improvements in sleep, physical activity, and diet were linked with a longer life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;For example, an extra five minutes of sleep, two minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity – such as brisk walking or taking the stairs – and an additional half a serving of vegetables a day could lead to an extra year of life for those with the worst sleep, physical activity, and dietary habits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Experts led by the University of Sydney gathered information on the levels of activity, diet and sleep of almost 60,000 people taking part in the UK Biobank study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Compared with people with the worst sleep, physical activity and dietary habits, the study suggested that the optimal combination of these behaviours – seven to eight hours of sleep per day, more than 40 minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity a day and a healthy diet – was associated with living almost a decade longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 23:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitAFBVV95cUxPM0xjLUx2WHAycy1fNjI3OGdrd3pBa3A0VzdmcWs3bVhpU3UzWFZlQ0ZWaXpIVDA3cldHY2VRRVNVd2F0WkFBZU13bzJRNklkVjVpTko3MkZZSXVyZTMtZTc1MG9OWER0TmhhLUdxbTBIbVhtaGtxMnRMaERwSk5DWDI2aWY0bDIwNWY2c01HaTBhWi0yVGZGQlg3aFdXbzNBMGxYazNkTlRJN0E4bkVNQkU5clU</guid></item><item><title>肯尼迪增加了怀孕期间反对疫苗和抗抑郁药的疫苗咨询小组成员- NBC新闻</title><link>https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/kennedy-cdc-vaccine-committee-new-members-vaccines-pregnancy-rcna253863</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body__content"&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7a32c6" class="body-graf"&gt;WASHINGTON — Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. appointed two new members to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s vaccine advisory committee who have challenged broad medical consensus on vaccines and antidepressants in pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a35159" class="body-graf"&gt;Kennedy on Tuesday announced he is adding two obstetrician-gynecologists to the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, the body that recommends to the CDC who should get certain vaccines. They join 11 other members selected by Kennedy after&lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/kennedy-guts-acip-cdc-vaccine-panel-rcna211935" target="_blank"&gt; he fired the previous panel of experts in June&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-83bfbd" class="body-graf"&gt;The newest appointees are Dr. Adam Urato, who specializes in maternal-fetal medicine and has practiced at Boston-area hospitals; and Dr. Kimberly Biss, who is based in St. Petersburg, Florida, and has held various leadership positions at an Orlando-area hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-af1357" class="body-graf"&gt;HHS referred NBC News to&lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/secretary-kennedy-appoints-two-ob-gyns-cdc-advisory-committee-immunization-practices.html" target="_blank"&gt; a press release&lt;/a&gt; when asked about past instances in which the appointees appeared to spread medical misinformation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-05be1c" class="body-graf"&gt;“ACIP serves as Americans’ watchdog for vaccine safety and transparency,” Kennedy said in a statement. “Dr. Urato and Dr. Biss bring the scientific credentials, clinical experience, and integrity this committee requires.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-090512" class="body-graf"&gt;Biss has been a vocal skeptic of Covid vaccines. In 2023, she told&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ozoyxd45ktE" target="_blank"&gt; the GOP-led House subcommittee on Covid vaccines&lt;/a&gt; that some patients in her practice had faced irregularities with their menstrual cycles after receiving the shots that were so severe she’d had to perform surgeries and hysterectomies. Biss also testified that the miscarriage rate at her practice went up each year from 2020 to 2022 and suggested the vaccines might have been responsible for some women entering early menopause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-372c5f" class="body-graf"&gt;Pediatrician and former ACIP member Paul Offit blasted Biss’ testimony in&lt;a href="https://pauloffit.substack.com/p/vaccine-safetyby-marjorie-taylor" target="_blank"&gt; a post on Substack at the time&lt;/a&gt;, pushing back on her claims about Covid vaccine safety risks and her suggestion that breastfeeding was unsafe for women who have been vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-724af3" class="body-graf"&gt;“Perhaps most outrageous was Biss’s stance on vaccinating children,” Offit wrote, referring to her claim that the death rate among children was low enough that vaccines weren’t needed. Biss falsely claimed that only 3 in 1 million children die from Covid, when the actual rate at the time was &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2800816" target="_blank"&gt;10 in 1 million&lt;/a&gt;. Covid shots have also been demonstrated to reduce the severity of illness and lower the risk of hospitalization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-df70c5" class="body-graf"&gt;During&lt;a href="https://ket.org/program/kentucky-tonight/vaccines-and-medications/" target="_blank"&gt; a panel discussion last October on PBS’s Kentucky Educational Television&lt;/a&gt;, Biss advocated against what she characterized as an “instant rejection” of alternative medical ideas, like the questioning of vaccine safety and the Trump administration’s advice that pregnant women avoid taking Tylenol because of potential links to autism. (&lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/acetaminophen-tylenol-pregnancy-autism-risk-rfk-jr-rcna229429" target="_blank"&gt;The bulk of scientific evidence&lt;/a&gt; suggests moderate Tylenol use is safe in pregnancy and does not show a link to autism.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4ca88e" class="body-graf"&gt;“I just think we need to be able to question these things and not be called a quack,” she said at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3e02da" class="body-graf"&gt;Urato, meanwhile, has also&lt;a href="https://x.com/AdamUrato1/status/1845461085106626880" target="_blank"&gt; questioned the safety of vaccines&lt;/a&gt; administered during pregnancy — including for flu, RSV and Covid — as well as the use of antidepressants among pregnant women.

Some research have found a&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9543237/" target="_blank"&gt; slightly elevated risk of miscarriage&lt;/a&gt;, while others have found&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/1656691" target="_blank"&gt; no association&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f67fc0" class="body-graf"&gt;In July, Urato participated in an FDA discussion in which nearly all the panelists bucked medical consensus on the safety of&lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/mental-health/fda-panel-promotes-misinformation-antidepressants-pregnancy-psychiatri-rcna220047" target="_blank"&gt; SSRIs during pregnancy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-75f2eb" class="body-graf"&gt;“Never before in human history have we chemically altered developing babies like this,” Urato said during the discussion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4d0291" class="body-graf"&gt;Biss and Urato didn’t respond to requests for comment after their appointments to ACIP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e14381" class="body-graf"&gt;Kennedy has said he overhauled the committee because the prior members were “plagued with persistent conflicts of interest.” (One of Kennedy’s picks, Dr. Michael Ross, withdrew his membership during a mandatory review of panelists’ financial holdings.) Many of the current advisory group members have expressed skepticism of vaccines — in particular, Covid shots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c27103" class="body-graf"&gt;The panel&lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/covid-vaccine-eligibility-limit-over-65-health-conditions-cdc-rcna232374" target="_blank"&gt; voted in September&lt;/a&gt; to recommend Covid shots only for people 65 and older and those with underlying health conditions, a change from prior guidance that everyone six months and older should get them. The vote came in spite of evidence that&lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/kids-health/cdc-covid-shot-study-protects-health-kids-severe-illness-rcna248683" target="_blank"&gt; the shots protect healthy children&lt;/a&gt; and younger adults from severe illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9588c6" class="body-graf"&gt;In making their decision, the panelists discussed a number of fringe ideas that aren’t supported by scientific evidence, including claims that injuries caused by Covid vaccines aren’t well-documented and that the shots can lead to cancer or birth defects. Studies have continuously demonstrated the safety of Covid vaccines. Though they carry a very small risk of myocarditis — inflammation of the heart muscle — the&lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/cardiovascular-medicine/articles/10.3389/fcvm.2022.951314/full" target="_blank"&gt; risk is far higher after an infection&lt;/a&gt; with the virus itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-fff5c5" class="body-graf"&gt;In December, the advisory panel&lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/kids-health/cdc-panel-vote-hepatitis-b-vaccine-babies-rfk-jr-rcna247482" target="_blank"&gt; reversed a decadeslong recommendation&lt;/a&gt; that all infants be vaccinated against hepatitis B shortly after birth, recommending instead that women who test negative for hepatitis B talk to their doctors about whether to give their newborn the first dose right away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c9a2ef" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;The panel had been planning to evaluate the full childhood immunization schedule, but — in an unprecedented move — Kennedy&lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/rfk-jr-vaccines-overhaul-kids-denmark-fewer-childhood-shots-rcna250055" target="_blank"&gt; altered the schedule last week&lt;/a&gt; without consulting the advisers. The new schedule has fewer universal recommendations for children, dropping the number of diseases targeted from 18 to 11. For example, the CDC now advises parents to talk to a doctor about whether their child should get the flu or Covid shots. The American Academy of Pediatrics has opposed the overhaul and encouraged people to follow &lt;a href="https://www.healthychildren.org/English/news/Pages/AAP-releases-its-own-evidence-based-immunization-schedule.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;its own schedule, instead&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 23:29:08 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitAFBVV95cUxQYU9zck1pNWdFWFZtdFhpbEd4WjBtcTJMMXVxSTBrLWdmY2FqNlc0Mk50Xy1zT28ySGNnYWVrNVYtWEdMRTNjTHctbUtpS0NBc3dnZEFWNHE3TEhLcWQxZEsxSlA2bW56RUhkbTNFN05XclpKTkFQLVZGcEpUTXNqSDV3Y1gwSmNWcUZIWEQzY19INUlvVXVkMGpnOGNZaWNvbEdfMVRKMURucThORi0wVjVNRE4</guid></item><item><title>新泽西州儿童流感死亡： 2岁儿子从莫里斯敦医疗中心被送回家后，妈妈大声疾呼-纽约ABC7</title><link>https://abc7ny.com/post/nj-child-flu-death-mom-speaks-2-year-old-son-was-sent-home-morristown-medical-center/18392336/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="xvlfx ZRifP TKoO eaKKC EcdEg bOdfO qXhdi NFNeu UyHES " data-testid="prism-article-body"&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao MvWXB TjIXL aGjvy ebVHC "&gt;&lt;span class="oyrPY qlwaB AGxeB  "&gt;MORRISTOWN, New Jersey (WABC) -- &lt;/span&gt;The parents of the &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://abc7ny.com/post/flu-outbreak-nj-health-officials-report-first-pediatric-death-season-state/18378670/" target="_blank"&gt;first child to die from the flu in New Jersey&lt;/a&gt; this season spoke out exclusively to Eyewitness News about their heartbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Two-year-old Isaias Castillo's mother says the family took him to the emergency room with a fever but they were sent home -- and hours later he died.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Family members told Eyewitness News they believe his death could have been prevented.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"I will never be the same, my children will never be the same, my family will never be the same, and to them it's just another number," Giselle Castillo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Castillo's 2-year-old son Isaias was the center of her world.

&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flu is surging around the country, and Vermont is not immune to the national trend, though the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s most recent &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/usmap.html"&gt;dashboard for the disease&lt;/a&gt; identifies the state’s illness prevalence as lower than much of the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Vermont, about 20-25% of tests have come back positive this season, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.healthvermont.gov/sites/default/files/document/lsid-id-flu-report-week-53-2025-2026.pdf"&gt;state dashboard&lt;/a&gt; with data through Jan. 3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Statewide, nearly 8% of visits to a Vermont emergency room or urgent care were due to flu-like illnesses; nearly 6% were related to diagnosed flu cases, according to the state data available through Jan. 3. Both rates were much higher than this same period last year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The overwhelming majority of these tests have come back positive for one particular strain of influenza A, which is the most &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/327397#Influenza-C"&gt;common of the four flu virus types&lt;/a&gt;. This year, a particularly vicious subvariant of that strain, subclade K, has dominated most flu cases across the country. While Vermont’s testing does not have that extra level of granularity, it’s likely these cases in the state are subclade K, said John Davy, the health surveillance epidemiologist at the Vermont Department of Health. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Experts &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/flu-subclade-k-cdc-vaccine-ca9bd270ca70602775168b0b651e3b2a"&gt;are not yet sure&lt;/a&gt; whether this strain is so prevalent due to the fact that it spreads more easily or due to it being more dangerous. But it’s clear that the illness has been especially brutal this season: In New York, the state has had the highest number of flu cases &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/flu-subclade-k-cdc-vaccine-ca9bd270ca70602775168b0b651e3b2a"&gt;ever reported&lt;/a&gt; in a single week. In Connecticut, doctors &lt;a href="https://www.wfsb.com/video/2025/12/29/connecticut-flu-cases-surge-highest-levels-doctors-have-ever-seen/"&gt;told a local news outlet&lt;/a&gt; that the surge is the highest they’ve ever seen.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;At UVM Medical Center, the illness prevalence mirrors statewide numbers, confirmed Phillip Rau, a spokesperson for the Burlington hospital. That is starting to trend downward, Rau added, though Vermont’s flu season generally lasts into late March. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hospital currently has around 20 people admitted with the flu or related health concerns, he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rutland Regional Medical Center, the state’s second largest hospital after UVM Medical Center, is seeing a much earlier spike in cases than in years past. In December, the hospital had 106 positive flu cases, compared with just 17 in December 2024, according to the hospital’s spokesperson Gerianne Smart. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of Jan. 13, the Rutland hospital has confirmed 88 cases of flu this month so far, while last January there were 125 cases the entire month. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Smart said this early surge may be due to the fact that more severe symptoms lead people to seek out care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wastewater &lt;a href="https://data.wastewaterscan.org/tracker/?charts=Ck8QACABSABSBjk4YTI4ZFIGNzY2ZTc3UgYwNjRhYWNaC0luZmx1ZW56YSBBcgoyMDI1LTEyLTAxcgoyMDI2LTAxLTEyigEGNWY5MDllwAEB&amp;amp;selectedChartId=5f909e"&gt;testing&lt;/a&gt; — done at six sites in Vermont — also shows flu increasing in the state. The most recent reports show “high” levels of flu in wastewater, though earlier in December levels were “very high.” Montpelier and Burlington sites show a higher concentration of the illness than the Ludlow and Middlebury sites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Davy, at the health department, explained that it’s important to assess all of these available data points together. “Each has its kind of strengths and weaknesses, reflecting a slightly different sort of phenomenon on the ground,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He said that the reason the CDC’s dashboard may show lower rates in Vermont than in neighboring states may be due to differences in how each state calculates and reports flu occurrence and may be because Vermont’s smaller population makes the data more responsive to smaller shifts in behavior — like a dip in the number of people seeking care over the holidays. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It doesn’t mean that there’s a shortage of flu in the state. He pointed to the outbreak reports that the health department receives from institutions — places like schools and nursing homes. Those show a growing number of flu cases, which he said can be a useful indicator for the rest of the state. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over one-fifth of patients with flu-like illness in Vermont are children under 5 years old, according to the state data from Dec. 28 to Jan. 3 — a “big, disproportionate amount,” compared to the state’s population that age, Davy said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“These are populations where vaccination can have a really positive impact,” Davy said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The variant arose this summer, and thus was not incorporated as a reference strain in this year’s flu vaccine, though &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12639273/"&gt;early research&lt;/a&gt; from England shows this year’s shot does convey some immunity. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;“Subclade K may be more likely to evade a vaccine, but folks’ immune systems are still going to benefit,” Davy added. “It could mean the difference between a real severe illness that you spread to a lot of people and a more minor illness that you’re less likely to spread.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Vermont, only 32% of the population, or around 208,000 people, have received the flu vaccine so far this season, &lt;a href="https://www.healthvermont.gov/stats/data-reporting-topic/respiratory-virus-vaccination-data"&gt;according to a state dashboard&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The surge comes in the midst of &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/childhood-immunization-schedule/index.html"&gt;changing guidelines from the CDC&lt;/a&gt; surrounding childhood immunization, including a demotion of the flu vaccines from something the federal body recommended for all children, to an immunization it recommended only after children or their guardians discuss with a doctor. Last week, Vermont state health officials held firm to their existing guidelines recommending that all children receive the vaccine against flu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Davy noted that the majority of flu deaths each year are children who did not receive the flu vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;On top of vaccination, Davy recommended individuals protect themselves and others from flu by practicing familiar safety measures against respiratory illnesses: stay home if you’re sick, wear a mask in crowded areas and wash your hands often.  &lt;/p&gt;
