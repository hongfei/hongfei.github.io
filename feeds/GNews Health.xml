&lt;p&gt;We’ve got some good news and some bad news.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The bad news is that a new study out of Harvard has established a link between eating potatoes and an increased risk of developing diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But the good news is not all potatoes are equal: There are plenty of spuds you can keep on your plate, but one preparation has a clear downside.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;A new study out of Harvard has established a link between eating potatoes and an increased risk of developing diabetes —but the good news is not all potatoes are equal. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Proxima Studio – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We’re shifting the conversation from, ‘Are potatoes good or bad?’ to a more nuanced — and useful — question: How are they prepared, and what might we eat instead?” &lt;a href="https://hsph.harvard.edu/news/potatoes-may-increase-risk-of-type-2-diabetes-depending-on-their-preparation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;said lead author&lt;/a&gt; Seyed Mohammad Mousavi, postdoctoral research fellow in the Department of Nutrition.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers followed over 205,000 people for more than 30 years, taking a close look a their diets.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They found that eating three servings of French fries a week spiked diabetes chances by 20% — but other types of potatoes, including baked and mashed, did not.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;That being said, they also found that replacing any type of potato with whole grain foods can lower your type 2 diabetes risk by 4%.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And swapping fries with whole grains? That will cut your risk by 19%, while even replacing them with refined grains like white bread made a positive difference.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The public health message here is simple and powerful: Small changes in our daily diet can have an important impact on the risk of type 2 diabetes,” said corresponding author Walter Willett, professor of epidemiology and nutrition.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Limiting potatoes — especially limiting French fries — and choosing healthy, whole-grain sources of carbohydrate could help lower the risk of type 2 diabetes across the population.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;They found that eating three servings of French fries a week spiked their diabetes chances by 20%. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;fahrwasser – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;





&lt;p&gt;This is the &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2022/12/26/potatoes-arent-always-bad-for-you-its-all-in-the-preparation/"&gt;second study&lt;/a&gt; in the past year that’s looked at the relationship between potatoes and diabetes. The last one, out of Australia, found that people who ate the most potatoes had a 9% higher diabetes risk compared to those who ate the fewest taters.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And their findings determined boiled potatoes to be the best option.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“When we separated boiled potatoes from mashed potatoes, fries or [chips], boiled potatoes were no longer associated with a higher risk of diabetes. They had a null effect,” said Dr. Nicola Bondonno from Edith Cowan University’s Nutrition and Health Innovation Research Institute, which conducted the research.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s only fries and mashed potatoes [that increase risk], the latter likely because [they’re] usually made with butter, cream and the like.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Picking healthier potato recipes seems to be the key — especially since potatoes actually have plenty of health benefits.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Other types of potatoes, including baked and mashed, did not increase diabetes risk. A previous study found boiled potatoes, in particular, had no effect on diabetes. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Valentina Rychkova – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They have lots of antioxidants like flavonoids, carotenoids and phenolic acids, which can help fight things like cancer and heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;And while starch gets a bad name, potatoes have resistant starch, which feed your gut nutrients and good bacteria. That’s great for digestive health and controlling blood sugar.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In 2022, Polish &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2022/12/07/potatoes-could-hold-a-powerful-new-treatment-for-cancer/"&gt;researchers found that glycoalkaloids&lt;/a&gt; — naturally occurring chemicals found in potatoes, peppers and goji berries — have some cancer-fighting properties.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Potatoes are just fantastic,” Caroline Susie, a registered nutritionist and spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, told &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/healthy-foods-bad-reputations-coffee-eggs-rcna147196" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;NBC News&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“What happens is, unfortunately, we tend to screw them up by not eating the skin or frying or mixing them with everything under the sun, like sour cream and butter and bacon”&lt;/p&gt;
						&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="68" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeow33wt00123b79co7tvqt7@published"&gt;My husband (we’re both men) brought home a guy for a threesome without telling me, saying he wanted it to be a “surprise.” It was. The guy happened to be incredibly hot, so I went along with it anyway, but I think him springing this on me without consulting me first was pretty thoughtless. Should I try pulling the same trick on him and see how he likes it?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="84" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeow345v00153b7939qwg5c5@published"&gt;You’re asking if you should punish your husband for what? Bringing a hot guy home? Please. I agree with you that he should have asked you first, but he didn’t and you tacitly forgave that by having sex. If the experience was nevertheless unenjoyable or even if the shock of the proposition outshined the actual sex, a conversation is in order. Just ask him to talk about it with you first, explaining that this is not the type of surprise that you find fun.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="170" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeow348f00163b79vgbcc3bj@published"&gt;But if the sex was really good and you’re miffed purely on principle, I’m going to urge you to try to center yourself in the realm of the practical. You could look at this as a new era in your relationship: your thirds era. Your husband’s method was a bit sloppy but you had fun anyway, and now there is more of that kind of fun that you can have. By all means, you have been given an implicit pass to do the same (at least once), and you should if you are so inspired and can remain in the original sharing spirit. But doing the same thing to him for sheer retaliation is escalating; he was “thoughtless” in your assessment. Don’t see and raise him with calculating and punitive. Keep sex fun and share a guy because it’s a hot thing to do, not to settle a score. Not only is that adding negativity where it doesn’t belong, it’d be treating the third as a pawn, not a person.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="129" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeowbmbb002o3b79tvdgusgd@published"&gt;I’m a single, straight male who just turned 60. I’ve never really had much of a sex life outside of masturbation. I’m not a bad looking guy, as I’ve been told, but have never had much confidence in myself. The limited sexual encounters I’ve had have been mainly with escorts (that, however, is a topic for another day.) My question deals with ejaculation. Over the last several years, I’ve noticed a marked decrease in ejaculate strength and volume. When I orgasm, the result is often a dribble, and generally one shot. I masturbate 3-5 times a week on average. What I’d like to know is, is this normal for my age? If not, is there something that I can do to get a little more umph in my game?&lt;/p&gt;

From urologist Aaron Spitz’s &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Penis-Book-Complete-Penis-Everything-ebook/dp/B075DSL2NW/ref=sr_1_1?crid=31Z631J3NXG6&amp;amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.EoEP-cm0Woc0LkPmGS1vK_jlSTxv0tMjLkO82yWkhZ7uqDcUQ3t7PFLPp9149ZE6eIx59LuOw5S0lxfRXZSVCPw2s1acl8Zfa-9jKQaemunaTxPvRnFiRFLXMwrX5p9PMNhBfGBW_xebmQtcMnds-MF8NCKe-wPaIy-ChzgVA5sVApxSPe3pT7BTjhqWzhuzY73kN5WtjXmpkcSUK8aUp_XlZzUWsgLnZnd3EFGtqfY.XSWi-3552rdJ0kw81a9z2yUXnrC0peyfBxv3Ch21GQU&amp;amp;dib_tag=se&amp;amp;keywords=the+penis+book&amp;amp;qid=1755700283&amp;amp;sprefix=the+penis+book,aps,127&amp;amp;sr=8-1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Penis Book&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;div data-editable="text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;As men pass the threshold of middle age, their pelvic floor muscles become weaker and less semen is ejaculated with less force—even down to none at all. Also, the seminal vesicles tend to empty less completely and may become partially blocked by the prostate gland as it enlarges. These are normal consequences of getting older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="76" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeowbmbc002t3b794j062q7w@published"&gt;To put an even finer point on this, a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17430422/"&gt;2007 analysis&lt;/a&gt; of more than 6,000 semen samples found that on average, the peak semen volume came from subjects between 30 and 35 in age, and the lowest volumes came from subjects who were ages 55 and up. Spitz adds that other factors that may play a role in semen volume include hormone balance, hydration, overall health, level of arousal and the strength of one’s pelvic floor.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="125" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeowbmbc002u3b79i2z103ao@published"&gt;This may be entirely out of your control, but you may want to consider exercising your pelvic floor (or doing kegel exercises, as they’re called). This typically involves squeezing your pelvic floor muscles repeatedly for periods of time. You can locate the muscle by stopping your flow of urine—working your kegels basically amounts to doing that same thing over and over. There are various online guides for these exercises—I use the &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/stamena-longer-lasting-sex/id1106687104"&gt;Stamena app&lt;/a&gt;. Another thing to consider is the usefulness of abstinence. A &lt;a href="https://www.fertstert.org/article/S0015-0282(04)00877-5/fulltext"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; of 27 men followed for 16 months found that semen volume increased 11.9 percent per abstained day for the first four days of abstinence and 7.1 percent thereafter. Try taking a few days off and see if that boosts your balls.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="145" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeowbmbc002v3b79cv7exzhj@published"&gt;I don’t recommend any kind of supplements that purport to increase semen volume. Any kind of reported success from them is anecdotal and generally on a person-to-person basis (I’ve tried some for the sake of answering these very questions and saw no difference). “I know there are some supplements and despite a friend being one of the ‘founders’ of one of these I would not say they actually do anything,” Charles Welliver, director of men’s health at Albany Medical College and my go-to urology source, wrote to me in an email regarding your letter. Something else you might want to look into: Medications (including urologic ones) may cause lower semen volume so if you had any changes recently in your regimen, that may be the culprit. Otherwise, “This isn’t something you need to see a doctor about. There isn’t much you can do,” wrote Welliver.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="110" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeowbmbd002w3b79zqfdjv2r@published"&gt;You should also pause to consider why this matters to you. Maybe it’s a way of providing to yourself that your body isn’t as old as the years suggest, or maybe you just like to think to yourself, “Look what I made!,” while gazing at the giant puddle of sperm you just produced. But since your play is largely solo, you’re the only one who’s judging. It’s great to strive for more than what you already are and can do, but self-acceptance is key for happiness. If you can’t boost your volume, find a way to be OK with that. Even if they aren’t big, your loads are still yours.&lt;/p&gt;

I’ve tried jerking off when my wife doesn’t want to have sex, but it doesn’t work. If I don’t get laid or at least a blow job, I will be guaranteed to be standing at attention come morning.  Any suggestions?&lt;/p&gt;

Anecdotally, at least &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/1bftql8/how_longstrong_is_your_morning_wood_my_bf_is_only/"&gt;one person&lt;/a&gt; reports a more likelihood to get morning wood if he &lt;em&gt;has&lt;/em&gt; had sex the night before. Regardless, a person like you and a person like him are both likely getting multiple erections a night. The exact reasons for nocturnal penile tumescence, as it’s officially referred to, aren’t known, but it may have something to do with the bladder—perhaps as an alert of its fullness or because a full bladder &lt;a href="https://www.newcastle.edu.au/hippocampus/story/2020/male-erections"&gt;stimulates nerves&lt;/a&gt; that end up causing these spontaneous erections.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="92" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeowbmbd00323b7917dursc4@published"&gt;Morning erections can be a sign of penile/overall health. They are something a lot of guys deal with, mostly by walking them off or peeing upon waking. If your wood is persistent, jerk off or ask your wife if she’s down for a morning bone. Morning wood can be annoying, but its absence can indicate something worse. “Morning and overnight erections are normal! They are good for penile health, bringing in nourishing and oxygenated blood,” wrote Welliver, the urologist I quoted elsewhere in this column. Embrace your morning wood—however you see fit.&lt;/p&gt;

I’m healthy, fairly handsome, very intelligent, successful, musically talented, generous, and have a great sense of humor. But, I have the absolute most difficult time engaging any type of sex that involves my penis because it’s smaller than average, and noticeably so. It’s been over a decade since I’ve had sex, been on a date, or even had a kiss, because at this point, I have so little self-confidence that I haven’t even attempted to ask a woman out. The penis size issue is a mental block for me. &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2023/07/small-penis-solution-average-size.html"&gt;How do I move beyond this?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A registered dietitian sets the record straight on those foods you were previously told are "bad" for heart health.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Foods like eggs, shellfish and full-fat dairy actually contain important heart-healthy nutrients.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;No need to cut out potatoes, coffee or dark chocolate — these foods can also be good for your heart. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For years, certain foods have been labeled as “bad” for heart health—often due to outdated nutrition myths or misleading advice from social media. However, research and expert insights reveal that many of these foods actually offer health benefits, including for the heart. In this article, we’ll highlight several so-called “bad” foods that may be better for your heart than you think.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-1-eggs"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 1. Eggs &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Eggs have long been controversial due to their cholesterol content. However, the current body of research shows that dietary cholesterol found in food has less impact on blood cholesterol than previously thought.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In fact, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Easy-Steps-Lower-Cholesterol-Portfolio/dp/B0D3B5LSDF/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2B74YF90IKZC7&amp;amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.fNASg5aKg7nChWnaUVBCrwxWXwpFq6al5XmFgZoIGIha7FZQZPdNk8zJ0pUqGvUnC-8f5Q1U9CcxAgvkHyjE7w.VpzWQFKYCb58V2pveU65Fhg1zqqHjj59UFGGQNweqlI&amp;amp;dib_tag=se&amp;amp;keywords=veronica+rouse&amp;amp;qid=1722441546&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;sprefix=veronica+rouse%2Cstripbooks%2C98&amp;amp;sr=1-1" data-component="amazon" data-source="affiliate" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Veronica Rouse, RD&lt;/a&gt;, points out that recent research studies have found moderate egg consumption (up to one egg per day) is not associated with an increased risk of heart disease.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In reality, eggs are an excellent source of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7913446/what-is-protein-why-do-you-need-it/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;complete protein&lt;/a&gt; and provide essential nutrients like choline, which supports both heart and brain health. And don’t be afraid to eat the whole egg—the yolk is where most of the vitamins, minerals and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/surprising-nutrient-for-better-heart-health-8686588" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;heart-healthy antioxidants&lt;/a&gt;, like lutein and zeaxanthin, are found.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-2-full-fat-dairy"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 2. Full-Fat Dairy &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Full-fat dairy products like yogurt and milk have long been criticized for their saturated fat content, but research shows they can be part of a heart-healthy diet. Rouse states, “A review article found that full-fat dairy consumption was not associated with an increased risk of heart disease and may even have protective effects due to its unique nutrient profile.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Rouse goes on to list the numerous nutrients found in dairy, including calcium, probiotics and potassium, that can support healthy blood pressure and cholesterol levels. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-3-shellfish"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 3. Shellfish &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Shellfish, such as shrimp, mussels, lobster and oysters, are often avoided due to their cholesterol content. However, they’re actually rich in heart-healthy &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/foods-with-as-many-omega-3s-as-salmon-11681920" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;omega-3 fatty acids&lt;/a&gt; and low in saturated fat, making them a nutritious choice for cardiovascular health. Rouse points out, “Eating one to two servings of seafood per week may reduce the risk of coronary heart disease, stroke and even death, especially when replacing less-healthy foods in the diet.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-4-coffee"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 4. Coffee &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Caffeine has often been controversial for raising blood pressure, but &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8069479/is-coffee-good-for-you/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;moderate coffee consumption&lt;/a&gt; (around 2 to 3 cups per day) has been linked to &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/is-drinking-too-much-coffee-bad-for-you-11745737" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;heart-health benefits&lt;/a&gt;. Rouse shares that a large cohort study found that coffee drinkers had a significant reduction of cardiovascular disease.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; These potential benefits may have something to do with the antioxidants found in coffee, like chlorogenic acid and polyphenols, which help reduce inflammation and support blood vessel function. Just be mindful of what you add to your cup—too much sugar or heavy cream can make it less heart-healthy.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-5-potatoes"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 5. Potatoes &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Potatoes often get unfairly criticized, but they’re actually a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8044322/are-potatoes-good-for-you/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;nutrient-packed vegetable&lt;/a&gt; loaded with fiber, energizing complex carbohydrates, vitamin C and potassium, which plays a key role in regulating blood pressure.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Rouse points out that what it all really boils down to&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;is how they’re prepared. She recommends boiling or baking them with the skin on for added fiber, instead of frying.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-6-chocolate"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 6. Chocolate &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Chocolate is often seen as a “bad” food that you should avoid for better health. However, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/benefits-of-chocolate-11760050" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;dark chocolate with a high cocoa content&lt;/a&gt; (70% cocoa or more) can actually be a heart-healthy food choice in moderation. &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8013599/what-happens-to-your-body-when-you-eat-chocolate-every-day/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Cocoa is rich in flavonoids&lt;/a&gt;, plant compounds that help lower blood pressure and improve circulation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Research supports these benefits—a meta-analysis study found that moderate chocolate consumption was associated with improvements in heart disease risk factors including lowering blood pressure, LDL cholesterol and fasting glucose.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-other-tips-for-supporting-heart-health"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Other Tips for Supporting Heart Health &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While a heart-healthy diet is important, it’s just one part of the bigger picture. Here are a few other habits to consider for keeping your heart strong and healthy.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focus on Fiber:&lt;/strong&gt; Include plenty of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts and seeds in the diet to get your fiber in. Most people should be aiming for about &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8043390/too-much-fiber/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;25 to 36 grams of fiber per day&lt;/a&gt;. Rouse mentions especially focusing on &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7962360/what-is-the-difference-between-insoluble-and-soluble-fiber-according-to-a-dietitian/" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;soluble fiber sources&lt;/a&gt;, as these can help lower your LDL (“bad”) cholesterol.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prioritize Omega-3s:&lt;/strong&gt; Make sure to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-nutrient-to-lower-inflammation-8783795" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;prioritize omega-3 fatty acids&lt;/a&gt; from foods such as salmon, mackerel, sardines, chia seeds and walnuts, as omega-3s can help reduce inflammation and support heart function. Rouse reminds us, “The American Heart Association recommends eating fish at least twice a week for optimal heart health.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stay Active:&lt;/strong&gt; Regular physical activity strengthens the heart and improves circulation. Aim for the goal of at least 150 minutes of moderate exercise per week. Rouse emphasizes the importance of making movement realistic and sustainable, stating, “Even short bursts of 10-minute activity can help improve cholesterol levels and manage blood pressure.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Turns out some foods with a bad reputation can actually have surprising heart-health benefits. Eggs, full-fat dairy, shellfish, coffee, potatoes and dark chocolate can all be part of a heart-friendly diet when enjoyed in moderation and prepared in healthy ways.

            &lt;div id="Entry-content" class="entry-content Entry-content "&gt;
                                                
                                
                &lt;p data-end="203" data-start="54"&gt;Health officials in Alexandria, Virginia, have issued a rabies alert after a fox in the Del Ray–Rosemont area tested positive for the virus. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fox apparently had contact with a domestic cat near a home Tuesday. The Alexandria Health Department said the fox is now dead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The health department said it is working with the cat’s owner on “safe next steps,” but there is “an increased risk of rabies exposures in the community,” &lt;a href="https://www.alexandriava.gov/news-ahd/2025-08-22/alexandria-health-department-issues-rabies-alert-after-fox-in-the-del" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;according to a news release&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-end="516" data-start="391"&gt;The health department is urging residents not to approach wild or stray animals, and to make sure pets are up to date on rabies vaccinations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-end="657" data-start="518"&gt;Rabies can be deadly, and is easily spread through bites or scratches, the health department said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-end="657" data-start="518"&gt;Symptoms of rabies in animals include aggression, excessive drooling, and odd behavior, according to the news release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-end="657" data-start="518"&gt;Anyone who has seen animals having symptoms of rabies is asked to call Alexandria Animal Control at 703-746-4444. If you or your family members were exposed, contact the Alexandria Health Department at 703-746-4910 during their business hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-end="657" data-start="518"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.alexandriava.gov/Rabies" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;City of Alexandria’s website&lt;/a&gt; has more information on how to protect yourself from rabies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Some social media users have recommended the use of a diversity jar as an easy way to improve gut health through at-home cooking.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A diversity jar aims to add a wider array of plants to your diet, which can boost gut health by fostering a more diverse microbiome in your digestive system.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Better gut health can improve digestion, strengthen the immune system, and support better nervous system function through the gut-brain axis.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Along with an emphasis on anything packed full of protein, there’s one health consideration that nutrition-focused individuals and content creators have been heavily tuned into over the past few years: gut health.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The term might sound nebulous at first, but as the American Medical Association explains, gut health “refers to the well-being of the digestive system, which is responsible for breaking down food, absorbing nutrients, and eliminating waste from the body.” A crucial part of this system is the &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/25201-gut-microbiome" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;gut microbiome&lt;/a&gt;, or the collection of microorganisms that aids digestion, supports your immune system, and even influences your nervous system.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Considering the far-reaching impacts of the gut microbiome throughout the body, it’s understandable that conscious consumers want to keep theirs balanced, diverse, and healthy. One strategy that several home cooks have suggested online for easily improving gut health is to create a diversity jar. Here’s everything you need to know about this simple nutrition tool and what experts think about it.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block foodandwine-sc-block-embed mntl-sc-block-universal-embed "&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://zoe.com/learn/tim-spector" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Tim Spector&lt;/a&gt;, MD — a professor of epidemiology at King’s College London, the scientific co-founder of personalized nutrition service &lt;a href="https://zoe.com/en-gb" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;ZOE&lt;/a&gt;, and the person credited with popularizing the diversity jar — explains that the concept “is essentially a homemade mix of plant ingredients — think nuts, seeds, spices, dried herbs, grains, and even pulses — that you can sprinkle onto meals to boost the diversity of plants in your diet.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The name of the diversity jar gives a clear hint as to what it is. It is a jar filled with various shelf-stable ingredients stored in the kitchen to add a greater variety of plants to each meal. With just a small sprinkle of ingredients from a diversity jar, you can — ideally — incorporate several plants into a single dish.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This tool is meant to supplement your diet, not replace anything else, and Spector recommends “starting with a spoonful a day, and you can use that spoonful however you wish. Sprinkle it on your morning yogurt, add it to soups or salads, or stir it into a stew or curry. You can always build from there. The beauty is that how you use it is entirely up to you.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-benefits-does-a-diversity-jar-provide"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block foodandwine-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What benefits does a diversity jar provide? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; According to Lisa Moskovitz, RD, founder of &lt;a href="https://www.nynutritiongroup.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;NY Nutrition Group&lt;/a&gt; and author of &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Core-Healthy-Eating-Plan-Sustainable/dp/1507216106" data-component="amazon" data-source="affiliate" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Core 3 Healthy Eating Plan&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the greatest benefit of a diversity jar is “introducing more gut-friendly fiber and antioxidants.” She also notes that many nuts and seeds — ingredients you’ll typically find in a diversity jar — “pack in plenty of other great nutrients like magnesium, iron, potassium, and omega-3 fatty acids.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The diversity part of the diversity jar is key to boosting your gut health and microbiome. Consuming a wider variety of plants introduces more microbes to your gut, resulting in a more diverse microbiome in your digestive system. (Previous &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2024/apr/04/30-plants-week-gut-health" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; shows that eating more plants improves gut health, and Spector has recommended aiming to include at least 30 different plants into your diet each week.)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@chicago.dietitian?lang=en" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Samar Kullab&lt;/a&gt;, MS, RDN, LDN, explains that a more diverse gut microbiome can provide benefits like “a stronger immune system (less inflammation and lower risk of allergies and autoimmune conditions), a more resilient gut that bounces back faster after antibiotics or diet changes, and even better mental well-being, since your gut and brain are so deeply connected.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you suffer from chronic gut issues like bloating, constipation, diarrhea, or irritable bowel syndrome, trying a diversity jar might be an easy way to support your digestive health. (Of course, if you have any serious medical concerns, always check with your doctor to find the best course of action.)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-do-you-make-your-own-diversity-jar"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block foodandwine-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How do you make your own diversity jar? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block foodandwine-sc-block-embed mntl-sc-block-universal-embed mntl-sc-block-embed--instagram"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When building a diversity jar, dry goods are your friend. This jar will sit on a counter or in the pantry, so use only shelf-stable ingredients. You don’t need to be exact about the number of ingredients, but aiming for about 10–15 different components is a good target.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Spector notes that it’s best to aim for variety “both in flavor and in nutritional value.” This is why you should add in more than just two or three ingredients. Kullab suggests starting “with a base of seeds or grains like flax, hemp, black sesame, pumpkin seeds, rolled oats, or even quinoa flakes.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Next, incorporate a few nuts — any kind will do. (If you're using larger nuts like pecans or cashews, chopping or blending them will make it easier to sprinkle the mixture on your dishes.) Dried herbs, spices like turmeric, and adaptogens such as ashwagandha or maca are just a few examples of the many optional ingredients you can include.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Spector advises avoiding “anything highly processed or sweetened… The key is to keep it plant-based and well-balanced, with textures and flavors that enhance your meals rather than overpower them.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A diversity jar is meant to be playful. You may find that some combinations of ingredients don’t taste great on every dish you add them to, while other diversity jar recipes might be so delicious you'd want to sprinkle them on every meal, even if they weren't boosting your gut health.&lt;br&gt;

It can lead to long COVID, hospitalization and even death,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“COVID is dangerous, and particularly dangerous for folks who have immunosuppression, other chronic medical illnesses, or people who are older, and these medications can help reduce those risks,” Coles added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;COVID symptoms can look a lot like the symptoms of other upper respiratory infections, which makes testing important.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think with every new variant, there is this narrative that suggests that we could tell if someone has COVID based on their symptoms, and that the symptoms are significantly different or unique, but all in all, they appear to be undistinguishable from any other upper respiratory infection,” Harmony said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, congestion can happen whether it’s COVID or a cold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I would encourage everyone to test if you’re symptomatic,” added Coles.

And, again, if you’re high-risk or have concerning symptoms, get medical attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There are several things you can do to stay healthy, too.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;To keep yourself from getting infected, “wear a high-quality mask, like an N95, in crowded indoor places ... wash [your] hands regularly and make sure that the folks around [you] are feeling well,” Coles said, and added that if a loved one tells you they have the sniffles, consider rescheduling that get-together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even before all of those preventative measures, make sure you have the latest COVID shot. “Vaccination is still, by far, the best way to protect yourself and your loved ones,” said Coles. Updated COVID shots for 2025-2026 are expected to be available soon, although it’s unclear &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/covid-shot-recommendation-changes-medical-experts-concerns_l_682e1bfde4b0c2f07d8c81cb" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="who will be eligible for these shots" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68a77b1ce4b0ab862cb1a364" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="682e1bfde4b0c2f07d8c81cb" data-vars-target-content-type="buzz" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="10"&gt;who will be eligible for these shots&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry-support-huffpost-mid-article" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title default-title"&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--first"&gt;20 Years Of&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--second"&gt;Free&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--third"&gt;Journalism&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-once-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-canceled-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message-container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message support-huffpost__message--main"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

That’s because mosquitoes are selective insects, and some people are more likely to get bites than others. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a few factors that could contribute to why this happens: In &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=pubmed&amp;amp;Cmd=ShowDetailView&amp;amp;TermToSearch=15311477&amp;amp;ordinalpos=3&amp;amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="one controlled study" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68a768eae4b03a473eb1c756" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=pubmed&amp;amp;Cmd=ShowDetailView&amp;amp;TermToSearch=15311477&amp;amp;ordinalpos=3&amp;amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="1"&gt;one controlled study&lt;/a&gt; by the Journal of Medical Entomology, the bugs landed on people with blood Type O nearly twice as frequently as those with Type A. The researchers noted this has to do with secretions we produce, which tips mosquitoes off on a person’s blood type. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;More research needs to be conducted on mosquitoes’ potential preference for certain blood types over others, said Jonathan F. Day, an entomology professor at the University of Florida. But he agreed that mosquitoes do pick up on some cues we give off that make the bugs more likely to land on certain people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These cues let them know they are going to a blood source,” Day said. “Perhaps CO2 is the most important. The amount of CO2 you produce, like people with high metabolic rates ― genetic, other factors ― increases the amount of carbon dioxide you give off. The more you give off, the more attractive you are to these arthropods.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what separates us from the nonliving entities that give off carbon dioxide, like cars? Mosquitoes look for primary cues in conjunction with what Day calls “secondary cues.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lactic acid — the stuff that causes our muscles to cramp during exercise — is one of those secondary cues, for example. Lactic acid is released through the skin, signaling to mosquitoes that we are a target, Day said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mosquitoes also have other qualities that help them pick up on secondary cues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Mosquitoes have excellent vision, but they fly close to the ground to stay out of the wind,” Day said. “They are able to contrast you with the horizon, so how you’re dressed matters. If you have on dark clothes, you are going to attract more because you’ll stand out from the horizon, whereas those wearing light colors won’t as much.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;A mosquito also takes in “tactile cues” once it has landed on you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Body heat is a really important tactile cue,” Day said. “That comes into play with genetic differences or physiological differences. Some people tend to run a little warmer — when they land, they’re looking for a place where blood is close to the skin.” That means those whose temperatures are a little higher are more likely to get the bite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lifestyle or other health factors may also play a role, said Melissa Piliang, a dermatologist at Cleveland Clinic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If body temperature is higher, you’re exercising and moving around a lot, or if you’re drinking alcohol, you are more attractive to mosquitoes,” Piliang said. “Being pregnant or being overweight also increases metabolic rate.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=pubmed&amp;amp;Cmd=ShowDetailView&amp;amp;TermToSearch=12083361&amp;amp;ordinalpos=3&amp;amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="One study" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68a768eae4b03a473eb1c756" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=pubmed&amp;amp;Cmd=ShowDetailView&amp;amp;TermToSearch=12083361&amp;amp;ordinalpos=3&amp;amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="2"&gt;One study&lt;/a&gt; showed that people who consumed just one can of beer were more at risk of attracting mosquitoes than those who didn’t.

Sunrise and sunset are when you’ll see peak activity.” Switching your early morning run to an after-work run could help here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, this tip won’t help you if you’re, say, throwing a BBQ for friends later at night. Try to cover as much skin as you can in these cases, Day said, especially in areas or at times mosquitoes are most likely to be present.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I love the fishing shirts and the long-legged outdoor pants that are breathable, but they prevent mosquitoes,” Day said. “A repellent that has a good protection time ― defined as the time from when you apply to when you get the first bite ― is also great. Roughly 5% DEET sprays gives you 90 minutes of complete coverage.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;DEET is a common ingredient in insect repellents, and sprays with DEET are probably the way to go if you know you’re at risk of bites, Piliang said. Despite the controversy over the health effects of DEET, &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/insect-repellents/deet" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="a 2014 review by the Environmental Protection Agency" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68a768eae4b03a473eb1c756" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.epa.gov/insect-repellents/deet" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="3"&gt;a 2014 review by the Environmental Protection Agency&lt;/a&gt; re-concluded that normal use of DEET products does not pose a risk to one’s health, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/westnile/prevention/index.html" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="including" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68a768eae4b03a473eb1c756" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.cdc.gov/westnile/prevention/index.html" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="4"&gt;including&lt;/a&gt; children, pregnant women and breastfeeding women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“DEET is the most effective,” Piliang said. “If you are going to be in a mosquito-prone place, knowing that they carry disease, it is your best bet. Take a shower later to wash it off, and put on just a little bit.” Always read the directions on a spray before using it, and help children apply products by following the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/westnile/prevention/index.html" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68a768eae4b03a473eb1c756" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.cdc.gov/westnile/prevention/index.html" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="5"&gt;U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt; guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;And while you may have heard that candles containing natural repellents like citronella oil can be useful, there is no &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/jinsectscience/article/17/1/24/2996380" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="research" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68a768eae4b03a473eb1c756" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://academic.oup.com/jinsectscience/article/17/1/24/2996380" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="6"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; to support it yet. Instead, keep the fan on or hang out in a breezy area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Mosquitoes can’t get around very much,” especially in wind, Piliang said. “You can run a fan to keep air moving.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you do end up with a bite, you may or may not be bothered. “This all depends on how allergic you are to the chemicals in the saliva of the mosquito, and that can vary based on the type of the mosquito or how reactive you and your skin are to things in the environment,” Piliang said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If it is itchy, the worst possible thing you can do is scratch it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you do, then more histamine is released and it gets itchier,” she said. “If you scratch it, you’re also more likely to break skin. You can get bleeding, scabs and put yourself at risk for infection and scarring.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there are a few simple things you can do to alleviate the itch, like putting an ice cube on it. “The sensation of cold travels on the same nerve as itch, so you cannot feel both at the same time,” Piliang said. “Even a drink with ice on it will help relieve itch immediately.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’ve received several bites after a morning or evening outside, she also recommended over-the-counter anti-itch creams with a mild topical steroid like hydrocortisone. “You can apply that two to three times a day to reduce itch,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“And the last thing you can do if you’re really bit up is take an &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000549.htm" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="antihistamine" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68a768eae4b03a473eb1c756" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000549.htm" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="7"&gt;antihistamine&lt;/a&gt;,” she added. “It can counteract the reaction a bit.” While OTC types that make you drowsy — like Benadryl — are more common, you can take non-drowsy antihistamines like Zyrtec or Allegra for daytime relief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry-support-huffpost-mid-article" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title default-title"&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--first"&gt;20 Years Of&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--second"&gt;Free&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--third"&gt;Journalism&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-once-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-canceled-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message-container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message support-huffpost__message--main"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

						&lt;p&gt;Pennsylvania hunters worried about deer they’ve shot being infected with chronic wasting disease can get their deer tested for free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the first time this fall, hunters can take the heads of deer shot anywhere in the state and deposit them in collection bins located throughout the 10 chronic wasting disease Disease Management Areas for free testing by the state Game Commission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Any deer head placed in a head bin will be tested, regardless of where in the state it was harvested,” said Game Commission spokesman Joshua Zimmerman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previously, those collection bins were reserved for the heads of deer taken within the management area where the deer were shot and where the bins were located.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hunters who shot deer outside a management area could submit samples on their own for testing to a laboratory for a fee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allowing hunters to now place heads in management area collection bins from deer taken anywhere in the state is good news for Lancaster County hunters concerned about chronic wasting disease, since there are seven collection bins located here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chronic wasting disease is an always-fatal disease that infects deer and elk by attacking the central nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was first found in 1967 in captive mule deer in Colorado, and then the first case in the wild was detected in an elk in Colorado in 1981.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chronic wasting disease has been spreading across North America ever since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Game Commission began testing for it in Pennsylvania in 1998, but it wasn’t found here until October 2012, when a captive deer in Adams County tested positive for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first confirmed case of chronic wasting disease in a wild deer in Pennsylvania was recorded a month later, when three deer in Bedford and Blair counties were found with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 2024-25 sampling year, the Game Commission tested over 11,000 deer for chronic wasting disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Samples from those deer were collected through a variety of avenues, including placing heads in the over 120 special, management area collection bins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 4,400 heads were obtained just from those collection bins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zimmerman reported that 30 deer were collected from the eight bins in Lancaster County.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None were found to have chronic wasting disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Statewide, a total of 530 deer were found to have chronic wasting disease from all the sampling done last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When chronic wasting disease is found in Pennsylvania, a management area is created around the site where the deer was found or harvested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Increased monitoring then occurs in that area, and hunters are subjected to a slate of special rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the rules are that no high-risk parts — spine, brain, spleen — may be taken out of the management area where a deer was shot, and deer feeding and the use of urine-based lures are banned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, there are 10 deer management areas in Pennsylvania, covering about a third of the state, mainly in the southcentral region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of Lancaster County is in management area 4, since chronic wasting disease was found in captive deer kept at a farm in the northern part of the county in 2018, and in the southern part in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chronic wasting disease has not ever been detected in wild deer in Lancaster County.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Deer Management Area 4 head collection bins in the county are at:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Bowmansville Fire Company, 146 W. Maple Grove Road, Bowmansville&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— West Earl Township Building, 157 W. Metzler Road, Ephrata&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Muddy Run Recreation Park parking area on Route 372 at Old Pinnacle Road&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— State Game Lands 136 parking area, Puseyville Road and Street Road, Kirkwood&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Blue Rock Fire Rescue House 903, 3079 River Road, Conestoga&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Salisbury Township Office, 5581 Old Philadelphia Pike, Gap&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Middle Creek Wildlife Management Area, Hopeland Road, 1 mile East of Route 897&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Since head bins are placed in areas where chronic wasting disease has already been detected, it can help provide additional information as to the level of chronic wasting disease in the area and monitoring the effect of management activities over time,” Zimmerman said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It also provides hunters with additional information they can use when deciding to consume venison.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Game Commission advises hunters not to eat venison from deer known to have chronic wasting disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“While chronic wasting disease has not been shown to infect humans, federal health officials consider it a theoretical risk, leading to the recommendation to avoid consuming meat from chronic wasting disease-positive animals,” the agency’s website states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hunters who want to have deer tested for chronic wasting disease should place the head — with harvest tag filled out and attached to the ear — in a plastic garbage bag and seal it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antlers attached to the skull will not be returned, so remove those first if you want to keep them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Place the bag into a collection bin, where samples are picked up by Game Commission staff about twice a week during hunting seasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Samples from each head are removed and sent to a lab for testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When results are returned to the Game Commission, that information is entered into a database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agency then mails a postcard to the submitting hunter informing them how to check for results either online at pgc.pa.gov or by calling the chronic wasting disease hotline at 833-463-6293.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If chronic wasting disease is confirmed in a sample, the submitting hunter will be notified via certified letter with the test result and information on what the hunter can/should do next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zimmerman said it takes about two weeks for test results to come back, although that time might be a bit shorter in early archery season or a bit longer during the firearms season.&lt;/p&gt;

But with grocery prices sky-high at the moment, many people may think the diet is financially out of reach. (After all, salmon and walnuts are not cheap!) This week, dietitian and Yahoo contributor Lauren Manaker wrote about the cost of the Mediterranean diet for Yahoo and shared &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://health.yahoo.com/wellness/nutrition/healthy-eating/article/mediterranean-diet-meager-budget-can-you-dupe-the-worlds-healthiest-meal-plans-100049940.html" data-ylk="slk:some pointers on how to follow the plan;cpos:2;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;some pointers on how to follow the plan&lt;/a&gt; without busting your budget.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;One easy tip to follow? &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/squeamish-around-sardines-tinned-fishs-health-benefits-might-convince-you-otherwise-090042646.html" data-ylk="slk:Swap out fresh fish for canned varieties;cpos:3;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;Swap out fresh fish for canned varieties&lt;/a&gt;, like omega-3 rich salmon and sardines. Not only are the tinned options more affordable than their refrigerated counterparts, but canned fish is also shelf stable — meaning it won’t spoil in the back of your fridge because you forgot to eat it in a timely fashion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Another way to save money but still get plenty of nutrients is to &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/7-best-frozen-vegetables-eating-140710729.html" data-ylk="slk:enjoy frozen veggies;cpos:4;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;enjoy frozen veggies&lt;/a&gt; rather than fresh. Since vegetables are frozen at their peak nutritionally, you can rest assured that you’re getting all those important vitamins and minerals while also saving money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Want to take things to the next level?

Since we lose water from breathing and sweating overnight, dietitian Amy Shapiro says that “drinking water in the morning helps restore normal hydration levels, which supports energy and focus.” And that’s not all: Staying properly hydrated can also aid in digestion and even help you consume fewer calories at your next meal for better weight management. Sticking to drinking more water earlier in the day, and tapering off closer to bedtime, also means you’ll be less likely to wake up in the middle of the night to pee, which can disrupt your sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;a data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://emojipedia.org/person-walking" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:🚶;cpos:10;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;🚶&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Take a power walk&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Step up your walking game by turning it into a “power walk,” aka a walk you do at the top of your walking speed, &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1" href="https://health.yahoo.com/wellness/fitness/exercise/articles/power-walking-back-big-way-180100467.html" data-ylk="slk:Women’s Health;cpos:11;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;Women’s Health&lt;/a&gt; reports. You’ll get all the benefits of walking — boosting your heart and lung health, better management of blood pressure and blood sugar and burning more calories, not to mention improving your mood — but in a shorter amount of time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Laura A. Richardson, a professor of applied exercise science at the University of Michigan, says that to get the most cardiovascular benefits, try to exert yourself to about a 7 out of 10 on the &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:12;pos:1" href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a41578244/what-is-rpe-meaning/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:rate of perceived exertion (RPE) scale;cpos:12;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;rate of perceived exertion (RPE) scale&lt;/a&gt;, and keep up your stride for ideally 30 minutes or more. Make sure to bend and swing your arms for momentum, engage your core and focus on taking smaller, quicker steps rather than a wider stride.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;a data-i13n="cpos:13;pos:1" href="https://emojipedia.org/beverage-box" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:🧃;cpos:13;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;🧃&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Pick this juice&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Juice may have a health halo, but often it’s nothing more than water flavored with sugar, our friends at &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:14;pos:1" href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/articles/healthiest-juice-dietitians-share-no-170041992.html" data-ylk="slk:Today;cpos:14;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;Today&lt;/a&gt; tell us. If you are going to grab one, however, some picks are better than others. Experts for Today say to look for 100% juice, which is the most dense in nutrients. Juices made from pomegranate, beet and low-sodium vegetable juice are great options because they’re packed with antioxidants. And if you’re looking for something to improve your night’s rest, try tart cherry juice, which contains sleep-inducing melatonin and tryptophan. It’s also great for after a workout since it can help reduce muscle soreness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;a data-i13n="cpos:15;pos:1" href="https://emojipedia.org/shower" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:🚿;cpos:15;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;🚿&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Shower right after you work out&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;It may seem like it’s no big deal to put off showering after a workout, especially if you’re heading straight to an alfresco brunch or work from home where no one can smell you while answering emails. But experts tell &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:16;pos:1" href="https://health.yahoo.com/your-body/dermatology/articles/yes-shower-immediately-workout-doctors-162300355.html" data-ylk="slk:Women’s Health;cpos:16;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;Women’s Health&lt;/a&gt; you really should rinse off ASAP. Not only will doing so prevent odor, but it also prevents the risk of not-so-fun stuff, like acne, skin irritation and even folliculitis, which is when hair follicles become inflamed, leading to pimple-like bumps. Postworkout, stick to products made for sensitive skin, even if you don’t typically have it — your skin can be extra sensitive following exercise due to increased blood flow. And while exfoliation is great to do twice a week to prevent dead skin buildup, skip it immediately after a tough gym session for the same reason.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;a data-i13n="cpos:17;pos:1" href="https://emojipedia.org/olive" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:🫒;cpos:17;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;🫒&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Buy olive oil in this container&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Olive oil is full of heart-healthy fat and has even been &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:18;pos:1" href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/olive-oil-good-fast-nutrition-100319387.html" data-ylk="slk:linked to better brain health and reduced joint pain;cpos:18;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;linked to better brain health and reduced joint pain&lt;/a&gt;. But if you want the most bang for your buck, pick an olive oil that’s packaged in a dark glass bottle rather than plastic, &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:19;pos:1" href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/articles/why-always-buy-olive-oil-170000643.html" data-ylk="slk:Martha Stewart;cpos:19;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;Martha Stewart&lt;/a&gt; reports. Unlike plastic containers, it’s harder for oxygen to seep into glass bottles, which can shorten the oil’s shelf life and even cause it to go bad faster. Also, putting olive oil in plastic can cause chemical migration, especially when the olive oil is warm (like, say, in your pantry on a hot day), which can change the way it tastes. Meanwhile, “dark glass is non-reactive, so it won't interact with the oil, and it shields it from damaging UV rays," Jill Myers, founder of Women in Olive Oil, tells the outlet. Bonus points? Dark glass will look prettier in your cabinet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;a data-i13n="cpos:20;pos:1" href="https://emojipedia.org/wine-glass" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:🍷;cpos:20;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;🍷&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Pass on alcohol to keep your blood pressure in check&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The American Heart Association just updated its guidelines on the best ways to lower blood pressure and protect your heart, &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:21;pos:1" href="https://health.yahoo.com/conditions/cardiovascular-health/articles/number-1-way-lower-blood-123000169.html" data-ylk="slk:Prevention;cpos:21;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;Prevention&lt;/a&gt; reports. One notable shift: The AHA now recommends avoiding alcohol. Though there have been “differing views on alcohol and potential cardiovascular risk” over the years, cardiologist Shaline Rao tells Prevention, the AHA has now seen that “consistent alcohol intake has more potential for risk than benefit.” One reason to skip it has to do with how the liver metabolizes the alcohol, which causes the blood vessels to constrict. This leads to stiffer blood vessel walls and, therefore, higher blood pressure over time. So the next time you’re at an event, &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:22;pos:1" href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/how-to-make-healthier-mocktails-according-to-dietitians-5-alcohol-free-recipes-to-try-110059545.html" data-ylk="slk:try a fun mocktail;cpos:22;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;try a fun mocktail&lt;/a&gt; instead, or just cut back on how many drinks you have throughout the evening by having a glass of water in between.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;a data-i13n="cpos:23;pos:1" href="https://emojipedia.org/sponge" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:🧽;cpos:23;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;🧽&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Exfoliate the right way&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Exfoliation is great for your skin — it removes dead skin cells, smooths skin texture and boosts product absorption. But doing it too often can backfire and leave your skin dry, irritated and inflamed, as well as more prone to breakouts. Experts tell &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:24;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/beauty/skincare/articles/often-exfoliate-face-according-dermatologists-133000370.html" data-ylk="slk:Prevention;cpos:24;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;Prevention&lt;/a&gt; that you should tailor how often you exfoliate to your skin type: Aim for one or two times weekly for dry, sensitive, combination or mature skin, and two or three times a week for oily or acne-prone skin.

One sign you’re overdoing it? “The skin will feel dry and tight,” dermatologist Dr. Brooke Jeffy says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;a data-i13n="cpos:26;pos:1" href="https://emojipedia.org/sun" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:☀️;cpos:26;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;☀️&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Get more vitamin D to support your immune system&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Want to avoid catching a summer cold?

Storing potatoes in the refrigerator causes their starches to turn into sugar, which alters their flavor and texture. And when cooked at high heat, those extra sugars can form acrylamide, a potentially harmful compound. Instead of putting potatoes in the fridge, keep them somewhere cool, dark and dry, like your pantry, which also &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:31;pos:1" href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/potatoes-proof-green-isnt-always-122522773.html" data-ylk="slk:slows down sprouting and helps keep them from turning green;cpos:31;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;slows down sprouting and helps keep them from turning green&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>yahoo.com</author><pubDate>Sun, 24 Aug 2025 09:00:43 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilgJBVV95cUxNbEhoMFdyNjdMc3d3UDROYzJCNHp4NzNjbmJGT3JCUVd3UFl0TUlEbFUxNkdKSTBXWHI3Q1EyN1UtUmZsR2I0aDFENlp3QnZ1d1dRZkJLbDBqbC1zUldxdEk3ZkZjR2s2b1VHRlB2S09wbExESWdRQ2tTOTBKRHNGSE95NFNsUTFPNzVDdlZSLXI4N0w1b0c0M1V5aG0xSFQ4NGNEX3RVVkZHMXY0OGd2cG0xbjZnekpRVkl4VVhXZDIwcTVBVkwyNklmYXUzczhUR3lqNFpReDh6eFA2Y3dma2xZMW1YaUpVXzl2WF9kVUVPUnlTTXlFZDU1Z2NuZ1d0bXc2RjZ4VWdpVUZmdW5hSEl4dmFWUQ</guid></item><item><title>神经病学家建议服用维生素B复合物（非维生素B12或B6 ）促进大脑健康：知道如何添加t -印度时报</title><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/neurologist-suggests-taking-vitamin-b-complex-not-vitamin-b12-or-b6-for-brain-health-know-how-to-add-this-to-your-diet/articleshow/123481099.cms</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="0"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;B for brain, B for B-complex!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Phoebe would have pointed out, ‘coincidence’?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientific evidence suggests it’s definitely not!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emerging research shows that beyond the well-known B6 and B12, the full vitamin B-complex, including B1 (thiamine), B2 (riboflavin), B3 (niacin), B5 (pantothenic acid), B7 (biotin), and B9 (folate), plays vital roles in keeping your brain energized and resilient.

Eating colorful, whole foods like legumes, leafy greens, nuts, and wholegrains gives your brain a nourishing buffet of vital nutrients. They help you think clearly, stay energized, and feel brighter. By mixing colorful veggies, whole grains, nuts, beans, and maybe an egg or two, you’re giving your brain its very own power-up team – all without needing extra pills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="102"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Disclaimer:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt; This article is intended for informational purposes only and does not constitute medical advice or diagnosis.

What you put on your plate every day plays a huge role in how your skin ages. In fact, some foods we casually snack on or sip with friends are secretly speeding up fine lines, dullness, and sagging. They don’t scream “bad for your skin” the way greasy fast food might, but they’re quietly working against you. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why is this important to know?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The intake of added sugar is increasing these days.

This equates to approximately 270 calories from added sugars daily—much higher than the recommended limits set by experts. Leading sources of this added sugar are sugar-sweetened beverages, desserts, and sweet snacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Edson Brandao, a 58 year old biohacker took to &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DNQUsuLoHo1/?igsh=NHV3YXgxc204bG4w" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Instagram &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;to share 7 foods that silently damages our skin and pushes it towards early aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Watch out some everyday treats might be working against you. Sneaky skin agers like sugar, soda, and ice cream don’t just taste sweet… they can accelerate wrinkles and steal your radiance," he warns his followers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ice cream breaks down collagen&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ice cream may be comforting, but it’s secretly rough on your skin. All that sugar creates something called advanced glycation end products (AGEs), which break down collagen and elastin—the proteins that keep your skin firm and bouncy. Without them, skin gets saggy and fine lines pop up faster. Plus, the dairy can trigger inflammation or acne for some people, leaving skin looking less clear. The combo of sugar and dairy is like a double hit to your glow, making ice cream more of a wrinkle-creator than a beauty booster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Cola dehydrates your skin&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cola feels refreshing, but it’s actually dehydrating your skin. The high caffeine content acts like a diuretic, meaning it makes your body lose water faster. Dehydrated skin looks dull, tired, and more prone to fine lines. On top of that, cola is loaded with sugar, which damages collagen, speeding up wrinkles and sagging. The acidity can also weaken your teeth, taking away from your overall youthful look. Basically, every sip gives you a quick energy rush but quietly steals your skin’s bounce and brightness. Swap it out with sparkling water if you want glow instead of dryness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Fruit juices have added sugar&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though fruit juice sounds healthy, most store-bought versions are loaded with sugar—sometimes as much as soda! That sugar spikes your blood glucose, leading to glycation, which weakens collagen and elastin. Over time, skin loses firmness and elasticity, showing wrinkles sooner. To make things worse, fruit juice lacks the fiber of whole fruit, so you’re just getting a big sugar dump without the benefits. This sugar rush also creates inflammation, which can worsen acne or redness. While fresh juice in moderation is fine, guzzling it daily can definitely fast-track dullness, sagging, and premature skin aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Margarine reduce skin hydration&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Margarine used to be marketed as the “healthy” butter swap, but it’s actually loaded with trans fats. These fats can stiffen cell membranes and reduce skin hydration, leaving you with dry, rough-looking skin. Even worse, they may damage collagen, which is your skin’s natural scaffolding. Without strong collagen, fine lines and sagging show up faster. Some studies even connect trans fats with increased inflammation, which makes skin more vulnerable to breakouts and redness. So, while margarine might spread smoothly on toast, it’s not doing your face any favors—it’s more like spreading wrinkles over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Artificial sweeteners can cause inflammation&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Artificial sweeteners might seem like a smart sugar hack, but they can mess with your skin in sneaky ways. They confuse your body, triggering insulin responses even without actual sugar, which can lead to inflammation. That inflammation shows up on your skin as dullness, breakouts, or redness. Some studies also suggest sweeteners can mess with gut health, and since your gut is tied to your skin, that imbalance may speed up aging. While they don’t directly cause glycation like real sugar, they still mess with your skin’s natural balance, making your complexion look less smooth and youthful over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Muffins weaken collagen&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Muffins might look innocent (especially the blueberry ones that scream “healthy”), but they’re really little sugar bombs. The refined flour and sugar combo spikes blood sugar, leading to glycation that weakens collagen. That means skin starts sagging earlier, with wrinkles creeping in faster. Plus, most muffins are made with unhealthy oils that add to inflammation, making skin dull and puffy. What feels like a cozy morning treat is really a hit to your skin’s glow. Eat them often enough, and your skin will show it—trading radiance for tiredness. Basically, muffins are dessert in disguise, and your face knows it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="57"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Alcohol dehydrates the skin&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="59"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alcohol might make you feel relaxed, but your skin pays the price. It’s a powerful dehydrator, which leaves your skin looking dry, flat, and more lined. Dehydrated skin shows wrinkles more easily and loses that fresh glow. Alcohol also inflames your skin, which can worsen redness, puffiness, or conditions like rosacea. Over time, it messes with vitamin A levels too—an essential nutrient for skin repair. Without enough of it, your skin struggles to renew itself, so signs of aging show up faster. A glass here and there is fine, but too much drinking leaves your face looking older, sooner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="64"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Give your skin the love it deserves by ditching these culprits and choosing nourishment that works for you—not against you.

A few weeks ago, I threw up at work with such force that I peed myself. My first thought was: the treatment pamphlets tell you to sip peppermint tea and keep a fan at your desk for nausea, but nowhere did they mention you might find yourself in the staff bathroom vomiting so hard you become incontinent. If they had, I’d have popped a spare pair of undies in my work bag.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;I was diagnosed just before Christmas last year. It was a complete shock: I was 44 and the healthiest I’d been in years. At first, I was given an excellent prognosis, and after the initial shock, I rallied like never before. I decided I was going to face this head-on, full of positive energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SignInGateSelector" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"contentType":"Article","sectionId":"australia-news","tags":[{"id":"australia-news/series/the-rural-network","type":"Series","title":"The rural network"},{"id":"society/cancer","type":"Keyword","title":"Cancer"},{"id":"australia-news/rural-australia","type":"Keyword","title":"Rural Australia"},{"id":"australia-news/health","type":"Keyword","title":"Health"},{"id":"australia-news/australia-news","type":"Keyword","title":"Australia news"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/health-and-wellbeing","type":"Keyword","title":"Health &amp;amp; wellbeing"},{"id":"type/article","type":"Type","title":"Article"},{"id":"tone/comment","type":"Tone","title":"Comment"},{"id":"tracking/commissioningdesk/the-rural-network","type":"Tracking","title":"The rural network"}],"isPaidContent":false,"isPreview":false,"host":"https://www.theguardian.com","pageId":"australia-news/2025/aug/24/ive-been-diagnosed-with-cancer-twice-in-the-past-12-months-heres-what-the-pamphlets-dont-tell-you","idUrl":"https://profile.theguardian.com","contributionsServiceUrl":"https://contributions.guardianapis.com","editionId":"US"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But after surgery and pathology, the language shifted. They started using the word “good” instead of “excellent&lt;em&gt;”&lt;/em&gt;, and we realised this was going to be more of a fight. I gathered as much information as I could, along with every resource available, determined to be prepared. But nobody told me about the messy parts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="f6b42809-9208-453d-acfe-4c1fe2d9ca4b" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-47fhrn"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":3,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"Sweaty and flustered, my breast cancer patient was experiencing hot flushes.

You don’t have to follow the advice&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;At one of your initial appointments, you will be handed a tonne of information from the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/cancer" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Cancer&lt;/a&gt; Council, and most of it is solid gold. But you don’t have to do everything that’s recommended. This is a shock, and I’m sorry it’s happened to you, and it’s OK to do this your way. I started by sharing everything publicly and was overwhelmed with wonderful support. Nine months in and I’ve retreated into myself and don’t want to talk to anyone about it. Both are OK. My oncology counsellor told me to stick to my normal schedule as much as possible and not to give cancer more power than it already has. This was fine until recently when I had to cut back hours at work. I’m not giving cancer power, however – I’m giving my body the rest it needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="2-give-your-body-what-it-needs" class="dcr-12pc8kk"&gt;2. Give your body what it needs&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Right now I need rest,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;nutritious meals when I can handle them, sunlight and movement. There’s new research that suggests &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/jun/01/exercise-better-than-drugs-after-cancer-treatment-international-trial-finds" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;exercise plays a vital role &lt;/a&gt;in cancer treatment, and it’s encouraged where possible. Personally, I find it improves my mood, gets me outside and helps me feel I’m taking a proactive step towards health. Likewise, I spoke to a fellow cancer warrior who explained that she loves juicing – each day she will head to the fruit market and carefully choose her fruits and vegetables. She explained she understands that juice is probably doing nothing for her cancer, but it’s not bad for her and helps her feel proactive. I’m not into juice, but after speaking with her, I now have salad for lunch every day. My daily bowl of rainbow veggies isn’t a cure, but it is a ritual that feels as though I’m telling cancer to fuck off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="3-your-body-will-change-in-unexpected-ways" class="dcr-12pc8kk"&gt;3. Your body will change in unexpected ways&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;You might pee yourself when you spew – look, it happens. Chemotherapy in particular will mess with your digestive system and you will immediately map out the toilets of any public space you are in. You might lose your hair – everywhere. Losing your nasal hair means your nose will run constantly. Losing your pubic hair makes you fart really loudly. Steroids make you pack on weight; other medications will strip it off frighteningly fast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="4-cancer-hurts-and-some-of-that-pain-is-financial" class="dcr-12pc8kk"&gt;4. Cancer hurts, and some of that pain is financial&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;I have stopped working full-time and we are so very broke right now. My diagnosis coincided with the cost-of-living crisis, so we’ve never needed a second income more. And cancer is expensive. It’s not as bulk billed as you would expect – the fine needle biopsy used to diagnose my cancer cost $380 after the Medicare rebate. The medical costs add up quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="5-you-will-become-your-own-best-advocate" class="dcr-12pc8kk"&gt;5. You will become your own best advocate&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Sure, you should find a knowledgable medical team who has your best interests at heart, but you know your body best. If something doesn’t feel right, keep pushing until it’s paid attention to. It’s OK to demand that scan, try a different medication and to discuss treatment options. You are not difficult. You deserve solutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="6-you-will-lose-friends-and-gain-unexpected-ones" class="dcr-12pc8kk"&gt;6. You will lose friends and gain unexpected ones&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;There’s this idea that challenging times “show us who our real friends are” but that’s not the case at all. Cancer is a lot, and not everyone can take this journey with you. It doesn’t make them bad people, it’s just that life is heavy for everyone and they don’t currently have space for you. But the people who stay with you will hold you up in ways you never knew you’d need, and you’ll make new friends too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="7-cancer-is-a-rollercoaster" class="dcr-12pc8kk"&gt;7. Cancer is a rollercoaster&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Lots of metaphors work, but this one is the best. The sudden jolting start, the highs, the lows, the speed increase and decrease and the twist you didn’t see coming. All of this is geared to get you to the exit: remission or NED – no evidence of disease. But here’s what you didn’t know: if you’re lucky you can get off the rollercoaster, but you can’t ever leave the amusement park. Every three, six, 12 months you have your scans and blood tests and see if you’re being dragged back on for another spin. I was thrown back on this year after a scan revealed new tumours, this time in my lung. I have lost the positivity that powered me through the first round. I’m not sharing as much because there’s nothing to say. It isn’t fair the first time, but the second time hits you where it hurts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="98544d55-ff73-41f3-8bff-0706ba12368e" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-47fhrn"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":20,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"‘It’s some sort of cosmic joke’: Tracy Sorensen wrote a book about surviving cancer.

You aren’t alone&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;There is so much help available. My family and friends, once they knew what was going on, cooked meals, grocery shopped, took care of our youngest and supported our eldest. I live in regional New South Wales and the charity &lt;a href="https://canassist.org.au/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Can Assist&lt;/a&gt; has been a lifeline. They pay for all of my cancer medications, including my radiation meds, and will cover transport and accommodation costs when I have to travel to Sydney for treatment. Your local hospital should be able to point you in the direction of a social worker who will find all of these helpful options for you. There’s probably a support group near you – make use of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="9-you-dont-have-to-stay-positive" class="dcr-12pc8kk"&gt;9. You don’t have to stay positive&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;You don’t have to be brave. You don’t have to be the best cancer patient and be liked and be an example to others. It’s OK to cry. Just make sure you reach out for help if it feels as if you are drowning in your tears.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="10-you-wont-be-the-same" class="dcr-12pc8kk"&gt;10. You won’t be the same&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But that’s not necessarily a bad thing. You will experience a loss of autonomy like never before. One moment my husband and I were discussing trying for a third baby, and the next I’m signing forms promising to not get pregnant for at least 12 months post radiation. But I’m stronger and surer of myself now, and I understand the fragility of life. I take fewer things for granted and prioritise my family over my career.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The pamphlets can’t tell you all this. But those of us who’ve been on the ride can.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;And if you’ve just found yourself holding that ticket – pack the spare undies. Trust me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;

What you eat and drink shapes that microbial community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dairy sits in the middle of the conversation because it provides nutrients and, sometimes, live cultures, yet researchers don’t always agree on its effects. A careful study that sampled the colon lining directly adds useful clues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diet studies often rely on stool samples. That’s helpful, but it doesn’t always reflect the bacteria that stick to the gut wall. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This project looked at those &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/gut-microbes-have-an-unexpected-link-to-anxiety/"&gt;wall-attached microbes&lt;/a&gt;, which sit directly against our tissues. The goal was straightforward: see whether everyday dairy habits show up in that community of bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-understanding-the-microbiome"&gt;Understanding the microbiome&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Think of your gut microbiome as a bustling neighborhood of &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/human-microbiome-trillions-of-bacteria-unique-like-fingerprints/"&gt;trillions of microbes&lt;/a&gt; – mostly bacteria, plus some fungi and viruses – that live mainly in your large intestine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They help break down parts of food you can’t digest on your own, especially fiber, producing short-chain fatty acids like butyrate that feed your colon cells and help keep inflammation in check. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These microbes also train your immune system, make certain vitamins, and interact with your nervous system through chemical signals. That’s where we get the term “gut feeling.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everyone’s microbiome is a little different, shaped by birth, diet, environment, sleep, stress, and medicines like antibiotics. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diversity tends to be a good sign: a wider variety of species usually means a more stable, resilient community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s no single “perfect” microbiome, but you can nudge yours in a &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/scientists-find-link-between-obesity-anxiety-and-gut-microbiome-changes/"&gt;healthy direction&lt;/a&gt; with balanced meals, regular movement, enough sleep, and cautious antibiotic use when medically needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-learning-how-dairy-shapes-gut-bacteria"&gt;Learning how dairy shapes gut bacteria&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adults undergoing routine colonoscopies at a veterans’ hospital in Houston participated. Their colons appeared normal, and none had &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/exercise-helps-fight-cancer-by-changing-gut-microbes/"&gt;major conditions&lt;/a&gt; that could confound the results. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the procedure, doctors collected pinhead-sized biopsies from the colon lining for lab analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In total, the team analyzed 97 biopsies from 34 people. Beforehand, participants completed a food questionnaire that covered the past year, including &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/most-americans-dont-know-the-dangers-of-raw-milk-and-bird-flu/"&gt;milk, cheese, yogurt&lt;/a&gt;, and total dairy intake. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the lab, the group used 16S rRNA sequencing to identify which bacteria were present and in what amounts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two basic yardsticks apply. “Alpha diversity” refers to how many kinds of bacteria are in a single sample. “Beta diversity” compares how different two people’s communities are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analysis adjusted for age, body size, smoking, alcohol use, health conditions, overall diet quality, and which part of the colon the sample came from. That helps separate signals that are likely true associations from those created by other factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-the-scientists-learned"&gt;What the scientists learned&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who drank more &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/extreme-heat-makes-dairy-cows-produce-less-milk/"&gt;milk&lt;/a&gt; – and those who consumed more total dairy – tended to have higher alpha diversity in the bacteria attached to the colon lining. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beta diversity also differed between higher and lower consumers of total dairy, milk, cheese, and yogurt, indicating that intake patterns were associated with broader shifts in community structure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two familiar bacteria stood out. &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/immunology-and-microbiology/faecalibacterium" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Faecalibacterium&lt;/a&gt; is often considered beneficial because it makes butyrate, a short-chain fatty acid that fuels colon cells and can calm inflammation. People who consumed more total dairy and more milk had more Faecalibacterium on the colon lining. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41575-022-00631-9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Akkermansia&lt;/a&gt;, frequently linked to a strong gut barrier and better metabolic markers, also appeared at higher levels with milk intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-dairy-products-and-bacteria"&gt;Dairy products and bacteria&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the team accounted for dietary lactose, the milk-microbe links weakened. That points to lactose as a possible &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/boost-your-gut-health-top-five-prebiotic-rich-foods-revealed/"&gt;prebiotic&lt;/a&gt; – food for specific bacteria – that may help certain microbes grow. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also fits a simple nutrition fact: milk contains lactose, while many hard cheeses have very little.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cheese didn’t follow milk’s pattern. Higher cheese intake was associated with lower amounts of certain bacteria in adjusted models, including &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2176045/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Bacteroides&lt;/a&gt; and Subdoligranulum. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists don’t treat Bacteroides as purely good or bad; it depends on the species and context. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1075996404000071"&gt;Subdoligranulum&lt;/a&gt; can produce butyrate, which is usually beneficial, so seeing lower levels with higher cheese intake raises questions about which cheese components might shift the balance. Turning milk into cheese changes nutrients in ways that could matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yogurt intake here was very low on average – approximately a few sips per day – so the study couldn’t draw firm conclusions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers didn’t see clear links between yogurt and diversity, and classic yogurt cultures like &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/worlds-oldest-cheese-discovered-alongside-ancient-mummies/"&gt;Lactobacillus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/mothers-gut-health-shapes-the-brain-development-of-her-baby/"&gt;Bifidobacterium&lt;/a&gt; appeared at very low levels on the colon lining in these samples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-colon-lining-yields-clues"&gt;Colon lining yields clues&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most data we see come from stool samples, which reflect what exits the body. The mucosa – the gut’s surface – can look different. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studying the wall-attached community gives a closer view of the microbes that interact with the gut barrier and immune cells. It reflects the mucosal surface rather than only what is present in stool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-gut-bacteria-dairy-and-health"&gt;Gut bacteria, dairy, and health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you tolerate dairy and already drink milk, your &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/move-over-microbiome-its-time-for-the-human-guts-virome-to-shine/"&gt;gut’s surface community&lt;/a&gt; may be more diverse. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If cheese is your main dairy, the effects likely depend on the type of cheese, your overall diet – especially fiber – and your individual microbiome. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you don’t tolerate lactose well, prebiotic fibers from beans, oats, bananas, onions, and asparagus can nourish beneficial bacteria by another route.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Different dairy foods appear to influence the gut’s wall-attached community in distinct ways. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Larger, longer studies in more diverse groups will help test which dairy components do what, and for whom. For now, what goes in your glass and on your plate shows up in your gut in measurable ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full study was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/17/3/567" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Nutrients&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Sun, 24 Aug 2025 00:13:47 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqAFBVV95cUxPWTdQUWQ0SE9BNV80eE5FMWxxMkd0dFZKRU1fRkJPQk1jUzY5RkFoOFFKMVdnVmdxbkU0T0FqUEx1cmRjNWxvcUFyYmFHeTNLUjhrTW1HckJIeW9IQkpKN2RYSDBpVlNSazZwNTVFa3FCZ1RTaDN4MTFyZmhaYVBaYTl0VGRUYXJHd3c0dWV2VGROSXQwMnhzYkJodXJiNTUtSzBzdlVnZU8</guid></item><item><title>根据营养师的说法，最好的肠道健康晚餐- EatingWell</title><link>https://www.eatingwell.com/best-dinner-for-gut-health-dietitian-approved-11796229</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-callout--summary mntl-sc-block-universal-callout--tips mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-summary callout--bordered" data-text="Key Points" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;
&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A gut-healthy dinner should combine probiotics, prebiotic fiber and anti-inflammatory foods.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Roasted salmon with chickpeas, kale and a whole grain provides protein, omega-3s and gut-supporting fiber.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Adding fermented foods like yogurt, kimchi or miso boosts probiotics that help balance the gut microbiome.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When we talk about “gut health,” we’re really talking about the gut microbiome—the trillions of microorganisms in your digestive tract. This community doesn’t just affect digestion, it also influences your metabolism, immune system, hormones and even brain function. “Recent research shows that a balanced microbiome supports nutrient absorption, hormone and neurotransmitter production and more,” says &lt;a href="https://www.topnutritioncoaching.com/nutritionists/tami-best" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Tami Best, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;, who specializes in nutrition and gut health.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; So what does that mean for dinner? We recommend our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/262763/roasted-salmon-with-smoky-chickpeas-greens/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Roasted Salmon with Smoky Chickpeas &amp;amp; Greens&lt;/a&gt; as one of the best meals you can make for gut health. Each serving provides nearly one-quarter of the Daily Value for fiber (6 grams) from plant foods that feed beneficial gut bacteria. Salmon adds high-quality protein and omega-3 fatty acids to help lower inflammation. If you want to round it out with a grain, choose &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/gallery/8038825/high-fiber-whole-grain-recipes-to-make-forever/" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;quinoa, wild rice or barley&lt;/a&gt; for added prebiotics—or start with white rice if you’re &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8043390/too-much-fiber/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;easing into more fiber&lt;/a&gt; to avoid bloating.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-why-this-dish-is-so-great-for-gut-health"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Why This Dish Is So Great for Gut Health &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Prebiotic Fiber &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.dianamesa.me/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Diana Mesa, RD, CDCES&lt;/a&gt; says legumes are one of her favorite prebiotic sources—and this recipe puts chickpeas to work. They’re tossed with oil, paprika and salt, then roasted until crispy to pair with salmon and kale. Have extras? &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/259418/crunchy-roasted-chickpeas/" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Roasted chickpeas&lt;/a&gt; make a tasty snack on their own or a crunchy salad topping the next day.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This dish also incorporates kale, which also helps to support your gut microbiome.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The recipe calls for cooking it on the stovetop for a warm side, but you can serve it chilled if you’d prefer something more refreshing.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; May Offer Probiotics &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This recipe includes a creamy green dressing to top the salmon and greens. One source of the dressing’s creaminess is buttermilk, an ingredient that sometimes (but not always) contains probiotics. (Check the label for live and active cultures.)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re not sure if your buttermilk contains probiotics, it’s also easy to add probiotics by using plain yogurt instead of buttermilk or mayonnaise in the recipe. Or, you can swap the dressing and make this &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/7917202/creamy-yogurt-dill-sauce/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Creamy Yogurt-Dill Sauce&lt;/a&gt; instead.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Anti-Inflammatory Ingredients &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This recipe incorporates a few anti-inflammatory ingredients that Best recommends, including green leafy veggies, fatty fish and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8003928/regular-vs-extra-virgin-olive-oil-whats-the-difference/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;extra-virgin olive oil&lt;/a&gt;. “Anti-inflammatory foods help keep intestinal cells healthy,” says Best. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Plus, the chickpeas are seasoned with paprika, a spice that may have anti-inflammatory benefits due to its capsaicin content. Capsaicin is responsible for the spicy flavor of foods like paprika and chile peppers. Research suggests that &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7824258/best-anti-inflammatory-spices-for-fighting-inflammation/" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;capsaicin may help reduce inflammation&lt;/a&gt; and stimulate mucin production in the colon, which supports the growth of healthy gut bacteria.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-to-look-for-in-a-gut-health-friendly-dinner"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What to Look For in a Gut-Health-Friendly Dinner &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A gut-healthy dinner includes more than just one superstar ingredient—it’s about combining the right foods and habits. Here are the key things to keep in mind.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Probiotic-Rich Ingredients &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Probiotics are good-for-you live bacteria that help populate your gut for a healthy microbiome. We still need more research to learn if or when &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8037462/benefits-of-taking-probiotics/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;probiotic supplements&lt;/a&gt; are beneficial, so getting probiotics from food sources is especially important.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You can find probiotics in foods such as &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/281916/must-eat-fermented-foods-for-a-healthy-gut/" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;kimchi, sauerkraut, tempeh, miso, kefir&lt;/a&gt; and some brands of cottage cheese. Yogurt is another great probiotic-rich food that can be incorporated into dinner—Mesa recommends that it can be used as a base for a dressing or marinade or dolloped onto a bowl of soup.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Prebiotic Fiber &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Fiber is great for gut health—especially if it’s a specific type called prebiotic fiber, which acts as food for the healthy bacteria in your gut, allowing them to thrive. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “The bacteria in your gut ferment prebiotic fiber, releasing byproducts such as gases and short-chain fatty acids,” says Mesa. “Short-chain fatty acids have anti-inflammatory properties, which are not only beneficial to gut health but to overall health, too,” she explains.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8052689/best-prebiotic-foods-for-better-gut-health/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;The prebiotic foods&lt;/a&gt; that Best recommends include whole grains, peas, legumes, artichokes, garlic, honey, asparagus, banana, dandelion greens and onions. Mesa says she loves incorporating potatoes, legumes or plantains in her dinners for prebiotic fiber.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Plant Foods &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For a gut-friendly dinner, make sure you’re packing in the plants. One study ifound that people who followed a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/2058981/ultimate-mediterranean-diet-shopping-list/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt; rich in plant foods had significantly more diverse gut microbiomes than those who ate a typical Western diet low in fiber and high in added sugars and animal products.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The researchers believe antioxidants—found in abundance in plant foods—may have something to do with this. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; A Low-Stress Environment &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Gut health is about more than just the nutrients you eat. It’s also about &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; you eat. &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8018354/can-you-practice-mindful-eating-while-trying-to-lose-weight/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Mindful eating&lt;/a&gt; can promote nervous system regulation and help your body enter &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7921263/can-stress-cause-diarrhea/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;“rest and digest” mode&lt;/a&gt; for optimal digestion. In fact, research on mindfulness-based stress reduction has shown robust improvements in gastrointestinal symptoms among people with IBS, with benefits linked to the ability to stay present and eat with awareness.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Try eating dinner in a low-stress environment. Set aside enough time so you’re not rushed, and aim to eat regularly during the day so you don’t arrive at dinner overly hungry. This gives you the chance to chew your food well. “Digestion begins in the mouth, and in the hustle and bustle of daily life, you might find yourself eating quickly,” says Mesa. Slowing down and chewing thoroughly can support digestion and make meals more enjoyable, she adds.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For a healthy gut, it’s important to eat prebiotics, probiotics and anti-inflammatory foods like fatty fish and leafy greens.

To support healthy digestion, experts recommend eating it slowly in a stress-free environment, too. Besides, with a dinner this good, you’ll want to savor and enjoy it.

To see how Banting's diet holds up in the 21st century, fitness YouTuber William Tennyson (pictured) decided to give it a go&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'So, ideally, you'd want your immune system to just be absolutely 100 percent. I don't think this [drink] would do it. I think this is just an excuse to have sugar and alcohol in the morning. Dare I say an energy drink is healthier.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Moving on to breakfast, Tennyson rustles up a feast in line with what Banting would have eaten.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In his diet book, Banting wrote: 'For breakfast, I take four or five ounces of beef, mutton, kidneys, broiled fish, bacon, or cold meat of any kind except pork; a large cup of tea (without milk or sugar), a little biscuit, or one ounce of dry toast.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This restriction of pork stemmed from a belief at the time that it contained starch and saccharine matter, which Banting and his medical adviser, William Harvey, believed contributed to the creation of fat and hindered weight loss. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Tennyson said that it is easy to understand why Banting lost weight with such a 'sad looking' breakfast. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said the mutton (aged lamb) tastes 'very earthy' and 'like I'm licking a barn door.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, he noted he was happy to see some protein on his plate to kick off the day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Studies consistently show that increasing your protein intake is one of the most effective strategies for promoting satiety and helping with weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, some carbohydrates such as pastries and pasta, don't keep you full because they are refined or processed, causing rapid blood sugar spikes and crashes that lead to hunger. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the 19th century, what is now called lunch was generally known as dinner, and it was the largest meal of the day, served in the early afternoon. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In his food diary, Banting said for 'dinner' he enjoyed: 'Five or six ounces of any fish except salmon, any meat except pork, any vegetable except potato, one ounce of dry toast, fruit out of a pudding, any kind of poultry or game, and two or three glasses of good claret, sherry, or Madeira - champagne, port and beer forbidden.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Banting excluded salmon as it is considered one of the fattiest fish. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mirroring this medley, Tennyson made a meal with cod, Brussel sprouts, and a piece of dry toast. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For dessert, he interpreted 'fruit out of a pudding' as a dish made with strawberries and whipped cream and as a drink, he opts for sherry. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While most modern-day diets generally recommend limiting or avoiding alcohol, Tennyson was surprised to see that alcohol is a running theme with the Banting diet, with up to seven glasses permitted per day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The calorie count of wine varies significantly based on its alcohol content and sweetness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, a standard five ounce (150ml) glass of dry table wine typically ranges from 120 to 130 calories, while dessert wines and fortified wines like sherry can have a much higher calorie density. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dry sherries are low in sugar and calories, while sweet or cream sherries are much higher. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As he sipped the sherry, Tennyson mused: 'Dude has the priorities of a seasoned pirate. Or you want to know what? Maybe this was safer to drink than water.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;For breakfast, Tennyson dined on mutton, a biscuit and tea without milk and sugar&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;William Banting, who was an funeral director living in London during the mid-19th century, claimed to have lost 52 pounds by adhering to a low-carb diet. Astounded by the results, he printed his weight loss secrets in a booklet titled Letter On Corpulence&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After his midday meal, Tennyson went for a 'gentle walk' before returning home for  'tea' which comprised 'two or three ounces of fruit, a rusk (a light, dry biscuit) or two, and a cup of tea without milk or sugar.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Banting diet was mainly concerned with food intake, with meals every three to four hours, and there is little focus on working out. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Considering he ate less calories than he usually would, Tennyson said he was surprised how satisfied felt. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For his final meal of the day, 'supper,'  Tennyson opts for chicken in line with Banting's meal plan ('three or four ounces of meat or fish') and this is paired with a 'glass or two' of sherry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The YouTuber said he likes the light protein before bed but the alcohol leaves him feeling a little light headed, as it did so earlier in the day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Before bed, Banting recommended a 'tumbler of grog (gin, whiskey, or brandy, without sugar) or a glass or two of claret or sherry.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Tennyson opted to have a glass of gin, which made him feel even more woozy. He said: '[Banting] may have lost waist size, but man, that liver. So he says that this [alcohol] attributes to the perfect night's sleep. I mean, yeah, probably because I'm going to be unconscious.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alcohol creates an illusion of restful sleep by initially acting as a sedative, but it disrupts the natural sleep cycle, leading to less REM (Rapid Eye Movement) sleep and more light sleep, causing fragmented rest and frequent awakenings. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At the end of the day and alcohol aside, the YouTuber said he can see why the Banting diet can be effective when it comes to shedding weight as it is very low carb and it is less than the recommended calorie intake. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He explained: 'Other than the alcohol, I will say it's actually kind of debatable that this diet is better than a lot of current diets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'[This is] because there's just a lot of single ingredient foods. No additives, no chemicals, just the food for what it is, which we need more of in today's day and age. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Tennyson makes a lunch with cod, Brussel sprouts, and a piece of dry toast. For dessert, he interprets 'fruit out of a pudding' as a dish made with strawberries and whipped cream and as a drink, he opts for sherry&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'So, while there's a lot of things that we should stay away from today, there's a lot of things that we should probably bring back and adopt.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Tennyson used a food tracking app while on the Banting diet and in one day, it came out to &lt;span&gt;1,714 calories, 115g of protein, 31g of fat, &lt;/span&gt;and 68g of carbs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For men, the recommended calorie intake per day is 2,500 calories and when it comes to macronutrients, the USDA recommends consuming 10 percent to 35 percent of calories from protein, 45 percent to 65 percent from carbohydrates, and 20 percent to 35 percent from fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Tennyson said that the Banting diet is so low in carbs, 'most people are going to lose &lt;span&gt;some weight.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;New York-based nutritionist Laura Cipullo told DailyMail.com that the Banting diet is a precursor to today's keto diet, which involves consuming a very low amount of carbohydrates and replacing them with fat to help your body burn fat for energy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="art-ins mol-factbox floatRHS health" data-version="2" id="mol-5919c3d0-7eb0-11f0-8976-bb5db4900e1d" data-permabox-url="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15019255/banting-diet-weight-loss-low-carb.html"&gt; &lt;h3 class="mol-factbox-title"&gt;THE BANTING DIET &lt;/h3&gt; &lt;div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"&gt;&lt;ul class="mol-bullets-with-font"&gt;&lt;li class=""&gt;For dinner, five or six ounces of any fish except salmon, any meat except pork, any vegetable except potato, one ounce of dry toast, fruit out of a pudding, any kind of poultry or game, and two or three glasses of good claret, sherry, or Madeira—champagne, port and beer forbidden.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul class="mol-bullets-with-font"&gt;&lt;li class=""&gt;For tea, two or three ounces of fruit, a rusk or two, and a cup of tea without milk or sugar.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul class="mol-bullets-with-font"&gt;&lt;li class=""&gt;For supper, three or four ounces of meat or fish, similar to dinner, with a glass or two of claret.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul class="mol-bullets-with-font"&gt;&lt;li class=""&gt;For nightcap, if required, a tumbler of grog—(gin, whiskey, or brandy, without sugar)—or a glass or two of claret or sherry.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;She says: '&lt;/span&gt;The Banting or keto diet macronutrient distribution typically ranges from approximately 55 percent to 60 percent fat, 30 percent to 35 percent protein, and five percent to 10 percent carbohydrates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'While you will dehydrate and lose all water related to glycogen stores immediately, you will then start to utilize fat and protein for energy. The goal is to use fat as the primary source.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'One should exercise when attempting a low-carb diet to preserve muscle mass and hypertrophy.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, personal trainer and fitness expert Natalya &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="http://trainer-nyc.com/"&gt;Alexeyenko&lt;/a&gt; says she is not a fan of such restrictive approaches to dieting. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is because from her observations, she believes strict approaches usually bring 'only temporary results, and eventually, most people end up rebounding'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Revealing her preferred approach, she says: 'What works much better long-term is having a clear understanding of how to manage your calories, protein, fats, and carbs according to your current goals without feeling like you have to cut things out completely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Carbs in particular, play an important role in building and maintaining muscle. With diets that cut them too low, someone might see the number on the scale go down, but in reality they’re often losing muscle instead of fat leading to that “skinny fat” look or simply not having a toned body.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Looking at the future of dieting, the personal trainer thinks there will be 'less focus on rigid plans and more emphasis on personalized nutrition plans built around someone’s lifestyle, preferences, and health needs, instead of strict rules that are hard to follow long-term'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Sat, 23 Aug 2025 23:18:48 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilAFBVV95cUxOSTJ3Xzg5RFQ3cElLUEJDcmVGRlVmLUpSZkU1cVE2NmtzTk9ldER4SXNGVW1mOHZ1djJBUFJtZWRfS0ZZR0w3UWlCNm5mWkdZY083aGNVQVc1cldrSms0ZEpRcVIzX3VzNk9nazcxUUxna1A2R3lNdUktRVB4SDZSbkJDLS1lc29SaGNoOFZ3RnVFWjZa0gGaAUFVX3lxTFBaanFUd1VPX3RtZFdEZ3hhSTBNaFpXTGhhX0tSRExKclkzbWtDVnhTdUxPXzRINkRUdy1YaDltSmMyVFRERldrb21Hb3UwV1ZQdXV3RjVuZTY4Rk5MWEg1QzJwUkFnQzkwTXI1dmVGWk5SREFVR1lweEdGOV9RdFdzeGdOYlFSa3NWSVVhYVVQcTBLWjh3aGR0S0E</guid></item><item><title>44个很酷的人体东西，在这个在线线程中被人们分享-无聊的熊猫</title><link>https://www.boredpanda.com/coolest-things-human-body-does/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="open-list-post-description"&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/topics/human-body/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer " class=" staff-link"&gt;The human body&lt;/a&gt; is truly amazing.

What's more, human bones are incredibly strong.

Credit: Stock&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A large study found that animal protein is not linked to higher mortality and may even help lower cancer-related deaths.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eating foods that contain animal protein is not connected to a higher chance of death and may even provide some protection against cancer-related mortality, according to new research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings, published in &lt;em&gt;Applied Physiology, Nutrition, and Metabolism&lt;/em&gt;, are based on an analysis of data from nearly 16,000 adults aged 19 and older who participated in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHAMES III).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers looked at how much animal and plant protein participants consumed and compared those patterns with their risk of dying from cancer, heart disease, or any cause. The results revealed no elevated risk of death linked to greater animal protein intake. Instead, the data pointed to a small but meaningful decrease in cancer-related deaths among people who consumed more animal protein.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There’s a lot of confusion around protein – how much to eat, what kind and what it means for long-term health. This study adds clarity, which is important for anyone trying to make informed, evidence-based decisions about what they eat,” explains Stuart Phillips, Professor and Chair of the Department of Kinesiology at McMaster University, who supervised the research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Ensuring Reliable Results&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To ensure reliable results, the team employed advanced statistical methods, including the National Cancer Institute (NCI) method and multivariate Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) modelling, to estimate long-term dietary intake and minimize measurement error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It was imperative that our analysis used the most rigorous, gold standard methods to assess usual intake and mortality risk. These methods allowed us to account for fluctuations in daily protein intake and provide a more accurate picture of long-term eating habits,” says Phillips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers found no associations between total protein, animal protein, or plant protein and risk of death from any cause, &lt;span class="glossaryLink" aria-describedby="tt" data-cmtooltip="&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemTitle&amp;gt;cardiovascular disease&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemBody&amp;gt;Cardiovascular disease (CVD) encompasses a range of disorders affecting the heart and blood vessels, including coronary artery disease, heart attack, stroke, and hypertension. These conditions are primarily driven by atherosclerosis, a process where plaque builds up in the arterial walls, leading to narrowed or blocked arteries. Risk factors include smoking, unhealthy diet, lack of exercise, obesity, and genetic predisposition. CVD remains a leading cause of global mortality, emphasizing the importance of lifestyle changes, medical interventions, and preventive measures in managing and reducing the risk of heart-related illnesses.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;" data-gt-translate-attributes='[{"attribute":"data-cmtooltip", "format":"html"}]' tabindex="0" role="link"&gt;cardiovascular disease&lt;/span&gt;, or cancer. When both plant and animal protein were included in the analysis, the results remained consistent, suggesting that plant protein has a minimal impact on cancer mortality, while animal protein may offer a small protective effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Broader Implications&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Observational studies like this one cannot prove cause and effect; however, they are valuable for identifying patterns and associations in large populations. Combined with decades of clinical trial evidence, the findings support the inclusion of animal proteins as part of a healthy dietary pattern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When both observational data like this and clinical research are considered, it’s clear both animal and plant protein foods promote health and longevity,” says lead researcher Yanni Papanikolaou, MPH, president, Nutritional Strategies.&lt;/p&gt;

There's no treatment for it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'And so I kind of decided, have to do things when you feel good, because I have no idea what's going to happen with this.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About 100 million Americans have some form of liver disease, and most don't know it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Fatty liver disease, the most common type, often develops silently, causing few or no symptoms at all. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But over time, the liver gradually becomes inflamed and eventually scarred, a condition called cirrhosis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cirrhosis is irreversible, meaning the only treatment is either a partial or full liver transplant. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's unclear exactly what causes primary sclerosing cholangitis, but it's thought that immune reactions to toxins or infections, as well as conditions like inflammatory bowel disease, may raise the risk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About nine in 10 PSC patients also have Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis, an inflammatory bowel disease that affects the lowest parts of the colon. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Kidd now is one of 9,000 Americans awaiting a liver transplant. This makes it the second most sought after organ behind kidneys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While most organs come from deceased donors, more and more patients with liver disease are seeking live donors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Living donors provide up to 70 percent of their liver to a recipient. Unlike other transplanted organs, the liver regenerates. In fact, it only takes about three months for both the donor and recipient livers to regrow to their full size and capacity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The liver is an incredible organ,' Kidd said. 'A lot of people don't realize you can donate part of your liver and be totally fine without any change to their lifestyle.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Most living liver donors are close family members or friends, but everyone in Kidd's inner circle has not been a match.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Living donors need to be the same blood type as the recipient or type O negative, the universal donor blood type. They also need to be free of any form of liver disease, be under 50 and have a relatively healthy lifestyle. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Kidd, pictured second from the right, once traveled the world and lived abroad. Her condition has now progressed and forced her to stay stateside&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Kidd is pictured above with her family. Family and friends have been tested, but none have been a match to donate to her yet&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Kidd spent nearly a decade 'fairly asymptomatic' after her diagnosis, allowing her to travel to 12 countries, including living in Scotland for three years before moving back home to New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is because PSC progresses slowly and is usually diagnosed via routine blood test or x-ray before symptoms like fatigue, yellow eyes, itching and abdominal pain set in. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In later stages, it can cause fever, chills, night sweats, weight loss and an enlarged liver and spleen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Kidd told this website: 'The only symptom I really had was that my lab work was getting worse, the liver enzymes were getting worse.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When she finally did develop minor symptoms in her late 20s, they started with what she calls 'the itch.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The liver normally processes and excretes bile acids, but as it failures, those acids build up in the bloodstream and skin, causing an unbearable itch.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Kidd said: 'I knew at that point I had kind of crossed over the mark of being symptom free to symptomatic.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her condition deteriorated in her 30s, forcing her to cut down on travel and be placed on the transplant list for a new partial liver. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A patient's need for a new liver is measured by a Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score, which ranges from six to 40. A higher score indicates a greater risk of death within three months or a more urgent need for a liver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Patients with high MELD scores are prioritized for getting an entire liver from a deceased donor, which means patients like Kidd have to rely on living donors. Kidd's MELD score is around 10 to 12. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She told this website: 'My MELD score has, fortunately and, yet, unfortunately, remained very low, so I have no hope of a deceased donor call coming in. I will not get a call at this point saying, "Hey, we've got a liver for you. Come in for surgery."'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'So my only viable option without getting really sick is a living donor.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But in later stages, conditions like PSC can progress rapidly while Kidd waits for a donor, leaving her with less time to get a new liver than her MELD score may suggest. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Kidd said if she gets a transplant, she will take her mother (pictured here with Kidd) to Ireland&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As Kidd awaits a transplant, her treatment plan 'is to try to stay out of the hospital as much as possible.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I fail pretty drastically at that,' she added. 'I've landed myself there twice this summer alone.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;PSC can put pressure on the portal vein, a blood vessel that carries blood from the gastrointestinal tract, gallbladder, pancreas and spleen to the liver. This causes blood vessels in the esophagus and stomach to enlarge and become prone to rupture and bleeding, which requires urgent attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Liver disease has also weakened Kidd's immune system, landing her in the hospital with infections several times a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite this, she has maintained her private therapy practice, though she has had to cope with less freedom. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She told this website: 'I try to live as normally as possible. I had to stop a lot of the things I love. I used to be a huge traveler. I would kind of just drop the hat and go to Europe for a weekend and see my friends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I would fly back and forth, I would go see friends, I would travel. I would do a lot of things, even making plans, seeing shows. It's always with the kind of asterisk now of if I can. So I'm homebound a lot more, more New York-based.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Kidd's donor would need to have either type A or O blood and be able to locate to the Long Island, New York, area for surgery. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Testing prior to surgery can be done remotely, and Kidd's insurance covers all costs for the donor's treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Those who are interested in getting tested can visit &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://courtneysliver.com/"&gt;Kidd's website&lt;/a&gt; for more information. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If Kidd gets the call that there's a donor ready for her, she's most looking forward to hopping on a plane again and jetsetting around Europe. For her first trip with a new liver, she plans to take her mother to Ireland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She also hopes to start a national liver donation registry to help other patients get matched with a donor more quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Kidd told this website: 'I'd really like to get back to my life.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Credit: Shutterstock&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lowering systolic blood pressure below 120 mm Hg may prevent more cardiovascular problems than higher treatment goals, according to new research.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;While the stricter target carried a higher risk of side effects and greater medical costs, the benefits outweighed the drawbacks. The study also showed that the lower goal was cost-effective, even when accounting for typical errors in readings.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Aggressive Blood Pressure Control Shows Promise&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A team from Mass General Brigham reports that the potential health benefits of stricter blood pressure management appear to outweigh the risks of overtreatment. Their findings come from a simulation study recently published in the &lt;em&gt;Annals of Internal Medicine&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To carry out the analysis, researchers drew on information from the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT), the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), and other scientific sources. They modeled long-term health outcomes, such as heart attack, stroke, and heart failure, for patients treated to three different systolic blood pressure goals: &amp;lt;120 mm Hg, &amp;lt;130 mm Hg, and &amp;lt;140 mm Hg. Because blood pressure medications can cause side effects, the study also examined the likelihood of serious complications linked to treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The model further incorporated the types of reading errors that commonly occur during everyday clinical measurements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Benefits and Risks of Lower Targets&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even after adjusting for these errors, the results showed that aiming for a systolic blood pressure below 120 mm Hg prevented more cardiovascular events than the 130 mm Hg goal. However, this more aggressive target also came with added risks, including falls, kidney injury, low blood pressure (hypotension), and a slow heart rate (bradycardia). In addition, the intensive target increased overall healthcare costs because of greater medication use and more frequent medical visits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the three targets were compared for cost-effectiveness under typical measurement conditions, the &amp;lt;120 mm Hg goal was still favorable. The researchers estimated it provided good value, with an associated cost of $42,000 per quality-adjusted life-year gained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Expert Perspective on Intensive Treatment&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This study should give patients at high cardiovascular risk and their clinicians more confidence in pursuing an intensive blood pressure goal,” said lead author Karen Smith, PhD, an investigator at the Department of Orthopedic Surgery at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, a founding member of the Mass General Brigham healthcare system. “Our findings suggest the intensive &amp;lt;120 mm Hg target prevents more cardiovascular events and provides good value, and this holds true even when measurements aren’t perfect.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smith also cautioned, “Our results examine the cost-effectiveness of intensive treatment at the population level. However, given the additional risk of adverse events related to antihypertensives, intensive treatment will not be optimal for all patients. Patients and clinicians should work together to determine the appropriate medication intensity based on patient preferences.”&lt;/p&gt;

Credit: Shutterstock&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some people carry a rare mutation that makes them resistant to viruses.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Now scientists have copied that effect with an experimental mRNA therapy that stopped both flu and COVID in animal trials — raising hopes for a universal antiviral.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Rare Mutation Unlocks Viral Immunity&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For only a few dozen people worldwide, living with a rare immune disorder comes with an unexpected advantage: the ability to resist every &lt;span class="glossaryLink" aria-describedby="tt" data-cmtooltip="&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemTitle&amp;gt;virus&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemBody&amp;gt;A virus is a microscopic infectious agent that can replicate only inside the living cells of an organism. Viruses can infect all types of life forms, from animals and plants to microorganisms, including bacteria and archaea. Structurally, viruses consist of genetic material—either DNA or RNA—enclosed in a protective protein coat called a capsid, and sometimes a lipid envelope. They are uniquely distinguished by their simple, acellular organization and mode of reproduction, which involves hijacking the host cell&amp;amp;#039;s machinery to produce new virus particles. This process often results in disease in the host organism. Viruses are responsible for a wide range of diseases, including the common cold, influenza, HIV/AIDS, and COVID-19. Despite their pathogenic nature, viruses also play roles in ecological and evolutionary processes, influencing gene transfer and genetic diversity.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;" data-gt-translate-attributes='[{"attribute":"data-cmtooltip", "format":"html"}]' tabindex="0" role="link"&gt;virus&lt;/span&gt; that comes their way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 15 years ago, Columbia immunologist Dusan Bogunovic first uncovered this remarkable protection shortly after identifying the genetic mutation behind the condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially, the disorder appeared to simply make people more susceptible to certain bacterial infections. But as more cases were studied, a surprising benefit became clear. Bogunovic, now a professor of pediatric immunology at &lt;span class="glossaryLink" aria-describedby="tt" data-cmtooltip="&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemTitle&amp;gt;Columbia University&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemBody&amp;gt;Columbia University is an Ivy League institution based in New York City, recognized for its excellence in medicine, law, and scientific research.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;" data-gt-translate-attributes='[{"attribute":"data-cmtooltip", "format":"html"}]' tabindex="0" role="link"&gt;Columbia University&lt;/span&gt;’s Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, found that everyone with the mutation, which leads to a shortage of an immune regulator known as ISG15, experiences mild but persistent whole-body inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Hidden Antiviral Clues&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The type of inflammation they had was antiviral, and that’s when it dawned on me that these individuals could be hiding something,” Bogunovic recalls. When he and his colleagues looked at the individuals’ immune cells, they could see encounters with all sorts of viruses—flu, measles, mumps, chickenpox. But the patients had never reported any overt signs of infection or illness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In the back of my mind, I kept thinking that if we could produce this type of light immune activation in other people, we could protect them from just about any virus,” Bogunovic says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, after years of research, he is developing a potential therapy that could replicate this unusual form of protection and serve as a powerful safeguard in the next pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Breakthrough Experiment Shows Promise&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his latest study, published on August 13 in &lt;em&gt;Science Translational Medicine&lt;/em&gt;, Bogunovic and his team report that an experimental therapy they’ve developed temporarily gives recipients (hamsters and mice, so far) the same antiviral superpower as people with ISG15 deficiency. When administered prophylactically into the animals’ lungs via a nasal drip, the therapy prevented viral replication of influenza and &lt;span class="glossaryLink" aria-describedby="tt" data-cmtooltip="&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemTitle&amp;gt;SARS-CoV-2&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemBody&amp;gt;SARS-CoV-2 is the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19, first identified in Wuhan, China, in late 2019. It primarily spreads through respiratory droplets and has infected hundreds of millions worldwide. The virus has undergone multiple mutations, resulting in variants with differing transmission and immune escape characteristics.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;" data-gt-translate-attributes='[{"attribute":"data-cmtooltip", "format":"html"}]' tabindex="0" role="link"&gt;SARS-CoV-2&lt;/span&gt; viruses and lessened disease severity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In cell culture, “we have yet to find a virus that can break through the therapy’s defenses,” Bogunovic says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;How the Therapy Works&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bogunovic’s therapy is designed to mimic what happens in people with ISG15 deficiency, but only for a short time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of turning off ISG15 directly—which leads to the production of more than 60 proteins—Bogunovic’s therapeutic turns on the production of 10 proteins that are primarily responsible for the broad antiviral protection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current design resembles COVID mRNA vaccines but with a twist: Ten mRNAs encoding the 10 proteins are packaged inside a lipid nanoparticle. Once the nanoparticles are absorbed by the recipient’s cells, the cells generate the ten host proteins to produce the antiviral protection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We only generate a small amount of these ten proteins, for a very short time, and that leads to much less inflammation than what we see in ISG15-deficient individuals,” Bogunovic says. “But that inflammation is enough to prevent antiviral diseases.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Next-Gen Pandemic Preparedness&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bogunovic’s team views their technology as a weapon against the next pandemic, providing protection for first responders, individuals in nursing homes, and family members of infected individuals, regardless of the responsible virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We believe the technology will work even if we don’t know the identity of the virus,” Bogunovic says. Importantly, the antiviral protection provided by the technology will not prevent people from developing their own immunological memory to the virus for longer-term protection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the technology’s drug delivery and absorption properties still need optimization. When delivered to animals via nanoparticles, the 10 proteins were produced in the lungs, “but probably not at high enough levels that makes us comfortable going into people immediately,” Bogunovic says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Fine-Tuning for Human Use&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Once the therapy reaches our cells, it works, but the delivery of any nucleic &lt;span class="glossaryLink" aria-describedby="tt" data-cmtooltip="&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemTitle&amp;gt;acid&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemBody&amp;gt;An acid is a chemical substance that releases hydrogen ions (H⁺) when dissolved in water, resulting in a low pH (below 7). Acids are often characterized by their sour taste and their ability to react with bases to form salts and water. They play essential roles in biology, industry, and environmental processes.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;" data-gt-translate-attributes='[{"attribute":"data-cmtooltip", "format":"html"}]' tabindex="0" role="link"&gt;acid&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="glossaryLink" aria-describedby="tt" data-cmtooltip="&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemTitle&amp;gt;DNA&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemBody&amp;gt;DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid, is a molecule made of two long strands of nucleotides twisted into a double helix. It serves as the hereditary material in humans and nearly all other organisms, encoding the genetic instructions used for development, functioning, and reproduction.

&lt;p&gt;“Our findings reinforce the power of research driven by curiosity without preconceived notions,” Bogunovic says. “We were not looking for an antiviral when we began studying our rare patients, but the studies have inspired the potential development of a universal antiviral for everyone.”&lt;/p&gt;

With the evolving research and pseudo-science influencers sharing misinformation online, it’s challenging to determine what, if anything, aside from water, can be consumed in a meal plan when weight loss is the goal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, thinking in absolutes can really derail your goals, especially if you’re someone who enjoys a cup of juice with breakfast or milk in their cereal. Here at&lt;em&gt; EatingWell&lt;/em&gt;, we believe all foods—drinks included—can fit into a healthy, balanced diet. Here are five “bad” drinks that are fine to consume, whether you want to lose weight or not.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Cow’s Milk&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the headlines that have deemed milk as “bad” for weight loss, demonizing its (natural) sugar content as the culprit, research has found the opposite to be true. For example, one study suggests that drinking whole milk is associated with lower body weight, BMI and risk of obesity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Milk has a lot of benefits. The high-quality, bioavailable protein in milk, like leucine, stimulates muscle growth, which can optimize maintaining lean muscle mass,” says sports dietitian &lt;a href="https://sarahkoszyk.com/about/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Sarah Koszyk, RDN;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Sarah Koszyk, RDN&lt;/a&gt;. “When people are trying to lose weight, they want to focus on preserving and maintaining their lean muscle mass and, instead, burn the fat."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re looking for a quick protein fix, milk offers just that. A 1-cup serving of skim milk delivers 8 grams of protein for just 90 calories. Whether you enjoy it on its own for a quick and nutrient-rich snack, in a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/261428/chocolate-peanut-butter-protein-shake/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:protein shake with fruit;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;protein shake with fruit&lt;/a&gt; for an on-the-go meal, or in a bowl of cereal, there’s no shame in adding dairy milk into your meal plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Fortified Soy Milk&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soy foods, including soy milk, are a great addition to your weight-loss eating plan. One review found that studies suggest that eating plenty of protein can aid in weight loss, and this includes soy protein. The point being: Soy protein does not stand in the way of weight loss—and may even help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soy milk can also help you consume a healthier diet. “Including soy milk in your diet is a fabulous way to up your protein, fiber and vitamin and mineral intake to meet your nutrient needs while losing weight,” says &lt;a href="https://nutritionstarringyou.com/about/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Lauren Harris-Pincus, M.S., RDN;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Lauren Harris-Pincus, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For reference, a 1-cup serving of fortified, unsweetened soy milk contains 7 grams of protein and 80 calories. Plus, it also packs vitamin B12, a nutrient often lacking in plant-based diets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Naturally Sweetened Coffee&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flavored coffee tends to get a bad rap. Even when the benefits of caffeine are highlighted for weight loss, the second a sweetener enters the picture, coffee gets canceled. But, that doesn't have to be the case. “There are some coffee creamers that are high in ‘empty’ calories from sugars and saturated fats,” says Koszyk. “Coffee isn’t meant to be a high-caloric drink, but drinking black coffee doesn’t always appeal to everyone’s taste buds. Choosing the right coffee creamer that is low in sugar and saturated fat can offer satisfaction while still aligning with one’s weight-loss goals.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With this in mind, it's important to consider what will satisfy your taste buds while fitting into your weight-loss goals. That’s where naturally derived sweeteners, like monk fruit, or no-added-sugar coffee creamers come into play, says Koszyk. Or drizzle a little honey or maple syrup into &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8069479/is-coffee-good-for-you/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:your coffee;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;your coffee&lt;/a&gt; for a truly natural sweet addition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;100% Pomegranate Juice&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A juice made from 100% fruit juice, like 100% pomegranate juice, can be a wonderful way to add flavor and nutrients to plain water. “Sometimes we need a little extra incentive to increase our water intake,” says Harris-Pincus. You can add a splash of the sweet and slightly tart juice to water or seltzer to encourage drinking more H20 without added sugar, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7882893/health-benefits-of-pomegranates/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Pomegranate;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Pomegranate&lt;/a&gt; consumption has also been shown to be beneficial in reducing body weight, blood pressure, blood sugar and other markers of cardiovascular health. The fruit is rich in polyphenols, good-for-you antioxidant compounds that help rid your body of free radicals and help decrease inflammation. For a nice twist on iced tea, try our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/249903/hibiscus-pomegranate-iced-tea/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Hibiscus-Pomegranate Iced Tea;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Hibiscus-Pomegranate Iced Tea&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Low-Calorie, Lower-Sugar Sodas&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Diet soda is a love-it or hate-it item for many,” says Harris-Pincus. However, switching from full-sugar soda to zero-calorie soda can significantly decrease the number of calories you consume in a day and assist with weight loss, she says. While it is probably safe in moderation, the downside is that diet soda doesn’t contain anything beneficial for your health, adds Harris-Pincus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At &lt;em&gt;EatingWell&lt;/em&gt;, we suggest first &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290448/is-drinking-soda-bad-for-weight-loss/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:switching to diet soda;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;switching to diet soda&lt;/a&gt; if you typically drink regular, then, over time, phase soda out completely (other than on occasion). Swapping soda for sparkling water and infusing it with fruit and herbs, like we do with our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/265887/lemon-cucumber-mint-infused-water/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Lemon, Cucumber &amp;amp; Mint Infused Water;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Lemon, Cucumber &amp;amp; Mint Infused Water&lt;/a&gt;, can help you make the switch less painfully.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How Can Drinks Help with Weight Loss?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Staying well-hydrated may help keep your hunger at bay, while also simultaneously reducing the tendency to mindlessly munch. “Hydration is important because it helps us feel full and can reduce our hunger levels,” says Koszyk. Sometimes we think we are hungry, but in reality, we’re thirsty and dehydrated. “A refreshing drink can fill up the stomach while also sending a signal to the brain that you are full,” she explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus, when you provide your body with the right kind of fluids, you’ll also keep your gastrointestinal tract moving. And good digestive health is something that can lead to successful weight maintenance in the long term. Of course, most drinks beyond water contain calories, which does matter for weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, that doesn’t mean you have to avoid calorie-containing drinks—even when you’re aiming to lose weight. “The right drinks can minimize hunger and increase satiety. Focus on staying hydrated with drinks that work with your needs so you enjoy life while reaching your goals,” says Koszyk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to Know If a Drink Is Good for Weight Loss&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Love a beverage not listed in the five above? Don’t worry! Here are a few tips Koszyk and Harris-Pincus use to evaluate if a drink can fit within someone’s weight-loss goals:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Check the calorie content. &lt;/strong&gt;Be mindful of how many calories the drink provides. Ideally, avoid drinking calories that are worth more than a regular meal. Make sure that a meal-substitute drink has a protein or fiber source so you feel full and satisfied after drinking it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monitor the added sugar content. &lt;/strong&gt;Added sugars come from sweet ingredients like honey, agave, syrups and sugar, and they add calories but don’t fill us up. The American Heart Association recommends limiting daily added sugar intake to 24 grams (6 teaspoons) for women and 36 grams (9 teaspoons) for men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evaluate the total nutrition. &lt;/strong&gt;Does the drink have more calories than you’d typically enjoy, but offer nutrients, like dietary fiber, protein and calcium? Then it may be a worthwhile addition to your day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Our Expert Take&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contrary to what you may have heard, you don’t have to just rely on water for your fluid intake if you’re on a weight-loss plan. You can include drinks, like cow’s milk, soy milk, 100% pomegranate juice and others you like. “Any weight-loss plan should be sustainable in the long term. It’s important to include foods and beverages that are enjoyable while allowing you to remain in a caloric deficit,” says Harris-Pincus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remember, nutrition and your individual needs are unique. Working with a registered dietitian one-on-one is the best way to tailor a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/30-day-high-protein-high-fiber-meal-plan-for-weight-loss-8695433" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:meal plan;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;meal plan&lt;/a&gt; that includes the drinks you love that work with your weight-loss goals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/bad-drinks-you-shouldnt-avoid-for-weight-loss-11796212" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:EatingWell;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;EatingWell&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Sat, 23 Aug 2025 20:09:05 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMib0FVX3lxTE1aMUhIeEFwUzZpandxZjMxWlFicGZWZmN0TFd2b2tKdExXZ1ZIZXpabFY3TVdHaDFLTDFINFB4QnNhZjlaRktxUFJnYWJpR2JQaE1mVy1fT2VnendkM2ZFaGJJNE1LNGxwSkFWeE1KNA</guid></item><item><title>在“僵尸”兔子和松鼠的照片病毒式传播之后，鹿疣图像现在成为趋势- WPFO</title><link>https://fox23maine.com/news/offbeat/deer-wart-images-now-trending-after-photos-of-zombie-rabbits-and-squirrels-went-viral-animals-wildlife-experts-rabbits-squirrels-diseases-growths-fibroma-caseous-lymphadenitis-papillomas-virus-hemorrhagic-disease-bluetongue-virus-hunters-meat-health</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="StoryText-module_storyText__FWhP"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;***WARNING: This story contains graphic content. Viewer discretion is advised.***&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Images of "Frankenstein" or "zombie" rabbits and squirrels with unusual growths recently started circulating on social media -- and now photos of deer with warts seem to be joining the bizarre trend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The images may appear alarming, but wildlife experts said the lumps or abscesses on deer and other wildlife are not uncommon. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://wdfw.wa.gov/species-habitats/diseases/abcesses" target="_blank" title="https://wdfw.wa.gov/species-habitats/diseases/abcesses" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife&lt;/a&gt; said two main causes of the growths include &lt;a href="https://wdfw.wa.gov/species-habitats/diseases/abcesses#" target="_blank" title="https://wdfw.wa.gov/species-habitats/diseases/abcesses#" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;Caseous Lymphadenitis &lt;/a&gt;(CL) and &lt;a href="https://wdfw.wa.gov/species-habitats/diseases/abcesses#papillomas-warts" target="_blank" title="https://wdfw.wa.gov/species-habitats/diseases/abcesses#papillomas-warts" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;Papillomas&lt;/a&gt;, also known as warts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agency said it routinely monitors wildlife for disease, such as sample testing from potentially sick animals reported by hunters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;While concern about CL or papillomas passing to humans through contact with an affected animal is small, as with all potential wildlife diseases, hunters should use standard game meat handling hygiene," the agency noted online. "Use protective gloves, avoid cutting into lumps and abscesses but cut away and discard them, clean equipment, and thoroughly cook meat."&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://cwhl.vet.cornell.edu/disease/fibromas" target="_blank" title="https://cwhl.vet.cornell.edu/disease/fibromas" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;The Cornell University Wildlife Health Lab&lt;/a&gt; described the growths as fibromas, or fleshy, wart-like nodules, noting that they tend to vary in texture, size, and color. They can occur on any part of an animal's body, but are typically found their heads and legs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Fibromas can affect an animal’s vision, feeding, breathing, and movement, depending on their size and location," Cornell University Wildlife Health Lab wrote on its website." In addition, abrasions on fibromas can lead to secondary bacterial infections. The growths are generally self-limiting and regress on their own as infected animals mount an immune response. However, in immunocompromised animals, fibromas may progress and invade internal organs."&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fibroma viruses are typically transmitted by insect vectors, such as fleas and mosquitoes, and direct contact with injured skin, according to experts. There is no treatment for fibromas in animals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;White-tailed deer are susceptible to several diseases and are hosts to numerous parasites, the &lt;a href="https://www.msudeer.msstate.edu/diseases-and-parasites.php" target="_blank" title="https://www.msudeer.msstate.edu/diseases-and-parasites.php" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;Mississippi State University Deer Ecology and Management Lab&lt;/a&gt;. It said "a major exception" is hemorrhagic disease, which is caused by the epizootic hemorrhagic disease (EHD) or bluetongue virus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several states, including Maine, Missouri, and Idaho have reported recent cases of EHD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EHD is a virus that spreads among white-tailed deer, causing them to appear weak or disoriented. Infected animals are often found near water as they seek relief from fever. There is currently no cure for the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Most wildlife disease researchers believe that [the disease] has negatively impacted deer populations for most of the 20th century," according to &lt;a href="https://www.mdwfp.com/wildlife-hunting/wildlife-species-program/deer-program/deer-diseases-abnormalities" target="_blank" title="https://www.mdwfp.com/wildlife-hunting/wildlife-species-program/deer-program/deer-diseases-abnormalities" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;Mississippi Wildlife, Fisheries, and Parks&lt;/a&gt;.

			&lt;p&gt;We're learning more and more about how parts of our bodies are linked &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-remarkable-connection-discovered-between-our-heart-and-brain"&gt;and working together&lt;/a&gt; – and now a new study reveals connections between gut bacteria and the risk of insomnia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research, from scientists in China and the US, suggests that being &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cognitive-shuffling-really-could-help-insomniacs-get-to-sleep"&gt;unable to sleep at night&lt;/a&gt; could be at least partly down to the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/the-people-in-your-life-are-sharing-their-gut-microbes-with-you"&gt;mix of microbes&lt;/a&gt; in our digestive system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's more, the relationship appears to go both ways: poor sleep can disrupt the gut's microbial balance, creating a feedback loop that could make insomnia harder to shake. With further investigation, we may be able to develop treatments based on these findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/screen-time-in-bed-may-increase-insomnia-odds-study-suggests"&gt;Screen Time In Bed May Increase Insomnia Odds, Study Suggests&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Changes in the composition and function of the gut microbiota are commonly noted in patients with insomnia," &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/gpsych-2024-101855"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers in their published paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"However, their causal connections to insomnia phenotypes are far from being clear."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team, led by psychiatrist Shangyun Shi of Nanjing Medical University, used a statistical approach called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mendelian_randomization"&gt;Mendelian randomization&lt;/a&gt;. This method looks at genetic variations – which are set at birth and unaffected by lifestyle and other factors – to help determine whether one factor is truly influencing another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By analyzing genetic and health data from more than 400,000 people, the researchers found several clear matches. Certain types of bacteria were associated with &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/chronic-insomnia-linked-to-ultra-processed-foods-study-finds"&gt;increased insomnia risk&lt;/a&gt;, while others seemed to lower the odds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The strongest evidence pointed to the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clostridium_innocuum"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Clostridium innocuum&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; group of bacteria being linked to a greater risk of insomnia. It's not normally a dangerous kind of bacteria, but it appears to be contributing to sleepless nights for some.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We identified a total of 14 and 8 bacterial taxa, respectively, as positively and negatively correlated with insomnia," &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/gpsych-2024-101855"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers.

We're still at the early stages here, and further studies are going to be required in diverse populations – all the participants in this study were of European descent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's worth noting that gut microbes are only one piece of the insomnia puzzle. Other factors can contribute, from stress at work to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/drinking-and-insomnia-often-go-together-and-this-could-be-why"&gt;drinking habits&lt;/a&gt;. But it appears that gut bacteria are definitely a factor to look at in more detail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eventually, &lt;a href="https://gutscharity.org.uk/advice-and-information/health-and-lifestyle/prebiotics-probiotics/"&gt;prebiotics and probiotics&lt;/a&gt; could be developed to take advantage of this link, and poop transplants might also work as a way of treating insomnia – something that's being looked at &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/transplanting-feces-from-one-person-to-another-could-ease-parkinsons-symptoms"&gt;for multiple conditions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Overall, the intertwined effects of insomnia on gut microbiota and vice versa represent a complex bidirectional relationship involving immune regulation, inflammatory response, release of neurotransmitters, and other molecular and cellular pathways," &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/gpsych-2024-101855"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/gpsych-2024-101855"&gt;&lt;em&gt;General Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Knowing what to eat and drink when trying to lose weight can be confusing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Drinks that you might think are "off-limits" can absolutely fit into a weight loss plan.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dairy milk, soy milk and 100% pomegranate juice are a few drinks that can fit into your plan.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Figuring out the best beverages for weight loss can be exhausting. With the evolving research and pseudo-science influencers sharing misinformation online, it’s challenging to determine what, if anything, aside from water, can be consumed in a meal plan when weight loss is the goal.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Unfortunately, thinking in absolutes can really derail your goals, especially if you’re someone who enjoys a cup of juice with breakfast or milk in their cereal. Here at&lt;em&gt; EatingWell&lt;/em&gt;, we believe all foods—drinks included—can fit into a healthy, balanced diet. Here are five “bad” drinks that are fine to consume, whether you want to lose weight or not.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-cows-milk"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Cow’s Milk &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Despite the headlines that have deemed milk as “bad” for weight loss, demonizing its (natural) sugar content as the culprit, research has found the opposite to be true. For example, one study suggests that drinking whole milk is associated with lower body weight, BMI and risk of obesity.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Milk has a lot of benefits. The high-quality, bioavailable protein in milk, like leucine, stimulates muscle growth, which can optimize maintaining lean muscle mass,” says sports dietitian &lt;a href="https://sarahkoszyk.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Sarah Koszyk, RDN&lt;/a&gt;. “When people are trying to lose weight, they want to focus on preserving and maintaining their lean muscle mass and, instead, burn the fat."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re looking for a quick protein fix, milk offers just that. A 1-cup serving of skim milk delivers 8 grams of protein for just 90 calories.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Whether you enjoy it on its own for a quick and nutrient-rich snack, in a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/261428/chocolate-peanut-butter-protein-shake/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;protein shake with fruit&lt;/a&gt; for an on-the-go meal, or in a bowl of cereal, there’s no shame in adding dairy milk into your meal plan.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-fortified-soy-milk"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Fortified Soy Milk &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Soy foods, including soy milk, are a great addition to your weight-loss eating plan. One review found that studies suggest that eating plenty of protein can aid in weight loss, and this includes soy protein.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The point being: Soy protein does not stand in the way of weight loss—and may even help.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Soy milk can also help you consume a healthier diet. “Including soy milk in your diet is a fabulous way to up your protein, fiber and vitamin and mineral intake to meet your nutrient needs while losing weight,” says &lt;a href="https://nutritionstarringyou.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Lauren Harris-Pincus, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For reference, a 1-cup serving of fortified, unsweetened soy milk contains 7 grams of protein and 80 calories.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Plus, it also packs vitamin B12, a nutrient often lacking in plant-based diets.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-naturally-sweetened-coffee"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Naturally Sweetened Coffee &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Flavored coffee tends to get a bad rap. Even when the benefits of caffeine are highlighted for weight loss, the second a sweetener enters the picture, coffee gets canceled.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; But, that doesn't have to be the case. “There are some coffee creamers that are high in ‘empty’ calories from sugars and saturated fats,” says Koszyk. “Coffee isn’t meant to be a high-caloric drink, but drinking black coffee doesn’t always appeal to everyone’s taste buds. Choosing the right coffee creamer that is low in sugar and saturated fat can offer satisfaction while still aligning with one’s weight-loss goals.” 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; With this in mind, it's important to consider what will satisfy your taste buds while fitting into your weight-loss goals. That’s where naturally derived sweeteners, like monk fruit, or no-added-sugar coffee creamers come into play, says Koszyk. Or drizzle a little honey or maple syrup into &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8069479/is-coffee-good-for-you/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;your coffee&lt;/a&gt; for a truly natural sweet addition.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-100-pomegranate-juice"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 100% Pomegranate Juice &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A juice made from 100% fruit juice, like 100% pomegranate juice, can be a wonderful way to add flavor and nutrients to plain water. “Sometimes we need a little extra incentive to increase our water intake,” says Harris-Pincus. You can add a splash of the sweet and slightly tart juice to water or seltzer to encourage drinking more H20 without added sugar, she says.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7882893/health-benefits-of-pomegranates/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Pomegranate&lt;/a&gt; consumption has also been shown to be beneficial in reducing body weight, blood pressure, blood sugar and other markers of cardiovascular health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The fruit is rich in polyphenols, good-for-you antioxidant compounds that help rid your body of free radicals and help decrease inflammation. For a nice twist on iced tea, try our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/249903/hibiscus-pomegranate-iced-tea/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Hibiscus-Pomegranate Iced Tea&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-low-calorie-lower-sugar-sodas"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Low-Calorie, Lower-Sugar Sodas &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Diet soda is a love-it or hate-it&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;item for many,” says Harris-Pincus. However, switching from full-sugar soda to zero-calorie soda can significantly decrease the number of calories you consume in a day and assist with weight loss, she says. While it is probably safe in moderation, the downside is that diet soda doesn’t contain anything beneficial for your health, adds Harris-Pincus.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; At &lt;em&gt;EatingWell&lt;/em&gt;, we suggest first &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290448/is-drinking-soda-bad-for-weight-loss/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;switching to diet soda&lt;/a&gt; if you typically drink regular, then, over time, phase soda out completely (other than on occasion). Swapping soda for sparkling water and infusing it with fruit and herbs, like we do with our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/265887/lemon-cucumber-mint-infused-water/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Lemon, Cucumber &amp;amp; Mint Infused Water&lt;/a&gt;, can help you make the switch less painfully.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-can-drinks-help-with-weight-loss"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Can Drinks Help with Weight Loss? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Staying well-hydrated may help keep your hunger at bay, while also simultaneously reducing the tendency to mindlessly munch. “Hydration is important because it helps us feel full and can reduce our hunger levels,” says Koszyk. Sometimes we think we are hungry, but in reality, we’re thirsty and dehydrated. “A refreshing drink can fill up the stomach while also sending a signal to the brain that you are full,” she explains.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Plus, when you provide your body with the right kind of fluids, you’ll also keep your gastrointestinal tract moving. And good digestive health is something that can lead to successful weight maintenance in the long term.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Of course, most drinks beyond water contain calories, which does matter for weight loss. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Still, that doesn’t mean you have to avoid calorie-containing drinks—even when you’re aiming to lose weight. “The right drinks can minimize hunger and increase satiety. Focus on staying hydrated with drinks that work with your needs so you enjoy life while reaching your goals,” says Koszyk.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-to-know-if-a-drink-is-good-for-weight-loss"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How to Know If a Drink Is Good for Weight Loss &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Love a beverage not listed in the five above? Don’t worry! Here are a few tips Koszyk and Harris-Pincus use to evaluate if a drink can fit within someone’s weight-loss goals:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Check the calorie content. &lt;/strong&gt;Be mindful of how many calories the drink provides. Ideally, avoid drinking calories that are worth more than a regular meal. Make sure that a meal-substitute drink has a protein or fiber source so you feel full and satisfied after drinking it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monitor the added sugar content. &lt;/strong&gt;Added sugars come from sweet ingredients like honey, agave, syrups and sugar, and they add calories but don’t fill us up. The American Heart Association recommends limiting daily added sugar intake to 24 grams (6 teaspoons) for women and 36 grams (9 teaspoons) for men.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evaluate the total nutrition. &lt;/strong&gt;Does the drink have more calories than you’d typically enjoy, but offer nutrients, like dietary fiber, protein and calcium? Then it may be a worthwhile addition to your day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_49-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-spotlight--1-2-post mntl-sc-block-universal-spotlight--1-2-post mntl-sc-block-universal-spotlight mntl-block theme-1-2-post"&gt;&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block-universal-spotlight__heading_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block-universal-spotlight__heading mntl-text-block"&gt;Healthy Drink Recipes for Weight Loss&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_50-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-our-expert-take"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_51-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Our Expert Take &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_52-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Contrary to what you may have heard, you don’t have to just rely on water for your fluid intake if you’re on a weight-loss plan. You can include drinks, like cow’s milk, soy milk, 100% pomegranate juice and others you like. “Any weight-loss plan should be sustainable in the long term. It’s important to include foods and beverages that are enjoyable while allowing you to remain in a caloric deficit,” says Harris-Pincus. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_53-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_54-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Remember, nutrition and your individual needs are unique. Working with a registered dietitian one-on-one is the best way to tailor a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/30-day-high-protein-high-fiber-meal-plan-for-weight-loss-8695433" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;meal plan&lt;/a&gt; that includes the drinks you love that work with your weight-loss goals.
