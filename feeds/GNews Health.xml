&lt;p&gt;Remi Bader is coming clean about undergoing weight-loss surgery after sidestepping speculation for months.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The influencer &lt;a href="https://www.self.com/story/remi-bader-surgery" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;opened up to Self&lt;/a&gt; about her single anastomosis duodenal-ileal bypass with sleeve gastrectomy in an interview published Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She spoke about having the procedure, which involved “cut[ting] out 80 percent of [her] stomach,” in December 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The influencer told Self about choosing to have a single anastomosis duodenal-ileal bypass with sleeve gastrectomy. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;remibader/Instagram&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;She shared the same on “Khloé in Wonder Land.” &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Khloe Kardashian/X&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;Bader said she chose the surgery after struggling with debilitating back pain, excessive sweat, sleep apnea, high cholesterol, heart issues, fatty liver disease and infertility fears.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, after the 30-year-old went under the knife, she spent “hours, hours, hours, hours, throwing up” — and despite being discharged from the hospital after three days, she continued vomiting for weeks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Bader subsequently fell into a “very, very deep depression” and “wanted to die.”&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The TikTok star, who has since been prescribed antidepressants, told the magazine how she is doing one year post-op.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“My binge eating is better,” she explained. “I’m still struggling and I have those thoughts, but I can’t physically binge as much because I don’t have the room for it. You cannot drink and eat within the same 30 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Sometimes I’m out to dinner with friends, and I run to the bathroom. It’s also hard; I’m going to these events and dinners, and I’m constantly getting sick,” Bader continued, saying she also suffered hair loss.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Bader lost “more than 140 pounds in less than a year.” &lt;span class="credit"&gt;GC Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;She called the “quick” transformation “confusing.” &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While reflecting on her “quick” transformation, Baden admitted that it has been “really confusing to be … in a different body but have the exact same brain” because she “never wanted to be this size” and wished to remain “curvy.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The model &lt;a href="https://x.com/i/events/1875987636159905792" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;shared more of her story on Wednesday’s episode of the “Khloé in Wonder Land” podcast&lt;/a&gt;, revealing she lost “more than 140 pounds in less than a year”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She clarified that &lt;a href="https://pagesix.com/article/celebrities-who-used-ozempic-for-weight-loss/"&gt;taking Ozempic&lt;/a&gt; was just a “Band Aid” for her prior to her surgery — but doubled down on the “brutal” recovery being the “worst” experience of her life.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Bader said she “never wanted to be this size” and liked being “curvy.” &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Instagram/@remibader&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;She stopped publicly speaking about her weight in 2023 due to “ridiculous” body shaming. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Instagram/@remibader&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Bader has not been speaking publicly about her weight and her health since September 2023.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the time, she &lt;a href="https://pagesix.com/2023/09/18/remi-bader-sobs-as-she-begs-followers-to-stop-commenting-on-weight-gain/"&gt;sobbed while begging “disgusting” trolls to stop&lt;/a&gt; their “ridiculous … &lt;a href="https://pagesix.com/2022/06/14/remi-bader-turned-away-at-montauk-ranch-called-fat-bitch/"&gt;body-shaming” over her fluctuating figure&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“My health journey will now be my business,” Bader said. “It’s really not fair to just see really mean, mean things. I’m taking care of myself the best that I can.”&lt;/p&gt;

This large-scale umbrella review analyzed data from over 258,000 participants and found that low- to moderate-intensity activities like yoga, Tai Chi, and even exergames significantly benefit cognition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Children and teens saw the greatest memory gains, while people with ADHD experienced notable improvements in executive function. The findings highlight that even small bursts of movement can have profound cognitive effects, making exercise an accessible and essential brain-health strategy for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Best Cognitive Boosts:&lt;/strong&gt; Yoga, Tai Chi, and exergames showed the strongest improvements in memory and cognition.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fast Benefits:&lt;/strong&gt; Gains in brain function were observed within just 1–3 months of regular exercise.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inclusive Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; Low- to moderate-intensity exercise benefited all age groups, especially children and those with ADHD.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of South Australia&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Whether it’s an early morning jog, or a touch of Tai Chi, groundbreaking research from the University of South Australia shows that any form of exercise can significantly boost brain function and memory across children, adults, and older adults.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the largest, most comprehensive umbrella review to date, researchers found that regular exercise improves general cognition, memory, and executive function in both healthy individuals and those with clinical conditions, reinforcing exercise as an essential, inclusive activity for optimising cognitive health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108246"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/exercise-memory-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/exercise-memory-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/exercise-memory-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/exercise-memory-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/exercise-memory-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/exercise-memory-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/exercise-memory-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/exercise-memory-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows an older man running." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/exercise-memory-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/exercise-memory-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/exercise-memory-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/exercise-memory-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/exercise-memory-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/exercise-memory-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/exercise-memory-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Senior researcher, Professor Carol Maher says exercise should be encouraged as a cognitive health strategy across all ages and fitness levels. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Synthesising findings from 133 systematic reviews, covering 2724 randomised controlled trials and 258,279 participants, the systematic umbrella and meta-meta-analysis found that:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;low- to moderate-intensity exercise had the greatest benefits for brain function and memory&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;children and adolescents showed the greatest improvements in memory, while people with ADHD saw the biggest gains in executive function&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;yoga, Tai Chi, and exergames (active video games) delivered the most significant cognitive benefits.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lead researcher, UniSA’s Dr Ben Singh, says the findings provide a comprehensive understanding of how different types, intensities, and durations of exercise influence cognitive function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Exercise has a profound effect on physical health, but we also know it benefits brain function. What this study confirms is that even low-intensity exercise – like yoga or walking – can improve cognition, making it accessible to people of all ages and abilities,” Dr Singh says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In particular, we found that benefits were delivered quickly – with clear gains within 1-3 months, highlighting that even small bursts of activity can make a big difference. It also signals that trying out new activities could play a key role in keeping the brain engaged and active.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For children and teens, exercise was especially beneficial for developing memory, while for people with ADHD, it helped improve focus, reduce impulsivity, and enhance executive function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We also found that mind-body exercises, like Tai Chi and yoga, had the most significant impact on memory, while exergames – such as Pokémon Go – were highly effective for general cognition. This is an encouraging finding, as it suggests that engaging, low-impact activities can offer real cognitive benefits.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Senior researcher, Professor Carol Maher says exercise should be encouraged as a cognitive health strategy across all ages and fitness levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Cognitive decline and neurodegenerative diseases are growing global health concerns, underscoring the urgent need to identify effective strategies to preserve and enhance cognitive function across the lifespan,” Prof Maher says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This study presents compelling evidence that exercise should be integrated into healthcare and education settings to promote cognitive well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Knowing that even small amounts of exercise can improve memory and brain function – especially for those at higher risk – presents a clear opportunity for exercise to be included in clinical and public health guidelines.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this exercise and memory research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#9ddcf3f3fcfff8f1b3d0fcf3eefbf4f8f1f9dde8f3f4eefcb3f8f9e8b3fce8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Annabel Mansfield&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://unisa.edu.au"&gt;University of South Australia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Annabel Mansfield – University of South Australia&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/early/2025/03/06/bjsports-2024-108589" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Effectiveness of exercise for improving cognition, memory and executive function: a systematic umbrella review and meta-meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt;” by Ben Singh et al. &lt;em&gt;British Journal of Sports Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Effectiveness of exercise for improving cognition, memory and executive function: a systematic umbrella review and meta-meta-analysis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="p-2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Objective&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="p-2"&gt;To evaluate systematic reviews of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on the effects of exercise on general cognition, memory and executive function across all populations and ages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="p-3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Methods&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="p-3"&gt;Systematic reviews and meta-analyses of RCTs evaluating the effects of exercise on general cognition, memory and executive function were eligible.

Exercise significantly improved general cognition (SMD=0.42), memory (SMD=0.26) and executive function (SMD=0.24). Memory and executive function improvements from exercise were greater for children and adolescents than for adults and older adults.

In some cases, it may even lead to abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, the Lebanese man did not present any such symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Louis Chaptini, senior author of the new case report said: 'That's the part that makes this case so fascinating. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The patient didn't have the classic symptoms. No heartburn. No food impaction. Just hiccups that wouldn't go away.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite being able to identify his condition through his blood test, the experts involved found it difficult to understand how eosinophilic esophagitis was causing him to constantly hiccup. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ultimately, they theorized the buildup of eosinophils in his esophagus might have triggered impulses in the vagal nerve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr. Louis Chaptini, senior author of the new case report noted that the patient did not show any regular symptoms of the condition &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To test the theory, the doctors gave him a topical steroid to use, which helped cure his hiccups and he found relief within a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;His eosinophil count also dropped back to a normal level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors concluded: 'EoE should be considered in the differential diagnosis in patients presenting with chronic refractory hiccups even when the typical symptoms of EoE are lacking, and prompt treatment with topical steroids should be considered.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While there is no cure for the condition, treatments such as steroids and an acid blocker like a proton pump inhibitor can help address the inflammation and manage symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The case was &lt;span&gt;published in the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://jmedicalcasereports.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13256-025-05044-1#Sec2"&gt;Journal of Medical Case Reports&lt;/a&gt; on March 6. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Despite not being at the epicenter of the outbreak, the number of people being vaccinated has increased, according to Katherine Wells, director of public health for the city of Lubbock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"We're 75 miles east of the actual outbreak, but we're seeing an increase in the number of vaccinations that we're giving in our community," she told ABC News. "Over the last four weeks, our health department has been operating a walk-in vaccine clinic that's just for MMR, and that vaccine clinic [has] administered a little over 300 vaccines."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;She added that health officials have seen multiple babies under 6 months old who have been exposed to measles. Because they are too young to be vaccinated, they have been given shots of immunoglobulin, which are antibodies that act as a post-exposure prophylaxis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Wells said the vaccines are available at no cost, and health officials have been trying to spread the word over social media and the local news.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"So we're kind of just getting the people that, I think, either their children are behind on vaccines, just because parents get busy and it's hard to get your four-year-old sometimes into the doctor's office, or people that were kind of on the fence about vaccines and maybe said, 'Well, I don't want to vaccinate my kids, because you never see measles.' But now that you're seeing measles, they're bringing their children in for vaccinations," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;In conversations with colleagues in nearby health departments, such as in epicenter Gaines County, Wells has said it's been harder to reach residents to distribute the MMR vaccine, making the process somewhat of a "struggle."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;She explained that in Lubbock, the health department building is large -- with most residents knowing where it is -- and the department has more outreach staff than smaller departments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"I think it's a little bit harder in some of these rural areas, because they're setting up in places that might not be as familiar to individuals," Wells said. "They're finding different locations in order to have those clinics; they're starting to focus a lot more on school-based clinics. So, let's go to where the children are and get the parents to come to that school and then offer the vaccine there, which I think is a great tactic."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Meanwhile, in nearby New Mexico, the state Department of Health (NMDOH) &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.nmhealth.org/about/erd/ideb/mog/" target="_blank"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; a total of 43 measles cases so far this year. Most of the cases have been confirmed in Lea County, which borders western Texas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Health officials suspect there may be a connection between the Texas and New Mexico cases, but a link has not yet been confirmed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Data from NMDOH provided to ABC News shows that between Feb. 1 and March 24 of this year, more than 13,100 MMR doses have been administered.

			&lt;p&gt;The  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/how-does-caffeine-wake-you-up" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73115" data-postid="156185" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;coffee&lt;/a&gt; in the break room at work could contain high levels of substances that elevate levels of 'bad' cholesterol in your blood – but there's a simple way to reduce them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diterpene"&gt;Diterpenes&lt;/a&gt; are compounds made by plants that have a variety of effects on the human body. Two of them – &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cafestol"&gt;cafestol&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kahweol"&gt;kahweol&lt;/a&gt; – have been &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms20174238"&gt;linked to increased levels&lt;/a&gt; of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. &lt;span&gt;High levels of these compounds have been found in coffee, but it seems to depend on &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/the-best-way-to-brew-coffee-depends-on-what-you-want-from-your-java"&gt;how you extract it&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Swedish researchers measured the levels of diterpenes in coffee made by a range of common coffee machines and brewing techniques. They found that boiling a big pot of coffee is the worst offender, but you can easily offset those levels by filtering it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coffee machines commonly found in workplaces around the world also produced cups of joe with relatively high diterpene levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We studied 14 coffee machines and could see that the levels of these substances are much higher in coffee from these machines than from regular drip-filter coffee makers," &lt;a href="https://www.uu.se/en/press/press-releases/2025/2025-03-21-cholesterol-elevating-substances-in-coffee-from-machines-at-work"&gt;says David Iggman&lt;/a&gt;, a clinical nutritionist at Uppsala University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"From this we infer that the filtering process is crucial for the presence of these cholesterol-elevating substances in coffee."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team calculated the benefits for a person drinking three cups of coffee a day, five days a week. Swapping the machine coffee for a nice paper-filtered java could reduce LDL cholesterol by enough to cut the relative risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease by 13 percent over 5 years, and 36 percent over 40 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers collected samples from 11 machines that brewed coffee from grinds mixed with hot water and passed through a metal filter, and from a further three that mixed a liquid coffee concentrate with hot water without filtration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For comparison, the team also brewed coffee themselves using a range of methods, including drip-brew, percolator, French press, and boiled coffee. Samples from each method and machine were then frozen for storage and transport, before being analyzed for diterpene concentration. &lt;span&gt;In addition, the team collected four espresso samples from three cafeterias and a workplace.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_156189" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-156189" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/coffee-cafestol-642x366.jpg" alt="How You Make Your Coffee Could Affect Your Cholesterol Intake" class="wp-image-156189 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/coffee-cafestol-642x366.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/coffee-cafestol-728x415.jpg 728w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/coffee-cafestol-768x438.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/coffee-cafestol-1536x875.jpg 1536w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/coffee-cafestol-600x342.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/coffee-cafestol.jpg 1555w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-156189" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;How the different brewing methods stack up in terms of cafestol concentrations. (&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.numecd.2025.103933"&gt;Orrje et. al, &lt;em&gt;Nutrition, Metabolism and Cardiovascular Diseases&lt;/em&gt;, 2025&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team found that manual methods of brewing coffee generally resulted in lower diterpene levels than grabbing a cup from a machine, &lt;span&gt;whether it be a brewing machine, a liquid-model machine, or a traditional espresso maker&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a glance, espresso seemed to be the worst way to make coffee, with a median cafestol level of around 1,060 mg/L. But there were only four samples analyzed and their levels varied wildly, from 35.6 to a staggering 2,446.7 mg/L. As such, it's hard to pull much meaning out of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coffee from liquid and brewing machine models had a median cafestol concentration of 174 milligrams per liter, and 135 mg/L of kahweol. French presses produced coffees with moderate diterpene levels, coming in under 90 mg/L for cafestol and under 70 mg/L for kahweol, while percolators had similar readings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best option seemed to be paper-filtered drip brews, clocking a median of just 11.5 mg/L of cafestol and 8.2 mg/L for kahweol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exception was boiled coffee, a typically unfiltered method that's common in countries such as Sweden. Getting your  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/how-does-caffeine-wake-you-up" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73115" data-postid="156185" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;caffeine&lt;/a&gt; fix this way resulted in a massive mean concentration of just under 940 mg/L of cafestol and nearly 680 mg/L of kahweol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_156292" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-156292" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/filter-coffee-642.jpg" alt="filtering coffee" class="wp-image-156292 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/filter-coffee-642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/filter-coffee-642-592x415.jpg 592w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/filter-coffee-642-600x421.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-156292" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Filtering coffee could make a big difference to your health. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MAEdcijLL8g/"&gt;Andreantian/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, it's easy to slash those levels. When the researchers filtered their boiled coffee through fabric, concentrations dropped to just 28 mg/L for cafestol and 21 mg/L for kahweol. They used a sock for some reason, but any cloth or paper filter should do the trick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team also acknowledges that the study has major limitations, including small sample sizes and variables that went unaccounted for, like filter pore size, water pressure, and temperature, and how the beans were roasted and ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings join a growing and often conflicting body of research into the health effects of coffee – and it's hard to know how it all fits together. Other studies, for instance, have found that drinking three or more cups of coffee per day could &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/drinking-coffee-and-tea-each-day-could-be-protecting-your-heart"&gt;lower your risk&lt;/a&gt; of developing cardiometabolic diseases by 40 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regular coffee consumption has also been linked to lower risks of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/some-coffee-and-tea-drinkers-could-be-lowering-their-risk-of-dementia"&gt;dementia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/drinking-coffee-may-help-protect-against-parkinsons-study-says"&gt;Parkinson's&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/drinking-coffee-may-protect-against-certain-types-of-skin-cancer"&gt;skin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/drinking-tea-or-coffee-each-day-could-reduce-mouth-and-throat-cancer-risk"&gt;mouth&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/drinking-coffee-dramatically-lowers-the-risk-of-bowel-cancer-coming-back"&gt;bowel cancer&lt;/a&gt;. It could offset the negative health effects of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/drinking-coffee-may-lower-risk-of-death-from-too-much-sitting"&gt;prolonged sitting&lt;/a&gt;, and even &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/giant-study-links-drinking-coffee-with-almost-2-extra-years-of-life"&gt;extend your life&lt;/a&gt; by years. But that could all depend on &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/four-cups-of-coffee-a-day-might-be-the-perfect-amount-of-your-heart"&gt;how many cups&lt;/a&gt; you down per day, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/key-health-perks-of-coffee-depend-on-when-you-drink-it-suggests-study"&gt;what time&lt;/a&gt; you drink them – and now, how you brew it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Most of the coffee samples contained levels that could feasibly affect the levels of LDL cholesterol of people who drank the coffee, as well as their future risk of cardiovascular disease," &lt;a href="https://www.uu.se/en/press/press-releases/2025/2025-03-21-cholesterol-elevating-substances-in-coffee-from-machines-at-work"&gt;says Iggman&lt;/a&gt;. "For people who drink a lot of coffee every day, it's clear that drip-filter coffee, or other well-filtered coffee, is preferable."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was published in the journal &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.numecd.2025.103933"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nutrition, Metabolism and Cardiovascular Diseases.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

(13 News) - Casino Del Sol has confirmed that a norovirus outbreak caused the cancellation of a large convention over the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;The Wild Wild West Steampunk Convention was set for March 20-23 at the casino. But on Saturday, Casino Del Sol canceled the rest of the event over “ongoing medical concerns.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;On Tuesday, the casino sent a release to 13 News and explained more about what happened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;“Casino Del Sol was informed that individuals attending a private event at our property were experiencing illness,” the casino said. “An individual associated with the event informed Casino Del Sol management that a guest of the group reported that she had norovirus and at least two attendees were already ill before arriving at the event.

The casino said vendors and attendees were told two hours ahead that they had to leave.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;“This timeline was determined based on the need to swiftly clear the area so that cleaning and sanitization efforts could begin immediately,” the casino said. “While we recognize that this created challenges for some vendors, the health and safety of all guests and team members had to take priority in order to prevent potential further spread.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Some people on social media also complained about the lack of information that was released during the weekend and the fact that the casino remained open.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;“We understand that there has been a strong desire for immediate information, and we appreciate the patience of our guests and the public while we worked to verify details and ensure that the information we provided was accurate,” the casino said. “Our priority throughout this process has been the well-being of our guests, team members, and the greater community. By acting quickly, we were able to contain the situation and reduce the potential for further illness.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="w-100"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Still others on social media called out the WWWSC for deleting a social media post made Saturday afternoon. The WWWSC said it did so “at the insistence of (Casino Del Sol) in an effort to maintain a working relationship during a difficult situation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;The WWWSC said it asked Pima County about the incident and was told “the Pascua Yaqui Health Department is managing the outbreak.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="divider | border-bottom mx-auto w-75 my-4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="header | article-header w-100"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Entire Casino Del Sol Statement&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Casino Del Sol was informed that individuals attending a private event at our property were experiencing illness.

Out of an abundance of caution, the decision was made to conclude the event early and begin a deep cleaning of the conference center. Additionally, all hotel rooms that housed event guests were placed on hold to undergo a deep cleaning and sanitization process, in line with our already rigorous cleaning protocols.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="w-100"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Vendors and attendees were given two hours’ notice to vacate the event space. This timeline was determined based on the need to swiftly clear the area so that cleaning and sanitization efforts could begin immediately.

This was based on the origin of the reported illness. As an added precaution, all occupied hotel rooms and public restrooms underwent an enhanced deep-cleaning and sanitization process in addition to the hotel’s already robust and comprehensive cleaning procedures for every room. Guests who were not affiliated with the event were not impacted by this precautionary measure.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;&lt;i&gt;We understand that there has been a strong desire for immediate information, and we appreciate the patience of our guests and the public while we worked to verify details and ensure that the information we provided was accurate.

Researchers have now discovered that postpartum female mice develop a long-term preference for cooler environments, driven by brain changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These changes involve a specific group of neurons in the preoptic area (POA) that express estrogen receptor alpha (ERα). Postpartum mice showed reduced warm sensitivity and increased cold sensitivity in these neurons, helping explain their new thermal preferences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Temperature Shift:&lt;/strong&gt; Postpartum mice preferred cooler environments for over four weeks after weaning.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brain Mechanism Identified:&lt;/strong&gt; The shift was linked to reduced activity of ERα-expressing neurons in the preoptic area.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reproductive Experience Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; Deleting estrogen receptors in these neurons in virgin females mimicked postpartum behavior.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Baylor College of Medicine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mothers experience major metabolic adaptations during pregnancy and lactation to support the development and growth of the new life. Although many metabolic changes have been studied, body temperature regulation and environmental temperature preference during and after pregnancy remain poorly understood. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers at Baylor College of Medicine and collaborating institutions show in the journal &lt;em&gt;Molecular Metabolism&lt;/em&gt; that postpartum female mice develop new environmental temperature preferences and reveal brain changes mediating these changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108242"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/postpartum-temperature-brain-neurscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/postpartum-temperature-brain-neurscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/postpartum-temperature-brain-neurscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/postpartum-temperature-brain-neurscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/postpartum-temperature-brain-neurscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/postpartum-temperature-brain-neurscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/postpartum-temperature-brain-neurscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/postpartum-temperature-brain-neurscience.jpg" alt="This shows a mom and baby." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/postpartum-temperature-brain-neurscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/postpartum-temperature-brain-neurscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/postpartum-temperature-brain-neurscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/postpartum-temperature-brain-neurscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/postpartum-temperature-brain-neurscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/postpartum-temperature-brain-neurscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/postpartum-temperature-brain-neurscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Supporting this finding, the researchers found that virgin females in which the estrogen receptor alpha had been deleted in ERαPOA neurons also preferred lower temperatures and avoided warmer locations, mimicking postpartum females. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In both humans and mice, body temperature increases during early pregnancy, drops to normal temperature during late pregnancy and then goes up again during lactation,” said co-corresponding author Dr. Chunmei Wang, assistant professor of pediatrics at USDA/ARS Children’s Nutrition Research Center at Baylor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this study, Wang and her colleagues investigated what changes occurred in the brain that mediated the new temperature preference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We worked with mice and found that female mice prefer a cooler environment starting from late pregnancy and persisting in long-term postpartum,” Wang said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For more than four weeks post-weaning female mice had a lower body temperature and preferred cooler environments; they lost their typical preference for warm environments (30 &lt;a&gt;°&lt;/a&gt;C/86 °F) but still avoided cold environments (15 °C/59 °F).”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To identify the biological underpinnings of these changes, the researchers studied the preoptic area (POA), a brain region important for sensing and regulating body temperature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We discovered that the change in temperature preference in postpartum female mice was associated with a significant decrease in a particular group of neurons, estrogen receptor alpha (ERα)-expressing neurons in the preoptic area of the brain (ERα&lt;sup&gt;POA&lt;/sup&gt; neurons),” Wang said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Supporting this finding, the researchers found that virgin females in which the estrogen receptor alpha had been deleted in ERα&lt;sup&gt;POA&lt;/sup&gt; neurons also preferred lower temperatures and avoided warmer locations, mimicking postpartum females.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking closely into the ERα&lt;sup&gt;POA&lt;/sup&gt; neurons, the researchers found that these neurons vary in their ability to sense warm or cold temperatures – one group of ERα&lt;sup&gt;POA&lt;/sup&gt; neurons can directly respond to warmth, while another group responds to cooler temperatures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Interestingly, compared to female mice that had not been pregnant, ERα&lt;sup&gt;POA&lt;/sup&gt; neurons of postpartum females had reduced response to warmth and an enhanced response to cold,” Wang said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, the results support that the ability of ERα&lt;sup&gt;POA &lt;/sup&gt;neurons to sense warmth and cold is regulated by reproductive experience and leads to changes in temperature preferences that alter the animal’s warmth-seeking behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, the researchers are exploring the function of each group of ERα&lt;sup&gt;POA&lt;/sup&gt; neurons on the regulation body temperature and thermal preference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other contributors to this work include Nan Zhang, Meng Yu, Qianru Zhao, Bing Feng, Yue Deng, Jonathan C.

The number and activity of ERα-expressing POA neurons (ERα&lt;sup&gt;POA&lt;/sup&gt;) were assessed using immunohistochemistry and in vitro electrophysiology in response to temperature changes and ERα agonist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="sectitle0025a"&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We showed that female mice prefer a cooler environment starting from late pregnancy and persisting long term postpartum. Female mice with RE (&amp;gt;4 weeks post-weaning) displayed lower body temperature and a lower thermal preferred temperature, and lost preference for warm environments (30 °C) but preserved avoidance of cold environments (15 °C).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was associated with a significant decrease in the number of ERα&lt;sup&gt;POA&lt;/sup&gt; neurons. Importantly, virgin female ERα&lt;sup&gt;POA&lt;/sup&gt;-KO mice displayed lower thermal preferred temperature and impaired warm preference, mimicking RE mice. We further found that distinct ERα&lt;sup&gt;POA&lt;/sup&gt; subpopulations can be regulated by temperature changes with or without presynaptic blockers, and by ERα agonist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More importantly, RE decreased the number of warm-activated ERα&lt;sup&gt;POA&lt;/sup&gt; neurons and reduced the excitatory effects of warmth and estrogen-ERα signaling, while cold-activated ERα&lt;sup&gt;POA&lt;/sup&gt; neurons were slightly enhanced in female mice with RE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="sectitle0030a"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our results support that the thermosensing ability and estrogenic effects in ERα&lt;sup&gt;POA&lt;/sup&gt; neurons are regulated by reproductive experience, altering thermal preference.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 25 Mar 2025 21:50:33 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMickFVX3lxTE9WeFpHdEdOMXV1TGtTOHNEVXpUWThhUTBXOW41THozQ0wzaGlLODJ5bDk3VXZzN0FMdWFPM0JiNWl6bDNRVEh4Nld3WnFKaTExSXprRHRLbDZEeHYydlMyUlJHU3lGaFlYbmlfbFJRQ1c0UQ</guid></item><item><title>Vaccine skeptic hired to head federal study of immunizations and autism - The Washington Post</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimAFBVV95cUxNeHd0cUdpVXZra0JMY1FTRFo3SWtWTWFPY190OG9HbE0zTDlyaE8xeDNWZjJuSkhRbzhUejNlMmh1eXlKeXh0U0d6ZEhFeXpJeUZ3bW03Qmt3V01DQkVOQTZWdnZpd3lHc1kyWkM5d09HSmtoQXJVMy02Z19EWUhCSjljTUpkUjN6bVliSmR1WjdQQXBTb3JTSQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="meteredContent grid-center"&gt;&lt;div class="teaser-content"&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="OLFJMKAJMZHLLC7ATDVDOJ5ACU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;A vaccine skeptic who has long promoted false claims about the connection between immunizations and autism has been tapped by the federal government to conduct a critical study of possible links between the two, according to current and former federal health officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-subscribe-cta" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="NXYZMVKG45AQBHTJ47S2ON4WDE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The Department of Health and Human Services has hired David Geier to conduct the analysis, according to the officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation.

Using advanced MRI scans and blood tests, researchers identified elevated iron in key brain regions and signs of nerve damage in ADHD patients compared to healthy individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These markers are known precursors to neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s. The findings suggest a potential biological mechanism linking ADHD to a higher risk of dementia later in life, underscoring the importance of early ADHD diagnosis and intervention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Iron Accumulation:&lt;/strong&gt; Adults with ADHD had increased brain iron in regions associated with cognitive function.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nerve Damage Indicator:&lt;/strong&gt; Elevated blood levels of NfL, a marker of axonal damage, were found in ADHD patients.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dementia Link:&lt;/strong&gt; The combination of iron buildup and NfL suggests ADHD may increase the risk of age-related dementia.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Geneva&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An adult brain affected by attention deficit disorder with or without hyperactivity (ADHD) presents modifications similar to those observed in individuals suffering from dementia. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are the findings of a study conducted by the Geneva University Hospitals (HUG) and the University of Geneva (UNIGE) which shows that, compared with healthy individuals, patients with an ADHD diagnosis have more iron in certain regions of their brain along with higher levels of neurofilaments (NfL) in their blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These markers have been consistently reported to be characteristic of old age-related dementias such as Alzheimer’s disease and can be measured in its early stages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108238"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/adhd-dementia-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/adhd-dementia-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/adhd-dementia-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/adhd-dementia-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/adhd-dementia-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/adhd-dementia-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/adhd-dementia-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/adhd-dementia-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows two brains." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/adhd-dementia-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/adhd-dementia-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/adhd-dementia-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/adhd-dementia-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/adhd-dementia-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/adhd-dementia-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/adhd-dementia-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;These results confirm that a link exists between ADHD and an increased risk of dementia at old age and identify first neurological mechanism. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study confirms that ADHD may be linked to an increased risk of developing dementia later in life and it provides first evidence for a neurological mechanism possibly involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This significant step forward is described in the journal &lt;em&gt;Psychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ADHD is a frequent neurodevelopmental disorder that affects about 3.5% of adults according to a 2008 World Health Organization (WHO) study. It is characterized by an inability to maintain attention along with inappropriate levels of hyperactivity and impulsivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although symptoms generally manifest during childhood and significantly affect educational development and social interactions, its effects can persist and adversely affect daily functioning in adult life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Old age-related dementias affect about 55 million people globally, with almost 10 million new cases each year according to WHO statistics from 2023. Alzheimer’s disease represents 60 to 70% of these dementia cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Recent epidemiological studies show that adults suffering from ADHD have an increased risk of dementia at an advanced age, but the mechanism through which ADHD constitutes a risk is not known,” states Professor Paul G. Unschuld, Head of the Division of Geriatric Psychiatry of the HUG, Associate Professor in the Department of Psychiatry at the UNIGE Faculty of Medicine and the initiator of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Iron and neurofilaments as indicators &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team used an advanced brain imaging method, known as quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) through magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to examine iron content in the brain of 32 adults between 25 – 45 years of age affected by ADHD and 29 healthy individuals in the same age bracket.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neurofilament light chain protein (NfL) levels in the blood of the participants were measured in parallel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results of the study reveal notable differences in iron distribution in several regions of the brain of the individuals affected by ADHD. Furthermore, a significant association was established between iron levels in the precentral cortex and NfL levels in the blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iron plays an essential role in normal brain functioning, but its excessive accumulation may cause neuronal damage and lead to neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Excess iron in certain regions of the brain is often observed and is associated with increased oxidative stress that furthers neuronal degeneration,” specifies Professor Paul Unschuld.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In parallel, the NfL is an indicator of neuronal damage in the brain, more specifically of neuronal axons which are essential for nerve transmission. High blood levels of NfL reflect axon damage in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consequently, an increased brain iron and NfL levels may indicate an underlying neurodegenerative pathology and an increased risk of neurodegenerative dementia at old age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results confirm that a link exists between ADHD and an increased risk of dementia at old age and identify first neurological mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The importance of early detection and management of ADHD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These discoveries pave the way for new research into understanding why persons with ADHD may be at increased risk of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Paul Unschuld believes that the information provided by this study “will enable targeted prevention strategies to be developed to reduce the risk of dementia in persons affected by ADHD. This is especially important since there is a well-known correlation between lifestyle and altered iron levels in brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“To achieve this, additional longitudinal studies are required in order to determine if a reduction of iron levels in the brain is a potential treatment pathway for preventing dementia at an advanced age in persons with ADHD.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the relationship between ADHD and dementia underlines the importance of early detection of these diseases. It also highlights the importance of proactive management of ADHD in adults, not only to improve quality of life for individuals but also to prevent long-term consequences on cognitive health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;This study was funded by a SPARK grant awarded by the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) to Professor Paul G.

Here, we investigated the liability for neurodegenerative brain disease in adult ADHD, possibly reflected by increased brain iron content and associated neuroaxonal vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="pcn13806-sec-0002-title"&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thirty-two adults with ADHD (35 ± 10 years) and 29 age- and sex-matched controls (32 ± 12 years) underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), standardized psychometric testing and assessment of lifestyle factors. Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) was used to assess magnetic abnormalities indicating local alterations of iron deposition in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By calculating QSM-maps, local iron deposition was tested for statistically significant differences between ADHD and healthy controls. Plasma neurofilament light chain (NfL) levels were measured as an indicator of neuroaxonal integrity by using a fourth-generation ELLA immunoassay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="pcn13806-sec-0003-title"&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brain iron content differed in persons with ADHD, with strongest effects observable in the right precentral cortex (healthy controls: 0.0033 ± 0.0017ppm; ADHD: 0.0048 ± 0.0016ppm; &lt;em&gt;t&lt;/em&gt;(59) = 3.56, &lt;em&gt;P &amp;lt;&lt;/em&gt; 0.001). Moreover, right precentral cortex iron in persons with ADHD was associated with increased blood NfL levels (&lt;em&gt;F&lt;/em&gt;(1.57) = 13.2, &lt;em&gt;P =&lt;/em&gt; 0.001, &lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;em&gt;2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.19).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="pcn13806-sec-0004-title"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our results indicate altered regional iron content in the brains of adults with ADHD. The observed association between increased precentral magnetic susceptibility and increased NfL suggests a connection between local excess of brain iron and neuroaxonal damage in ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the limited sample size of the current study and the naturalistic medication plan, further longitudinal studies are needed to establish whether altered brain iron distribution in adults with ADHD may be associated with an increased risk of dementia at old age.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 25 Mar 2025 21:37:35 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMib0FVX3lxTFB4X0lsdWlJRThhdmVtUVU0ZUdFRUNHazZ2UDYxZE5uQm5pSDFTU1VSTDg2ejlqYUlGUmp6Nk9kZkxDVVI4LU52UUpyeDZSNXJRQTljVXlaaXNxTFNWX3VDQ2NIdVNaLVVWa0RuY0ZYOA</guid></item><item><title>Measles vaccine: Can young children get an early dose of the MMR shot? - NBC News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMisgFBVV95cUxQYnFQMnFvZ3pCVERWV2ZMVG80TlNYU0Q0eG1Ycm1GSVpScDRFcVFWU3E5X0VrRndfYjdnckFmcnJKZHdyYXJwa0c3WHpXZzl0SWJpUFIxamVhMEtjSzFFcG8tNHZGM0JqSzdYV3BrbzE1dFNoV2xVWWxRQ05Zb3hFZXRlMnhjZTBrV2sxX0phYVhNTUo5cEQzSHlxNE1JdDFaTFV0SmlkZ1ZoZkt3UVlVaUh30gFWQVVfeXFMTXFUdkgtajVuXzA1RGVBQ19BakxCaVZ2VnhfRnVhVmVYMUM0LWN0VWdxUG1sZzZCai15QzZBU0R3d3BPeElTMEpwMVVkalZFVWtTSGpjLVE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body__content"&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;More &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/-worried-getting-worse-texas-measles-outbreak-grows-families-resist-va-rcna196873" target="_blank"&gt;measles cases&lt;/a&gt; have been reported in the first three months of 2025 than in all of 2024. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Most of the 420-plus cases have been centered around the &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025" target="_blank"&gt;West Texas&lt;/a&gt; outbreak, which has spilled over to neighboring &lt;a href="https://www.nmhealth.org/about/erd/ideb/mog/" target="_blank"&gt;New Mexico&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://oklahoma.gov/health/news---events/newsroom/2025/ok-measles-update.html" target="_blank"&gt;Oklahoma&lt;/a&gt;. Other cases in people returning from travel abroad have been reported in a handful of states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Vaccination is the best way to protect against infection, but the first dose of the &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/childhood-vaccines-adults-booster-shots-measles-texas-what-know-rcna193197" target="_blank"&gt;measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine&lt;/a&gt; usually isn’t given until a child is 12 to 15 months old. A second dose is given from ages 4 to 6. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;That schedule leaves children under 1 vulnerable. Some parents, however, are opting to give their young children a &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/pediatricians-walk-delicate-line-parents-measles-vaccination-debate-rcna194226" target="_blank"&gt;dose of the vaccine ahead of schedule&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Ana Montanez, a pediatrician at Texas Tech Physicians in Lubbock — an epicenter of the current outbreak — said that parents are calling to request an early dose of the MMR vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“We’ve almost doubled the amount of vaccine we administer on a typical month,” Montanez said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Both the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/mmr/hcp/recommendations.html#:~:text=In%20addition%20to%20the%20routine,elapsed%20since%20the%20first%20dose).&amp;amp;text=There%20are%20no%20recommendations%20to,MMR%20vaccine%20during%20measles%20outbreaks." target="_blank"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.healthychildren.org/English/safety-prevention/immunizations/Pages/Protecting-Your-Baby-from-a-Measles-Outbreak-FAQs.aspx#measles-travel-baby" target="_blank"&gt;American Academy of Pediatrics&lt;/a&gt; say that, in the case of an outbreak or international travel, children as young as 6 months can get a dose of the vaccine, and children under 4 years old who have gotten one dose can get their second one earlier. All doses must be separated by at least four weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Shilpa Patel, a pediatrician at New Jersey Hackensack Meridian Health Medical Group Northern Valley Pediatrics, said that an early dose before 12 months is essentially a bonus dose, and doesn’t take the place of either of the two standard doses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“It does not count for the total,” Patel said. “You still need two doses after the age of 12 months.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Montanez said that’s because, “at this age of development, their immune system isn’t quite developed to where the vaccine would provide prolonged or lifelong immunity.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“Therefore, we would have to give another dose at a year and essentially a third dose at 4 to 6 years,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;While early doses are typically recommended when traveling abroad with children, Patel said she’s also starting to recommend the vaccine for kids traveling to some parts of the U.S., including Texas and Disney World in Florida. &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/measles-outbreak/measles-outbreak-traced-disneyland-declared-over-n343686" target="_blank"&gt;Theme parks&lt;/a&gt; have been the sites of measles outbreaks in the past.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Don Gibson, 36, and his wife considered early vaccinations for their two sons, now ages 2 years and 4 months, as they prepared&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;in January to travel from California to Texas for an April wedding. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“We were really excited to go, and they invited our kids, too, so we were going to take the whole family, but, then, after we booked our travel, including lodging, flights, we saw the &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/measles-outbreak-west-texas-grows-unvaccinated-rcna192163" target="_blank"&gt;outbreak happening in Texas&lt;/a&gt;,” Gibson said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;This prompted a conversation with the family pediatrician, who said they could give an early second dose for their 2-year-old and a dose for the infant when he&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;reached 6 months. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The wedding, however, would occur before the infant hit 6 months, and ultimately the family decided to cancel their plans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Patel said that she’s even started offering an early dose to families who aren’t traveling, but who are concerned about rising measles counts in their neighborhood, pointing to the &lt;a href="https://www.nj.gov/health/cd/topics/measles.shtml" target="_blank"&gt;three measles cases&lt;/a&gt; recently identified in her home state, New Jersey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;For now, doses for domestic travel and for patients in places without active outbreaks are being given at the discretion of individual doctors and parents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;There’s currently &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7146a1.htm" target="_blank"&gt;no official recommendation&lt;/a&gt; for people traveling domestically to places experiencing outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Some are calling for changing that to include a flexible third dose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;In an article earlier this month in the &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2831828" target="_blank"&gt;Journal of the American Medical Association&lt;/a&gt;, former CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky and several other experts proposed codifying an extra dose for high-risk domestic travel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Montanez noted that it’s unclear whether insurance will cover an extra dose of the MMR vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;She said that 80% of her patients are on Medicaid and have their regular immunizations covered by the Texas Vaccines for Children program. But, because these particular doses are given outside of the standard schedule, it remains unclear whether they will be reimbursed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Ultimately, the extra dose is the parents’ choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“If you decide you want to do this, you are welcome to,” Montanez said. “If you don’t want to do this, you don’t have to do this.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Tue, 25 Mar 2025 21:27:46 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisgFBVV95cUxQYnFQMnFvZ3pCVERWV2ZMVG80TlNYU0Q0eG1Ycm1GSVpScDRFcVFWU3E5X0VrRndfYjdnckFmcnJKZHdyYXJwa0c3WHpXZzl0SWJpUFIxamVhMEtjSzFFcG8tNHZGM0JqSzdYV3BrbzE1dFNoV2xVWWxRQ05Zb3hFZXRlMnhjZTBrV2sxX0phYVhNTUo5cEQzSHlxNE1JdDFaTFV0SmlkZ1ZoZkt3UVlVaUh30gFWQVVfeXFMTXFUdkgtajVuXzA1RGVBQ19BakxCaVZ2VnhfRnVhVmVYMUM0LWN0VWdxUG1sZzZCai15QzZBU0R3d3BPeElTMEpwMVVkalZFVWtTSGpjLVE</guid></item><item><title>For Some Measles Patients, Vitamin A Remedy Supported by RFK Jr. Leaves Them More Ill - The New York Times</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifEFVX3lxTE5WN3RzNzZZNlF0QkE3QzQwOGktWU5yR2RZemZ6VllWUUI3TV9nTEtCQm9Dc2RYYkkwcWRFaHl6RUNLbkRYS0dBNUZXaEhLTjJTa0syUzdLWGNGcDRScFl0VWl0S1pCbkZNclJPZHYtc0wzVTYzWVpBMUYwN0M?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-0"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Doctors in West Texas are seeing measles patients whose illnesses have been complicated by an alternative therapy endorsed by vaccine skeptics including Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the health secretary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Parents in Gaines County, Texas, the center of a raging measles outbreak, have increasingly turned to supplements and unproven treatments to protect their children, many of whom are unvaccinated, against the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;One of those supplements is vitamin A, which Mr. Kennedy has promoted as a near miraculous cure for measles. Physicians at Covenant Children’s Hospital in Lubbock, Texas, say they’ve now treated a handful of children who were given so much vitamin A that they had signs of liver damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Some of them had received unsafe doses of supplements for several weeks in an attempt to prevent a measles infection, said Dr. Summer Davies, who cares for acutely ill children at the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“I had a patient that was only sick a couple of days, four or five days, but had been taking it for like three weeks,” Dr. Davies said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;While doctors sometimes administer high doses of vitamin A in a hospital to manage severe measles, experts do not recommend taking it without physician supervision. Vitamin A is not an effective way to prevent measles; however, two doses of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine are about 97 percent effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-1336jj"&gt;&lt;div class="css-121kum4"&gt;&lt;p class="css-171quhb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-asuuk5"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-7axq9l" data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true" class="css-1b5b8u1"&gt;&lt;path fill="currentColor" fill-rule="evenodd" d="M2.5 12a9.5 9.5 0 1 1 19 0 9.5 9.5 0 0 1-19 0Zm8.5 1.75v-7.5h2v7.5h-2Zm0 2v2h2v-2h-2Z" clip-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;div data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript-message" class="css-6yo1no"&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;We are having trouble retrieving the article content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dv1kvn" id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

Gaines County is the epicenter of the outbreak, with 226 cases reported. Fifteen counties in Texas have reported cases.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neighboring New Mexico added 1 more measles case to its outbreak total, which now stands at 43.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Measles is primarily a disease of people who are not immunized, and most residents in the outbreak area are protected from measles disease even if they are exposed to the virus.

This graph shows the latest year for which data is available&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This has changed from 50 when Ms Comer was diagnosed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She told &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://abc7news.com/post/screen-early-bay-area-woman-stage-4-colon-cancer-shares-dire-message-colorectal-awareness-month/16076982/#:~:text=%22I%20was%20told%20that%20I,during%20an%20interview%20in%202023."&gt;ABC 7 News&lt;/a&gt; if the recommended colon cancer screening age had been moved just a few years earlier, 'I would have been inconvenienced for maybe 18 months, but it would not have been a death sentence.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Colorectal &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-c28441d0-08ac-11f0-a088-dfe2cc6ff8d4" class=""&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; is the fourth most common cancer in the US and the second-leading cause of cancer deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The American Cancer Society estimates 154,270 Americans will be diagnosed with colon cancer this year, and 52,900 will die. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This includes 19,550 cases and 3,750 deaths in under-50s.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;By 2030, colon cancer is estimated to be the biggest cancer killer in patients under 50. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts are still largely unsure what's behind the epidemic, but obesity, diets high in processed meats and sugar, sedentary lifestyles, and environmental exposures like microplastics and antibiotics are several of the top theories. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While bloody stool, abdominal pain, weight loss, and changes in bowel habits are tell-tale signs of colon cancer, Ms Comer had no symptoms leading up to her diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Instead, the only sign of trouble was elevated liver enzymes during a blood test. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Liver enzymes are proteins that help the liver produce and break down bile and rid the body of toxins. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cancer that has spread to the liver damages protective cells and can lead to excess enzymes flooding into the bloodstream. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ms Comer told ABC 7 News that following her diagnosis, she would spend eight to 11 hours three days every other week in doing chemotherapy treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She also underwent seven surgeries to remove the tumors from her liver. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But after 180 rounds of chemotherapy and between 60 and 70 scans, Ms Comer made the decision to stop treatment and enter hospice care at home this year due to the lasting wear and tear from chemotherapy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: 'It wasn't a difficult decision. There were no treatment options that were working and the chemo was making me sicker so I couldn't recover.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Ms Comer, pictured here with her husband and daughter, is now in hospice care and focusing on encouraging young patients to get screened for colon cancer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ms Comer said that over the years, her advice to young people and doctors has stayed the same. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I'm really a pain in the butt. I keep saying the same thing - screen early,' she said.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A colonoscopy is considered the gold standard for diagnosing colon cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This involves inserting a long tube with a camera on the end into the anus and passing it through the rectum and colon. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If the doctor finds polyps during the exam, they will remove them and test them for cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The American Cancer Society recommends getting a colonoscopy every 10 years starting at age 45. Prior to 2021, this began at age 50, making Ms Comer miss the age requirement to catch her cancer before it spread. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ms Comer said: 'To the problem in your life, you are the answer and you are the solution. You have to figure it out.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Though she is no longer seeking treatment, she noted her husband and 17-year-old daughter have helped keep her from giving up on life itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Who would want to leave, who would want to leave this beautiful world with all this kindness?' she said.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Tue, 25 Mar 2025 20:22:43 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMioAFBVV95cUxPaEdLdkE3eHZFOV9BdkZiZXdKdUJvaXVRU0pDQ0ZKSXc0UkcxeVdndmduMEZJUUR1Umx0YlN6dGdqRmVselVXVHpGLTQtVXhCTlY2d29kamN0STZvcXU5Y1p6ZERsVWpYc2k3LVpQRTR4aGRQTHE4MTBIWXZCRlJscjdSZ2Z6WGtMVVRkWC11c3NzUnlnMUZ5SElRR2V1TWFG0gGmAUFVX3lxTE5kdF9YR1lFZmxmX2p3UGZiZkhtWmFORGQtV3BVSVFTazRka2xrSDJMLVZqa0VjcmxrdWxoUmJPckFoT1p3VkJZQ0ZqRVVRU1JaSWtudk1FSHpDaTE2ZFVqcnU5a3FqWG9oQ3JYdnVsTmVHaVM1a3RFSkJhdHhPWjA5aV84QW83cFkxUXpvc2lBNUVxLURLdnVfNnNMV3RBYjZXTzNLMkE</guid></item><item><title>World First on Bird Flu: A Sheep Tests Positive - Newser</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikAFBVV95cUxQalV5TDFVQUliV0dOeXRVVzlCVEJCVTYxd0Y4SkR4dERxb3dzYk10bTVVVDBtU3VwTzBBZ3czbnZLellhMHpTLWtlOTUzek9va05XYUlHbHhLZnV4RlFtblF6UGJSTVVuZVc5dUhMUnI3Sms2dnhZYktUVi1SS0V3YVlpSGNEbFhhN2c0RVFsdjM?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="divStoryBodyAbove"&gt;

Health officials in Britain say the virus turned up in a single sheep on a farm in an undisclosed location, reports the &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3w1jj0jzl2o?utm_source=join1440&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_placement=newsletter&amp;amp;user_id=66c4c321600ae150759254c4"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt;. Avian flu, aka H5N1, had previously been reported in a wide range of animals beyond birds, including &lt;a href="https://www.newser.com/story/365898/amid-more-cat-deaths-another-pet-food-recall.html"&gt;cats&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.newser.com/story/363806/2nd-form-of-bird-flu-spreads-to-cows.html"&gt;cows&lt;/a&gt;, pigs, foxes, and &lt;a href="https://www.newser.com/story/364066/new-strain-of-bird-flu-detected-in-a-human.html"&gt;humans&lt;/a&gt;, but this appears to be the first time for a sheep anywhere in the world, notes the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/24/world/europe/bird-flu-sheep-england.html"&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.

                                        "In this instance sheep and poultry have mixed on the same farm, resulting in the transmission of avian influenza," said Phil Stocker of Britain's National Sheep Association, adding that the development may lead to new farming practices to keep animals better separated. Health officials continue to emphasize that it remains relatively difficult for the virus to spread to people, notes &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/what-the-worlds-first-case-of-bird-flu-in-sheep-means-for-the-viruss-spread/"&gt;Scientific American&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.

According to the &lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/173944/nutrients" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/173944/nutrients" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="USDA" data-node-id="5.1" class="body-link css-1i7jlb0 emevuu60"&gt;USDA&lt;/a&gt;, one medium banana has about 105 calories, 27 carbs, 14 grams of sugar, 5 grams of fiber, and 422 mg of potassium. It's also a good source of other nutrients like vitamin C and vitamin B6 and &lt;a href="https://www.delish.com/food-news/what-are-electrolytes/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.delish.com/food-news/what-are-electrolytes/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="electrolytes" data-node-id="5.3" class="body-link css-1i7jlb0 emevuu60"&gt;electrolytes&lt;/a&gt;, including magnesium, sodium, and potassium. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="6" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;"It is estimated that 90% of Americans are not eating the recommended servings of fruits and &lt;a href="https://www.delish.com/holiday-recipes/christmas/roasted-vegetable-recipes/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.delish.com/holiday-recipes/christmas/roasted-vegetable-recipes/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="vegetables" data-node-id="6.1" class="body-link css-1i7jlb0 emevuu60"&gt;vegetables&lt;/a&gt; every day," Manaker says. "So, if someone wants to eat a banana every day, that can be a great habit to get into to get some fruit servings in."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="potential-downsides-of-bananas" data-node-id="7" class="body-h2 css-1iyazm5 emevuu60"&gt;Potential Downsides Of Bananas&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="8" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;But bananas might not be the ideal pick for everyone. Manaker says they might not be the best choice for those following a low-potassium diet or those who get elevated blood sugar after eating. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="9" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Bananas contain carbohydrates and sugars, which raises questions about whether they're a healthy food for people with diabetes. However, according to &lt;a href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/food-features/bananas" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/food-features/bananas" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health" data-node-id="9.1" class="body-link css-1i7jlb0 emevuu60"&gt;Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health&lt;/a&gt;, bananas contain resistant starch, similar to fiber, and release less glucose into the bloodstream than non-resistant starches, like white bread. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="10" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;In addition to their carb content, bananas are known for their potassium, an important electrolyte vital to cell and muscle function and heart health. Potassium and sodium work together and need to be in balance. Hyperkalemia occurs when your blood potassium levels are too high, although this condition is rare. Medical experts estimate that only 2% to 3% of people have high potassium levels, according to the &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/15184-hyperkalemia-high-blood-potassium" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/15184-hyperkalemia-high-blood-potassium" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Cleveland Clinic" data-node-id="10.1" class="body-link css-1i7jlb0 emevuu60"&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br data-node-id="10.3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="11" class="body-text css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;"For a generally healthy person, it is unlikely to experience hyperkalemia by eating one banana a day, especially if the rest of their diet isn't excessively high in potassium-rich foods," Manaker says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="the-bottom-line" data-node-id="12" class="body-h2 css-1iyazm5 emevuu60"&gt;The Bottom Line&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="13" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;So yes, a banana a day is most likely safe. But this depends on your individual health and diet. Overall, Manaker recommends people eat a variety of fruits and veggies. "While eating a banana every day isn't bad for many people, it may be more beneficial to eat different fruits, with bananas sprinkled into the rotation."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="14" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;She adds that the amount of bananas someone can eat in a day depends on the rest of their daily diet. For someone with a stomach bug who can only stomach bananas, she said that having more than one is likely acceptable. But it's probably not the best idea for those eating many bananas on top of "mass quantities" of carbohydrate-rich foods. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="15" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;As they say, too much of anything—even fruits—can have its downsides, so it's best to aim for a balance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="16" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Tired of plain old bananas?

But within a few weeks of taking creatine daily, Taft clocked a benefit that she hadn’t anticipated: a cognitive one. “In addition to strength building, creatine has been really helpful with lifting my brain fog,” she says. The best evidence of that, she adds, may be that she remembers to take it every day. Taft’s experience reflects a broader shift in creatine’s target audience. Once a word rarely heard uttered outside of powerlifting circles, nowadays creatine is attracting new interest among women—and middle-aged women at that. According to doctors, it’s for good reason.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="1" class="body-h3 css-6lrfhd emevuu60"&gt;What is creatine, anyway?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="2" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Creatine is a natural compound that our bodies make using three amino acids (arginine, glycine, and methionine), says Banafsheh Bayati, MD, a board-certified ob-gyn and medical cofounder of &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1583755&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fperelelhealth.com%2F%3Futm_channel%3Dpaid_search%26utm_source%3Dgoogle%26utm_medium%3Dpmax%26utm_campaign%3Dbrand%26gad_source%3D1%26gclid%3DCj0KCQjwytS-BhCKARIsAMGJyzqG2r3H_n6EFnl1EmqIPgULQvzyCXbCbqyARfUHCecQH8REHJ_-Z-waAvRDEALw_wcB" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://perelelhealth.com/?utm_channel=paid_search&amp;amp;utm_source=google&amp;amp;utm_medium=pmax&amp;amp;utm_campaign=brand&amp;amp;gad_source=1&amp;amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwytS-BhCKARIsAMGJyzqG2r3H_n6EFnl1EmqIPgULQvzyCXbCbqyARfUHCecQH8REHJ_-Z-waAvRDEALw_wcB" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Perelel Health" data-vars-ga-product-id="ee6be9a7-8459-4e1b-8219-b7ec728a143e" rel="nofollow" data-node-id="2.1" data-href="https://perelelhealth.com/?utm_channel=paid_search&amp;amp;utm_source=google&amp;amp;utm_medium=pmax&amp;amp;utm_campaign=brand&amp;amp;gad_source=1&amp;amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwytS-BhCKARIsAMGJyzqG2r3H_n6EFnl1EmqIPgULQvzyCXbCbqyARfUHCecQH8REHJ_-Z-waAvRDEALw_wcB" data-product-url="https://perelelhealth.com/?utm_channel=paid_search&amp;amp;utm_source=google&amp;amp;utm_medium=pmax&amp;amp;utm_campaign=brand&amp;amp;gad_source=1&amp;amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwytS-BhCKARIsAMGJyzqG2r3H_n6EFnl1EmqIPgULQvzyCXbCbqyARfUHCecQH8REHJ_-Z-waAvRDEALw_wcB" data-affiliate="true" data-affiliate-url="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1583755&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fperelelhealth.com%2F%3Futm_channel%3Dpaid_search%26utm_source%3Dgoogle%26utm_medium%3Dpmax%26utm_campaign%3Dbrand%26gad_source%3D1%26gclid%3DCj0KCQjwytS-BhCKARIsAMGJyzqG2r3H_n6EFnl1EmqIPgULQvzyCXbCbqyARfUHCecQH8REHJ_-Z-waAvRDEALw_wcB" data-affiliate-network='{"afflink_redirect":"/_p/afflink/swxB/perelelhealth-perelel-doctor-made-vitamins-for","site_id":"10a25939-3448-4c42-8343-9bfdfc32076b","network":{"name":"Skimlinks"}}' data-vars-ga-product-price="$0.00" data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id="9bb6b777-4fb0-4ed4-b95d-fcf0c3f0ded5" data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" class="body-link product-links css-1kl271g e1aq0z090"&gt;Perelel Health&lt;/a&gt;. “Its main job is to help make ATP [the body’s main source of energy] in muscle and brain tissue,” Bayati explains. Creatine is produced in your liver, kidneys, and pancreas, and the majority of it (around 95 percent) is stored in our skeletal muscles, says Stacey Ellery, PhD, a pregnancy physiologist and research group head of biogenetics in reproduction at the Hudson Institute of Medical Research in Australia. But while the body may naturally produce creatine, that amount covers only a portion of what your muscles use, particularly if you’re active or working on building them, says board-certified ob-gyn &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/drmaryclaire/?hl=en" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.instagram.com/drmaryclaire/?hl=en" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Mary Claire Haver, MD" data-node-id="2.3" class="body-link css-1kl271g emevuu60"&gt;Mary Claire Haver, MD&lt;/a&gt;. And though creatine is also found in animal-based foods like red meat, poultry, and fish, for your body (and brain) to really reap the benefits, you’d need to eat a few pounds a day. Hence: supplements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="3" class="body-h3 css-6lrfhd emevuu60"&gt;How creatine helps muscles&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="4" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;In the ’90s, supplementing with creatine rose to popularity among the body-building masses, as did the first wave of scientific studies supporting its ability to bolster muscle mass. How does it do it? “Creatine phosphate stored in muscles is responsible for supplying energy for quick anaerobic bouts of muscle contraction,” says Heather A. Milton, an exercise physiologist supervisor at NYU Langone Health. We use those CP stores within 10 to 30 seconds, she adds, so the higher the stores we have in the muscles, the more our energy output. “This means creatine provides more capacity to lift a heavier load and withstand fatigue while doing so, and that increased strength of work produces greater muscle growth,” says Milton. So you’re able to train harder, lift heavier, and, crucially, recover faster, because creatine is key both for muscle metabolism and muscle repair.  But it’s important to remember that taking creatine alone won’t magically grow your muscles. “It’s the increased capacity to train that most people experience when taking creatine that results in increased muscle mass and exercise performance,” says Ellery.&lt;br data-node-id="4.1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="6" class="body-h3 css-6lrfhd emevuu60"&gt;How the rest of your body may benefit&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="7" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;While the research on creatine and muscle is long-standing and robust, newer research points to additional benefits. One area is the brain, which makes sense, considering that the brain relies on ample amounts of ATP (which, as a reminder, creatine helps create) to function. “When creatine stores are low, brain cells may have a harder time keeping up with the energy demands of thinking, processing, information, and managing stress,” says Haver. Thus far, says Bayati, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8912287/" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8912287/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="studies have shown" data-node-id="7.1" class="body-link css-1kl271g emevuu60"&gt;studies have shown&lt;/a&gt; creatine to be beneficial for &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/nutritionreviews/article/81/4/416/6671817" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://academic.oup.com/nutritionreviews/article/81/4/416/6671817" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="cognitive function " data-node-id="7.3" class="body-link css-1kl271g emevuu60"&gt;cognitive function &lt;/a&gt;in stressful situations or with sleep deprivation.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;section data-embed="pullquote" data-lazy-id="P0-12" data-node-id="8" class="embed"&gt;&lt;blockquote data-theme-key="pullquote" class="css-1eiql25 e1pe3zr91"&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden="true" data-theme-key="title-design-element-before" class="css-2xuljx eagam8p0"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;blockquote class="css-40esvh e1pe3zr90"&gt;Studies have shown creatine to be beneficial for maintaining cognitive function in stressful situations.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden="true" data-theme-key="title-design-element-after" class="css-15j1ztq eagam8p1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="9" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Another area of &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/fsn3.4135" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/fsn3.4135" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="research growth is reproductive health" data-node-id="9.1" class="body-link css-1kl271g emevuu60"&gt;research growth is reproductive health&lt;/a&gt;. “Estrogen levels affect creatine metabolism and play a role in both the synthesis and bioavailability of creatine,” says Bayati. This is why creatine levels fluctuate with your menstrual cycle and other hormonal changes, like the drop in estrogen during menopause. Not to mention that key players in the reproductive process (sperm, uterus, placenta, and fetus) rely on creatine as a source of cellular energy. “Observational studies suggest that in some cases, low creatine levels are associated with fertility complications and adverse pregnancy outcomes,” says Ellery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="10" class="body-h3 css-6lrfhd emevuu60"&gt;Why women in midlife may be the biggest winners&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="11" class="body-text css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Creatine is not a one-size-fits-all recommendation for every woman hovering around midlife. But most doctors agree that, besides vegans and vegetarians (who noticeably lack it in their diets), middle-aged women stand to benefit from it because it can help mitigate the loss of muscle and bone mass, as well as the brain fog that is common in perimenopause. The fact that creatine not only increases exercise performance but also specifically targets changes in energy metabolism, inflammation, and oxidative stress associated with insufficient estrogen is huge for women in midlife, says Ellery. She adds that creatine is also fast becoming a therapeutic intervention of interest for diseases more prevalent in female populations, such autoimmune and major depressive disorders. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="12" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;For Veerle Arts, a 39-year-old strength and mobility coach and co-founder of &lt;a href="https://www.breuckelenathletic.com/" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.breuckelenathletic.com/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Breuckelen Athletic" data-node-id="12.1" class="body-link css-1kl271g emevuu60"&gt;Breuckelen Athletic&lt;/a&gt; in Brooklyn, New York, a podcast interview with &lt;a href="https://www.drstacysims.com/" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.drstacysims.com/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Stacy Sims" data-node-id="12.3" class="body-link css-1kl271g emevuu60"&gt;Stacy Sims&lt;/a&gt;, PhD, talking about creatine in the context of women’s health and performance benefits first piqued her curiosity. “After taking it for four weeks, I began to notice that I could scale up my workouts and sustain a higher intensity. Around the six-week mark, I felt clearer, like my brain fog had lifted. And two months in, I had noticeably put on more muscle,” says Arts, adding that she has been taking it for 10 months and has no plans to stop. “Most of my female clients over 40 are either considering creatine or already taking it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;section data-embed="pullquote" data-lazy-id="P0-13" data-node-id="13" class="embed"&gt;&lt;blockquote data-theme-key="pullquote" class="css-1eiql25 e1pe3zr91"&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden="true" data-theme-key="title-design-element-before" class="css-2xuljx eagam8p0"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;blockquote class="css-40esvh e1pe3zr90"&gt;Around the six-week mark, I felt clearer, like my brain fog had lifted.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden="true" data-theme-key="title-design-element-after" class="css-15j1ztq eagam8p1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="14" class="body-h3 css-6lrfhd emevuu60"&gt;Are these supplements safe?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="15" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Creatine’s use as a dietary supplement has been studied for decades, and it is widely regarded as safe. In the ’90s, it got some negative press due to a case study linking it to kidney injury, says Ellery. But that study has since been debunked and superseded by thorough safety reviews. (Still, people with kidney issues should check with their doctors before taking the supplement.) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="16" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Because the supplement market is wildly and widely unregulated, paying attention to source and quality are key, says Milton. Creatine monohydrate is the gold standard, says Haver—specifically products that are third-party tested (like those certified by the &lt;a href="https://cleanlabelproject.org" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://cleanlabelproject.org" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Clean Label Project" data-node-id="16.1" class="body-link css-1kl271g emevuu60"&gt;Clean Label Project&lt;/a&gt;) for purity, potency, and contaminants. The clinically effective dose that doctors usually recommend is 3 to 5 grams a day, though people who are keen to saturate their muscles faster, says Haver, will sometimes “creatine load,” which involves taking a higher dose (20 grams per day, split into four doses) for five to seven days. “But that isn’t necessary, especially if you’re in this for long-term health and maintenance.”  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="17" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Consistency matters more than anything else, and, as with any supplement, it’s important to note that there is a range of responsiveness: Some people experience mild side effects like water retention or gastrointestinal upset, and some people experience a benefit while others don’t.  Additionally, many doctors recommend taking it for up to five years, since its effects beyond that time frame are not well documented. The bottom line? For women eager to shore up their mental and physical strength in midlife, it may be worth trying.&lt;br data-node-id="17.1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="18" class="body-tip css-tax92z emevuu60"&gt;Any content published by Oprah Daily is for informational purposes only and does not constitute medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.

The breakfast staple is an excellent addition to &lt;a href="https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/how-to-make-a-smoothie/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:smoothies;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;smoothies&lt;/a&gt;, hearty oatmeal, or, on its own, slathered in peanut butter. And, as a fruit with natural packaging, it's easy to carry on the go for a quick snack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;We've all heard the saying, "An apple a day keeps the doctor away." For many, the versatile fruit is a regular part of the daily diet. But just how healthy is it to eat a &lt;a href="https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/best-banana-recipes/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:banana;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;banana&lt;/a&gt; every day?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nutritionnowcounseling.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Lauren Manaker;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Lauren Manaker&lt;/a&gt;, registered dietitian nutritionist, shares her insight on everything we need to know about eating bananas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Health Benefits Of Bananas&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;First, let's get to the nutrition. According to the &lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/173944/nutrients" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:USDA;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;USDA&lt;/a&gt;, one medium banana has about 105 calories, 27 carbs, 14 grams of sugar, 5 grams of fiber, and 422 mg of potassium. It's also a good source of other nutrients like vitamin C and vitamin B6 and &lt;a href="https://www.delish.com/food-news/what-are-electrolytes/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:electrolytes;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;electrolytes&lt;/a&gt;, including magnesium, sodium, and potassium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"It is estimated that 90% of Americans are not eating the recommended servings of fruits and &lt;a href="https://www.delish.com/holiday-recipes/christmas/roasted-vegetable-recipes/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:vegetables;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;vegetables&lt;/a&gt; every day," Manaker says. "So, if someone wants to eat a banana every day, that can be a great habit to get into to get some fruit servings in."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Potential Downsides Of Bananas&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;But bananas might not be the ideal pick for everyone. Manaker says they might not be the best choice for those following a low-potassium diet or those who get elevated blood sugar after eating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Bananas contain carbohydrates and sugars, which raises questions about whether they're a healthy food for people with diabetes. However, according to &lt;a href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/food-features/bananas" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health&lt;/a&gt;, bananas contain resistant starch, similar to fiber, and release less glucose into the bloodstream than non-resistant starches, like white bread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In addition to their carb content, bananas are known for their potassium, an important electrolyte vital to cell and muscle function and heart health. Potassium and sodium work together and need to be in balance. Hyperkalemia occurs when your blood potassium levels are too high, although this condition is rare. Medical experts estimate that only 2% to 3% of people have high potassium levels, according to the &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/15184-hyperkalemia-high-blood-potassium" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Cleveland Clinic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"For a generally healthy person, it is unlikely to experience hyperkalemia by eating one banana a day, especially if the rest of their diet isn't excessively high in potassium-rich foods," Manaker says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;The Bottom Line&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;So yes, a banana a day is most likely safe. But this depends on your individual health and diet. Overall, Manaker recommends people eat a variety of fruits and veggies. "While eating a banana every day isn't bad for many people, it may be more beneficial to eat different fruits, with bananas sprinkled into the rotation."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;She adds that the amount of bananas someone can eat in a day depends on the rest of their daily diet. For someone with a stomach bug who can only stomach bananas, she said that having more than one is likely acceptable. But it's probably not the best idea for those eating many bananas on top of "mass quantities" of carbohydrate-rich foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;As they say, too much of anything—even fruits—can have its downsides, so it's best to aim for a balance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Tired of plain old bananas? Put your produce to use with a &lt;a href="https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/healthy-peanut-butter-banana-smoothie-recipe/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:peanut butter banana smoothie;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;peanut butter banana smoothie&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/banana-nut-bread-recipe/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:banana nut bread;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;banana nut bread&lt;/a&gt; (to use up those super ripe ones).

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;There are dozens of canned soup options to choose from at the supermarket, including plant-based picks and traditional types with differing fat and sodium content.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When shopping for a healthy canned soup, look for one with 300 to 600 milligrams of sodium per serving, zero trans fat or added sugars, and no more than four grams of saturated fat per serving.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Using those guidelines, some of the healthiest canned soups you can buy at the supermarket include Amy’s Organic Lentil Soup Light in Sodium and Cedarlane Foods Organic Vegetable &amp;amp; Barley Soup.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When you’re looking for a quick lunch or dinner, nothing beats a savory can of soup. These quick conveniences often elicit nostalgic, comforting, and delicious childhood memories. But nowadays there are many more canned soup options to choose from. In fact, pretty much any soup you can think of is available for purchase in a can.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; And while majority of these shelf-stable soups are undoubtedly tasty, many of them contain ingredients that take away from their overall healthfulness.The yummiest soup varieties tend to boast high levels of sodium, fat, preservatives, and even added sugars, making them a little less alluring for the health-conscious community.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When it comes to sussing out healthier canned soup options, the main nutrients and ingredients we want to be wary of are &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/healthy-foods-high-in-sodium-7564072" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;sodium&lt;/a&gt;, saturated and trans fat, added sugars, additives, and preservatives.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Canned soup is one of the most notorious sources of sodium (aka salt) as it adds to the product’s overall taste and shelf life. But long-term excessive sodium consumption can lead to hypertension (or high blood pressure levels)&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, and increase one’s risk for developing heart disease. “A good soup choice will have between 300 and 600 milligrams (milligrams) of sodium per serving. Just remember that one serving is usually just half of the can, so if you’ll be having both servings (which most people do), don’t forget to double the sodium,” says Rachel Gargano, MS, RD, CSSD, CBS, chief registered dietitian at Live it Up. These guidelines help you to stay within nationally-recognized limits. “The American Heart Association (AHA) recommends limiting sodium intake to no more than 2,300 milligrams a day&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (though ideally no more than 1,500 milligrams per day for most adults),” says Jamie Adams, MS, RDN, RPYT, women’s health dietitian and founder and owner of Mamaste Nutrition.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Speaking of heart disease, trans and saturated fats are other nutrients we want to be on lookout for. Trans fat, also known as hydrogenated fat, increases LDL (low-density lipoprotein or ‘bad’) &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/health/nutrition-diet/worst-foods-for-high-cholesterol" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;cholesterol levels&lt;/a&gt; while decreasing HDL (high-density lipoprotein or ‘good’) cholesterol levels, delivering a one-two punch to heart health and increasing cardiovascular disease risk&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. The healthiest canned soup will have zero grams of trans fat and no ‘hydrogenated’ ingredients on the ingredients list. Saturated fat (though more controversial&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;) is also generally accepted as a cholesterol-raising nutrient as well,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and is best limited when heart health is the priority. The AHA recommends keeping saturated fat intake to less than six percent of your total daily calories&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. So if you’re following a 2,000 calorie diet, that would be about 13 grams total. Look for soup options with no more than four grams of saturated fat per serving.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Additives, preservatives, and added sugars&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; are also ingredients to avoid in canned soup. This is because mystery ingredients like additives and preservatives lack the long-term evidence to fully evaluate their health effects&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (though they’re technically deemed safe for consumption). Meanwhile, added sugar is a major &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/food-recipes/recipe-collections-favorites/healthy-meals/sugar-inflammation" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;pro-inflammatory agent&lt;/a&gt; in the diet&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, and can contribute to chronic disease development&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and insulin resistance&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. “Some soups, particularly tomato-based varieties, may contain higher amounts of added sugars which only provide empty calories,” says Adams. The healthiest soups will mainly contain ingredients you recognize and have no added sugars.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Better-for-you canned soups will be filled with health-boosting nutrients, like &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/best-sources-of-protein-8775868" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;protein&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/how-much-fiber-do-you-need-a-day-7564730" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;fiber&lt;/a&gt;, too. “Ensuring you have enough protein and fiber at the meal will help you get enough nutrition and feel satisfied. Some soups don’t have enough of these macronutrients, which means you may be more likely to feel hungry sooner,” says Gargano. These nutrients also promote muscle and tissue growth and repair, as well as gut and metabolic health. Protein can be found in lean meats, fish, poultry, dairy, &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/food-recipes/recipe-collections-favorites/ways-to-use-up-extra-eggs-recipes" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;eggs&lt;/a&gt;, nuts, seeds, and legumes, whereas fiber is most concentrated in &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/food-recipes/recipe-collections-favorites/healthy-meals/healthiest-grains" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;whole grains&lt;/a&gt;, veggies, legumes, nuts, and seeds. “Look for soups higher in protein (at least five to seven grams per serving) and fiber (three plus grams per serving) for a more nutritionally balanced soup that leaves you feeling full and satisfied,” Adams adds. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/healthy-fats-8740244" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Unsaturated fat&lt;/a&gt;, vitamins, minerals, and plant compounds are other nutrients you want to see in a canned soup. Unsaturated fats offer satiating benefits while also working to lower cholesterol levels and &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/anti-inflammatory-foods-11684448" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;reduce inflammation&lt;/a&gt; throughout the body. Micronutrients like vitamins, minerals, and plant compounds support several important body systems like the gut, &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/foods-for-immune-system-7093660" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;immune system&lt;/a&gt;, heart, brain, skin, hair, &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/foods-for-stronger-longer-nails-9588978" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;nails&lt;/a&gt;, and more. Sources of these nutrients include whole grains, &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/healthiest-nuts-to-eat-11686130" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="5"&gt;nuts&lt;/a&gt;, seeds, legumes, vegetables, and healthy oils (like olive or avocado), and you want to choose a soup with as many of these ingredients as you can find.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-the-healthiest-canned-soup-varieties"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; The Healthiest Canned Soup Varieties  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; With these guidelines in mind, let’s dive into six of the healthiest canned soup varieties:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Lentil Soup &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For a super-satisfying dish full of protein, fiber, plant compounds, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/health/nutrition-diet/vitamin-b-foods" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;B vitamins&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/health/nutrition-diet/vitamin-a-foods" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;vitamin A&lt;/a&gt; (which together support gut, heart, immune, metabolic, and eye health), look no further than lentil soup. “Lentil soup tends to have a bit more protein than other bean-based soups,” Gargano agrees, meaning you’ll feel plenty full after enjoying it. Amy’s Organic Lentil Soup Light in Sodium has nine grams of protein, six grams of fiber, and a total of 460 milligrams of sodium.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Minestrone Soup &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Minestrone warms you from the inside out with its rich tomato broth filled with an array of vegetables, &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/food-recipes/recipe-collections-favorites/popular-ingredients/bean-recipes" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;beans&lt;/a&gt;, and pasta. These ingredients provide plenty of protein, fiber, and micronutrients for a balanced and filling meal. “Soups such as minestrone usually have at least three grams of fiber per serving, and bring with them the excellent health benefits of beans and legumes,” says Gargano. Health Valley Organic Minestrone Soup is made with organic veggies and spices, and provides seven grams of protein, six grams of fiber, and only 32 milligrams of sodium per serving. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Tomato Soup &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Few soups are as American as tomato soup, often conjuring up childhood memories of gooey &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/food-recipes/cooking-tips-techniques/grilled-cheese-secret-ingredient" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;grilled cheese dipping&lt;/a&gt;. And thankfully, this soup can be plenty healthy as a meaningful source of fiber, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/food-recipes/recipe-collections-favorites/healthy-meals/vitamin-c-foods" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;vitamin C&lt;/a&gt;, vitamin A, and lycopene&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;—a powerful plant compound that benefits eye, immune, and gut health&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. However, many tomato soups are sneaky sources of added sugars, so it’s important to check the ingredients list prior to making a purchase. Sprague Tomato Bisque with Roasted Red Peppers is a fantastic grab that meets our criteria, though is a little low in protein. “If you love a soup that has enough fiber, is low in sodium, but not enough protein (like tomato soup), you can add &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/food-recipes/recipe-collections-favorites/quick-easy/leftover-chicken-recipes" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;leftover chicken&lt;/a&gt;, low-sodium canned chicken, or extra beans to it for a boost,” Gargano shares.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Chicken and Vegetable Soup &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Though chicken noodle soup is a comforting classic, it lacks the robust vegetable content needed to earn a spot on this list. Chicken and vegetable soup meets this criteria, however, providing plenty of protein, fiber, energy-boosting B vitamins, and immune-supportive plant compounds. “Pacific Foods Organic Chicken and Wild Rice Soup is one example made with organic chicken and veggies, and this soup provides you with 12 grams of protein and four grams of fiber per serving,” says Adams. While this option is just 40 milligrams over the recommended sodium guidelines, you can mix in a touch of water while warming it up to mitigate this.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Split Pea Soup &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A close relative to lentil, split pea is equally satisfying with its impressive fiber, protein, &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/foods-high-in-iron-8702307" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;iron&lt;/a&gt;, B vitamins, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/food-recipes/recipe-collections-favorites/healthy-meals/foods-high-in-potassium" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;potassium&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/health/nutrition-diet/foods-high-in-magnesium" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;magnesium&lt;/a&gt; content to benefit immune, bone, blood, gut, heart, and metabolic health. “This soup provides plenty of fiber and vegetables—things that most Americans fall short of every day,” Gargano adds. Amy's Organic Light in Sodium Split Pea Soup is made with organic vegetables and provides 12 grams of protein, seven grams of fiber, and 510 milligrams of sodium per serving with no added sugars. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Vegetable Barley Soup &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; And our final healthy canned soup to highlight is vegetable barley. This &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/vegetable-soup-recipes-7187500" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;vegetarian soup&lt;/a&gt; is rich in fiber with its high vegetable content, and features an often-forgotten (but super nutritious) ingredient—barley! Barley is an excellent source of protein, fiber, potassium, iron, magnesium, B vitamins, selenium, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/foods-high-in-zinc-7511268" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;zinc&lt;/a&gt;, copper, and manganese&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, championing heart, gut, immune, metabolic, and bone health. Cedarlane Foods Organic Vegetable &amp;amp; Barley Soup is a tasty organic option with less than 500 milligrams of sodium per serving, and it serves as the perfect palette for protein-rich add-ins.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-to-look-for-in-healthy-canned-soup"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_49-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What to Look for in Healthy Canned Soup &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_50-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While the above varieties are fantastic soups to start with, there are many other healthy canned soup options to be discovered in the canned foods aisle. To find them, use the following guidelines:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_51-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_52-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;Choose soups with less than 600 milligrams of sodium per serving&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Look for options with zero grams of trans fat and no ‘hydrogenated’ ingredients on the label&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Opt for soups with ingredients you recognize and can pronounce&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Choose soups with at least five to seven grams of protein per serving&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Look for fiber content of at least three grams per serving&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Aim for soup brands with four grams of saturated fat or less per serving&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Select soups with no added sugars&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reach for varieties with plenty of nutrient-dense ingredients like lean meats, fish, poultry, whole grains, legumes, and/or vegetables&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

                                        &lt;p&gt;An outbreak of measles in southwest Kansas continues to grow. &lt;a href="https://kshealthdata.kdhe.ks.gov/t/KDHE/views/InfectiousDiseaseCaseDashboard/DiseaseCharts?%3Aembed=y&amp;amp;%3AisGuestRedirectFromVizportal=y" class="Link" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;&lt;u&gt;State health data shows&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; 10 people in Grant, Stevens and Morton counties, all under the age of 18, have tested positive for measles since the start of this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Kansas Department of Health and Environment first &lt;a href="https://www.kdhe.ks.gov/CivicAlerts.aspx?AID=1483" class="Link" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;&lt;u&gt;reported a measles case in Stevens County March 13&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, stating it was the first measles case in Kansas since 2018. But the state’s measles dashboard also shows two cases, one in January and one in February. A state health department spokesperson said those cases were “retrospectively identified” and part of the current outbreak. The eight other cases were recorded this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly said during a health conference in Wichita that state officials are closely monitoring the outbreak and are ensuring infected people are isolated. She also urged Kansans to get vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They are safe and effective,” Kelly said. “I have two kids. They were both vaccinated. They are alive and well.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" class="Link" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;&lt;u&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention classify a measles outbreak&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as three or more cases linked to each other. This makes Kansas one of the most recent states with a measles outbreak. &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025" class="Link" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Texas has the largest outbreak&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, with more than 300 cases of the measles. Health experts say the disease can lead to serious complications, hospitalization or death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC has confirmed one death amid the outbreak in Texas. In New Mexico, health officials are investigating the cause of death for a person who tested positive for measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ongoing spread of the illness in Kansas comes as state lawmakers in Topeka are considering a bill that includes loosening vaccine requirements in child care regulations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bill is aimed at reducing specific fees and training requirements for early child care facilities. But a provision expands religious exemptions for vaccines that are required for child care programs. The Kansas House recently approved the bill with bipartisan support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kansas vaccine advocates argue the requirement changes could reduce vaccine rates amid a growing public health issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The more unvaccinated children you have in a setting, the more likely it is that measles or whatever will go through the population,” said Rabbi Moti Rieber, executive director for Kansas Interfaith Action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="Enh" data-align-center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class=""&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3 class=""&gt;&lt;b&gt;What is measles? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles, also known as rubeola, is a highly contagious infection caused by a virus. It spreads through the air.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Dana Hawkinson, medical director of infection and prevention at the University of Kansas Health System, said the illness can linger in the air for up to two hours. He said he expects to see the number of cases in Kansas rise because of how easy measles spreads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“With the decrease in overall vaccine rates, I think we have to expect there to be more cases,” he said, “Just because the less people vaccinated means more people that are susceptible to the disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hawkinson said measles can potentially cause severe health problems, like pneumonia. In rare cases, it can lead to brain damage and deafness. He said one in five people who contract measles are hospitalized and it can be deadly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This can be a very devastating disease,” Hawinkson said. “It is unfortunate because we know we have the best proactive safety measure, and that is the vaccine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;State health officials say nine of the 10 Kansans who tested positive for measles were unvaccinated, and one was under vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class=""&gt;&lt;b&gt;Symptoms&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hawkinson said measles symptoms typically start like a common cold. An infected person may have a fever, sore throat, runny nose and mild cough. About two to three days later, the person may develop white &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/measles/symptoms-causes/syc-20374857" class="Link" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;&lt;u&gt;spots in their mouth, known as Koplik spots&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. About three to five days later, the person will develop &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/signs-symptoms/photos.html" class="Link" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;&lt;u&gt;a red, splotchy rash&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which Hawksinson said usually starts on a person’s head and face and then spreads downward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://kidshealth.org/en/parents/measles-keeping-family-safe.html" class="Link" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Experts say if you suspect you or your child has measles&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, it’s best for them to stay home away from other people. Hawkinson said it’s also important to call ahead before bringing someone with a possible infection to the doctor, emergency room or urgent care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is really best to call ahead so that they can take those preparations into account, so that they can protect other people in those areas,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The state health department website has more information about &lt;a href="https://www.kdhe.ks.gov/1501/Measles-Rubeola#:~:text=Providers%20%26%20LHD%20Resources%20Table%20Section,not%20wait%20for%20test%20results." class="Link" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;&lt;u&gt;measles and what to watch for.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class=""&gt;&lt;b&gt;Measles prevention&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hawkinson encourages full vaccination against measles as the best way to avoid contracting the illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have a vaccine that has been used for five to six decades,” Hawkinson said. “It has a great history of safety. It has a great history of effectiveness at preventing disease and especially the complications of disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/vaccines/index.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fvaccines%2Fvpd%2Fmmr%2Fpublic%2Findex.html" class="Link" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;&lt;u&gt;There are two types of vaccines for measles&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: MMR and MMRV. Children need two doses of either vaccine to be fully protected against measles. The first dose should be administered when a child is between 12 and 15 months old and the second should be when a child is between four and six years old. However, the MMVR second dose can be administered as early as 3 months after the first dose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hawkinson said now is a good time to check you and your family’s vaccination status. He said unvaccinated children and adults or people who didn’t receive both doses of the vaccine should consider getting them now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="Enh" data-align-center&gt;

About 90% of Kansans are vaccinated for measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent years, state lawmakers have challenged vaccine requirements in the state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Kansas House recently approved a &lt;a href="https://www.kslegislature.gov/li/b2025_26/measures/hb2294/?link_id=1&amp;amp;can_id=ddf8202ea341214def057893c988d994&amp;amp;source=email-action-alert-tell-your-house-member-to-protect-the-kansas-supreme-court&amp;amp;email_referrer=email_2662630&amp;amp;email_subject=action-alert-on-childhood-immunizations&amp;amp;&amp;amp;" class="Link" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;&lt;u&gt;bill&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; aimed at reducing or eliminating fees and training requirements for child care facilities. That bill includes a provision that adds moral and ethical opposition to the definition of religious exemptions for vaccines that children are required to get before attending child care programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rabbi Moti Rieber, executive director of Kansas Interfaith Action, said the change is reckless. He said most major religions approve of vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In anti-vax sentiment, sometimes it’s called 'religious' but actually, it is more about people’s fears,” Rieber said. “There’s not really a religious basis for it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rieber said changing the definition of religious exemption for vaccine requirements at childcare facilities could also open the door to changes for K-12 public schools, which require several other vaccines for children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rieber said he supports expanding access to affordable child care in Kansas, but the amendment could harm vaccinated and unvaccinated kids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The biggest issue is the potential for this to be a precedent that would then take away the ability of the school or the facility to actually protect their children by not allowing unvaccinated children to be in the setting,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lawmakers on the House floor did not discuss the details of the bill or the reasons to include the vaccine exemption changes before voting to approve it. The bill is now in the Senate.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A joint team of professors—Hajun Kim, Taejoon Kwon, and Joo Hun Kang—from the Department of Biomedical Engineering at UNIST has unveiled a novel diagnostic technique that utilizes artificially designed polymers known as peptide nucleic acid (PNA) as probes. &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0956566324009576" target="_blank"&gt;The research&lt;/a&gt; is published in the journal &lt;i&gt;Biosensors and Bioelectronics&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


										      
																					&lt;p&gt;The fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) technique works by detecting fluorescent signals generated when probe molecules bind to specific genetic sequences in bacteria. This innovative FISH method employs two PNA molecules simultaneously. By analyzing the &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/genomic+sequences/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;genomic sequences&lt;/a&gt; of 20,000 bacterial species, the research team designed PNA sequences that specifically target the ribosomal RNA of particular species.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The method is significantly faster and more accurate than traditional bacterial culture and &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/polymerase+chain+reaction/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;polymerase chain reaction&lt;/a&gt; (PCR) analysis, and it holds promise for reducing mortality rates in critical conditions such as sepsis, where timely administration of antibiotics is crucial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PNA exhibits a higher sensitivity to sequence mismatches compared to conventional DNA-based probes and demonstrates superior penetration through bacterial cell walls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the requirement for both PNA molecules to bind to their target site before generating a signal significantly reduces the likelihood of crosstalk, thereby enhancing accuracy in situations involving multiple overlapping bacterial strains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In tests, the technology successfully detected seven bacterial species—including E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus—showing over 99% accuracy for all species except S. aureus, which was detected with an accuracy of 96.3%. The method's effectiveness was further validated in mixed bacterial samples. Both Enterococcus and E. coli were detected with over 99% accuracy when tested together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The approach utilizing two PNA molecules is based on Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET). This principle involves energy transfer from one PNA molecule to another when they are in close proximity, allowing for the measurement of the fluorescence emitted by the recipient molecule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professor Kim noted, "This method will aid in the diagnosis of infections requiring immediate antibiotic treatment, such as sepsis, &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/urinary+tract+infections/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;urinary tract infections&lt;/a&gt;, and pneumonia, while also helping to reduce unnecessary antibiotic usage."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research team plans to conduct further experiments using blood samples taken from actual patients to explore clinical applications.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A breakthrough in safely delivering therapeutic DNA to cells could transform treatment for millions suffering from common chronic diseases like heart disease, diabetes, and cancer.&lt;/p&gt;


										      
																																	&lt;p&gt;A new process that transports DNA into cells using tiny fat-based carriers called lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) developed by researchers at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania improved the process of turning on the DNA's instructions in mice to make proteins inside cells, which is crucial in fighting disease. Signs also point to an improvement in reducing treatment risks, such as immune reactions, as compared to older DNA transfer techniques.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team's findings were recently &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-025-02556-5" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Nature Biotechnology&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Nobel Prize-winning work sets the stage&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new approach builds directly on the genetic medicine revolution that began at Penn: the development of safe messenger RNA (mRNA) therapies used in COVID vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"For 20 years, DNA delivery with LNPs has been a major goal in this field," said Jake Brenner, MD, Ph.D., an assistant professor of Medicine and Pharmacology. "We're picking up where mRNA left off to tackle bigger challenges."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In their Nobel Prize-winning work, Penn's Katalin Kariko, Ph.D., and Drew Weissman, MD, Ph.D., showed how to modify mRNA to make it safe for delivery in the body. Since then, mRNA-based treatments have entered &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/clinical+trials/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; for a variety of vaccines and for delivering CRISPR proteins to edit genes in rare diseases. While mRNA therapies have advanced rapidly, they have limitations for chronic conditions because mRNA breaks down quickly in the body and cannot easily target specific cell types.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DNA delivery offers a compelling solution to these challenges. Unlike mRNA, DNA remains active in cells for months or even years and can be programmed to work only in targeted cells. However, past attempts to use LNPs to deliver DNA failed because they triggered severe immune reactions—when loaded into standard mRNA-LNPs, DNA was lethal to 100% of healthy mice in laboratory tests. For two decades, researchers recognized DNA delivery's potential but considered it impossible due to these safety barriers.&lt;/p&gt;

																																						&lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
    
     
&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="8188791252"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
																																			&lt;h2&gt;Solving the safety puzzle&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brenner's team discovered why previous attempts to deliver DNA using LNPs were dangerous: These particles triggered the body's internal alarm system—a defensive pathway called STING that normally helps fight infections but causes harmful inflammation when activated inappropriately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;STING detects viruses, bacteria, or damaged DNA. To counter STING-induced inflammation, researchers studied the approach Kariko and Weissman had used 20 years earlier to make mRNA delivery safe: modifying nucleotides (the building blocks of mRNA and DNA). While that approach turned out not to work for STING's interaction with DNA, it led Brenner's team to the key finding: Cells produce a natural anti-inflammatory molecule called nitro-oleic acid (NOA).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By adding this protective molecule to the DNA-carrying particles, the researchers completely eliminated the fatal reactions that had previously made this approach impossible. In &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/laboratory+tests/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;laboratory tests&lt;/a&gt;, all mice receiving the improved DNA delivery system survived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this advancement, treated cells produced the intended therapeutic proteins for about six months from a single dose—much longer than the few hours seen with mRNA therapies. Compared to viral methods commonly used for gene therapy, these DNA-LNPs can carry larger genetic instructions, cause fewer &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/immune+reactions/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;immune reactions&lt;/a&gt;, target specific cells more precisely, and can be given multiple times without losing effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"For 20 years, the use of DNA-LNPs for DNA delivery has been a major goal in the field of genetic medicine," Brenner said. "This technology holds incredible promise—not just to treat diseases, but to fundamentally change how we address health challenges that affect millions. It builds directly on Penn's pioneering work in mRNA and represents the next generation of precision medicine."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Future studies will focus on further refining the technology and testing its effectiveness in different tissues and disease models.&lt;/p&gt;

Healthcare providers, laboratories, and hospitals must report suspected or confirmed cases to the OSDH immediately at 405-426-8710, available 24/7.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

The fungus is spread through tiny spores in the ground that may be whipped up by harsh winds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Roselia Aguirre (left) pictured here with her daughter Aide Moreno (right)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Weakened by brain damage and unable to walk on her own after coming out of the coma, Roselia began attending physical therapy and taking antifungal medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, the treatments couldn't fight the infection and she died on August 24, 2016 from a heart attack. Her death certificate attributed the cause to Valley fever. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Roselia died on August 24, 2016 from a heart attack. Her death certificate attributed the cause to viral fever&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Valley Fever - which got its name because a majority of cases are found in Arizona and California - is a deadly lung infection that kills one in 100 people who contract it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;On average, there were approximately 200 coccidioidomycosis-associated deaths each year from 1999 to 2021.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Valley fever is caused by the fungus coccidioides, which &lt;span&gt;is swept up into the air when soil contaminated with the fungus is disturbed by wind or digging. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;States usually report a total of 10,000 to 20,000 cases of Valley fever yearly. In 2024, Arizona - where most cases emerge - reported a total of 11,801 confirmed and probable cases of Valley fever, higher than last year's total count of 10,990.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;When humans or animals breathe in the spores, they travel through the respiratory tract and into the lungs where they reproduce and spread to other parts of the body, including the brain, skin and liver through the bloodstream. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;If it infects the membranes and fluid around the brain and cause life-threatening meningitis. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The disease, for which there is currently no preventative vaccine, can often be missed by doctors or misdiagnosed as pneumonia as it presents with similar symptoms such as fatigue, cough, fever, aching muscles and breathlessness.&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other symptoms include blurry vision, cognitive decline, hearing changes, night sweats, joint aches and a red rash, usually on the legs but occasionally on the chest, arms and back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There is no current cure and patients are given treatments to manage symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Evidence suggests the fungus that causes Valley fever lives in the soil of Arizona, California, Nevada, New Mexico, parts of Mexico, Central America and South America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Since Texas is one of the states that does not require reporting and the number of Valley fever incidents across the area remain unknown, nobody in Roselia's family had ever heard about the disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Evidence suggests the fungus that causes Valley fever lives in the soil of Arizona, California, Nevada and New Mexico. Texas is one of the states that does not require reporting and the number of Valley fever incidents across the area remain unknown&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Talking about her mother's final days, Aide told &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://elpasomatters.org/2025/03/24/valley-fever-el-paso-dust-storms-disease/"&gt;El Paso Matters&lt;/a&gt;: 'My mom doesn't play around like this. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'What damaged my mom more was we didn't know what it was, so we didn't know how to treat it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'Mom felt like she was going crazy, Now I want everyone to know it doesn't just happen to people living in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a target="_self" href="/news/california/index.html" id="mol-35462820-0996-11f0-93fa-7922d364b9d9"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a target="_self" href="/news/nevada/index.html" id="mol-35462821-0996-11f0-93fa-7922d364b9d9"&gt;Nevada&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a target="_self" href="/news/arizona/index.html" id="mol-35462822-0996-11f0-93fa-7922d364b9d9" class=""&gt;Arizona&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. It's present [in Texas], too.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to Dr &lt;span&gt;Armando Meza, an infectious disease physician at &lt;/span&gt;Texas&lt;span&gt; Tech Health, El Paso, who was not involved in Roselia's care, over half of the people suffering from Valley fever do not show clear symptoms and usually only have a cough and fever, like many other common respiratory illnesses. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He explained: 'Sometimes it's not easy to make a diagnosis because doctors just think they have simple &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/pneumonia/index.html" id="mol-47892500-0996-11f0-93fa-7922d364b9d9" class=""&gt;pneumonia&lt;/a&gt; and give antibiotics, but those patients will not get better, they will get worse.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;There is no proven cure for Valley Fever and patients are usually prescribed rest and given therapies to manage symptoms. Mild cases also tend to clear up on their own. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors may prescribe antifungal medications, but there is no evidence from clinical trials that show these treatments are effective - and antifungal drugs come with the potential for serious side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;According to Dr Armando Meza, an infectious disease physician at Texas Tech Health, El Paso, over half of the people suffering from Valley fever do not show clear symptoms&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In recent years, El Paso has been experiencing frequent dust storms that have left residents battered. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While the region used to see about two to three dust days in the early months of the year, it has already recorded eight days of blowing dust this March alone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The county was placed under a Weather Authority Alert last week after winds blew winds from 35 to 45 mph and gusts reached 65 mph. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts have since warned locals that these dust storms are much worse than previous years and can negatively impact their physical health as airborne particles can cause numerous illnesses including Valley Fever. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Multiple local and federal agencies have asked El Paso residents to stay indoors and avoid traveling during these storms.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Since her mother's death, Aide said she tries to ask every doctor and nurse practitioner she meets if they have heard of Valley fever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She claims that probably two out of three experts she encounters do not know about the disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Aide said: 'It's just to spread awareness. Maybe somebody else doesn't have to go through what my mom did, all the experimenting, wondering if it's this or that. Maybe they can figure it out faster.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

That priority has fallen by the wayside in the second Trump administration, with the termination of a number of grants related to HIV in the past week. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most notable was the sudden withdrawal of $18 million per year for a program dedicated to understanding how to diagnose, treat, and prevent HIV infections and AIDS in adolescents and young adults, who account for about &lt;a href="https://hivinfo.nih.gov/understanding-hiv/fact-sheets/hiv-and-adolescents-and-young-adults#:~:text=Adolescents%20and%20young%20adults%20(AYA,get%20it%20through%20sexual%20transmission." target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;19% of new infections annually&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S. On Friday, the Adolescent Medicine Trials Network for HIV/AIDS Intervention was notified that the two &lt;a href="https://reporter.nih.gov/search/ywiR4GL71UiO0skW5-ySbQ/project-details/10993597#description" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;major&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://reporter.nih.gov/search/ywiR4GL71UiO0skW5-ySbQ/project-details/10880572#description" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;grants&lt;/a&gt; that support its operations had been halted by the National Institutes of Health, in a move that legal experts say may be found illegal if it were challenged in court.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers say the loss of the program — during the third year of the seven-year grants — would mean ceasing research that could help expand the populations that might benefit from emerging treatments. The network has two ongoing trials studying a potential preventive &lt;a href="https://idhi.fsu.edu/sites/g/files/upcbnu4171/files/imported/ATN%20168%20HAPPY%20Lay%20Summary.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;treatment for HIV and pregnancy&lt;/a&gt; and assessing the effectiveness of sexual health counseling and behavioral therapy to &lt;a href="https://idhi.fsu.edu/sites/g/files/upcbnu4171/files/imported/ATN%20170%20IMPACT%20Lay%20Summary.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;reduce HIV transmission in adolescents who use stimulants&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

The New Mexico Department of Health (NMDOH) said the official cause of death is still under investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The CDC has &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html#cdc_data_surveillance_section_10-measles-cases-in-2025" target="_blank"&gt;confirmed 378 measles cases&lt;/a&gt; this year in at least 17 states: Alaska, California, Florida, Georgia, Kansas, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Texas, Vermont and Washington. This is likely an undercount due to delays in states reporting cases to the federal health agency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The majority of nationally confirmed cases, about 95%, are in people who are unvaccinated or whose vaccination status is unknown, the CDC said. Of those cases, 3% are among those who received just one dose of the MMR inoculation and 2% are among those who received the required two doses, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The CDC currently &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/vaccines/index.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fvaccines%2Fvpd%2Fmmr%2Fpublic%2Findex.html" target="_blank"&gt;recommends&lt;/a&gt; that people receive two vaccine doses, the first at ages 12 to 15 months and the second between 4 and 6 years old. One dose is 93% effective, and two doses are 97% effective, the CDC says. Most vaccinated adults don't need a booster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;For those living in the outbreak area, Texas health officials are recommending that parents consider an early dose of the MMR vaccine for children between 6 months and 11 months, and that adults receive a second MMR dose if they only received one in the past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>ABC News</author><pubDate>Tue, 25 Mar 2025 17:26:15 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiogFBVV95cUxOSHM5S1o2LUw1TDE4U1hhN2QwNjhaVzlaU2Zud29LdlRSaDV4UnJGNUoyR05tWHpjX0JJTjhrUTNyeU9sWnNWdHNxdTRNN1lSN0YyRGppY05VTy13RzBnWkdDblo5Ti1XdlVnYm1fUi1ROS1IUWx0Nll3U05BRVVraGVpd1RrdzNhbFBLN3NDZXJUTWN5RVRGMDB4UUdONi1QNXfSAacBQVVfeXFMTmJHQXRTRlkwLVhtNTBzWENCYzhjQ21BZ2FXTm1LRmFycTBISGc4ME9YNk1VdXpMQU04b0N0anlKU2hycVJCbUpVSTczeHlOdVNTSGFPaXlEVTNzVEhJNEUyb25zdEdacEttSlIwcGZ3ODVoX1J3UFU0N0duRTdXaHhoUTdQOFhIZkJGbkZackVxV2dxaGlNZ0hlNUJkN05KemQ2dk5rTnM</guid></item><item><title>I'm a healthy doctor, he's a cross-fit trainer.

Like Dr Light, he developed severe fatigue and breathing trouble, as well as brain fog and anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Both have spent years searching high and low for viable&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-10846665/Long-Covid-Dont-fall-quick-fix-cures.html"&gt; treatments for long Covid&lt;/a&gt; symptoms, estimated to affect around seven percent of Americans, from hyperbaric oxygen chambers to red light therapy and low-dose medication typically used to treat opioid addiction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Long Covid research began in earnest around three years ago, soon after the US government formally named it a disability. Since then, scientists have identified treatments that don’t work – hydroxychloroquine, an antidepressant called fluvoxamine, the &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/diabetes/index.html" id="mol-d1d583d0-099a-11f0-a22f-dff210889df4"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; drug Metformin, and nicotine patches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But they've still not found one that &lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;does &lt;/span&gt;give sufferers relief.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Light, who spent three years treating covid patients and witnessing its long-term effects, never expected to fall severely ill himself—yet after infection, he developed crushing chest tightness, debilitating fatigue, severe brain fog&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Light said he tries ‘not to get too excited about any studies, and I always assume that they’re wrong or that it’s not going to work.’ For now, he added, he and millions more are ‘grasping at straws.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Light told &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.menshealth.com/health/a64144602/long-covid-treatment-cure/"&gt;Men's Health&lt;/a&gt; that he thought he would be spared from Covid infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He regularly burned more than a thousand calories on his Peloton, had no underlying chronic conditions, and was one of the first medical professionals to get vaccinated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Shortly after he recovered from infection in February 2023, he still felt he couldn’t breathe normally and was constantly short of breath. He had trouble concentrating, and wasn't sleeping well. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Emergency room doctors repeatedly sent him home, finding nothing alarming on his chest X-rays, nor anything troubling about his oxygen levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Light said: ‘Your whole body betrays you. But to everyone else, you look okay.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The experience, he added, counted as gaslighting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He questioned his own perception of what was happening in his body and his expertise as a pulmonologist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘At one point, I asked myself, “Am I the problem? Did I just take care of a lot of COVID patients and see a lot of people die, and now that I have COVID, it just scares the crap out of me?”’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In May 2023, he met with a doctor specializing in long Covid, who concluded that Dr Light’s symptoms are ‘typical Long Covid.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Levi Henry - once extremely fit - saw his life transformed after catching covid in December 2021. He lost his sense of taste and smell, struggled to breathe, and was left so exhausted that even reading to his kids became impossible &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Light tried an array of treatments, including Naltrexone, a drug used to treat opioid and alcohol dependence. Its effectiveness in treating long COVID remains thin, but it is also affordable, safe, and well tolerated by patients, Dr Light said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘By blocking your opiate receptors just a little bit, it stimulates your body to make its own endogenous opiates, or feel-good hormones, so it can really help with fatigue and brain fog.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He also replaced cycling on his Peloton to swimming, which was gentler on his body and didn’t bring those same post-exertional crashes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He drank plenty of water to stay constantly hydrated, avoided alcohol, and carried around protein bars to keep himself from passing out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, Mr Henry was struggling with his own symptoms just a few minutes away from Dr Light’s home in Colorado.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A former medical school student-turned-actuary, he was extremely fit and treated his body well. But his Covid infection in December 2021 changed everything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He lost his senses of taste and smell and had trouble breathing, comparing it to trying to run in a corset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He felt so wiped out at the end of the day that he could no longer read stories to his kids. Every errand or exercise felt like running a marathon and would collapse on the couch for hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Ice baths were among the many treatments he tried to alleviate long Covid symptoms. For 84 days in the winter, Mr Henry submerged himself in 33-degree water, a practice that caused his energy levels to improve temporarily&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Like Dr Light’s, Mr Henry felt as though doctors were dismissing his symptoms. They told him, ‘Well, you have young kids. Aren’t all parents wiped out?’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He matched his symptoms with those of long Covid and concluded that this was the opponent he was facing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He became a citizen scientist, conducting hours of research to find any inkling of hope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mr Henry said: ‘I tend to go more of the Eastern medicine approach…vegan, herbs, supplements, traditional Chinese medicine.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He tried hyperbaric oxygen therapy - chambers that administer oxygen at air pressure three times higher than a person would breathe normally. It’s commonly used for muscle recovery but is also helpful for dissolving air bubbles in the lungs following a scuba excursion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He noticed some improvement in his breathing after the treatments, but they came at a steep price—around $200 per session. Because hyperbaric oxygen therapy isn't an approved treatment for long COVID, his insurance refused to cover the costs, so he kept looking for other potential solutions to his ongoing symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Then he tried red light therapy, even buying a $1,200 light panel for the treatments in his home. In theory, red light therapy may alleviate long Covid symptoms by targeting mitochondria – the power plants of cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The light gets absorbed by a key enzyme in the mitochondria, potentially helping cells produce more energy and reducing stress.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Research has yet to prove this effective, though, with small studies returning mixed results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He then tried the carnivore diet, spending around $1,000 per month on meat from his local butcher, as well as a long list of supplements, including ashwagandha, magnesium, L-carnitine, omega-3, vitamin D, zinc, black seed oil, spirulina, and many more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ice baths came next. For 84 days in the winter, Mr Henry submerged himself in 33-degree water, a practice that caused his energy levels to improve. But this, too, proved too expensive to do regularly. It was back to the drawing board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A short drive away, Dr Light, was growing increasingly frustrated by the dismissive doctors. He started a support group for fellow long Covid sufferers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Based out of UCHealth Medical Center of the Rockies, the group consisted of virtual and in-person attendees nationwide.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mr Henry was immediately charmed by Dr Light’s vulnerability. ‘This guys is just cool,’ he thought. Dr Light was a relatable neighbor, a guitar player, and, most notable, a long-covid sufferer himself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I feel like I’ve always thought of doctors as...I don’t want to say not human, but just not coming down to my level,’ he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;During a support group session, Dr. Light used a clever analogy to explain long COVID symptoms - he likened them to the knobs on a guitar amplifier that control different sound levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The comparison instantly clicked with Levi, who plays guitar himself. It helped him visualize how his symptoms could fluctuate in intensity, much like adjusting volume or tone controls on an amp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Both men still exercise – Mr Henry runs and gets 10,000 steps a day, and Dr Light still swims – pushing themselves to the extent they did before they got sick is impossible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mr Henry has less faith in the medical system and its ability to find a cure for what ails them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I don’t think doctors are going to be the ones in a lab solving long Covid,’ he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I think it’s going to be people just trying things on themselves and figuring things out—with some of the people who are doing research finding key pieces of the puzzle, but not all of it.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Tue, 25 Mar 2025 17:06:29 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>Is This Experimental Drug A Promising Alzheimer's Treatment? - Women's Health</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimgFBVV95cUxQRVRQWW5JQkJFS2V4VlVqeF9nQjRzSnJ5a05fdVZieVIzTFJmaEl6YkQ2UGhTMzJUOTlLdEYzVjE2OUR4RkNad3FGZHhyYWlJQlBTaVhERlZfa1NybVJYeDVNd2pPUXc1b05YbEpVY25fRmRFOURIX1JISG1ENFVVcVJaVGJDMloxRnVVSE4yQUVsTHByZU02NGl3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-journey-body="standard-article" class="article-body-content article-body standard-body-content css-j4k1z9 et2g3wt6"&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="0" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;If you're someone who is at high risk of developing &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a64146986/dementia-microplastics-brain-study/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a64146986/dementia-microplastics-brain-study/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="dementia" data-node-id="0.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;dementia&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a64246150/alzheimers-tests-accuracy-study/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a64246150/alzheimers-tests-accuracy-study/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Alzheimer's disease" data-node-id="0.3" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Alzheimer's disease&lt;/a&gt;, it can be pretty &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a63771979/alzheimers-biomarker-test-study/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a63771979/alzheimers-biomarker-test-study/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="emotionally and mentally draining" data-node-id="0.5" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;emotionally and mentally draining&lt;/a&gt;, especially if you feel like there's very little you can do to delay its onset (aside from &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a63622761/rem-sleep-alzheimers-disease-study/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a63622761/rem-sleep-alzheimers-disease-study/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="following a healthy diet and lifestyle" data-node-id="0.7" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;following a healthy diet and lifestyle&lt;/a&gt;, and getting enough sleep).

In case you’re not familiar, amyloid is found, but in the brain it clumps together to form "plaques" between nerve cells. Too much build-up of these amyloid plaques in the brains can lead to issues with brain function and is linked to Alzheimer's, per the &lt;a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/news/amyloid-structure-linked-different-types-alzheimers-disease" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.nia.nih.gov/news/amyloid-structure-linked-different-types-alzheimers-disease" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="National Institute on Aging" data-node-id="5.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;National Institute on Aging&lt;/a&gt; (NIA). But we'll get to more of that later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="6" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;For the study, the researchers gave the study participants an experimental anti-amyloid drug. They found that 22 participants who had no cognitive problems at the study's start and who took the drug the longest (an average of eight years) had a 50 percent lower chance of developing symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="will-the-treatment-cure-alzheimers" data-node-id="8" class="body-h2 css-1coetfg emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="8.0"&gt;Will the treatment cure Alzheimer’s?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="9" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;The researchers didn’t study the impact of the treatment on people who already have Alzheimer’s disease. Instead, they looked at people with a very high likelihood of developing it who were within 10 to 15 years before they were expected to develop the disease based on their family history. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="10" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;So, the treatment is more geared towards delaying or halting onset rather than curing an existing disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-are-amyloid-plaques-and-what-do-they-do-in-the-brain" data-node-id="11" class="body-h2 css-1coetfg emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="11.0"&gt;What are amyloid plaques and what do they do in the brain?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="12" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Amyloid plaques are areas where amyloid (again, a protein) has built up, explains &lt;a href="https://neurology.msu.edu/directory/amit-sachdev" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://neurology.msu.edu/directory/amit-sachdev" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Amit Sachdev," data-node-id="12.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Amit Sachdev,&lt;/a&gt; MD, MS, medical director in the Department of Neurology at Michigan State University. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="13" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;“You can think of it a lot like a scab on your skin,” he says. “The scab is rough, it isn't supposed to be there and, if it gets too thick, it causes a problem.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="14" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;But there is some debate about whether targeting amyloid will help lower the risk of Alzheimer’s disease, says &lt;a href="https://www.providence.org/doctors/profile/203880-clifford-segil" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.providence.org/doctors/profile/203880-clifford-segil" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Clifford Segil," data-node-id="14.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Clifford Segil,&lt;/a&gt; DO, a neurologist at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, CA. “Targeting brain amyloid is not a slam dunk for Alzheimer’s prevention as we do not have any tests that are in use clinically to predict Alzheimer’s onset,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="15" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;“Most neurologists liken [amyloid plaques] to skin freckles, which are normal aging phenomena  and extremely infrequent[ly] became a skin cancer,” Dr. Segil continues. “Many Alzheimer’s scientists liken them to unexploded land mines which, if left alone, will cause older people to lose the ability to tie their shoes and all but surely get Alzheimer’s disease.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-does-this-treatment-break-down-the-amyloid-plaques" data-node-id="17" class="body-h2 css-1coetfg emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="17.0"&gt;How does this treatment break down the amyloid plaques?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="18" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;The treatment uses anti-amyloid antibodies to break down the plaques, Dr. Sachdev explains. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="19" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;“The anti-amyloid antibodies attach to amyloid and use the immune system to remove it,” he says. “This is very effective, because the immune system is excellent at getting rid of things that do not belong.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="20" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;But Dr. Sachdev also says that the drug relies on inflammation to clear the plaques. (Think of it like this: Inflammation is a natural bodily response to kickstart healing in the body, bringing various cells and biological tools to the site of injury to repair it. The treatment seems to trigger inflammation.) “More than 50 percent of patients who were exposed in this study had changes to their brain [including potential for swelling and bleeding] that could be related to inflammation,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="21" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;As such, these medications come with the risk of brain bleeding, brain swelling, and brain shrinkage, making them risky to use, Dr. Segil points out. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="will-this-treatment-be-available-to-the-public" data-node-id="22" class="body-h2 css-1coetfg emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="22.0"&gt;Will this treatment be available to the public?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="23" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Not yet, says &lt;a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://profiles.wustl.edu/en/persons/randall-bateman__;!!Ivohdkk!jPRBR3AsqWVyxRxdsTSwUtCV2vHkBx8sj-HcRxEkgB-gqeEPDZD26v3kHYHNSMbSkKFZJlKiIQLcz6Mc3PizyA$" target="_blank" title="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://profiles.wustl.edu/en/persons/randall-bateman__;!!Ivohdkk!jPRBR3AsqWVyxRxdsTSwUtCV2vHkBx8sj-HcRxEkgB-gqeEPDZD26v3kHYHNSMbSkKFZJlKiIQLcz6Mc3PizyA$" data-outlook-id="e969d9d8-afe5-4fde-99c7-3779cfebf110" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://profiles.wustl.edu/en/persons/randall-bateman__;!!Ivohdkk!jPRBR3AsqWVyxRxdsTSwUtCV2vHkBx8sj-HcRxEkgB-gqeEPDZD26v3kHYHNSMbSkKFZJlKiIQLcz6Mc3PizyA$" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Randall J.

One of the medications in the treatment (gantenerumab) is no longer made. “The company developing it has decided to go into go in a different direction,” Dr. Sachdev says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="26" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Anti-amyloid medications also come with a high risk of side effects, including death—and that's concerning to many doctors and families, Dr. Segil says. “Like most neurologists in the U.S. today, we are not using this family of medications,” he says. “Clinical neurologists like me continue to be skeptical that the benefits outweigh the risks of anti-amyloid medications for dementia.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-journey-blur="partial" data-ad-exclude="true" class="css-19m4yzp e1jy25xv0"&gt;&lt;div class="css-sfzxfp ev8dhu59"&gt;&lt;span class="css-3mrz81 ev8dhu51"&gt;&lt;img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/ea27d1a6-ecd9-4da8-b2a7-049a03b4ab93_1528214135.file?fill=1:1&amp;amp;resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Korin Miller" title="Headshot of Korin Miller" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="css-o0wq4v ev8dhu53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dsojn8 ev8dhu55"&gt;&lt;p class="css-19s3ilq ev8dhu54"&gt;Korin Miller is a freelance writer specializing in general wellness, sexual health and relationships, and lifestyle trends, with work appearing in Men’s Health, Women’s Health, Self, Glamour, and more.

In case you’re not familiar, amyloid is found, but in the brain it clumps together to form "plaques" between nerve cells. Too much build-up of these amyloid plaques in the brains can lead to issues with brain function and is linked to Alzheimer's, per the &lt;a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/news/amyloid-structure-linked-different-types-alzheimers-disease" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:National Institute on Aging;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;National Institute on Aging&lt;/a&gt; (NIA). But we'll get to more of that later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the study, the researchers gave the study participants an experimental anti-amyloid drug. They found that 22 participants who had no cognitive problems at the study's start and who took the drug the longest (an average of eight years) had a 50 percent lower chance of developing symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Will the treatment cure Alzheimer’s?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers didn’t study the impact of the treatment on people who already have Alzheimer’s disease. Instead, they looked at people with a very high likelihood of developing it who were within 10 to 15 years before they were expected to develop the disease based on their family history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, the treatment is more geared towards delaying or halting onset rather than curing an existing disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are amyloid plaques and what do they do in the brain?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amyloid plaques are areas where amyloid (again, a protein) has built up, explains &lt;a href="https://neurology.msu.edu/directory/amit-sachdev" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Amit Sachdev,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Amit Sachdev,&lt;/a&gt; MD, MS, medical director in the Department of Neurology at Michigan State University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You can think of it a lot like a scab on your skin,” he says. “The scab is rough, it isn't supposed to be there and, if it gets too thick, it causes a problem.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there is some debate about whether targeting amyloid will help lower the risk of Alzheimer’s disease, says &lt;a href="https://www.providence.org/doctors/profile/203880-clifford-segil" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Clifford Segil,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Clifford Segil,&lt;/a&gt; DO, a neurologist at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, CA. “Targeting brain amyloid is not a slam dunk for Alzheimer’s prevention as we do not have any tests that are in use clinically to predict Alzheimer’s onset,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Most neurologists liken [amyloid plaques] to skin freckles, which are normal aging phenomena and extremely infrequent[ly] became a skin cancer,” Dr. Segil continues. “Many Alzheimer’s scientists liken them to unexploded land mines which, if left alone, will cause older people to lose the ability to tie their shoes and all but surely get Alzheimer’s disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How does this treatment break down the amyloid plaques?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The treatment uses anti-amyloid antibodies to break down the plaques, Dr. Sachdev explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The anti-amyloid antibodies attach to amyloid and use the immune system to remove it,” he says. “This is very effective, because the immune system is excellent at getting rid of things that do not belong.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Dr. Sachdev also says that the drug relies on inflammation to clear the plaques. (Think of it like this: Inflammation is a natural bodily response to kickstart healing in the body, bringing various cells and biological tools to the site of injury to repair it. The treatment seems to trigger inflammation.) “More than 50 percent of patients who were exposed in this study had changes to their brain [including potential for swelling and bleeding] that could be related to inflammation,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As such, these medications come with the risk of brain bleeding, brain swelling, and brain shrinkage, making them risky to use, Dr. Segil points out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Will this treatment be available to the public?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not yet, says &lt;a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://profiles.wustl.edu/en/persons/randall-bateman__;!!Ivohdkk!jPRBR3AsqWVyxRxdsTSwUtCV2vHkBx8sj-HcRxEkgB-gqeEPDZD26v3kHYHNSMbSkKFZJlKiIQLcz6Mc3PizyA$" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Randall J.

"Our trial tested this in rare families with mutations that cause Alzheimer's disease," Dr. Bateman says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This trial originally ended in 2020. Right now, there are ongoing trials that will wrap up in a few years, and if those are successful, the treatment could potentially be made available to the public, per Dr. Bateman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But some doctors aren't convinced these treatments should be used. One of the medications in the treatment (gantenerumab) is no longer made. “The company developing it has decided to go into go in a different direction,” Dr. Sachdev says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anti-amyloid medications also come with a high risk of side effects, including death—and that's concerning to many doctors and families, Dr. Segil says. “Like most neurologists in the U.S. today, we are not using this family of medications,” he says. “Clinical neurologists like me continue to be skeptical that the benefits outweigh the risks of anti-amyloid medications for dementia.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL</author><pubDate>Tue, 25 Mar 2025 16:43:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiwFBVV95cUxQRDVWaHRPZTBmRjEydzN6WFJIQmhDS2xDYVNzU1BDZ1dReXhYTDBWWkNwX2tkWE56R2o0NEVLSnRzeHJTWVBibWF2X3JyazNPWmdNdU5mZW9yZmJEQkx0RWtzZXRaN2s4bnZjX1V4TTVmYm02Z0VqWTJyZngyRE5LWHNNbmVCVWptN0pr</guid></item><item><title>Could Salty Foods Be Fueling Depression Rates? - Study Finds</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYkFVX3lxTE4tdGN4MnozZGlDMThMNHRQQWNsT2JTb0dpVUNMQXpPOHRDS3VkME5JektpMUVydzhuWmNvZG5lZ2dYRUpXbkdnZEpDU3pfRTBSVmpBYlFOSWYyVE5KTHI3WWxn?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content"&gt;&lt;div class="post-featured-image"&gt;&lt;picture&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-in-a-nutshell"&gt;In a nutshell&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;High-salt diets triggered depression-like behaviors in mice by activating specific immune cells that produce the inflammatory molecule IL-17A.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;When researchers removed these immune cells or used mice genetically unable to produce IL-17A, the depression-like behaviors didn’t occur despite high salt consumption.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;While promising, this mouse study used extremely high salt levels, and more research is needed before applying these findings to human depression treatment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NANJING, China —&lt;/strong&gt; Too much salt has long been blamed for heart problems, but new research suggests it might harm our minds too. Scientists from Nanjing Medical University have discovered a surprising connection between high-salt diets and depression-like behaviors in mice, potentially explaining why depression rates continue rising alongside our consumption of processed foods.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research team found that &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/salt/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;excessive salt intake&lt;/a&gt; triggers specific immune responses in the brain that can lead to behaviors resembling depression. Their findings, published in &lt;a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jimmun/vkaf019" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Journal of Immunology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, offer a biological explanation for previously observed connections between processed food consumption and mood disorders.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/depression/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Depression&lt;/a&gt; affects millions worldwide, with lifetime prevalence reaching 15-18% in many populations. Modern Western diets, especially fast food, contain dramatically more sodium than home-cooked meals—sometimes exceeding homemade options by 100-fold.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-salt-depression-connection"&gt;The Salt-Depression Connection&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the study, mice fed high-salt diets showed behaviors remarkably similar to those experiencing chronic stress. They explored less, displayed heightened &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/anxiety/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;anxiety&lt;/a&gt;, and spent more time motionless during tests measuring “behavioral despair”—patterns that parallel human depression symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers investigated the biological mechanisms behind these behavioral changes. High-salt diets significantly increased production of Interleukin-17A (IL-17A), an immune signaling molecule, particularly in specialized immune cells called gamma delta T cells (γδT cells).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Previous research had linked elevated IL-17A to depression, but this study reveals a direct pathway from dietary salt to increased IL-17A production to depression-like &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/depression-symptoms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;symptoms&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To confirm this connection, the team tested mice genetically modified to lack the ability to produce IL-17A. These mice showed no signs of depression despite consuming high-salt diets. Even more convincingly, when researchers removed the specific immune cells that produce IL-17A, the animals no longer developed depression-like behaviors on high-salt &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/high-salt-diet-weakens-immune-system-study-finds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;diets&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-this-means-for-humans"&gt;What This Means for Humans&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While conducted in mice, the research has compelling implications for human health. Population studies have already shown links between high-salt diets and increased depression rates. This study offers a potential explanation for those observations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/western-diet/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;average American diet&lt;/a&gt; contains about 3,400 mg of sodium daily—far exceeding the American Heart Association’s recommended maximum of 2,300 mg. Fast food meals often deliver an entire day’s worth of recommended &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/sodium/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;sodium&lt;/a&gt; in a single sitting.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This isn’t the first research connecting diet and mental health. &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/mediterranean-diet/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Mediterranean diets&lt;/a&gt; rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, olive oil, and lean proteins correlate with &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/study-finds-mediterranean-diet-depression/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;lower depression rates&lt;/a&gt;. Conversely, diets heavy in &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/processed-foods/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;processed foods&lt;/a&gt;, sugars, and unhealthy fats tend to increase depression risk.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The distinctive aspect of this study is identifying a specific biological pathway connecting diet directly to depression-like behaviors. This precision opens doors to potential new treatment approaches targeting the immune system rather than just brain chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-simple-ways-to-reduce-salt-intake"&gt;Simple Ways To Reduce Salt Intake&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Current depression &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/fish-oil-for-depression-stem-cell-study-shows-supplement-effective-treatment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;treatments&lt;/a&gt; typically focus on neurotransmitter imbalances using medications like SSRIs or on changing thought patterns through therapy. The discovery that dietary factors might contribute to depression through immune pathways represents an important shift in how we might approach mental health care.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Applying these findings doesn’t necessarily require waiting for new pharmaceutical treatments. Simple dietary changes are accessible to most people:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reducing processed food intake&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Eating more &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/home-cooked-meals-healthy-diet/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;home-cooked meals&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Checking food labels for sodium content&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Using herbs and spices instead of salt for flavoring&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some health professionals already recommend the &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/dash-diet/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;DASH diet&lt;/a&gt; (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) for patients with high blood pressure. This diet emphasizes fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and reduced sodium. This new research hints such approaches might benefit mental health too.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Beyond individual choices, these findings could influence public health policies around sodium reduction in processed foods. Some countries have already implemented such regulations: the United Kingdom’s salt reduction program has achieved a 15% decrease in average salt intake since implementation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While more research is needed before definitive conclusions about &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/salt/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;salt reduction&lt;/a&gt; as a depression treatment in humans, this study adds to mounting evidence that what we eat affects both body and mind. For those struggling with depression, these findings don’t suggest dietary changes should replace established treatments like therapy and medication, but they highlight diet as an important complementary factor in mental health care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This research was conducted entirely in mice, not humans&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Mouse depression models may not fully represent human depression’s complexity&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;The behavioral tests measure approximations of depression symptoms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-extreme-salt-levels"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Extreme Salt Levels&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The study used extremely high salt concentrations (8% in food, 1% in water)&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;This far exceeds even high-sodium human diets&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Unclear if more moderate salt increases would produce similar effects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-female-only-subjects"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Female-Only Subjects&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Only female mice were studied&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Sex differences in immune response and depression are well-documented&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Results might differ in male subjects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-correlation-vs-causation-questions"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correlation vs. Causation Questions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The study shows a pathway but doesn’t prove this is the only mechanism&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Other factors beyond IL-17A may contribute to depression in high-salt scenarios&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;The relationship may be more complex in humans with varied diets and lifestyles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-clinical-application-hurdles"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clinical Application Hurdles&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No evidence yet that reducing salt intake reverses depression symptoms&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;No human clinical trials testing this specific mechanism&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Unknown if targeting this pathway would be effective in humans already experiencing depression&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-methodology"&gt;Methodology&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study used female C57BL/6J mice aged 8-12 weeks, including normal mice and some genetically modified to lack RORγt (a protein necessary for IL-17A production). Researchers split the mice into groups receiving either normal diet (0.5% salt) or high-salt diet (8% salt in food plus 1% salt in drinking water) for 5-8 weeks. They also included a group subjected to chronic restraint stress (placed in a restrictive tube for 4 hours daily for 3 weeks) as a comparison model known to induce depression-like behavior. To assess depression-like behaviors, researchers employed four behavioral tests: the open field test (measuring exploration and anxiety), elevated plus-maze test (measuring anxiety), and tail suspension and forced swimming tests (both measuring “giving up” behaviors). They then examined tissues from blood, spleen, and brain using flow cytometry and microscopy to identify changes in immune cells and IL-17A production. In some experiments, they depleted specific immune cells (γδT cells) using antibodies to see if this would prevent depression-like behavior in mice eating high-salt diets.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-results"&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mice on high-salt diets developed significant depression-like behaviors comparable to those seen in chronically stressed mice. They showed reduced exploration in open spaces, increased anxiety behaviors, and greater immobility (a sign of “giving up”) in behavioral tests. These changes happened without affecting blood pressure, body weight, or food intake, suggesting the effects weren’t due to physical health problems. High-salt diet increased IL-17A production in the spleen, blood, and brain. Further analysis showed γδT cells (specifically a subset called γδT17 cells) were the main source of this increased IL-17A. When genetically modified mice unable to produce IL-17A were fed high-salt diets, they didn’t develop depression-like behaviors. Similarly, depleting γδT cells in normal mice using antibodies protected them from developing depression-like behaviors despite consuming high-salt diets. These results strongly suggest high-salt diets trigger depression-like behaviors through IL-17A production by γδT cells.&lt;/p&gt;
