&lt;p&gt;For decades, Alzheimer’s disease has been seen as a one-way road, a slow but inevitable decline in memory and thinking. But new research out of Harvard is beginning to challenge that assumption. A 2024 study suggests that with targeted lifestyle changes, it may be possible to reverse Alzheimer’s symptoms in the early stages, though &lt;a href="https://bgr.com/science/researchers-found-a-way-to-switch-memories-back-on-in-alzheimers-patients/"&gt;the cure&lt;/a&gt; isn’t a one-size-fits-all kind of deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://alzres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13195-024-01482-z"&gt;The study&lt;/a&gt;, published in &lt;em&gt;Alzheimer’s Research &amp;amp; Therapy&lt;/em&gt;, followed 50 people with early-stage Alzheimer’s over the course of 20 weeks. Instead of using medication, participants adopted a program focused on a plant-based diet, regular exercise, better sleep habits, and stress reduction. By the end of the study, many showed measurable improvements in cognitive tests. Some even regained skills like remembering names or following conversations.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“To get significant results in just 20 weeks, in just 50 patients, only altering lifestyle — to be very honest, was shocking to me,” said senior author Rudolph Tanzi, a Harvard Medical School professor, in a &lt;a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2024/07/alzheimers-study-finds-diet-lifestyle-changes-yield-improvements/"&gt;recent statement&lt;/a&gt;. The findings raise the possibility that lifestyle changes alone could help reverse Alzheimer’s symptoms before the disease progresses too far.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="is-wp-image-block wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/AdobeStock_170206548.jpeg?quality=82&amp;amp;strip=all" alt="MRI of alzheimer's disease" class="is-wp-image-block wp-image-5968984" srcset="https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/AdobeStock_170206548.jpeg?quality=82 6000w, https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/AdobeStock_170206548.jpeg?resize=150%2C100&amp;amp;quality=82 150w, https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/AdobeStock_170206548.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;amp;quality=82 300w, https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/AdobeStock_170206548.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;amp;quality=82 768w, https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/AdobeStock_170206548.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;amp;quality=82 1024w, https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/AdobeStock_170206548.jpeg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;amp;quality=82 1536w, https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/AdobeStock_170206548.jpeg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;amp;quality=82 2048w, https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/AdobeStock_170206548.jpeg?resize=63%2C42&amp;amp;quality=82 63w" sizes="(max-width: 6000px) 100vw, 6000px"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="is-wp-image-block wp-element-caption"&gt;An MRI showing Alzheimer’s disease in the brain. Image source: Atthapon/Adobe&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;One key factor is insulin resistance, which affects the brain’s ability to process energy. By shifting to a ketogenic or Mediterranean-style diet, participants improved their brain’s energy metabolism. This, in turn, may reduce inflammation and support neural function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="bgr-newsletter-signup-form newsletter-signup-form black-bg"&gt;	&lt;h4&gt;Tech. Entertainment. Science. Your inbox.&lt;/h4&gt;	&lt;p class="signup-form-info"&gt;Sign up for the most interesting tech &amp;amp; entertainment news out there.&lt;/p&gt;		&lt;p class="signup-form-tos"&gt;By signing up, I agree to the &lt;a rel="noopener" href="https://pmc.com/terms-of-use/" target="_blank"&gt;Terms of Use&lt;/a&gt; and have reviewed the &lt;a rel="noopener" href="https://pmc.com/privacy-policy/" target="_blank"&gt;Privacy Notice.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;	&lt;span class="success hidden text-white font-bold items-center"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other interventions focused on correcting nutritional deficiencies linked to cognitive decline to try to reverse Alzheimer’s progress. Low levels of vitamin B12, vitamin D, and glutathione, for example, have all been associated with increased Alzheimer’s risk. Improved sleep and regular physical activity also boost blood flow to the brain and promote synaptic health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, not every case of Alzheimer’s will respond the same way. The study was relatively small, and most participants had sporadic (non-genetic) Alzheimer’s, which is more likely to be influenced by environmental and lifestyle factors. Experts caution that more research is needed before these findings can be broadly applied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, this study offers hope and a practical direction. If you or a loved one is &lt;a href="https://bgr.com/science/this-ai-can-tell-if-you-might-develop-alzheimers-just-by-hearing-you-speak/"&gt;facing early-stage Alzheimer’s&lt;/a&gt;, it’s worth exploring lifestyle changes under a doctor’s guidance. A diet rich in greens and omega-3s, regular movement, and solid sleep habits could do more than just slow symptoms. It might help reverse Alzheimer’s progression altogether.&lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;Ozempic and similar drugs aren’t just for weight loss, more and more research is finding. New data is the latest to show that GLP-1 medications help lower people’s alcohol consumption, too.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scientists in Ireland and Saudi Arabia conducted the study, which involved around 200 patients who were prescribed GLP-1 drugs to manage their obesity. They found that people not only lost weight on the drugs, they also tended to reduce their alcohol intake—by up to two-thirds for those who drank the most beforehand. The findings strengthen the case for GLP-1s as an addiction treatment, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Semaglutide (the active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy) and similar GLP-1 drugs are &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/semaglutide-tirzepatide-weight-loss-drugs-future-uses-1851116318"&gt;far more effective&lt;/a&gt; at helping people lose weight than diet and exercise alone. But some scientists have also begun to notice that these drugs may help reduce people’s cravings for things besides food, including potentially harmful drugs like opioids, cocaine, and alcohol. &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/the-case-for-ozempic-as-a-addiction-treatment-keeps-getting-better-2000513096"&gt;Early&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/glp-1-drugs-like-ozempic-reduce-cocaine-cravings-case-study-finds-2000565524"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/losing-weight-with-ozempic-might-also-lighten-your-bar-tab-study-finds-2000530051"&gt;have&lt;/a&gt; started to support these anecdotal observations as well.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This new study was prospective, meaning the researchers proactively tracked how people’s alcohol use changed after starting GLP-1 therapy (many past similar studies were retrospective, which only look back in time). The study participants were real-life patients prescribed either semaglutide or liraglutide (an older GLP-1 drug) for weight loss. The participants reported their level of alcohol use before starting the drug, then were asked to come back for follow-up visits three and six months later.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Overall, 188 people returned for at least one follow-up visit. And people who drank alcohol reported drinking less on average after starting a GLP-1 drug. This reduction was especially apparent in those who drank the most to begin with: high consumers (defined as drinking over 11 drinks a week) reported a 68% reduction in their alcohol use, from around 23 drinks a week on average to 8 drinks weekly. That level of reduction is comparable to the effectiveness of existing treatments for alcohol use disorder, the study researchers note.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Our results demonstrate a significant reduction in alcohol intake among patients treated with GLP-1 RAs,” they wrote in their paper, which is set to be &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1083036"&gt;presented&lt;/a&gt; this weekend at the annual European Congress on Obesity. The findings were also &lt;a href="https://dom-pubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/dom.16152"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year in the journal Diabetes, Obesity and Metabolism.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The study does have limitations, such as a lack of a control group and a relatively small sample size. There is also still some mystery as how exactly these drugs could affect drug cravings, though it’s suspected that GLP-1 receptors in the brain regulate our response to rewarding and potentially addictive stimuli like alcohol. But the evidence is mounting for GLP-1s having another life as a treatment for substance use disorders.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The authors note that there was a weak positive correlation between the amount of weight someone lost and how much less alcohol they consumed—a connection that makes sense, given how rich in calories alcoholic drinks tend to be. So at the very least, these drugs might serve a dual function for people struggling with their weight and their drinking habits at the same time, the authors say.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“These findings suggest a potential therapeutic role for GLP-1 RAs in managing co-occurring obesity and alcohol use,” the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Ultimately, it will take randomized and controlled clinical trials to truly know whether semaglutide can become a reliable front-line option for substance use disorders, some of which are &lt;a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06015893?cond=Alcohol%20Use%20Disorder&amp;amp;intr=semaglutide&amp;amp;rank=4"&gt;already underway&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

County each year, infected at least 138 people in 2024 and cases have remained unusually high so far in 2025. Officials say that levels of the virus in local wastewater suggest &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/acd/diseases/hepa-data.htm" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;these figures are an undercount&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Here’s what to know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="css-13o6u42 eoo0vm40" id="link-59aff52b"&gt;How is hepatitis A transmitted?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The hepatitis A virus is spread through the so-called oral-fecal route, which means it is ingested through food or drinks that have been contaminated by microscopic bits of stool from an infected person. It can also spread through close contact with someone who is carrying the virus, even if they don’t show any symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Unhoused people are often at greater risk of contracting hepatitis A because they have limited access to proper toilets and hand-washing facilities. The virus is also more common among travelers to places with poor sanitation, men who have sex with men and people who use drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;But officials say many of the recent cases have occurred in people without those risk factors. They do not yet know why, but Dr. Timothy Brewer, an infectious disease physician and epidemiologist at U.C.L.A., said it had led him to worry about two things: &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/outbreaks/frozen-strawberries-2023/index.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;food contamination&lt;/a&gt;, and community circulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“If you’re practicing good hygiene in a community that has access to potable water, you really should not be seeing a lot of this,” he said. “Something is going on — but exactly what that something is, we don’t yet know.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-kbghgg"&gt;&lt;div class="css-121kum4"&gt;&lt;p class="css-171quhb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-asuuk5"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-7axq9l" data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true" class="css-1b5b8u1"&gt;&lt;path fill="currentColor" fill-rule="evenodd" d="M2.5 12a9.5 9.5 0 1 1 19 0 9.5 9.5 0 0 1-19 0Zm8.5 1.75v-7.5h2v7.5h-2Zm0 2v2h2v-2h-2Z" clip-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;div data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript-message" class="css-6yo1no"&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;We are having trouble retrieving the article content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dv1kvn" id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

          &lt;p&gt;A starry sky can be stunning—even inside a hospital emergency room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But instead of celestial bodies sparkling in the night, doctors in South Korea were gazing at bright brain lesions punctuating a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. The resulting pattern, called a "starry sky," meant that their 57-year-old patient had a dangerous form of tuberculosis. The doctors &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMicm2415077?logout=true"&gt;report the case&lt;/a&gt; in this week's issue of the New England Journal of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The man had previously been treated for the infection in his lungs but came into the hospital's emergency department after two weeks of unexplained headaches, neck pain, and tingling in his right hand. The MRI and Computed-Tomography (CT) scans clearly revealed the problem: rare nodules and lesions, called tuberculomas, speckling his lungs and central nervous system, including both cerebral hemispheres, the basal ganglia deep inside the brain, the cerebellum at the back of the brain, the brain stem, and the upper spinal cord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="ars-wp-img-shortcode id-2094308 align-center"&gt;

    &lt;div class="caption-content"&gt;&lt;p&gt;
      Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head with gadolinium enhancement revealed numerous small, spherical, peripherally enhancing nodules in the cerebral hemispheres (Panels A and B), basal ganglia, cerebellum, and brain stem, as well as in the upper spinal cord with surrounding edema (Panel C).

                      &lt;/a&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The condition, called CNS tuberculoma, is a relatively rare manifestation of tuberculosis, which typically infects the lungs but can invade any part of the body. It's unclear exactly how tuberculomas form, but evidence suggests that the bacteria that cause tuberculosis—&lt;em&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis—&lt;/em&gt;can spread around the body via the blood. &lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt;M. tuberculosis &lt;/em&gt;can get past the blood-brain barrier, possibly by hiding inside a type of white blood cell called a macrophage, in a "Trojan horse" mechanism or by breaking through the barrier.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK585138/"&gt;Tuberculomas are thought to form&lt;/a&gt; when bacteria and macrophages clump together into masses that may contain calcifications or cheese-like dead tissue called caseum.&lt;/p&gt;

            Measles cases continue to accumulate in the United States in what is already the second-worst year since the disease was declared eliminated a quarter-century ago. Now, a recent outbreak in one North Dakota county has led local health officials to quarantine nearly 200 unvaccinated students.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmah6bcky00063b6mosmds0h6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            North Dakota has reported &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.nd.gov/news/nine-cases-measles-williams-county" target="_blank"&gt;nine measles&lt;/a&gt; cases this year, and a recent outbreak among schoolchildren in Williams County in the northwest part of the state has led local health officials to enforce a law that requires unvaccinated students to quarantine for 21 days after exposure to someone who has the virus. The move was taken by local public health officers in the Upper Missouri District Health Unit, and the state health department is assisting with mitigation efforts.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmah6bcky00073b6mgjouu841@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            On Tuesday, families of 188 unvaccinated students in the Williston Basin School District No. 7 received a letter informing them that their children would&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;need to quarantine for three weeks.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmah6bcky00083b6m25pchj1k@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            About two weeks earlier, district nurse coordinator Lynn Douglas had sent a letter to all families in anticipation of an outbreak, preemptively outlining the quarantine procedure and highlighting the importance of prevention, including vaccination.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmah6bcky00093b6ml3h0ul3a@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Williston Basin School District #7 plays a very important role in the health and well-being of our students,” Douglas said in an email to CNN. “Having vaccine-preventable diseases circulating within a school would lead to large numbers of school absences and adversely affect the health of our students.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmah6bcky000a3b6mm2vvoozd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “While even a small drop in immunization rates can lead to outbreaks, unvaccinated students are at significant risk of serious illness and complications from measles, which are highly contagious and preventable diseases,” she said. “WBSD #7 prioritizes student safety by taking measures to protect unvaccinated students and prevent the spread of illness to themselves, their families, and others and in order to do this, students must be excluded.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmah6bcky000b3b6m6hqiyk46@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There have been at least 1,018 measles cases reported in the US in 2025, according to a CNN tally using data from state health departments and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;The CDC publishes data on measles cases each Friday, but it has stopped providing details on the specific number of cases in each state, and its national total does not always capture the latest updates from states.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmah6bcky000c3b6m4olgaqsp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The vast majority of these cases – at least 845 – are associated with an outbreak centered in West Texas that has expanded to New Mexico, Oklahoma and possibly Kansas. Texas has reported 709 outbreak-associated cases, New Mexico reported 71 cases, and Oklahoma reported 17 cases – 14 confirmed and three probable – as of Friday. Cases in Kansas, which the state health department says may be linked to the outbreak, have reached 48 as of Wednesday. Experts say these numbers are all a severe undercount because many cases are going unreported.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmah6bcky000d3b6mkzblgqvd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Since measles was declared eliminated in the US in 2000, 2019 is only other year in which there were more than 1,000 cases, driven by large outbreaks in New York City and a nearby suburb. There were 1,274 confirmed measles cases that year, according to the CDC, only about 250 more than have been reported so far in 2025.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmah6bcky000e3b6m10oqwmo7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Nationwide, CDC data shows that 126 people have been hospitalized with measles this year – about 13% of all cases – and there have been three confirmed deaths associated with the large multistate outbreak: two children in Texas and one adult in New Mexico, all of whom were unvaccinated. The vast majority of cases in the US this year have been in people who are unvaccinated; only about 4% of confirmed cases have been in people who had received one or two doses of the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, according to the CDC.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmah6bcky000f3b6mhr9pfdpq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There have been 14 total outbreaks this year, and 30 states have reported at least one case, according to the CDC.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Measles cases continue to accumulate in the United States in what is already the second-worst year since the disease was declared eliminated a quarter-century ago. Now, a recent outbreak in one North Dakota county has led local health officials to quarantine nearly 200 unvaccinated students.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmah6bcky00063b6mosmds0h6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            North Dakota has reported &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.nd.gov/news/nine-cases-measles-williams-county" target="_blank"&gt;nine measles&lt;/a&gt; cases this year, and a recent outbreak among schoolchildren in Williams County in the northwest part of the state has led local health officials to enforce a law that requires unvaccinated students to quarantine for 21 days after exposure to someone who has the virus. The move was taken by local public health officers in the Upper Missouri District Health Unit, and the state health department is assisting with mitigation efforts.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmah6bcky00073b6mgjouu841@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            On Tuesday, families of 188 unvaccinated students in the Williston Basin School District No. 7 received a letter informing them that their children would&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;need to quarantine for three weeks.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmah6bcky00083b6m25pchj1k@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            About two weeks earlier, district nurse coordinator Lynn Douglas had sent a letter to all families in anticipation of an outbreak, preemptively outlining the quarantine procedure and highlighting the importance of prevention, including vaccination.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmah6bcky00093b6ml3h0ul3a@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Williston Basin School District #7 plays a very important role in the health and well-being of our students,” Douglas said in an email to CNN. “Having vaccine-preventable diseases circulating within a school would lead to large numbers of school absences and adversely affect the health of our students.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmah6bcky000a3b6mm2vvoozd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “While even a small drop in immunization rates can lead to outbreaks, unvaccinated students are at significant risk of serious illness and complications from measles, which are highly contagious and preventable diseases,” she said. “WBSD #7 prioritizes student safety by taking measures to protect unvaccinated students and prevent the spread of illness to themselves, their families, and others and in order to do this, students must be excluded.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            There have been at least 1,018 measles cases reported in the US in 2025, according to a CNN tally using data from state health departments and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;The CDC publishes data on measles cases each Friday, but it has stopped providing details on the specific number of cases in each state, and its national total does not always capture the latest updates from states.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmah6bcky000c3b6m4olgaqsp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The vast majority of these cases – at least 845 – are associated with an outbreak centered in West Texas that has expanded to New Mexico, Oklahoma and possibly Kansas. Texas has reported 709 outbreak-associated cases, New Mexico reported 71 cases, and Oklahoma reported 17 cases – 14 confirmed and three probable – as of Friday. Cases in Kansas, which the state health department says may be linked to the outbreak, have reached 48 as of Wednesday. Experts say these numbers are all a severe undercount because many cases are going unreported.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmah6bcky000d3b6mkzblgqvd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Since measles was declared eliminated in the US in 2000, 2019 is only other year in which there were more than 1,000 cases, driven by large outbreaks in New York City and a nearby suburb. There were 1,274 confirmed measles cases that year, according to the CDC, only about 250 more than have been reported so far in 2025.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Nationwide, CDC data shows that 126 people have been hospitalized with measles this year – about 13% of all cases – and there have been three confirmed deaths associated with the large multistate outbreak: two children in Texas and one adult in New Mexico, all of whom were unvaccinated. The vast majority of cases in the US this year have been in people who are unvaccinated; only about 4% of confirmed cases have been in people who had received one or two doses of the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, according to the CDC.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            There have been 14 total outbreaks this year, and 30 states have reported at least one case, according to the CDC.
    &lt;/p&gt;

This approach focuses on tracking AMPARs—key receptors that regulate synaptic strength—over time, illuminating how the brain encodes, strengthens, and stores memories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using advanced fluorescence labeling and high-resolution imaging, the team traced memory-linked synaptic changes in mice during learning tasks, revealing the rules that guide how specific synapses are modified. The findings have major implications for understanding memory disorders like Alzheimer’s and may support the development of targeted therapies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Memory Mapping Breakthrough:&lt;/strong&gt; EPSILON tracks AMPAR protein movement during synaptic plasticity in live brains.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High-Resolution Insight:&lt;/strong&gt; Enables visualization of memory-related synaptic changes over time and space.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Therapeutic Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; Findings could inform new treatments for memory-impairing conditions like dementia.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Harvard&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A team of Harvard researchers have unveiled a way to map the molecular underpinnings of how learning and memories are formed, a groundbreaking new technique expected to offer insights that may pave the way for new treatments for neurological disorders such as dementia.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This technique provides a lens into the synaptic architecture of memory, something previously unattainable in such detail,” said Adam Cohen, professor of chemistry and chemical biology and of physics and senior co-author of the research paper, published in &lt;em&gt;Nature Neuroscience.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Memory resides within a dense network of billions of neurons within the brain. We rely on synaptic plasticity — the strengthening and modulation of connections between these neurons — to facilitate learning and memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109722"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/synapse-memory-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/synapse-memory-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/synapse-memory-neuroscience-770x514.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/synapse-memory-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/synapse-memory-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/synapse-memory-neuroscience-293x196.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/synapse-memory-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/synapse-memory-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/synapse-memory-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/synapse-memory-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/synapse-memory-neuroscience-770x514.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/synapse-memory-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/synapse-memory-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/synapse-memory-neuroscience-293x196.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/synapse-memory-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;As synaptic changes of specific memories came into view with greater clarity, patterns started to reveal rules governing how the brain decides which synapses to make stronger or weaker when storing a memory. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Synapses, or the junctions where neurons communicate, lay the groundwork for every memory we form, from a childhood melody to a loved one’s face to what we ate for breakfast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In their new paper, the team detailed their new technique, dubbed Extracellular Protein Surface Labeling in Neurons (EPSILON), which focuses on mapping the proteins vital for the transmission of signals across synaptic connections in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These specific proteins are called AMPARs and are considered key players in synaptic plasticity, the process that allows the brain to adapt and reorganize itself in response to new information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Utilizing sequential labeling with specialized dyes, EPSILON enabled the researchers to monitor these proteins’ movements at high resolutions. Traditionally, understanding such detailed microscopic phenomena has required more invasive methods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using EPSILON to observe AMPARs’ behavior in neurons represents a significant scientific advance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This work was undertaken by several members of Cohen’s lab, including Harvard Griffin GSAS student Doyeon Kim and postdoctoral scholars Pojeong Park, Xiuyuan Li, J. David Wong-Campos, He Tian, and Eric M. Moult, as well as scientists from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A combination of fluorescent labeling and cutting-edge microscopy allowed the researchers to illuminate synaptic behavior at unprecedented resolution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The technique’s precision was akin to shining a spotlight on some of the brain’s most intricate functions, allowing the team to monitor the synaptic interactions critical for learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior research into synaptic processes often lacked such granularity, making EPSILON’s insights particularly valuable for future explorations into diseases like Alzheimer’s, marked by synaptic dysfunction that results in memory and learning impairment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As synaptic changes of specific memories came into view with greater clarity, patterns started to reveal rules governing how the brain decides which synapses to make stronger or weaker when storing a memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our most important breakthrough is our method that can map the past history of the synthetic plasticity in the living brain,” Kim said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We can look at the history of the synaptic plasticity, studying where and how much of the synaptic potentiation has happened during a defined time window during the memory formation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By mapping the synaptic plasticity over time at multiple time points, we can truly map the dynamics of the synapses,” Kim added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’ll also be able to apply this to different kinds of memories that have different patterns of synaptic plasticity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The technique’s first application has already yielded intriguing results. By applying EPSILON to study mice undergoing contextual fear conditioning — a process that helps animals associate a neutral context with a fear-inducing stimulus — researchers were able to demonstrate a correlation between AMPARs and the expression of the immediate early gene product cFos, a signal that tells us when brain cells are active.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings suggest that AMPAR trafficking is closely linked to enduring memory traces, or engrams, within the brain, where specific neurons become activated following learning experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cohen credits the significant and sometimes unexpected role basic science can play in fueling progress with enabling their study to succeed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The HaloTag technology, which is used to label proteins, was based on a gene discovered in 1997 by a group of scientists in Ireland who were studying a soil bacterium, which had an unusual ability to break down pollutants,” Cohen said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s a generations-long arc from the basic research characterizing the natural world to making discoveries that can make human health better. We really need to support the entire arc to make progress.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking forward, Cohen is eager to see how EPSILON can be further applied to study numerous cognitive phenomena and potentially improve therapeutic strategies targeting memory impairments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’ve already distributed the molecular tool to labs around the world who are now starting to use these tools to explore how synaptic strength is regulated in their favorite question and context,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;This work was partially supported the National Institutes of Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this memory and neurotech research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.harvard.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Yahya Chaudhry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.harvard.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Harvard&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Yahya Chaudhry – Harvard&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-025-01922-5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EPSILON: a method for pulse-chase labeling to probe synaptic AMPAR exocytosis during memory formation&lt;/a&gt;” by Adam Cohen et al. &lt;em&gt;Nature Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EPSILON: a method for pulse-chase labeling to probe synaptic AMPAR exocytosis during memory formation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A tool to map changes in synaptic strength during a defined time window could provide powerful insights into the mechanisms of learning and memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here we developed a technique, Extracellular Protein Surface Labeling in Neurons (EPSILON), to map α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPAR) exocytosis in vivo by sequential pulse-chase labeling of surface AMPARs with membrane-impermeable dyes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This approach yields synaptic-resolution maps of AMPAR exocytosis, a proxy for synaptic potentiation, in genetically targeted neurons during memory formation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In mice undergoing contextual fear conditioning, we investigated the relationship between synapse-level AMPAR exocytosis in CA1 pyramidal neurons and cell-level expression of the immediate early gene product cFos, a frequently used marker of engram neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We observed a strong correlation between AMPAR exocytosis and cFos expression, suggesting a synaptic mechanism for the association of cFos expression with memory engrams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The EPSILON technique is a useful tool for mapping synaptic plasticity and may be extended to investigate trafficking of other transmembrane proteins.&lt;/p&gt;

            To get screened for cervical cancer, patients in the United States may no longer need to put their feet in those awkward stirrups, brace for the uncomfortable speculum or even take the time off from work for an in-person doctor’s appointment.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmah2hurh000y3b6mo4vjvuxb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Soon, they will have the option to collect their own vaginal samples for screening from home – instead of a health care provider doing it for them.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmah2fsdz00063b6m2yvnkvt1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The US Food and Drug Administration has approved the first at-home self-collection device for cervical cancer screening in the United States, called the Teal Wand, according to the women’s health company Teal Health. Last year, the FDA gave the company’s Teal Wand “breakthrough device” status, allowing the agency to review it on a faster timeline.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmah2fsdz00073b6m3ml13k5l@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Teal Wand, which will be provided in Teal Health’s at-home self-collection kit, will require a prescription. Self-collected samples using the Wand are then mailed to a lab to be tested for HPV, the &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/fda-approves-teal-healths-teal-wandthe-first-and-only-at-home-self-collection-device-for-cervical-cancer-screening-introducing-a-comfortable-alternative-to-in-person-screening-302451189.html?tc=eml_cleartime" target="_blank"&gt;company announced&lt;/a&gt; Friday. Most &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/cervical/basic_info/risk_factors.htm?c" target="_blank"&gt;cervical cancers&lt;/a&gt; are caused by human papillomavirus or HPV, and screening for HPV can help identify women who may be at risk of developing cervical cancer.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmah2fsdz00093b6mdezj6ndu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Typically, when screening for cervical cancer, gynecologists collect samples for HPV testing, cervical cytology or both. Cervical cytology, also known as a Pap test or Pap smear, involves examining cervical cells for changes to detect precancerous or cancerous cells. The HPV test checks cells for infection with the high-risk types of HPV that can cause cervical cancer.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmah2fsdz000a3b6mo49xbqaf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Last year, the FDA greenlit similar self-collection cervical cancer screening kits for use in a medical setting, such as at a doctor’s office, an urgent care or even a mobile clinic. At the time, two health care businesses – biotechnology company &lt;a href="https://www.roche.com/media/releases/med-cor-2024-05-15" target="_blank"&gt;Roche&lt;/a&gt; and medical technology firm &lt;a href="https://news.bd.com/2024-05-15-Women-in-U-S-Can-Now-Collect-Their-Own-Sample-for-Cervical-Cancer-Screening" target="_blank"&gt;Becton, Dickson and Company&lt;/a&gt; – said the FDA had approved the use of self-collected samples with their respective HPV tests.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmah2fsdz000b3b6mcm1xxy3g@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The Teal Health at-home kit allows a patient to collect their sample using the Teal Wand, which is then processed on Roche’s HPV test, said Kara Egan, Teal Health’s CEO. But a major difference is that the Teal Wand is approved to be used at home, so patients don’t have to travel to or make time for in-person doctor appointments.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmah2tg1l001g3b6m1d813o01@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            To use Teal Health’s new self-collection kit, “you request a kit at the Teal website, meet with a provider who prescribes the kit, then comfortably and privately collect at home and mail to the lab to process on the Roche Cobas HPV test,” Egan said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmah2xxz5001j3b6m38e7ryld@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The results are then reviewed by a clinician and shared back,” she said. “If the results are positive, a provider will meet with you and refer you to any required follow-up.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmah2fsdz000g3b6m6x8i44fj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Clinical trial &lt;a href="https://www.getteal.com/research/u-s-clinical-study-demonstrates-94-of-women-prefer-at-home-cervical-cancer-screening" target="_blank"&gt;data from Teal Health&lt;/a&gt; has found that self-collection with the Teal Wand has the same accuracy for cervical cancer screening as when a health care provider collects a sample, Egan said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmah2fsdz000h3b6mocsvgmtd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s the same test, same accuracy, but you can comfortably do it from home,” she said. “It gives women more options, and with telehealth, we see more options to get access to care.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmah2fsdz000i3b6mnf6gdcsd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Teal Health plans to begin shipping its at-home self-collection kits in June, Egan said, starting in California before expanding nationwide. A waitlist is available at the &lt;a href="https://www.getteal.com/" target="_blank"&gt;company’s website&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmah2fsdz000l3b6mgor3q4eb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Teal Health has been in talks with health insurance companies about having the self-collection kit covered, Egan added, and for people who don’t have insurance, the cost of the kit will be announced within the next month.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmah2fsdz000m3b6mo9x7tqz0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The American Cancer Society applauded the new FDA approval.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmah3z8he001u3b6mtskb05vo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Despite the benefits of cervical cancer screening, not all eligible are screened regularly,” Dr. William Dahut, the society’s chief scientific officer, said in an email Friday. “Most cervical cancers are found in people who have never had a cervical cancer screening test or who have not had one recently. That’s why today’s Food and Drug Administration’s announcement approving the first at-home test to screen for cervical cancer as an additional cancer screening method for this potentially deadly disease will make a huge impact.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmah2fsdz000p3b6mv9jvabbm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Some of the most important steps women can take to help reduce their risk for cervical cancer, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/cervical-cancer/prevention/?c" target="_blank"&gt;US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;, are to get vaccinated against HPV, avoid smoking, use condoms during sex, have regular screening tests and check with their doctor if their test results are not normal.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmah2fsdz000q3b6mnarhvk8u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s estimated that about 1 in 4 adults are not up to date on cervical cancer screening recommendations, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pcd/issues/2023/23_0071.htm" target="_blank"&gt;according to data from 2021&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmah1yl6w00003b6mac60hzex@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Some women are scared of a traditional pap smear or find the process uncomfortable, as a result they put off this vital test,” Dr. &lt;a href="https://doctors.hackensackmeridianhealth.org/provider/ami-p-vaidya/1318087" target="_blank"&gt;Ami Vaidya&lt;/a&gt;, co-chief of gynecologic oncology at Hackensack University Medical Center’s &lt;a href="https://www.hackensackmeridianhealth.org/en/locations/john-theurer-cancer-center?placement=&amp;amp;target=&amp;amp;keyword=john%20theurer%20cancer%20center&amp;amp;matchtype=e&amp;amp;hgcrm_channel=paid_search&amp;amp;hgcrm_source=google_adwords&amp;amp;hgcrm_agency=client&amp;amp;hgcrm_campaignid=8991&amp;amp;hgcrm_tacticid=12043&amp;amp;hgcrm_trackingsetid=17437&amp;amp;utm_source=Google-Assembly&amp;amp;utm_medium=SEM&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Oncology&amp;amp;gad_source=1&amp;amp;gad_campaignid=22496171240&amp;amp;gbraid=0AAAAAoKg1oYVP8ALlxrTvqyWrt2OjVvB7&amp;amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwz_bABhAGEiwAm-P8YX8eRmK1QYlru8BPXyHBfhyx5ZefApfUH2fja4QwBvG4gBHSbgxkbxoCliIQAvD_BwE&amp;amp;gclsrc=aw.ds" target="_blank"&gt;John Theurer Cancer Center&lt;/a&gt;, said in a news release Friday.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmah42ats00233b6m3hglq2t3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The newly approved at-home screening device “could be an important tool in getting more women regularly screened, especially those that don’t have access to a medical provider,” Vaidya said. “Any type of test that helps detect cervical cancer is a win.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmah2fsdz000r3b6mvud4cuh6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The &lt;a href="https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/cervical-cancer-screening" target="_blank"&gt;US Preventive Services Task Force recommends&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/types/cervical/screening" target="_blank"&gt;screening for cervical cancer&lt;/a&gt; with cervical cytology – also known as a Pap test or Pap smear – every three years for women ages 21 to 29. For women 30 to 65, the USPSTF recommends screening every three years with cervical cytology alone, every five years with high-risk HPV testing alone, or every five years with high-risk HPV testing in combination with cytology.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmah2fsdz000t3b6mrf5vh3ak@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s estimated that about &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hpv/hcp/schedules-recommendations.html" target="_blank"&gt;80% of people will get an HPV infection&lt;/a&gt; in their lifetime. HPV, a &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/immunization/diseases/hpv/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;group of more than 150 viruses&lt;/a&gt;, is spread primarily through sexual contact and includes low-risk strains, which most often cause warts, and high-risk strains, which have been associated with an increased risk of certain cancers, such as cervical, anal, penile and oropharyngeal cancers. In most cases, HPV clears on its own within two years, but &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/sti/about/about-genital-hpv-infection.html" target="_blank"&gt;when the infection does not go away&lt;/a&gt;, health problems like cancer may occur.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmah2fsdz000u3b6mobqy3c6x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Screening for cervical cancer remains important because early cases often may not have signs or symptoms. Advanced cases may cause abnormal vaginal bleeding or unusual discharge. Cervical cancer is treated in many ways, including surgery, chemotherapy and radiation therapy.

   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports there have been &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;1,001 confirmed measles cases&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S. this year. It's the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7414a1.htm" target="_blank"&gt;second-highest case count&lt;/a&gt; in 25 years, topped only by 2019, when more than 1,200 measles cases were detected. The best way to contain measles is two doses of the MMR vaccine (measles, mumps and rubella).&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Here are numbers to help you understand how measles is spreading now.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1,001 cases:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The CDC keeps &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/" target="_blank"&gt;track of confirmed cases&lt;/a&gt; and is updating its count on a weekly basis. On May 2, it reported 935 cases. On Friday, it reported cases have ticked past the thousand mark, to 1,001.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;31 jurisdictions:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Measles cases have been reported in 31 jurisdictions, up from 30 on May 1. Cases have been reported in more than half of U.S. states this year, but not all of those states have full-fledged outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;14 outbreaks&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;An outbreak is defined as 3 or more related cases. So while the total number of cases is important, the number of outbreaks shows where the virus is spreading. The number of outbreaks went from 12 last week to 14 this week.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;By far the largest outbreak is centered in west Texas, where measles has been spreading since January. Reported cases in that outbreak totaled 683 last week and 709 this week.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3 deaths&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Two unvaccinated, otherwise healthy children in Texas have died of the disease. One adult in New Mexico was diagnosed with measles posthumously.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;18 people&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In a population where no one is vaccinated, a single person sick with measles &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/28/nx-s1-5312088/measles-texas-outbreak-contagious-spread" target="_blank"&gt;could go on to infect up to 18 others&lt;/a&gt; on average. By comparison, when 82% of a population is vaccinated, a sick person would infect about 2 to 3 other unvaccinated people on average.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;95% vaccination rate&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;To prevent outbreaks from spreading within a community, there needs to be a vaccination rate of 95%, according to the CDC. Below that threshold, a community's herd immunity can begin to erode. In Gaines County, Texas, the epicenter of the outbreak in that state and where measles is still spreading, the kindergarten vaccination rate against measles is &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/03/07/nx-s1-5312107/how-a-measles-outbreak-overwhelmed-a-small-west-texas-town" target="_blank"&gt;just under 82%&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Herd immunity means that enough members of a community are immune to a contagious disease that it is unlikely to keep spreading because there aren't enough people vulnerable to infection. Herd immunity protects people with weakened immune systems and children who have not yet completed their two-shot series of the measles vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;12 months&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It's an open question how long measles will keep spreading in the U.S. The Texas outbreak, the biggest one, began in January. If any single outbreak continues to result in ongoing transmission for more than 12 months, the U.S. will lose its &lt;a href="https://iris.who.int/bitstream/handle/10665/242035/WER8809_89-98.PDF?sequence=1" target="_blank"&gt;measles "elimination" status&lt;/a&gt;. That's &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/04/08/1243384827/getting-measles-under-control" target="_blank"&gt;a technical term in public health for contagions&lt;/a&gt; that have been well-controlled for 12 months or more. The U.S. has had that status for about 25 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

A new approach surfaced when Alice Ball from the University of Hawaii transformed it into a more soluble form.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-alice-ball-had-a-passion-for-chemistry"&gt;Alice Ball had a passion for chemistry&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0738081X22001663" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Alice was born&lt;/a&gt; on July 24, 1892, in Seattle, Washington, into a family that valued creativity and learning. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her parents’ interests in newspapers and photography exposed her to different fields beyond traditional academics, and encouraged her inquisitive spirit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the University of Washington, she explored pharmaceutical &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/100-year-old-chemistry-rule-bredts-rule-proven-false-updating-textbooks-comes-next/"&gt;chemistry&lt;/a&gt;, a discipline focused on the creation and refinement of medicinal compounds from natural or synthetic sources. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She earned her first degree in 1912 and a second in 1914, demonstrating unusual drive for someone her age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-call-to-tropical-medicine"&gt;The call to tropical medicine&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her quest for deeper knowledge led her to the &lt;a href="https://www.hawaii.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Hawaii&lt;/a&gt;, where she studied the &lt;a href="https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/kava" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;kava plant&lt;/a&gt;, a botanical with bioactive components. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kava was known for its soothing effects in some cultural settings, making it an intriguing subject for a talented researcher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her success in that research drew the attention of &lt;a href="https://daily.jstor.org/the-chemist-whose-work-was-stolen-from-her/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Dr. Harry T. Hollmann&lt;/a&gt;, who asked for her help in addressing the treatment of leprosy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many physicians at the time relied on oils extracted from the chaulmoogra tree&lt;em&gt; (Hydnocarpus wightianus)&lt;/em&gt;, but the preparations were unpredictable and sometimes irritating to patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-crafting-a-new-solution"&gt;Crafting a new solution&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;She discovered that chaulmoogra seeds contain fatty acids that show potential against the bacteria that cause leprosy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By converting these fatty acids into &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/chemistry/ethyl-ester" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;ethyl esters&lt;/a&gt;, she made the preparation easier to inject into patients, which improved their ability to absorb the medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People called it the “Ball Method,” recognizing her pioneering step in making an ancient plant medically relevant. Doctors at Kalihi Hospital in Hawaii reported favorable outcomes in patients who had previously struggled with conventional remedies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-tragic-end-and-near-forgotten-credit"&gt;Tragic end and near-forgotten credit&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In late 1916, she inhaled toxic laboratory fumes while preparing materials for her experiments, an accident that quickly turned fatal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She died on December 31, 1916, at just 24 years old, with little public acknowledgment of her groundbreaking developments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arthur L. Dean, her academic supervisor, continued the project without clearly mentioning her involvement or her scientific process. Dr. Hollmann stepped in and ensured that her valuable contribution would be recognized in official records.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-remembered-legacy-of-alice-ball"&gt;Remembered legacy of Alice Ball&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.hawaii.edu/news/2025/02/28/alice-ball-day-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Hawaii&lt;/a&gt; installed a plaque beside a &lt;a href="https://www.osgf.org/blog/2021/2/10/alice-ball-and-chaulmoogra-oil" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;chaulmoogra tree&lt;/a&gt; to honor her lasting influence. She also received a posthumous award called the Medal of Distinction in 2007, reflecting a gradual correction of history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A small satellite named “&lt;a href="https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2020/11/long-march-6-lofts-ten-argentinian-satellites/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Alice&lt;/a&gt;” was launched in November 2020, as a way of paying tribute to her achievements from beyond Earth’s boundaries. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That modern gesture reminded many in the scientific community to revisit her role in early Hansen’s disease treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-broader-impact"&gt;A broader impact&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once antibiotics became widely available in the 1940s, the “Ball Method” fell out of common use. Yet historians note that her approach offered one of the first genuine options for people facing severe nerve damage and social stigma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her achievement stands among the work of other African American pioneers in science, an often underrecognized group. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While many faced discrimination, individuals like NASA mathematician &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/image-article/melba-roy-mouton-mathematician/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Melba Roy Mouton&lt;/a&gt; proved that diverse expertise can break through restrictive barriers, even in top research agencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-alice-ball-as-an-inspiration"&gt;Alice Ball as an inspiration&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Modern experts see her technique as a remarkable blend of traditional botanical knowledge and chemical resourcefulness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This story sparks fresh discussions on the relevance of natural products in managing diseases worldwide, especially in light of the current trend in increasing &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2954574/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;antibiotic resistance&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her path also turns the spotlight on the importance of crediting researchers, especially when they are marginalized by social structures. In her short life, she managed to merge academic &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/nematodes-use-chemistry-to-survive-and-communicate/"&gt;chemistry&lt;/a&gt; and pressing medical priorities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ongoing-lessons"&gt;Ongoing lessons&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The desire to help others propelled Alice Ball, even though her name was overshadowed for a time by more prominent figures. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People study her story to appreciate how determination and focus can reshape the way we view medical challenges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though chaulmoogra oil is less common now, her idea of transforming thick extracts into more workable solutions still guides pharmaceutical research. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Efforts to refine plant-derived treatments often mirror her resourceful approach that involved integrating new technology with older remedies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-looking-ahead"&gt;Looking ahead&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ball’s journey reminds us that life can be brief, but well-targeted &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/dark-oxygen-discovery-deep-ocean-rocks-upends-centuries-of-scientific-beliefs/"&gt;scientific&lt;/a&gt; contributions can echo for decades. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her ability to solve a critical challenge illustrates how observation, laboratory methods, and curiosity can make a difference in healthcare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who appreciate her contributions argue that she belongs among the prominent names in medical history, alongside other innovators who expanded treatment options. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Historians agree that her background and perseverance enrich the broader narrative of global scientific progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More information about Alice Ball’s contribution is published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0738081X22001663" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Clinics in Dermatology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt;

capital.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Bronx has the &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14683527/alzheimers-rises-25th-years-people-diagnosed.html"&gt;highest rate of Alzheimer's disease&lt;/a&gt; in the nation, tied with Baltimore and Miami.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt; One in six adults over 65 in the &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/new_york/index.html" id="mol-b840bab0-2b60-11f0-992a-73c158b7b47f" class=""&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt; borough are diagnosed with Alzheimer's, compared to around one in 10 nationally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers believe the Bronx became an Alzheimer's hotspot due to its long history of poverty rates well above the national average and a large minority population that has historically been more likely to be struck by the disease.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The area also has New York City's highest rate of food insecurity, leading residents to turn to ultraprocessed foods shown to induce harmful inflammation in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Healthcare providers in the Bronx have now launched a four-week pilot program to emulate Ikaria, Greece, a small island in the Aegean Sea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The Bronx, pictured here, has the highest Alzheimer's rate in the country, tied with Baltimore and Miami&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The island of 8,300 is one of the world's five Blue Zones, areas where residents regularly live well into their 80s, 90s and even 100. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One of three Ikarians, for example, live past age 90.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One man named &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/news/article-12320521/Greek-man-cheats-death-45-years-living-blue-zone.html"&gt;Stamatis Moraitis&lt;/a&gt;, who was born on Ikaria but moved to the US for work, was given a death sentence lung cancer diagnosis in 1976 and just nine months to live. After moving back home to Ikaria, he survived another 45 years until age 98.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Residents of the Bronx, in comparison, tend to live to 81, still more than the national average but the lowest out of all five New York City boroughs. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Bronx program, dubbed the 'Blue Zones Challenge,' has recruited 100 Bronx residents of varying ages, races and backgrounds to follow in the footsteps of Ikarians. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The only enrollment requirement was living in the Bronx, and participants were encouraged to eat more foods aligned with the Mediterranean diet like salmon and arugula. They then were tasked with journaling their habits for four weeks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The experts running the program told DailyMail.com the goal isn't to completely reverse the risk of Alzheimer's in just a month. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Instead, they hope it will help residents adopt long-term healthy habits shown to combat the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Edward Cisek, chief research, grants and evaluation officer at CaringKind, one of the two organizations in charge of the Blue Zones Challenge, told this website: 'It's not expected huge changes are going to happen in four weeks. It's to set residents up for success.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The program will run through May 27, 2025, and the team will unveil the findings next month. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team is looking to find if the majority of the 100 participants are able to experience notable changes like losing weight, having more energy or improvements in chronic conditions like diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They hope the program may inspire larger initiatives reaching the rest of New York City. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nearly 7million Americans over age 65 have Alzheimer's disease, the most common form of dementia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the Alzheimer's Association, New York state has the third-highest percentage of over-65s with Alzheimer's disease at nearly 13  percent, &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-12542001/America-Maryland-Alzheimers-disease.html"&gt;trailing only behind Washington DC and Maryland&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This adds up to roughly 427,000. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;'Blue Zones' are places lauded as longevity hotspots with low rates of chronic diseases and significant amounts of people living well into their 90s and beyond&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the Bronx, 17 percent of adults over 65 - about 35,700 - have been diagnosed with Alzheimer's. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The national rate is 11 percent.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In a 2023 report, Alzheimer's Association researchers said the higher rates could be due to the demographics in the Bronx. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The latest Census data shows 57 percent of residents are Hispanic and 28 percent are Black, more than any other New York county. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Both of these groups have the highest rates of Alzheimer's disease nationally. The Alzheimer's Association reports Black Americans over 65 are more than twice as likely as their white peers to be struck by the condition, and Hispanics are 1.5 times more likely. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Recent research shows this could be due to Black and Hispanic populations having higher rates of cardiovascular conditions that affect the blood vessels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Heart disease can damage blood vessels and reduce the amount of blood that flows to the brain. Over time, this kills off brain tissues and cells, leading to dementia, particularly vascular dementia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Diabetes, which is twice as common in Black adults, also weakens blood vessels in the brain and leads to inflammation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Socioeconomic status may also be a factor in the Bronx's wave of Alzheimer's disease.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Bronx is one of America's most impoverished urban counties and the poorest in New York state, with 28 percent of residents living below the poverty line. Nationwide, 11 percent of Americans live in poverty. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The median household income in the Bronx in 2022 was $47,260, about 41 percent less than $80,610 nationally. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The researchers behind the Blue Zones Challenge in the Bronx are aiming to emulate the habits of Ikaria, Greece (pictured here), where rates of dementia are significantly lower&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These factors are more likely to lead residents to turn toward cheap, ultraprocessed foods loaded with saturated fats, sugars and artificial additives. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These foods have been shown to increase inflammation and oxidative stress, an imbalance between disease-fighting antioxidants and harmful free radicals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Free radicals attack cell DNA and promote the growth of toxic amyloid-beta and tau proteins shown to cause Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In Ikaria, meanwhile, residents over age 85 have a one in 10 chance of developing Alzheimer's disease. That's the same risk for Americans 20 years younger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;By the time the average US adult reaches 85, they are three times more likely to develop the disease than an 85-year-old in Ikaria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ikaria also has about half America's rate of heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is largely because Ikarians traditionally follow the Mediterranean diet, which has been hailed as the healthiest eating plan in the world. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The diet emphasizes vegetables, dark leafy greens, olive oil, avocadoes, whole grains and nuts and seeds. These foods are rich in nutrients like omega-3 fatty acids, which have been shown to reduce levels of harmful inflammation and protect neurons from damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Research in the &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23481688/#:~:text=Omega%2D3%20fatty%20acids%20enhance,microglia%20and%20decrease%20inflammatory%20markers"&gt;Journal of Alzheimer's Disease&lt;/a&gt; also suggested omega-3s reduce levels of amyloid-beta and tau proteins. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ikaria's long life expectancy may also be due to most people living a more relaxed lifestyle. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To shift the Bronx's health closer toward Ikaria, the Blue Zones Challenge emphasizes lifestyle changes like choosing foods more closely aligned with the Mediterranean diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Eleonora Tornatore-Mikesh, president and CEO of CaringKind, points toward a &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39096926/"&gt;2024 Lancet study&lt;/a&gt; that round addressing 14 lifestyle factors lowered the risk of dementia by about 40 percent. These included addressing diet, obesity, diabetes and physical inactivity. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Anderson Torres, who is helping run the Blue Zones Challenge, is also participating in the program. He said he has lost weight and has had fewer blood sugar spikes related to his type 2 diabetes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She told DailyMail.com that while certain factors like genetic predisposition can't easily be reversed, the Blue Zones Challenge focuses on factors that are within the average person's grasp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: 'This is the portion you can control: lifestyle. We can't fix all things, but we know lifestyle changes can impact good healthcare.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The only requirement to sign up for the challenge was being a resident from the Bronx. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Anderson Torres, CEO of Bronx-based elderly care organization RAIN Total Care who is also a participant in the challenge, told DailyMail.com because Alzheimer's is so prevalent in the area that the team didn't need to specifically seek out a particular group of people for this initial study. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'By being from the Bronx, we are all at risk,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The 100 participants enrolled in the study were told to download a journaling app and keep track of everything they ate, as well as habits like exercising. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They weren't given specific instructions but were instead told to be more intentional with their habits. For example, instead of choosing fried chicken, opt for grilled. Participants are also encouraged to add more dark, leafy greens and healthy fats to their meals and suggest their peers try the same. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'These lifestyle changes work best when you do them with other people,' Dr Cisek said.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Tornatore-Mikesh told this website the team chose four weeks because research suggests that's how long it takes to create a habit. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The hope, she said, is to lay the groundwork for participants to make longer-term changes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Torres, who treats many Bronx-based patients with Alzheimer's, is participating in the challenge himself. He said that while he has just under three weeks left, small habits like weighing himself every day have caused him to lose weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And as a type 2 diabetic, he has noticed fewer blood sugar spikes since swapping out fried foods for healthier choices like arugula and lean meats.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If the other 99 participants experience similar improvements and can start forming similar habits, the researchers plan to expand the efforts to the rest of New York City.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Tornatore-Mikesh said: 'I believe this is just the beginning. I want to go for a full Blue Zone.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Fri, 09 May 2025 16:03:51 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>北卡罗来纳州妈妈加入突破性的癌症研究，以保护她的女儿- WRAL.com | NC mom joins groundbreaking cancer study to protect her daughters - WRAL.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikgFBVV95cUxPZkdrRHFSUW9FbnZ5MTQ2VkRQcno4cVBzdE5lYzUxdjBXZHl2RkllSXRVdUZrNDRRMzdfRFRlYWtIT3BYRGFKc2g0WktiaE9haWd3UXZqUV9tNlpYU09PTFoyOFY2azZ0RmM1dHhSSmRtZTVxVGE2V3d3U2FDOE0yVEVRMTVRSjNuaXpZcFAwcEhlUQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body"&gt;
					
						&lt;p&gt;This Mother’s Day, Samantha McCoy isn’t just asking for
flowers. She’s asking for progress. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The Johnston County mom is one of the North Carolinians enrolled
in the groundbreaking &lt;a href="https://voices.cancer.org/"&gt;VOICES of Black Women
Study&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
								&lt;p class="exco-player" feature="vendor.exco.player" id="d8af3f9c-ad37-4890-8ed5-bb0ce702acdf"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“I’ve always wanted to be a part of anything that’s going to
help, especially my children,” McCoy said. “I have daughters. Anything that is
going to hopefully make an advancement, so they don’t have to hear the words,
‘You have cancer.’”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The &lt;i&gt;VOICES&lt;/i&gt; study by the American Cancer Society (ACS)
aims to uncover why Black women are more likely to die from cancer and develop
more aggressive forms of the disease. It is the largest study of its kind in U.S. history.
The plan is to follow 100,000 women between 25-55 years old with no prior
cancer history for the next 40 years.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“Black women have not had an opportunity in medical science
to share their stories and share their experiences,” shared cancer
epidemiologist Lauren McCullough. “We really wanted to hear their voices.” &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;McCullough, co-principal investigator of the study, said the
name &lt;i&gt;VOICES&lt;/i&gt; holds multiple meanings.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“In the African American community, I think our voices have
always been the way we’ve passed down information. Whether it’s through song or
storytelling, it really is sort of integral to our culture,” said McCullough.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
								&lt;p class="opscoad-Mobile_In_Content" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/mother-daughter-cancer-study-black-women-may-2025"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p class="opscoad-article_in_read" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/mother-daughter-cancer-study-black-women-may-2025/"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Participants are asked to complete two 30-minute
questionnaires twice each year. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The survey asks women about a range of topics – ranging from
doctor visits and diagnoses, to income, family dynamics and social habits.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“We really felt having a mixed methods approach where we
have both the hard numbers and data, paralleled with women’s open-ended
responses to questions, would be the best way to really understand what the
data is showing us,” said McCullough.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The study also asks women about feelings of stress and
anxiety. Researchers note emotional health has been strongly linked to physical
wellbeing. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“On the airplane, they always say if the oxygen mask comes
down you have to put yours on first before you help the other person,” said
McCoy. “As women, we have to take care of ourselves first so we can help our
family members, and a lot of us don’t do that.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
								&lt;p class="opscoad-Mobile_In_Content" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/mother-daughter-cancer-study-black-women-may-2025"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p class="opscoad-article_in_read" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/mother-daughter-cancer-study-black-women-may-2025/"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;McCullough explained the questions seek to uncover under-researched
links between environmental and social determinants of health, and cancer incidences
and outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“What sets &lt;i&gt;VOICES&lt;/i&gt; apart, I think, from previous studies
is that we are attuned to some of those social and structural barriers,” said
McCullough. “We’re asking questions that may be uncomfortable. We’re asking
about experiences with racism and discrimination. We’re asking about
generational wealth.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;ACS data shows just under 3,500 women have enrolled in the
study nationwide, fewer than 200 of them from North Carolina. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://studyportal.cancer.org/enroll/voices"&gt;Black
women from all fifty states and Washington D.C. are encouraged to enroll online.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;McCoy hopes sharing her story will inspire other moms to
join the cause and fuel efforts to protect children like her three daughters, Carolyn, Deion and Madison. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
								&lt;p id="nativo-0001"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p id="nativo-0002"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p id="nativo-0003"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“It’s super easy. If you’re on social media, you’ve got time
to do this,” said McCoy. “Let’s do the research, let’s put the time and effort
into it, let’s be part of the study and let’s find a cure.”&lt;/p&gt;

This detailed map, created using cryo-electron microscopy, reveals how sweeteners bind to a key receptor component, TAS1R2, which resembles a Venus flytrap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The discovery could enable the development of new molecules that better regulate or reduce sugar cravings, potentially helping combat obesity and diabetes. Unlike current artificial sweeteners, which were discovered by chance and often fail to curb sugar desire, this structural breakthrough offers a rational path to designing better alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Structural Breakthrough:&lt;/strong&gt; First high-resolution map (2.8 angstroms) of the human sweet taste receptor.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sweet Binding Pocket:&lt;/strong&gt; Identifies how molecules like sucralose and aspartame bind to trigger sweetness.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Potential Applications:&lt;/strong&gt; May lead to better sugar substitutes and insights into metabolic health.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Zuckerman Institute&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our attraction to sugar has grown to an unhealthy level. The average person in the United States now consumes more than 100 pounds of the sweet stuff every year, up from 18 pounds in 1800.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With new research published May 7, in &lt;em&gt;Cell,&lt;/em&gt; Columbia University scientists have taken a major step toward dealing with this public health crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109714"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/sweet-receptor-mapped-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/sweet-receptor-mapped-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/sweet-receptor-mapped-neuroscience-770x514.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/sweet-receptor-mapped-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/sweet-receptor-mapped-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/sweet-receptor-mapped-neuroscience-293x196.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/sweet-receptor-mapped-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/sweet-receptor-mapped-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a woman eating a sugar cube." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/sweet-receptor-mapped-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/sweet-receptor-mapped-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/sweet-receptor-mapped-neuroscience-770x514.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/sweet-receptor-mapped-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/sweet-receptor-mapped-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/sweet-receptor-mapped-neuroscience-293x196.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/sweet-receptor-mapped-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The new work maps the structure of the human sweet taste receptor in unprecedented detail, to a resolution as good as 2.8 angstroms. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the first time, they have mapped the 3-D structure of the human sweet taste receptor, the molecular machine that allows us to taste sweet things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This could lead to the discovery of new regulators of the receptor that would significantly alter our attraction to and appetite for sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The leading role that sugar plays in obesity cannot be overlooked,” said study co-first author Juen Zhang, PhD, a postdoctoral fellow in the lab of Charles Zuker, PhD, at Columbia’s Zuckerman Institute and at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The artificial sweeteners that we use today to replace sugar just don’t meaningfully change our desire for sugar. Now that we know what the receptor looks like, we might be able to design something better.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sweet receptors on our tongue can detect a large number of different chemicals that taste sweet, from common table sugar (also known as sucrose) to antimicrobial enzymes in chicken eggs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike other receptors—for bitter, sour, or other tastes—our sweet sensors evolved to not be very sensitive. This helps us focus on sugar-rich foods for energy, and drives a need for a lot of sweets to satisfy our sweet tooth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Determining the structure of the human sweet receptor is key to comprehending how it helps us detect sweet taste, fundamentally advancing our understanding of taste perception.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 20 years ago, Dr. Zuker and his colleagues uncovered the genes behind the mammalian sweet taste receptor. This landmark work revealed its chemical formula, but until now no one knew its precise shape, much like how knowing a cake’s recipe will not tell you what the pastry will look like when finished.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without this knowledge, understanding the molecular basis of sweet detection to rationally design ways to regulate the function of this essential receptor has been a challenge, said Dr. Zuker, in whose laboratory this new work was also carried out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; “All the artificial sweeteners that we use today were either discovered by accident or based on known sweet-tasting molecules,” said study co-author Brian Wang, a research assistant in the Zuker lab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As a result, most artificial sweeteners have drawbacks.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new work maps the structure of the human sweet taste receptor in unprecedented detail, to a resolution as good as 2.8 angstroms. In comparison, the smallest atom, hydrogen, is slightly more than 1 angstrom wide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It took the researchers innovative approaches and about three years to map the human sweet taste receptor’s structure, in large part because it proved difficult to grow this protein on cells in lab dishes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Just getting the purified protein we needed to map the structure took more than 150 different preparations over the course of three years,” said study co-first author Zhengyuan Lu, a doctoral student at the Zuker lab. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientists then used cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to analyze the human sweet taste receptor. This technique fires beams of electrons at molecules that have been frozen in solution, helping researchers capture snapshots of those molecules from different perspectives, from which they can reconstruct their three-dimensional structures at the atomic level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of particular importance, cryo-EM revealed the receptor’s binding pocket: the cavity where sweet things stick and trigger the set of reactions that drive our strong appetite for sweets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Defining the binding pocket of this receptor very accurately is absolutely vital to understanding its function,” said study co-author Anthony Fitzpatrick, PhD, a principal investigator at Columbia’s Zuckerman Institute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By knowing its exact shape, we can see why sweeteners attach to it, and how to make or find better molecules that activate the receptor or regulate its function,” added Dr. Fitzpatrick, who is also an assistant professor of biochemistry and molecular biophysics at Columbia’s Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The human sweet taste receptor consists of two main halves. One of these, named TAS1R2, possesses the binding pocket, a component resembling a Venus flytrap. Knowing the structure of this part may also help us understand why people differ in how sensitive they are to sweets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientists mapped the receptor’s structure as it bound to two of the most commonly used artificial sweeteners, aspartame and sucralose. These are, respectively, 200 and 600 times sweeter than sucrose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers then systematically altered tiny parts of the receptor. This helped shed light on the role each of these parts play in binding onto the sweeteners, said study co-author Ruihuan Yu, a doctoral student at the Zuker lab. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re trying to move our understanding of science forward to be able to help people,” said study co-author Andrew Chang, a research technician at the Fitzpatrick lab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the human sweet taste receptor is found mostly on taste buds in the mouth, Dr. Zhang noted it is also scattered throughout the body, where it may play a role in the function of organs such as the pancreas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As such, the new map of this receptor’s structure might support research investigating our metabolism, as well as in disorders such as diabetes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#19777c6e6a596370377a76756c747b7078377c7d6c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Zuckerman Communications&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://zi.columbia.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Zuckerman Institute&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Zuckerman Communications – Zuckerman Institute&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2025.04.021" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;The Structure of Human Sweetness&lt;/a&gt;” by Andrew Chang et al. &lt;em&gt;Cell&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Structure of Human Sweetness&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In humans, the detection and ultimately the perception of sweetness begin in the oral cavity, where taste receptor cells (TRCs) dedicated to sweet-sensing interact with sugars, artificial sweeteners, and other sweet-tasting chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Human sweet TRCs express on their cell surface a sweet receptor that initiates the cascade of signaling events responsible for our strong attraction to sweet stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, we describe the cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of the human sweet receptor bound to two of the most widely used artificial sweeteners—sucralose and aspartame.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our results reveal the structural basis for sweet detection, provide insights into how a single receptor mediates all our responses to such a wide range of sweet-tasting compounds, and open up unique possibilities for designing a generation of taste modulators informed by the structure of the human receptor.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Fri, 09 May 2025 15:34:08 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMieEFVX3lxTE1oakdRdDltTlVILUt5QTlsQlRBcnRZLWd3ZG9NUGU4NmtoMm1BbUpxb1VGaG9PeDJ1YTdVM05YbTJzc3oyMWR1WHBfak5KcllBcFV0M1I2TGd1cTVQMmR1cF9FaWl6clNXZDRXNUlURDlHOEdMdjBPYQ</guid></item><item><title>8位意大利物理学家制作了完美的cacio e pepe吗？我测试了他们的实验以找出答案- CNN | Did 8 Italian physicists make the perfect cacio e pepe?

            Few things are as impressive to dinner party guests as a perfectly executed à la minute pasta dish.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaf8loc003l3b6mzlcoo0vo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As a Roman-born foodie, I would argue that cacio e pepe, a Roman pasta recipe that is as delicious and simple as it is finicky, is a bold menu choice for the novice cook.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d700053b6m1gqecjsh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The name says it all: pasta, cacio (cheese) and pepe (pepper). That’s it. That’s the recipe.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d700063b6m58o4lg1b@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There is no margin for error with just pasta, Pecorino Romano cheese, and black pepper,” Michele Casadei Massari, CEO and executive chef of Lucciola Italian Restaurant in Manhattan, told CNN via email.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d700073b6moc7ae82r@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The main challenge lies in achieving a stable emulsion: If the cheese is overheated or the starch-water balance is wrong, the sauce will separate,” Massari said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d700083b6maqetauzk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When that happens, the pecorino forms a gloopy cheesy mess, sticking to everything but the noodles — sad and naked.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d700093b6mru4lvpwx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            So, how can one reliably avoid unpleasant dinnertime disasters? Either by practicing a lot — and inevitably making mistakes in the process, as I have — or by using science to guide the way.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d7000a3b6mc6ow50ts@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Eight Italian physicists collaborated to crack the code of a foolproof cacio e pepe recipe, studying the properties of cheese, starch and water at different temperatures to learn how to replicate a flawless dish every time.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            The study was published April 29 in the journal &lt;a href="https://pubs.aip.org/aip/pof/article/37/4/044122/3345324/Phase-behavior-of-Cacio-e-Pepe-sauce" target="_blank"&gt;Physics of Fluids&lt;/a&gt;.

            The magic trick? Adding a precise amount of cornstarch relative to the overall quantity of cheese used, to keep the dreaded clumps at bay.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d7000d3b6mhzek6xja@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When I first heard about the method, the Roman cuisine purist in me was skeptical.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d7000e3b6mor1cddf4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Too many times, I’ve read cheat sheets for the perfect carbonara dish in which the solution to perfect, non-scrambled-egg sauce is to add cream (please, do not do this). In the interest of objectivity, I had to test the recipe myself and talk to these fellow Italians behind the research.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  



    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d7000f3b6malreri8u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In a conversation in Italian, three of the study authors shared that the research came from their frustration for one too many cacio e pepe dishes gone wrong. Thanks to the group’s familiarity with the concept of “liquid-liquid phase separation,” they knew how to investigate the problem scientifically.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d7000g3b6mb0y3pg55@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “At some point, the eight of us were all at the Max Planck Institute in Dresden (Germany), some as PhD students, some as postdocs,” said study coauthor Daniel Maria Busiello, a statistical physicist at Italy’s University of Padova. At that time, “something we’d often do was cooking Italian recipes, not just for Italians, but for others as well.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d7000h3b6m5lp3tu36@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Making big batches of cacio e pepe to feed other hungry scientists turned out to be a near-impossible feat. “There were problems with controlling the temperature of the sauce and of the noodles, causing these clumps,” Busiello said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d7000i3b6mvpf28x6m@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I remember a time the dish came out inedible. Something clicked then,” said study coauthor Ivan Di Terlizzi, one of the group’s top cooks, and a statistical physicist at the Max Planck Institute for the Physics of Complex Systems in Dresden.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d7000j3b6mwtdn6m82@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Di Terlizzi approached fellow researcher Giacomo Bartolucci, now a biophysicist at the University of Barcelona in Spain, with a working theory about possible commonalities between the behavior of cacio e pepe sauce and that of aqueous solutions of proteins inside cells. Bartolucci had focused on phase separation and the aggregation of proteins for his doctoral research.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d7000k3b6mqo8k8xbq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The scientists set out to understand whether the cheese and water in this recipe could be scientifically described as “a system that undergoes phase separation at high temperatures,” in Busiello’s words.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d7000l3b6m4mfatv8r@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We had a theoretical framework and a practical problem,” Busiello added.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d7000m3b6mhrcdq0q0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Innovating on traditional Italian recipes, even on solid scientific grounds, is a high-risk endeavor. Given the touchy subject, the study authors are of course all Italians, by design.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d7000n3b6mn9cb1xho@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “If we have to piss off a bunch of people, at least let it be eight Italians who did it,” Di Terlizzi said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d7000o3b6m5dp67fdm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            To investigate the behavior of cacio e pepe sauce under heat, the researchers conducted experiments recreating the cooking process in a controlled setup.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d7000p3b6mdctlpk25@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We prepared small batches of sauce using precise amounts of cheese, starch, and water, and gradually heated them using a sous vide device to carefully control the temperature,” Di Terlizzi explained.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d7000q3b6mkvrder94@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “At each stage, we took a small sample of the sauce, placed it in a petri dish and photographed it from above to observe how clumps formed. This allowed us to track how changes in temperature and ingredients affected the smoothness of the sauce.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d7000r3b6m5slp1y01@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The researchers found that the concentration of starch in the sauce is the key factor influencing its stability. If the proportion of starch falls below 1% of the total cheese weight, the cheese will enter what the authors call the “Mozzarella phase” — in which clumps are inescapable and the dish is ruined — at lower temperatures. A 2% to 3% starch-to-cheese ratio yields the best results.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d7000s3b6mqeyk94ts@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In the recipe for two published in the study, the researchers used 5 grams (0.18 ounce) of cornstarch or potato starch dissolved in water, heated up gently to form a gel, then cooled down with more water before being blended with 200 grams (7 ounces) of pecorino cheese.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d7000t3b6muahwfq8o@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Sodium citrate, a common additive used to make smooth mac and cheese, also worked well in their recipe, although according to Di Terlizzi it lent the dish a slightly “cheese single” aftertaste.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d7000u3b6msp8avli0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The scientifically engineered pecorino cream can withstand temperature changes better than the classic cheese-starchy water mixture made with pasta cooking water and can even be reheated.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d7000v3b6mg2tw9qgs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Temperature is in fact another key factor that can make or break the sauce, which has to do with how the proteins in the cheese behave when heated.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d7000w3b6mha7j8xmp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The sauce is stable if created at low temperatures and the starch bonded with the proteins. If, after that happens, you expose the sauce to high temperatures, proteins can no longer interact,” Di Terlizzi said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d7000x3b6mzof6u6et@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If the emulsion of cheese and starch happens at high temperatures though, “there’s no guarantee that proteins will bond with other proteins, which causes the aggregation, before they bond with the starch.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d7000y3b6mi87n4xdq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The scientifically optimized recipe will yield solid results for large batches of pasta, as the stable sauce will give you more flexibility dealing with a large volume of piping hot noodles, cooling down more slowly than a smaller batch of pasta would.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d7000z3b6mzt040x4j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When trying the scientifically optimized recipe, don’t throw away all the pasta cooking water! You’ll still need some of it in the final mixing of all ingredients (the “mantecatura” in Italian). Just be careful to let it cool down slightly.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d700103b6mf9l0w8gu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When I tested the recipe, the instructions felt straightforward, and the process was quick, though it required a few more steps than what I’m used to (such as forming the starch gel on the stove).
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d700113b6mbx3b73af@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It was frankly odd to work with a pecorino cream that felt so smooth — it almost reminded me of a jarred sauce. Nothing changes as far as the pepper goes. Just crack as much of it as you’d like and toast it in a pan to release its aroma.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d700123b6m7h2ja6tr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            My husband and I enjoyed the dish. It tasted great, and dealing with a pecorino cream that needs much less babying at the stove and allows for a much less time-sensitive mantecatura is a definite plus. Also, who doesn’t love the idea of a cacio e pepe party for a crowd?
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d700133b6mw0e27aa8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            My only qualm is that knowing there was starch added in the sauce, my perception of the dish’s mouthfeel was definitely skewed, but that wasn’t the case for my husband.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d700143b6m6fkh744e@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As a proud Roman home cook, my pursuit of a perfect classic cacio e pepe will be a life-long experiment, but the scientifically optimized recipe exceeded my expectations and would be a good initiation for home cooks who have been put off by the dish’s treachery thus far.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d700153b6m1pykxwt3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But what exactly makes the traditional way of making this dish, by emulsifying the cheese with pasta cooking water, so challenging?
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d700163b6my3e7k6t1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s practically impossible to know just how much starch is naturally present in the pasta cooking water, so the success of the crucial emulsion is more of a gamble, but there are tricks to mitigate catastrophe.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d700173b6m76rvfzf5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            One, coming from Massari, is to use less water to boil the pasta.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d700183b6mhslknx8h@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “For cacio e pepe, I recommend using about 6 to 8 cups of water for 7 ounces of pasta, which translates to a ratio closer to 1 part pasta to 6–7 parts water by weight — significantly less than in traditional pasta cooking,” the chef said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d700193b6ml6n5dtcn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A classic rule of thumb for cooking pasta, according to Massari, is to use about 1 quart of water for every 3½ ounces of pasta, and 2 teaspoons of salt.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d7001a3b6mee7hp9h1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The researchers, who used an arbitrary 10-to-1 ratio of water to pasta in their experiments, also said that reducing that volume of water by two-thirds generally concentrated the natural pasta starch to a safe degree.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d8001b3b6m5xcpr6o5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Massari also recommends emulsifying the cheese and pasta water below 60 degrees Celsius (140 degrees Fahrenheit), which is in line with the new study’s findings on temperature.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d8001c3b6m0m7p0xra@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I first create a cold cheese cream, using finely grated Pecorino and a small amount of the pasta’s starchy cooking water, blending until smooth. Then, I toss the pasta off the heat with the cream and freshly cracked black pepper, adding extra water to adjust the texture,” Massari said. “The result should be a silky, cohesive sauce that clings beautifully to every strand of pasta, not a broken or heavy coating.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d8001d3b6m7ppm32hm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The natural starch from properly handled pasta is more than sufficient to achieve a creamy, stable, and authentic sauce without compromising the nutritional integrity of the dish,” Massari added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d8001e3b6muk2hhk1s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Another chef’s trick to buy you some time while attempting the recipe the traditional way is “pasta regeneration” — which involves partially cooking the pasta for about 70% of its time, immediately shocking it in ice water to stop gelatinization and finishing it later before serving.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d8001f3b6m40ky176q@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “This method preserves al dente texture while enhancing the final release of surface starch, which is crucial for stabilizing delicate emulsions,” Massari explained.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d8001g3b6my07yo0ng@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The researchers said their scientifically optimized recipe has surged to meme status, online and offline.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d8001h3b6mbxdj6vfw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Some social media users were hypercritical about the recipe we proposed, despite it being used before in prestigious restaurants,” Di Terlizzi told CNN. “Overall, I can say that excitement prevailed, especially in the scientific community,” he added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d8001i3b6mbsdtb5e2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We won’t say we invented the definitive method,” Di Terlizzi said, but this method will save you from ruining good, expensive and hard-to-source pecorino cheese.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d8001j3b6m2hujmvjh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For the researchers, that’s personal: “We’re in Germany. We have that shipped to us all the way from Italy. We can’t just buy it at the store every day,” Di Terlizzi said. “So, when the dish turns out badly, that bothers us.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d8001k3b6mhj0c9hwe@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A big pasta dinner celebrated the publication of the paper, with the researchers preparing at least 4 pounds of pasta for a crowd.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d8001l3b6mcl1e0pnn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We were on pins and needles because our diners all knew about the experiment — but it worked perfectly,” Busiello said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d8001m3b6meeorbvkm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Bartolucci added, “That was our trial by fire.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            This is CNN’s summary of the recipe presented in the study. You can find Pecorino Romano DOP — which stands for Protected Designation of Origin, a certification of a product’s origin and quality assigned by the Italian government and the European Union — and tonnarelli pasta at Italian grocers and online specialty stores.

            • 300 grams (10.6 ounces) pasta, preferably tonnarelli (spaghetti or rigatoni also work well)
    &lt;/p&gt;

            1. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d8001w3b6mnddrfz3h@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            2. While the water comes to a boil, add peppercorns in a single layer to a dry pan over medium-low heat. Toast until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove pepper from heat immediately.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d8001x3b6mxv34fw6l@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            3. Make the starch gel. In a small saucepan, dissolve the cornstarch by whisking it into 50 grams (3 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon) cold water. Heat the mixture gently over low heat until it thickens and turns nearly clear. Remove the starch gel from heat and whisk in 100 grams (6 ¾ tablespoons) water to cool. The mixture will return to a liquid state.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d8001y3b6mq0j3gq23@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            4. Make the pecorino cream. Add the starchy water, grated cheese and peppercorns&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;to the bowl of a food processor and pulse to combine until a smooth cream forms.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaf5ypz003j3b6meiw27a7t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            5. Cook the pasta according to the package directions until al dente, reserving 237 milliliters (1 cup) of pasta water before draining. Drain the pasta and let cool for up to 1 minute.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d800203b6my6yio35j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            6. Mix the pasta with the sauce, ensuring even coating, and adjust the consistency by gradually adding pasta water as needed. Keep the sauce slightly runny as it tends to thicken as it cools. If needed, the dish can withstand gentle reheating (up to 80 or 90 C, 176 to 194 F) to reach serving temperature.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            7. Sprinkle with additional grated cheese and pepper and serve immediately.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “I recommend using high-quality spaghettoni pasta made from durum wheat semolina, bronze-extruded and slow-dried at low temperatures,” Massari told CNN. “I prefer using Matt, a heritage durum wheat cultivated mainly in Puglia and Sicily.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            1. Bring 6 to 8 cups of lightly salted water to a boil in a large pot. Toast the black pepper in a dry pan over medium-low heat until fragrant. Remove pepper from heat immediately.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d8002d3b6mxa4vfkn7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            2. Cook the spaghettoni according to the package directions until slightly al dente, reserving 237 grams (1 cup) of cooking liquid while it’s cooking.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d8002e3b6ml2addbdi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            3. While the pasta is cooking, prepare a cold emulsion by mixing grated Pecorino Romano with a small ladle of warm pasta water (ideally under 60 C, or 140 F) in a medium bowl until it forms a creamy base.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d8002f3b6myrw3a0fc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            4. Drain the pasta slightly al dente, then transfer it to the pan with the pepper.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaaep4d8002g3b6m2d5yf488@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            5. Toss the pasta with the Pecorino cream, gradually adjusting with more pasta water to create a glossy, smooth sauce that perfectly coats the noodles. Add more black pepper and cheese before serving. Serve immediately.
    &lt;/p&gt;

Biochemist Rhonda Patrick says intensity wins over length when it comes to taking care of heart or efficient blood sugar regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sharing her views on Lewis Howes' School of Greatness Podcast, Patrick says people should opt for 10 minutes of gruelling workout than 10,000 steps of leisurely walk if they want to make better utilization of their time, and improve glucose regulation and cardiovascular health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think that 10,000 steps should be replaced with 10 minutes of vigorous exercise a day," she said in the interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;People may feel long-duration walks could be better for fitness, but the biochemist says slow walking may bring limited benefits compared to intense exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It comes down to [the fact that] you can walk slow, right?" she told Howes. "Also, do you know how long it takes? It takes a long time—like an hour and a half," she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, 10 minutes of vigorous exercise, like sprints or cycling intervals, can help boost blood glucose regulation and heart health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Benefits of &lt;keyword id="24430337" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="exercise-snacks" source="keywords"&gt;exercise snacks&lt;/keyword&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quoting a &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38629807/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, Patrick said that 10 bodyweight squats every 45 minutes during an 8.5-hour period of sitting improves blood sugar regulation better than a single 30-minute walk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Talking about 'exercise snacks' or brief, intense bursts of activity is an effective way to avoid health risks linked with our inactive lifestyles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study examined how different patterns of muscle activity while interrupting prolonged sitting affect blood sugar control in overweight and obese men. Compared to 8.5 hours of uninterrupted sitting, all active interruptions, one continuous 30-minute walk, or 3-minute walks or squats every 45 minutes led to better post-meal glucose control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Frequent walking or squatting was significantly more effective than a single 30-minute walk. The improvements were linked to increased muscle activity, especially in the quadriceps and glutes. In short, frequent, short bursts of movement, even as brief as 3 minutes, help regulate blood sugar more effectively than one long session of walking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Intense exercise vs slow walking: What improves VO2 max&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;VO2 max, or maximal oxygen consumption, is a measure of how much oxygen your body can use during exercise. Slow or casual walking doesn't have a major impact on VO2 max. Vigorous exercise on the other hand could drastically improve this measure which can improve your cardiovascular health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having a good VO2 max reduces your risk of death from all causes to a significant extent. People with low VO2 max could have a mortality rate lower than those who smoked, had blood pressure, or diabetes, according to Patrick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Unique benefits of walking&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many, however, would still say that walking is the best exercise as it supports joint mobility and strengthens muscles without the strain of high-impact exercise, which makes it ideal for people of all ages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regular walking also improves digestion, boosts immune function, aids in maintaining a healthy weight, and enhances sleep quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mentally, walking, especially in nature, can reduce stress, elevate mood, improve creativity, and even lower the risk of anxiety and depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Indoor walking workout: Complete 1000 steps in 10 mins&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Fri, 09 May 2025 14:32:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>FDA批准首个代替子宫颈抹片检查的家庭替代品--《纽约时报》 | F.D.A.

But the at-home version could help women who have trouble finding, traveling to or making time for an in-person appointment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The approval is a result of a process that began with the discovery decades ago&lt;strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;that the human papillomavirus, commonly known as HPV, causes almost all cervical cancer cases, and that people who don’t have the virus are at virtually no risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Armed with that information, many providers started testing Pap smear samples for HPV in addition to analyzing cervical cells under a microscope.

      &lt;p class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" data-username="gavi"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Top virologists from over 40 countries have delivered an urgent warning over the growing risk of an H5N1 avian flu pandemic, calling on global leaders to shore up defences against a virus that can kill one in every two people it infects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the last two years, the virus has evolved from circulating mostly in birds to becoming &lt;a href="/vaccineswork/bird-cow-and-beyond-how-h5n1-flu-made-worrying-leap-mammals" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="c84257f5-88d4-406b-8987-98ee7ac32ef9" data-entity-substitution="canonical" title="From bird to cow and beyond: how H5N1 flu made the worrying leap to mammals"&gt;more adept at infecting mammals&lt;/a&gt; such as pigs and cattle. Although a handful of people have been infected, the virus hasn’t been able to spread from human to human – yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2667193X25001103"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;The Lancet Regional Health – Americas&lt;/em&gt; by the Global Virus Network (GVN), a consortium of the world’s top virologists, says that unless urgent actions are taken to boost surveillance and biosecurity, prepare for potential human-to-human viral transmission, and protect communities through vaccination and other prevention methods, we could face a global health disaster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evolving virus&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Influenza viruses are &lt;a href="/vaccineswork/bird-flu-detected-pigs-heres-why-virologists-are-concerned" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="7d3ddac0-191b-4fae-b40a-f6c4f01d220f" data-entity-substitution="canonical" title="Bird flu detected in pigs – here's why virologists are concerned"&gt;better than most other viruses&lt;/a&gt; at being able to jump between different species – this is why most of the pandemics so far have been influenza pandemics. The ability of H5N1 bird flu to infect mammals more easily is a worrying potential stepping stone to being able to more readily infect people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists are also worried about the potential for people to be co-infected with bird flu and seasonal flu, particularly considering the severe flu season the northern hemisphere recently experienced. If the bird flu virus were to acquire mutations that allow seasonal flu to spread between people, it could spell &lt;a href="/vaccineswork/could-bird-flu-be-one-mutation-away-causing-pandemic" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="ef5a9e42-c8a3-433b-ab9d-06365e58a079" data-entity-substitution="canonical" title="Could bird flu be one mutation away from causing a pandemic?"&gt;disaster&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Glaring gaps&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the COVID-19 pandemic hit, the world wasn’t prepared for it, and in its aftermath, global leaders and health experts vowed that countries would be better fortified in the event of another pandemic. The Global Virus Network scientists warn that there is limited surveillance at animal-human interfaces, meaning that we may not spot when bird flu starts to jump more often from animals to people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And they cite “a lack of a clear pathway to mitigation measures”, so that even if surveillance does detect worrying signals, it is unclear how that would lead to a rapid and forceful enough response to quash a budding pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Preparing the world&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientists outline a clear ten-point plan that they urge world leaders to implement now, so that if bird flu does become a pandemic, we have a chance of mitigating the damage it causes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;High on the list is faster genomic data sharing to help track mutations as they circulate, and investment in systems that could use this genetic data to predict the visible characteristics and traits of the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sharing genetic data can also be important in vaccine development – another area on their list. They say that more insight is needed to “understand breadth of protection for stockpiled vaccines, and their potential role in an early stage of a pandemic when fully matched vaccines are not yet available.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As well as strengthening the public health infrastructure, the proposed plan urges improved biosecurity and biocontainment on farms, as contact between farm animals and people has driven several cases of animal-to-human bird flu in this current outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, the virologists call for the development of several preparedness plans for the roll-out of tests, vaccines and therapeutics – including a framework for assessing current national stockpiles and new vaccine distribution. Ideally, tests should be delivered by local clinics, as this is faster to roll out and manage than setting up large regional testing hubs, but there should be good chains of communication so that data can be quickly gathered and analysed in a central location. A preparedness plan for the launch of rapid clinical studies to assess any new pandemic strain is also needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;International collaboration will be essential, the authors conclude, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2667193X25001103"&gt;adding&lt;/a&gt; that “while the current North American outbreak [in dairy cows] is largely mild, historic mortality rates of 50% from H5N1 in humans suggest the terrible consequences of underreacting to current threats.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt; In the UK, 82 fatalities have been reported to regulators—again, with no confirmed links. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ozempic and Wegovy contain the active ingredient semaglutide, which mimics glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1)— a naturally occurring hormone released in the small intestine when eating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The chemical signals to the brain when you are full and slows digestion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This keeps people feeling fuller for longer and dramatically reduces appetite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It also slows the liver's production of sugar, forcing the body to burn stored fat for energy.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Since being approved for weight-loss in November 2023, Mounjaro, which contains a GLP-1 drug similar to semaglutide, has already been linked to 209 adverse reactions, one of which was fatal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For all of these drugs, the second most common complaint was fatigue, followed by headaches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Less common side-effects include menstruation bleeding, joint pain and abnormal heart rhythms. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Ms Coe was rushed to hospital after experiencing blood clots, cramping and headaches, which she believes to be a side-effect of the skinny jab&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Karen Coe, 59, who was taking Mounjaro to treat her type 2 diabetes, said that being on the weight loss drug felt like 'being ripped open by a knife'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Just three days after her first injection, Ms Coe started to experience side-effects.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'At first I had a headache and got dizzy,' she explained. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I had a few stomach cramps. On Monday it was excruciating. I nearly passed out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I had to ask my husband to call for an ambulance. I was dizzy and really cold. they did my observation and said it was all okay.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ms Coe was sent home and told to monitor her symptoms. She spent the next 24 hours in excruciating pain with stomach cramps and passing blood when she went to the toilet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite her symptoms initially clearing up, a week later she was rushed to hospital after experiencing 'massive blood clots'. She was then referred to a colorectal surgeon within the next two weeks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While doctors could not say that the blood clots were caused by the weigh loss drug, it is likely that her initial symptoms were caused by Mounjaro. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ms Coe is now urging people to consider the potential side-effects of the popular jab—which the NHS lists as nausea, diarrhoea and abdominal cramps—before taking it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It can cause severe reactions and severe side effects. People should really think carefully and don't take it lightly' she warned. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In response, Eli Lilly, the pharmaceutical company that makes Mounjaro, said: 'patients safety is our top priority. We take any reports regarding patients safety extremely seriously and actively monitor, evaluate and report safety information for all our medicines.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We encourage patients to consult their doctors or other healthcare professional regarding any side effects they may be experiencing and to ensure that they are getting genuine Lily medicine.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It added that the patient information leaflet for Mounjaro—also known as tirzepatide—warns that various gastrointestinal side effects are very common side effects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt; The yellow card website, in partnership with the MHRA, states that reported adverse reaction have not yet been proven to be treated to the drug, and therefore should not be interpreted as a list of the common known side-effects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="art-ins mol-factbox health" data-version="2" id="mol-31e81810-2ccc-11f0-a4e8-6d01e7290b1e" data-permabox-url="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-14695421/Alarm-severe-reactions-Ozempic-set-SOAR-350-cent-new-data-reveals.html"&gt; &lt;font&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;Reports of reactions to semaglutide by year&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"&gt; &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;2019: 114 adverse reactions reported &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;2020: 144 adverse reactions reported&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;2021: 336 adverse reactions reported&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;2022: 534 adverse reactions reported&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;2023: 1592 adverse reactions reported&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;2024 (up to May 19): 2780 adverse reactions reported &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Fri, 09 May 2025 14:02:22 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>根据营养师的说法，如果你有高胆固醇，最好吃的5种奶酪- EatingWell | 5 Best Cheeses to Eat If You Have High Cholesterol, According to Dietitians - EatingWell</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieEFVX3lxTE4tVFhXRzNsOEktQUdadF9kR0dmX1VLZHhKOWtYeFhIeE9EWWRtamdRUXNfX3F5dThXaUQ4VnNUV1BfRXJ5bXRpY09xc0NMWU50a1BJdkktWXRaUlFrclNja3paQ2hjZUlXN19XXy1WVFJpZ1QtREROdQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-callout--summary mntl-sc-block-universal-callout--tips mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-summary callout--bordered" data-text="Key Points" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;
&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Many people with high cholesterol assume they can’t eat cheese.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Yet, dietitians say certain types of cheese can be part of a heart-healthy diet.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The key is to watch serving sizes and pair cheese with other heart-friendly foods.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If it seems like &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8013604/what-happens-to-your-body-when-you-eat-cheese-every-day/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;cheese&lt;/a&gt; gets a bad rap when it comes to health, it’s not your imagination. Especially if you have high cholesterol. Even though cheese is filled with good-for-you nutrients like protein and calcium, it can also be high in cholesterol-raising saturated fat. While that might sound like trouble for your heart health, it might surprise you to learn that research suggests otherwise. For instance, a recent umbrella review and meta-analysis found that people who eat slightly less than 1.5 ounces of cheese daily are &lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt; likely to experience heart disease or have a stroke.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Dietitians agree. “If you are someone with high cholesterol, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/can-you-eat-cheese-when-you-have-high-cholesterol-8383929" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;you can enjoy all types of cheeses&lt;/a&gt;,” says &lt;a href="https://tobyamidornutrition.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Toby Amidor, M.S., RD&lt;/a&gt;. “Many higher-fat cheeses offer a ton of flavor, meaning a little goes a long way.” At the same time, some cheeses are better for your cholesterol than others. To find the very best ones, we turned to registered dietitians. Read on to learn how to make these delicious, dietitian-approved cheeses part of your heart-healthy diet. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-1-cheddar-cheese"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 1. Cheddar Cheese &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Amidor gives Cheddar the green light, even if you have high cholesterol. While Cheddar does have some saturated fat, a little bit of this tangy cheese is fine. The trick is to keep portion sizes in mind. For instance, a 1-ounce slice of full-fat Cheddar cheese contains 5 grams of saturated fat.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; By comparison, the same amount of low-fat Cheddar has 1 g of saturated fat.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; So, if you like a few slices of Cheddar on your sandwich, low-fat Cheddar is a better choice. However, noshing on a cube of full-fat Cheddar with an apple or sprinkling a small handful of grated Cheddar on a cup of black bean chili can easily fit into a heart-healthy eating plan. Ironically, low-fat Cheddar has more sodium than full-fat (roughly 250 versus 180 milligrams). So, if high blood pressure is also an issue, you may be better off just using a smaller amount of the real deal.  &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-2-2-fat-cottage-cheese"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 2. 2% Fat Cottage Cheese &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’ve jumped on the &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8056073/cottage-cheese-mustard-dip-trend-gone-too-far/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;FoodTok &lt;/em&gt;trend&lt;/a&gt; of adding cottage cheese to everything, this staple can stay, says Amidor. After all, cottage cheese is packed with protein (12 g per half cup!).&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; To make the most of this rich, creamy cheese, Amidor recommends pairing it with other nutrient-dense foods, like fruits and vegetables in &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/high-protein-ingredients-to-add-to-smoothie-8786900" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;smoothies&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/savory-cottage-cheese-bowl-8763804" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;bowls&lt;/a&gt;, or using it as a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-high-protein-upgrade-for-your-morning-toast-11681776" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;high-protein topping for toast&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The great thing about cottage cheese is that there are a variety of options that can work with your needs. In addition to cholesterol-friendly low-fat cottage cheese, there are low- and no-salt-added varieties. Which is best for you? The 2% fat cottage cheese is loaded with creamy goodness but contains only about 2 g of total and 1 g of saturated fat per half cup. For many of us, the bigger heart health issue is sodium (roughly 350 mg per half cup). If you’re also watching your sodium, simply balance things out by keeping serving sizes small and making other low-sodium choices throughout the day. Or, if you prefer a nice big bowlful, go with no-salt-added or low-sodium cottage cheese. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Feta fans, there’s also a place for this briny cheese on your plate, says &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sarah-anne-williams123/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Sarah Williams, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;. One ounce of full-fat feta (about two 1-inch cubes) contains 6 g of fat and 4 g of saturated fat with roughly 320 mg of sodium.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; An even better bet is reduced-fat feta, says Williams. “Reduced-fat feta works really well in grain bowls or sprinkled over a chopped salad,” she says. “Plus, its bold flavor means you don’t need much to deliver that pop to your dish.” One ounce has a reasonable 5 g of fat and 3 g of saturated fat.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Plus, it pairs beautifully with foods that are naturally rich in cholesterol-lowering fiber, like whole grains, beans, fruits and veggies. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Part-Skim Mozzarella Cheese  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Who isn’t a fan of this rich, gooey pizza topping? Don’t just save it for pizza, though. Both Amidor and Williams encourage you to think outside the pizza box and use &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7937030/is-mozzarella-cheese-healthy/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;mozzarella&lt;/a&gt; in all kinds of other nutrient-dense recipes like quiches and wraps. It’s also a natural in &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/274006/skillet-ravioli-lasagna/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;pasta&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/278133/eat-the-rainbow-chopped-salad-with-basil-mozzarella/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;salads&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/274358/caprese-zucchini-casserole/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;veggies&lt;/a&gt;, so it’s a tasty way to up your intake of fiber-rich foods. For the most cholesterol-lowering muscle, go with part-skim mozzarella. It still delivers that familiar taste you’ve come to know and love with only 3 g of saturated fat per ounce.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Another happy surprise is that part-skim mozzarella is lower in sodium than many other kinds of cheese (about 190 mg per ounce). So, it’s a great choice for heart health overall.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Last, but certainly not least, Williams gives the nod to the Italian classic Parmesan. “Parmesan adds a great salty kick to roasted veggies, soups or even just a sprinkle on avocado toast,” she says. And if you’re grating it, you’re probably not eating all that much to begin with. So, its smaller portion size helps keep saturated fat in check without skimping on flavor, says Williams. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The other nice thing about Parmesan cheese is that a little goes a long way, thanks to its savory umami flavor. Each tablespoon contains just 2 g of total and 1 g of saturated fat.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; So, go ahead and sprinkle a few spoonfuls on your pasta or any of these &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/gallery/8067381/parmesan-crusted-veggie-recipes/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Parmesan-crusted veggie recipes&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You don’t have to forgo cheese if you have high cholesterol. Dietitians say that Cheddar, reduced-fat feta, part-skim mozzarella, grated Parmesan and 2% fat cottage cheese are all great choices if you have high cholesterol. “Cheese can absolutely have a place in a heart-healthy diet. It’s about being mindful of portions and pairing it with fiber-rich foods like veggies or whole grains to round things out,” says Williams. So, think of cheese as an accent to your heart-healthy meals and snacks rather than the main event. Then, go ahead and enjoy!

Prolonged cortisol elevation is linked to numerous mental health disorders, including depression and anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UC researchers created a lab-on-a-chip system to track a patient’s cortisol levels. It consists of a disposable collection device that a person puts in their mouth which is then inserted into a reader. The reader can transmit results in minutes to a portable analyzer and smartphone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Biomedical Microdevices.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Mental health care can be an urgent situation. And so these tests will help doctors make timely interventions,” Ahn said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patients can do the testing themselves and share results with doctors with a web app, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study co-author UC doctoral student Supreeth Setty is working on a related project for his dissertation that examines another hormone (dehydroepiandrosterone) that goes by the acronym DHEA. That hormone helps to counteract the effects of too much cortisol in the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research has shown that high ratios of cortisol to DHEA are indicators of chronic stress associated with conditions such as depression and anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Setty said the tests provide clinicians with objective evidence to supplement traditional screenings such as the patient health questionnaire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Point-of-care testing is a practical way to make results available quickly for everyone,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike mental health questionnaires that can be more subjective because they rely on a patient’s candor and self-awareness, the cortisol and DHEA tests are objective and can raise a red flag about a patient’s levels of stress, Setty said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The next step would be to collaborate with psychiatrists and conduct clinical trials to see if our platform works as expected,” Setty said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UC doctoral graduate Vinitha Thiyagarajan Upaassana was the lead author of the study with Setty and co-author and UC doctoral student Heeyong Jang. The project was partially funded by UC’s Technology Accelerator Project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UC researchers say their technique can be used to diagnose other health issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In particular, they examined troponin, a protein that gets released into the bloodstream when patients suffer damage to their hearts from conditions such as a heart attack. The amount of the protein released depends on how much damage the heart sustains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;High cardiac troponin levels in combination with symptoms such as chest pain can indicate a heart attack in progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a paper published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Analytical Chemistry&lt;/em&gt;, Jang, Setty and Ahn unveiled an innovative new device for a rapid and effective point-of-care biochemical test that measures troponin from a drop of blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Once you survive a heart attack there is an increased probability of having another heart attack,” Jang said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We can monitor troponin in the blood on a daily basis and hopefully get valuable information. The test provides immediate results, which is important when a patient is in need of immediate care.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this depression and neurotech research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#a1ccc8c2c9c0c4cd8fccc8cdcdc4d392e1d4c28fc4c5d4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Michael Miller&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://uc.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Cincinnati&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Michael Miller – University of Cincinnati&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10544-025-00733-6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;On-site analysis of cortisol in saliva based on microchannel lateral flow assay on polymer lab-on-a-chip&lt;/a&gt;” by Chong Ahn et al. &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Biomedical Microdevices&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On-site analysis of cortisol in saliva based on microchannel lateral flow assay on polymer lab-on-a-chip&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unbound cortisol in saliva, detectable through non-invasive sampling, is widely recognized as a validated biomarker for the biochemical evaluation of common mental disorders such as chronic stress, depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this work, we report a novel polymer lab-on-a-chip (LOC) for microfluidic lateral flow assay (mLFA) with on-chip dried reagents for the detection of unbound cortisol in saliva using a competitive immunoassay protocol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new polymer microchannel lateral flow assay on lab-on-a-chip (mLFA-LOC), replicated using injection molding technology, are composed of sequentially connected microchannels for sample loading, detection antibody immobilization, flow delay, sensing spirals for test and control, and a capillary pump at the end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The competitive immunoassay of cortisol can be autonomously performed through the microchannels after sample loading of the filtered saliva, and the fluorescence signals emitted from the sensing spirals are detected and quantified by a custom-designed, portable fluorescence analyzer developed in this work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the evaluation of cortisol assay, artificial saliva samples spiked with unbound cortisol were analyzed using mLFA-LOC and the portable analyzer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The performed competitive assay of unbound cortisol showed a limit of detection (LoD) of 1.8 ng/mL and an inter-chip coefficient of variation (CV) of 4.0%, which covers the clinical range for on-site unbound salivary cortisol analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The newly developed mLFA-LOC platform certainly works successfully for the rapid on-site sampling and analysis of salivary biomarkers.&lt;/p&gt;

Rates of the disease have plummeted since the 1970s, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/content/dam/cancer-org/research/cancer-facts-and-statistics/annual-cancer-facts-and-figures/2025/2025-cancer-facts-and-figures-acs.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;2025 report from the American Cancer Society&lt;/a&gt;, though they have begun to &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/cancer/cancer-hpv-increasing-women-vaccine-safe-rcna196439" target="_blank"&gt;level off in recent years&lt;/a&gt;. The report estimated that this year, 13,360 women will be diagnosed with cervical cancer and about 4,320 women will die.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;However, the number of women getting screened has fallen since the mid-2000s. A &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2788175" target="_blank"&gt;2022 study &lt;/a&gt;found that 23% of women were behind on their cervical cancer screening in 2019, up from 14% in 2005. Up to half of women diagnosed with cervical cancer in the U.S. weren’t up to date on their screenings, the &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/research/acs-research-news/cervical-cancer-leads-cancer-deaths-37-countries.html" target="_blank"&gt;American Cancer Society says&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“Cervical cancer screening in general is something that saves lives,” said Dr. Jessica Kiley, chief of general obstetrics and gynecology at Northwestern Medicine in Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The new test, called the Teal Wand, detects HPV using a vaginal swab, making it less invasive than a pap smear, in which the gynecologist inserts a speculum and collects samples of cells from the cervix.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;HPV, or human papillomavirus, is a sexually transmitted infection and the &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/cancer/hpv-can-cause-cancer-many-people-dont-realize-rcna79597" target="_blank"&gt;leading cause of cervical cancer&lt;/a&gt;. There’s no treatment for HPV, but most cases clear on their own. Several strains, however, are linked to cervical cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The Teal Wand is not the first HPV test that uses a vaginal sample: Last year, the FDA approved a similar swab, also performed by patients themselves, that’s &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2024/fda-hpv-test-self-collection-health-care-setting" target="_blank"&gt;collected in a doctor’s office&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“What’s different about this new indication is that this sample can be collected at home and not in a medical setting,” said Dr. George Sawaya, a gynecologist at UCSF Health. “You have to logically believe that would increase access if people’s main barrier was getting to a medical setting.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;A recent report in &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2830824" target="_blank"&gt;JAMA Network Open&lt;/a&gt; found that women in rural areas are 25% more likely to be diagnosed with cervical cancer and 42% more likely to die from the disease than women who live in cities, a trend that likely reflects lower access to screenings and care in rural parts of the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Patients will be able to order the test kit after a telehealth appointment with a doctor and then collect the sample themselves at home. For now, the product will have to be prescribed by one of Teal Health’s virtual providers, but the company plans to make it available for other doctors to order as well. The swab is then mailed to a lab for analysis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Teal Health said if the result is positive, its providers will help arrange for further care. Following a positive test, women may need additional tests in a doctor’s office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Still, experts want more information on the cost of the test, and whether patients will follow up if they need more testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“Those are some of the uncertainties around it,” Sawaya said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Kara Egan, the CEO of Teal Health, did not say how much the test would cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;However, she said, because cervical cancer screening is endorsed by a government group called the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, the company is anticipating the test will be covered by insurance and expects to know definitively in the coming months. In December, the task force endorsed in-office self-swabs in a draft recommendation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="endmark body-graf"&gt;Kiley, the gynecologist from Northwestern, said it’s still important that women see a gynecologist regularly. An annual exam covers more than just cervical cancer screening, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Fri, 09 May 2025 13:54:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqAFBVV95cUxPVHNxVER0TFYtTkRGTDdxQlNTcXROd0F0QkZ5TXJMamdMZFdGcXlOXzBTYUdZRDdOc0JfSTJLdDFDWVdEWVkyTjRTZWlnWlVkcXdHbjJRTTIwWjlvUkZFdDY4YUNRcEJ0OU1LUmhCNHR1VlVDRElib1VsTFMyMkc3X0JIMU14VE5DNjh3T2E4VXpzWUF4ckZnYXhtQ1Bja1JQVjVCdGZqUUrSAVZBVV95cUxQd2RwMEoxVVVmWXozTUJxSGdFZjZtMV9wWE9DQUpPaHdNajRjMWhqNGt4cUJ4NkdMXzgtTUZXZHlWYzRzN0dIYTlDcmNDdUliVnpmT2VXQQ</guid></item><item><title>B细胞水平可以预测Ocrevus上复发性多发性硬化症患者的PIRA风险-今日多发性硬化症新闻 | B-cell levels can predict PIRA risk in relapsing MS patients on Ocrevus - Multiple Sclerosis News Today</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiugFBVV95cUxPU3FVVXJZems0VmpKcTBpb1hJbkdVQ1prbXd3dnJNLURWdzRVaXRtUFp3Tm5VZURqWmd4NElkbzFxVVBYYTFHOWNxcDNkZlp3WU1GZ2RSQ2hyZlB0aThPN2x6R3J5cFdNMVNvc3pmTHlacUtzaUVSZjM1ajJYTzFfOGRTcVpUV2h5Y0NJMVF1YmhRQjRQbWNGQk9zRElMYzB5Z05saUU3Tld2WDBaOUZ2eEUyb04tWG82SGc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="pf-content"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In people with relapsing forms of &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/multiple-sclerosis-overview/"&gt;multiple sclerosis&lt;/a&gt; (MS) treated with &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/ocrevus-ocrelizumab-primary-progressive-relapsing-multiple-sclerosis/"&gt;Ocrevus&lt;/a&gt; (ocrelizumab), levels of B-cells can help to predict the risk of progression independent of relapse activity, a new study reports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Our results unveil a discernible relationship between the degree of B-cell depletion and disease progression in individuals with [relapsing] MS,” researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/13524585251329849"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Suboptimal B-cell depletion is associated with progression independent of relapse activity in multiple sclerosis patients treated with ocrelizumab&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,” was published in &lt;em&gt;Multiple Sclerosis Journal&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/risk-factors-for-multiple-sclerosis/"&gt;MS is caused&lt;/a&gt; by inflammation that damages healthy tissue in the brain and spinal cord. Most people with MS have &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/4-types-ms/"&gt;relapsing forms of the disease&lt;/a&gt;, which are marked by &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/ms-flares/"&gt;flares&lt;/a&gt; where &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/symptoms-of-multiple-sclerosis/"&gt;symptoms&lt;/a&gt; suddenly worsen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Symptoms generally ease after a relapse, but some symptoms from a relapse can persist and become permanent — this is called relapse-associated worsening. People with relapsing MS can also experience progression independent of relapse activity (PIRA), where symptoms get worse in the absence of disease flares.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Ocrevus works to deplete B-cells&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ocrevus is widely approved to treat relapsing MS as well as &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/primary-progressive-multiple-sclerosis-ppms/"&gt;primary progressive disease&lt;/a&gt;. The therapy works by depleting B-cells, a type of immune cell with a central role in MS-driving inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the study, researchers in Germany wanted to examine factors that are associated with the risk of PIRA in people with relapsing MS taking Ocrevus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The analysis included data on 148 people with relapsing MS who were treated with Ocrevus from 2017 to 2023. Over the course of follow-up, 47% of the patients had no evidence of disease activity (NEDA), meaning they didn’t experience relapses or signs of new disease activity on MRI scans, and had no confirmed disability accumulation, defined as an increase in Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores sustained for at least six months. Another 17% of patients experienced PIRA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The remaining 34% of patients experienced some signs of disability progression, but those did not meet the criteria for confirmed disability accumulation to be considered PIRA. Instead, they were classified as patients with evidence of disease activity (EDA) without fulfilling PIRA criteria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Statistical analyses accounting for age, sex, body fat, initial disability levels, and treatment duration showed that patients who had NEDA had significantly lower levels of B-cells than those who experienced PIRA or EDA. There was a clear gradient in B-cell levels across the three groups, with NEDA patients showing the lowest counts, EDA patients showing intermediate levels, and PIRA patients having the highest B-cell counts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This implies “that the degree of B-cell depletion may be associated with disease progression,” the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the statistical models comparing PIRA versus NEDA patients and adjusting for multiple other factors, older age, initial EDSS scores, treatment duration, and B-cell counts were all significantly associated with PIRA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, the odds of experiencing PIRA increased by 3% with each year added to a person’s age, and by 64% with each point increase (indicating more severe disability) in initial EDSS scores. Those who were on treatment for longer were also 30% more likely to experience PIRA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By far the strongest predictor of PIRA was insufficient B-cell depletion. Patients with B-cell counts of 10 cells per microliter of blood or higher were nearly four times as likely to experience PIRA as patients with lower B-cell counts.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Lower B-cell counts associated with reduced risk of overall disability worsening&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lower B-cell counts were also associated with a reduced risk of overall disability worsening, whether from PIRA or relapse-associated worsening. Collectively, the data suggest that, for MS patients on Ocrevus, insufficient B-cell depletion is associated with an increased risk of disability progression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our study provides evidence that PIRA occurs in the context of suboptimal B-cell depletion in a relevant proportion of patients with [relapsing] MS. This underscores the importance of closely monitoring B-cell counts and potentially adjusting infusion intervals,” the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This implies that patients who don’t experience sufficient B-cell depletion may benefit from higher doses of Ocrevus or shorter treatment intervals, though the researchers stressed that further testing will be necessary to assess whether such interventions are safe and effective. They also noted that this analysis was limited to patients at a single center, so additional studies are necessary to validate the results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Moving forward, a nuanced understanding of B-cell dynamics will be pivotal for refining treatment strategies and improving outcomes for patients with [relapsing] MS,” the scientists concluded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ocrevus is sold by &lt;a href="https://www.gene.com/"&gt;Genentech&lt;/a&gt;, a subsidiary of Roche. The company was not involved in this study.&lt;/p&gt;

These children also experience faster blood pressure increases between ages 2 and 18, highlighting the long-term cardiovascular impact of prenatal exposures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, analyzing nearly 30 years of data from over 12,000 mother-child pairs, underscores how maternal health before and during pregnancy can shape a child’s heart health trajectory. These findings advocate for early intervention strategies, including maternal lifestyle changes and routine blood pressure screenings in children, even when no current health issues are apparent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prenatal Risk Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; Children born to mothers with at least one cardiometabolic risk factor had higher systolic and diastolic blood pressure percentiles.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Faster BP Growth:&lt;/strong&gt; Blood pressure rose more quickly from ages 2 to 18 in children exposed to maternal risk factors during pregnancy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disparities Noted:&lt;/strong&gt; Effects were more pronounced in girls and Black children, suggesting potential social and biological interactions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;USC&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Children born to mothers with obesity, gestational diabetes mellitus or a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy have higher systolic and diastolic blood pressure than children born to mothers without these risk factors, according to a new USC study. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among children whose mothers had at least one risk factor, blood pressure also rose more quickly between ages 2 and 18 compared to their peers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109694"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/pregnancy-health-child-blood-pressure-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/pregnancy-health-child-blood-pressure-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/pregnancy-health-child-blood-pressure-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/pregnancy-health-child-blood-pressure-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/pregnancy-health-child-blood-pressure-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/pregnancy-health-child-blood-pressure-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/pregnancy-health-child-blood-pressure-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/pregnancy-health-child-blood-pressure-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a child." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/pregnancy-health-child-blood-pressure-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/pregnancy-health-child-blood-pressure-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/pregnancy-health-child-blood-pressure-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/pregnancy-health-child-blood-pressure-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/pregnancy-health-child-blood-pressure-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/pregnancy-health-child-blood-pressure-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/pregnancy-health-child-blood-pressure-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;At their first blood pressure reading, children born to mothers with any cardiometabolic risk factor ranked in a higher SBP percentile (4.88 points higher, on average) and DBP percentile (1.09 points higher, on average) than their peers born to mothers with no risk factors. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings, which suggest that blood pressure interventions could start as early as pregnancy, were just published in &lt;em&gt;JAMA Network Open&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across the country, heart health is declining, with hypertension affecting more people—and showing up earlier in life. Growing evidence indicates that blood pressure levels may be shaped by early development, even before birth. But most research on maternal and child heart health has looked at risk factors individually, rather than exploring their combined role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study from the Keck School of Medicine of USC has examined links and interactions between a mother’s cardiometabolic health during pregnancy and her child’s blood pressure up to age 18.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study included nearly 30 years of data from 12, 480 mother-child pairs across the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We still have so much to learn about how we can prevent the development of cardiovascular disease,” said Shohreh Farzan, PhD, associate professor of population and public health sciences at the Keck School of Medicine and the study’s senior author.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Finding factors that we can address during pregnancy and childhood—and implementing early interventions—may be key to changing the trajectories of health for future generations.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Funded by the National Institutes of Health, Farzan and her colleagues found that children born to mothers with at least one cardiometabolic risk factor had a systolic blood pressure (SBP) that averaged 4.88 percentile points higher than children whose mothers had no risk factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diastolic blood pressure (DBP) averaged 1.90 percentile points higher. Children born to mothers with one or more risk factors also had a faster increase in blood pressure between ages 2 and 18.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings can help shape prevention efforts on both ends of the equation, including lifestyle changes for women of childbearing age and earlier blood pressure screenings for at-risk children, said Zhongzheng (Jason) Niu, PhD, the study’s first author, a Presidential Sustainability Solutions Fellow at USC and assistant professor of epidemiology and environmental health at the University at Buffalo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blood pressure percentiles&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers used data collected between January 1994 and March 2023 through the Environmental influences on Child Health Outcomes (ECHO) Program. The data include demographic and health information on 12,480 mother-child pairs from across the country, about half of whom identified as non-white.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearly half of the mothers in the study (5,537, or 44.4%) had at least one cardiometabolic risk factor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obesity was the most common, affecting 3,072 mothers (24.6%), followed by hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, which include gestational hypertension, preeclampsia and other conditions (1,693 mothers, or 13.6%) and gestational diabetes mellitus (805 mothers, or 6.5%).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For children, researchers used blood pressure readings to calculate SBP and DBP percentiles, which estimate how a child’s blood pressure compares to that of peers who are the same age, sex and height.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers then conducted a statistical analysis to examine how maternal risk factors related to blood pressure in their offspring down the line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They accounted for other variables that could influence the results, including maternal age, race/ethnicity, education, income, number of previous pregnancies and smoking during pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Elevated blood pressure&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At their first blood pressure reading, children born to mothers with any cardiometabolic risk factor ranked in a higher SBP percentile (4.88 points higher, on average) and DBP percentile (1.09 points higher, on average) than their peers born to mothers with no risk factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Children born to mothers with two risk factors faced even higher blood pressure. For example, when mothers had both obesity and a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy, their children had SBP that averaged 7.31 points higher and DBP that averaged 4.04 points higher than children whose mothers had no risk factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The effects were more pronounced in female compared to male offspring and in Black children compared to other racial and ethnic groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the children in the study, 6,015 had at least two blood pressure readings, which allowed researchers to assess how maternal risks related to changes in a child’s blood pressure over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found that SBP (0.5 points/year) and DBP (0.7 points/year) rose more quickly between ages 2 and 18 in children whose mother had at least one risk factor, compared to children whose mother had no risk factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Screening and prevention&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings show that on top of directly benefiting women, better cardiovascular health during the childbearing years can also support health in the next generation, Niu said. A 2025 statement from the American Heart Association highlights strategies for boosting heart health in young adults, including improving social connectedness and reducing substance use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier blood pressure screenings for children—even those who are healthy by other measures—could also help identify candidates for intervention before problems arise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Currently, most clinical guidelines do not suggest blood pressure screenings for children who seem healthy overall,” Niu said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But our evidence is clear, showing that even a small blood pressure difference in early life can magnify over a longer period.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Farzan, Niu and their colleagues are also studying how various combinations of environmental and social factors, such as air pollution and stress, may influence cardiometabolic health in children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About this research&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to Farzan and Niu, the study’s other authors are Carrie V.

Three common maternal cardiometabolic risk factors during pregnancy were examined: prepregnancy obesity, gestational diabetes, and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exposure&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maternal cardiometabolic risk factors were retrieved and harmonized from medical records and questionnaires.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Main Outcomes and Measures&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Offspring systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) percentiles adjusted for age, sex, and height were calculated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among 12 480 mother-offspring pairs (mean [SD] maternal age during pregnancy, 29.9 [6.4] years; 856 of 12 303 identifying as Asian [7.0%]; 1908 as Black [15.5%]; 2305 as Hispanic [18.7%]; 6522 as White [52.3%], and 712 as other [5.8%] race and ethnicity), at least 1 maternal cardiometabolic risk factor was present in 5537 (44.4%), with prepregnancy obesity being the most prevalent (3072 [24.6%]), followed by HDP (1693 [13.6%]) and gestational diabetes (805 [6.5%]).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Offspring born to mothers with any cardiometabolic risk factors had higher SBP (4.88 percentile points; 95% CI, 3.97-5.82 percentile points) and higher DBP (1.90 percentile points; 95% CI, 1.15-2.64 percentile points) at their first blood pressure measurement, after adjusting for potential confounders, compared with their counterparts without any risk factors. Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, alone or with either prepregnancy obesity or gestational diabetes, was significantly associated with higher offspring blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These associations were generally more significant among female compared with male offspring and among Black compared with other racial and ethnic groups. Among 6015 offspring who had 2 or more blood pressure measures, maternal cardiometabolic risk factors were associated with an increased rate of blood pressure change from age 2 to 18 years (SBP percentile, 0.5 [95% CI, 0.2-0.8] per year; DBP percentile, 0.7 [95% CI 0.5-1.0] per year).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusions and Relevance&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings suggest that protecting pregnant individuals from cardiometabolic risk factors may promote healthier blood pressure in the next generation.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Fri, 09 May 2025 13:46:36 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifkFVX3lxTE9GcER6V09WZFZVSW1WWjhhNzhYY0VqOFJrZEM1STZZTUd1OU1TN0VVYmV5cTgwMDhWOHlxVWVWbkY0YlZDWTluWXBqRVo2NW9kX0poYkw3Qzg3SHFva1JSZUgyOUpsZm9ZWllqR3d4TzZvNkJvU0FBalcyeUlWUQ</guid></item><item><title>人工智能可以通过自拍来判断您身体的真实年龄和衰老速度- Live Science | AI can tell how old your body really is and how quickly you're aging using just a selfie - Live Science</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi2AFBVV95cUxOc2RfTEEzQWJGdUFmVmc5RnhaQWhDVWhhdnh2b3Zxb3FXSEVfbUswRnBIRUdFZ3RpVW5sMzh0SXN1TURtUFJuMU13bDFLQUN4RjBteFczbzdmdEtFWFE1ZHJnMmx6UDVoNmh2YVpVTW5NN2Y5VXk1OHN0WTBoX3g0QjVRZ3BQelRSYm5IUHo4VV9Ka3o2b1dwYzRBaVgyV3JNU05lX29wd2hJblY3SUZRblJBZ1dSV2N2YkdEbVQzSzhSOHpidjNDdTFwS0lmY1MydnlnWVBEQWY?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-body" class="text-copy bodyCopy auto"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/technology/artificial-intelligence" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/technology/artificial-intelligence"&gt;&lt;u&gt;artificial intelligence&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (AI) model can predict a person's biological age — the state of their body and how they're aging — from a selfie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The model, dubbed FaceAge, estimates how old a person looks compared to their chronological age, or the amount of time that's passed since their birth. FaceAge's makers say their tool could help doctors decide on the best course of treatment for diseases like cancer. But one outside expert told Live Science that before it is used that way, follow-up data needs to show it actually improves treatment outcomes or quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a doctor is treating a cancer patient, "one of the first things they do is they try to assess how well the individual is doing,"&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://aim.hms.harvard.edu/team/hugo-aerts" target="_blank" data-url="https://aim.hms.harvard.edu/team/hugo-aerts" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt; &lt;u&gt;Hugo Aerts&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, director of the AI in Medicine Program at Mass General Brigham, said in a news briefing on May 7. "This is often a very subjective assessment, but it can influence a lot of future decisions" about their treatment, including how aggressive or intense their treatment plan should be, he added. For example, doctors may decide a patient who looks younger and more fit for their age may tolerate an aggressive treatment better and eventually live longer than a patient who looks older and more frail, even if the two have the same chronological age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FaceAge could make that decision easier by turning doctors' subjective estimates into a quantitative measure, the study authors wrote in the new study published May 8 in the journal&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/landig/article/PIIS2589-7500(25)00042-1/fulltext" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/landig/article/PIIS2589-7500(25)00042-1/fulltext" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt; &lt;u&gt;Lancet Digital Health&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. By quantifying biological age, the model could offer another data point in helping doctors decide which treatment to recommend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aerts and his colleagues trained the model on more than 58,000 photos of people ages 60 years and older who were assumed to be of average health for their age at the time the photo was taken. In this training set, the researchers had the model estimate chronological ages and assumed that the people's biological ages were similar, though the scientists noted that this assumption is not true in every case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team then used FaceAge to predict the ages of more than 6,000 people with cancer. Cancer patients looked about five years older, on average, than their chronological ages, the team found. FaceAge's estimates also correlated with survival after treatment: The older a person looked, regardless of their chronological age, the lower their chances of living longer. By contrast, chronological age was not a good predictor of survival in cancer patients, the team &lt;u&gt;found.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FaceAge isn't ready for hospitals or physicians' offices yet. For one, the dataset used to train the model was pulled from IMDb and Wikipedia — which may not represent the general population, and may also not account for factors like plastic surgery, lifestyle differences, or images that have been digitally retouched. Further studies with larger and more representative training sets are needed to understand how those factors impact FaceAge estimations, the authors said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-AEDtjTWoTFodi7TMrejSaK" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-AEDtjTWoTFodi7TMrejSaK slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;And the researchers are still improving the algorithm with additional training data and testing its efficacy for other conditions besides cancer. They're also investigating what factors the model draws on to make its predictions. But once it's finalized, FaceAge could, for example, help doctors tailor the intensity of cancer treatments like radiation and chemotherapy to specific patients, study co-author&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://doctors.massgeneralbrigham.org/provider/raymond-h-mak/255665" target="_blank" data-url="https://doctors.massgeneralbrigham.org/provider/raymond-h-mak/255665" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt; &lt;u&gt;Dr. Ray Mak&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a radiation oncologist at Mass General Brigham, said during the briefing. A clinical trial for cancer patients, comparing FaceAge to more traditional measures of a patient’s frailty, is starting soon, Mak added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ethical guidelines surrounding how FaceAge information can be used, such as whether health insurance or life insurance providers could access FaceAge estimates to make coverage decisions, should be established before rolling out the model, the researchers said. "It is for sure something that needs attention, to assure that these technologies are used only for the benefit of the patient," Aerts said in the briefing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors would also need to carefully consider when and how they use FaceAge in clinical settings, said&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://profiles.ucl.ac.uk/31627-nicola-white/publications" target="_blank" data-url="https://profiles.ucl.ac.uk/31627-nicola-white/publications" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt; &lt;u&gt;Nicola White&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a palliative care researcher at University College London who was not involved in the study. "When you're dealing with people, it's very different to dealing with statistics," White told Live Science. A long-term study assessing whether involving FaceAge in treatment decisions improved patients' quality of life is needed, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers noted the AI tool wouldn't be making calls about treatment on its own. "It's not a replacement for clinician judgement," Mak said. But FaceAge could become part of a physician's toolkit for personalizing a treatment plan, "like having another vital sign data point."&lt;/p&gt;

Developed to address the lack of reliable diagnostic methods for children aged 2 to 18, MuSICCA uses tailored live music performed by a therapist to evoke and record patient responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These responses are measured against a diagnostic scale to evaluate awareness, offering clearer insights into a child’s cognitive state. Initial feedback from professionals and families strongly supports its validity and usefulness in clinical care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Musical Assessment Tool:&lt;/strong&gt; MuSICCA uses live, personalized music to help assess consciousness in children with brain injuries.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High Approval Rate:&lt;/strong&gt; 85% of evaluators strongly agreed it is both valid and suitable for use with children.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Supports Care Teams:&lt;/strong&gt; The tool helps therapists identify patient awareness and communicate findings effectively to families and clinicians.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Anglia Ruskin University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Music could provide a breakthrough in assessing consciousness levels in children who have suffered significant brain injuries, according to new research published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Frontiers in Psychology&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Children with disorders of consciousness rely on those caring for them to provide all aspects of their daily living, including hydration, nutrition, washing and dressing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is currently a lack of tools to assess consciousness in children aged between two and 18 and assessing awareness in children is complicated by neurodevelopmental changes that occur as the child ages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To tackle this, researchers at Anglia Ruskin University (ARU), The Children’s Trust and Temple University have developed the MuSICCA (Music therapy Sensory Instrument for Cognition, Consciousness and Awareness) tool, which involves using musical stimulation to enable the patient to show how conscious they are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The music is specially selected for the patient and a qualified music therapist performs this live to the patient, manipulating different aspects of the music depending on how the patient responds. The idea is to give the patient the best chance of showing what they can do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The music therapist observes the child’s behaviours and records these observations against a set of scales. MuSICCA then produces a diagnosis of the level of consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of the study, researchers invited a group of participants including music therapists, family members of children affected by brain injuries, and healthcare professionals to evaluate MuSICCA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants in the study took part in question and answer sessions following a demonstration of the tool and were asked to rate how much they agreed or disagreed with two statements: On initial review, the MuSICCA appears to be an assessment of consciousness and awareness; and on initial review, the MuSICCA appears to be suitable for use with children and young people. Participants were also asked to comment on the strengths and weaknesses of the MuSICCA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All participants agreed with both statements, with 85% strongly agreeing with each.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lead author Dr Jonathan Pool, Senior Research Fellow at Anglia Ruskin University’s Cambridge Institute for Music Therapy Research, said: “Children with disorders of consciousness are often almost completely dependent on others to meet their needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Their therapists, nurses and caregivers must interpret very subtle behaviours to help them understand their needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There is often great uncertainty when determining this, which makes it so important to find a reliable way of assessing levels of consciousness in these young people. Currently, there are very few ways of doing this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“MuSICCA allows the music therapist to conduct a rigorous assessment of the patient’s response to various musical stimuli, giving the therapist a picture of the patient’s level of consciousness and the strengths and weaknesses of their responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The information from MuSICCA is easy to communicate to the rest of the care and medical teams and can support families in understanding what they can do to support their child’s recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This study strongly suggests that MuSICCA is a suitable and comprehensive assessment method, highlighting its strengths in providing guidance, involving caregivers, and supporting clinical teams.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this music and concussion research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#5b313a36323e753d342928222f331b3a292e753a38752e30" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Jamie Forsyth&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://aru.ac.uk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Anglia Ruskin University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Jamie Forsyth – Anglia Ruskin University&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2025.1441178" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;The development and face validity of the music therapy sensory instrument for cognition, consciousness, and awareness (MuSICCA)&lt;/a&gt;” by Jonathan Pool et al. &lt;em&gt;Frontiers in Psychology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The development and face validity of the music therapy sensory instrument for cognition, consciousness, and awareness (MuSICCA)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Severe brain injuries in children and young people can result in disorders of consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This can pose significant challenges for the brain injury survivor as they may struggle to show awareness; for their family, who want to help their child to recover consciousness; and for the team providing treatment and care for them, who need an assessment that will inform optimal treatment and care planning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, there is a paucity of fully validated behavioral tools to assess consciousness in 2–18-year-olds. Assessing awareness across this age range is challenging and complex due to neurodevelopmental changes that occur during maturation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study evaluated the face validity of a music-based behavioral assessment for children and young people with disorders of consciousness. This is known as the Music therapy Sensory Instrument for Cognition, Consciousness and Awareness (MuSICCA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study recruited 20 participants to compose a mixed cohort of music therapists, non-music therapy healthcare professionals and family members with lived experience of caring for a child or young person with a disorder of consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These participants reviewed the MuSICCA and evaluated its suitability as an assessment of consciousness for use with children and young people. They provided feedback by rating their level of agreement with two statements and they also described the perceived strengths and limitations of the MuSICCA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results showed substantial agreement among raters that the MuSICCA appears to be an assessment of consciousness and awareness, and that the MuSICCA appears to be suitable for use with children and young people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its strengths include being rigorous, comprehensive, providing guidance and opportunity for caregiver involvement, its use of salience in stimulation, and its utility in supporting the wider clinical and care teams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings suggest that the MuSICCA may be a valuable assessment tool in providing treatment and care for children and young people with disorders of consciousness and their families.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Fri, 09 May 2025 13:16:53 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiaEFVX3lxTFA4Y3dnS2llc3pFMnM5NG51RGZHaVVvN0NSaE9iN1oyZkV3bDVhOVNBVmV5Y3RBN2NnTi1kQUV1ckZQdFRScEFvRWF1WWdSMlNHeVpRYlpfbkx4X09qNzVSR1Z2UkFzVDlP</guid></item><item><title>研究表明，血液中的咖啡因可能会影响身体脂肪和糖尿病风险- ScienceAlert | Caffeine in Your Blood Could Affect Body Fat And Diabetes Risk, Study Shows - ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipgFBVV95cUxPMFl4Vm5EMU9pZzU0cFRZZkRRTzF3cl9JRUVVbXIyaUw3emduQWZ6a0lmQWtRS1pRY0E4WkhaR1BVOFgtLVhocDNKUHhuSGlmX1JNUlRCWWo3YWJCajFvNDVVYnNiOURILWh6TWxxcFNCbC12dkJwTXd1MVRFWkNLWFRwMzBUaHZCNDhUbmkyM0s5OS1XMW1qTW5qUS1nbC1FRVJ5bUF3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;The levels of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/how-does-caffeine-wake-you-up" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73115" data-postid="103693" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_self"&gt;caffeine&lt;/a&gt; in your blood could affect the amount of body fat you carry, a factor that in turn could determine your risk of developing type 2 &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="103693" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; and cardiovascular diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those are the findings of a 2023 study that used genetic markers to establish a more definitive link between  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/how-does-caffeine-wake-you-up" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73115" data-postid="160058" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;caffeine&lt;/a&gt; levels, BMI, and type 2  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="160058" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research team, from the Karolinska Institute in Sweden, the University of Bristol in the UK, and Imperial College London in the UK, said calorie-free caffeinated drinks could be explored as a potential means of helping reduce body fat levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Genetically predicted higher plasma caffeine concentrations were associated with lower BMI and whole body fat mass," the researchers &lt;a href="https://bmjmedicine.bmj.com/content/2/1/e000335"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; in their paper, published in March 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Furthermore, genetically predicted higher plasma caffeine concentrations were associated with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes. Approximately half of the effect of caffeine on type 2 diabetes liability was estimated to be mediated through BMI reduction."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 youtube-iframe relative"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eqbRU-59e54?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study involved data from just under 10,000 people collected from existing genetic databases, focusing on variations in or near specific genes known to be associated with the speed at which caffeine is broken down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, those with variations affecting the genes – namely &lt;a href="https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=CYP1A2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CYP1A2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and a gene that regulates it, called &lt;a href="https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=AHR"&gt;&lt;em&gt;AHR&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – tend to break caffeine down more slowly, allowing it to remain in the blood longer. Yet they also tend to drink less caffeine in general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An approach called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mendelian_randomization"&gt;Mendelian randomization&lt;/a&gt; was used to determine likely causal relationships between the presence of the variations, illnesses like diabetes, body mass, and lifestyle factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_141100" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-141100" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/ThreeHandsHoldingCoffeeR_U_642.jpg" alt="Three coffees being held by hands" class="size-full wp-image-141100" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/ThreeHandsHoldingCoffeeR_U_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/ThreeHandsHoldingCoffeeR_U_642-623x415.jpg 623w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/ThreeHandsHoldingCoffeeR_U_642-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-141100" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Caffeine in your blood may help determine your risk of developing type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases.

&lt;p&gt;Previous studies have linked a moderate and relative increase in caffeine consumption to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/four-cups-of-coffee-a-day-might-be-the-perfect-amount-of-your-heart"&gt;better heart health&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10408398.2018.1507996"&gt;a lower BMI&lt;/a&gt;, and this research adds more detail to what we already know about the effects that &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/how-does-caffeine-wake-you-up" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73115" data-postid="103693" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_self"&gt;coffee&lt;/a&gt; has on the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 youtube-iframe relative"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LoTgfGotaQ4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's important to also keep in mind the impacts of caffeine on the body &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/all-the-ways-caffeine-affects-your-body-in-one-handy-infographic"&gt;aren't all positive&lt;/a&gt;, which means &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/this-eye-opening-medical-case-reveals-what-can-happen-when-you-overdose-on-caffeine"&gt;care must be taken&lt;/a&gt; when weighing up the benefits of drinking it – but this latest study is an important step in assessing how much caffeine is ideal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Small, short term trials have shown that caffeine intake results in weight and fat mass reduction, but the long term effects of caffeine intake is unknown," the researchers &lt;a href="https://bmjmedicine.bmj.com/content/2/1/e000335"&gt;explained&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Considering the extensive intake of caffeine worldwide, even its small metabolic effects could have important health implications."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team thinks the association shown here could be down to the way caffeine increases thermogenesis (&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/our-muscles-evolved-a-clever-way-to-keep-us-warm-even-when-theyre-doing-nothing"&gt;heat production&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/drinking-coffee-before-exercising-does-something-pretty-awesome-to-your-body"&gt;fat oxidation&lt;/a&gt; (turning fat into energy) in the body, which both play an important role in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/an-expert-reveals-3-ways-you-can-speed-up-your-metabolism"&gt;overall metabolism&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_122681" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-122681" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/03/CoffeeBowelCancer-642x260.jpg" alt="Coffee in cup" class="wp-image-122681 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/03/CoffeeBowelCancer-642x260.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/03/CoffeeBowelCancer-768x311.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/03/CoffeeBowelCancer-600x243.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/03/CoffeeBowelCancer.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-122681" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The research adds to what we know about caffeine's effects. (Guido Mieth/Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;While this study involved a large sample, Mendelian randomization isn't infallible, and it's still possible that other factors are at play that weren't accounted for. More research will be needed to confirm cause and effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Randomized controlled trials are warranted to assess whether non-caloric caffeine containing beverages might play a role in reducing the risk of obesity and type 2 diabetes," &lt;a href="https://bristol.ac.uk/news/2023/march/caffeine-type2-diabetes.html"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; University of Bristol genetic epidemiologist Benjamin Woolf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research was published in &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9978685/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMJ Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An earlier version of this article was published in March 2023.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Previous research showed pesticides such as paraquat and rotenone induce Parkinson-like neurodegeneration in the substantia nigra, primarily through mechanisms involving oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and dopaminergic neuron apoptosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Golf courses are frequently treated with pesticides to uphold the visual and maintenance standards of putting greens and fairways. In the United States, the amount of pesticide used on golf courses can be up to 15 times greater than that in European countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One anecdotal report has suggested that living near golf courses may increase the risk for PD. However, few studies have explored the role of pesticide exposure from golf courses on PD risk, said Krzyzanowski.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using the Rochester Epidemiology Project (REP) medical records linkage system, researchers identified patients with PD in Olmstead County, Minnesota, from 1991 to 2015. From medical records, a movement disorder specialist confirmed the PD diagnosis as well as the date of onset&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investigators used home addresses 2 or 3 years prior to PD symptom onset to allow for a delay between potential environmental exposure and development of PD. Address-level data provide the most accurate distance-to-exposure values.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study included 419 individuals with PD, median age of 73 years at diagnosis and 61% men, who were compared with 5113 age- and sex-matched control individuals without the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers collected data on 139 golf courses in the 27-county study region. Using satellite imagery, they manually digitized golf course data to confirm the correct placement of golf course boundaries in 2013, the earliest year relevant data were available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After adjusting for age, sex, race and ethnicity, index year (date of PD symptom onset for cases), household income, and urban or rural category, the study found living within one mile of a golf course was associated with 126% increased odds of PD (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 2.26; 95% CI, 1.09- 4.70; &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = .03) compared with those living more than 6 miles from a golf course.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analysis uncovered a modest dose response. The odds of PD increased by 198% at 1-2 miles (aOR, 2.98; 95% CI, 1.46-6.06; &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = .003), 121% at 2-3 miles (aOR, 2.21; 95% CI, 1.06-4.59; &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = .03), and 92% at 3-6 miles (aOR, 1.92; 95% CI, 0.91-4.04; &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = .09) compared with those living more than 6 miles away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contaminated Drinking Water?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A sensitivity analysis showed the link between proximity to golf course and PD was stronger in urban areas. The authors speculate that greater density surrounding golf courses in urban areas may lead to higher levels of airborne pollutant exposure to nearby residents&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers also assessed whether individuals received their drinking water from groundwater sources located either with, or without, a golf course or from private wells. Overall, 77.3% of the study population lived in areas served by groundwater-based water systems. They noted that pesticides used on golf courses can seep into groundwater, potentially contaminating drinking water supplies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results showed that individuals receiving tap water from groundwater service areas with a golf course had nearly a twofold increased risk for PD compared with those in groundwater areas without golf courses (aOR, 1.96; 95% CI, 1.20-3.23). They also had a 49% higher risk for PD than those using private wells as a drinking water source (aOR, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.05-2.13).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers acknowledged the water distribution process is complex and varies from city to city, so it’s possible not everyone within the same water service area shared the same water source&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The investigators also determined whether water services areas were within a vulnerable groundwater region, defined as those with coarse texture soils, shallow bedrock, or karst geology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Krzyzanowski explained that karst topography describes a region with limestone bedrock that slowly dissolves over time, creating underground voids that allow water from the surface to move more rapidly through it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This means that pesticides applied to grass or crops can more readily move into the groundwater supply after a rain,” the investigators noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analysis showed that individuals whose tap water was from service areas with a golf course located in vulnerable groundwater regions were 82% more likely to have PD compared with those in similar areas with a golf course but nonvulnerable groundwater (aOR, 1.82; 95% CI, 1.09-3.03).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study limitations included the restricted geographic scope of the population-based dataset and the predominantly White study population. In addition, the lack of occupational history data may have led to exposure misclassification, as some individuals may have spent significant time away from their home address. The study also did not account for other relevant risk factors for PD, such as head trauma or genetic predisposition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Experts Weigh In&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Commenting on the findings, David Dexter, PhD, director of Research, Parkinson’s United Kingdom, raised a number of other potential limitations of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement from the Science Media Center, which features expert comment on science news, Dexter noted the study didn’t restrict participants to those who lived permanently in the area, an important consideration as PD starts in the brain 10-15 years before diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This would not only affect participants’ exposure but also suggests their Parkinson’s could have started before they moved around a golf course,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dexter also noted that 80% of individuals with PD lived in urban areas compared with only 30% of control individuals, so other factors such as air pollution from motor vehicles could have accounted for some of the increased incidence of the disease. He also noted that the drinking water wasn’t analyzed for pesticide levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Commenting on the research for &lt;em&gt;Medscape Medical News&lt;/em&gt;, Michael S. Okun, MD, Adelaide Lackner professor of Neurology, University of Florida, and executive director, Norman Fixel Institute for Neurological Diseases, both in Gainesville, Florida, said the study’s findings “highlight a clear and urgent need to re-evaluate pesticide use on golf courses.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Okun, who is also medial advisor for the Parkinson’s Foundation said the link between proximity to golf courses and increased PD risk is “striking.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These results raise concerns about how chemicals applied for aesthetics may silently shape neurological health,” he said. The fact that pesticides used to keep golf courses pristine may be seeping into local water supplies and increasing PD risk “is a hidden hazard we can no longer ignore,” said Okun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Rochester Epidemiology Project is supported by the National Institute on Aging of the National Institutes of Health. Krzyzanowski, Okun, and Dexter reported no relevant conflicts of interest.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Medscape</author><pubDate>Fri, 09 May 2025 12:50:05 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirwFBVV95cUxNT09HTkdFOTJ0UzVlb2g4REo3MUU4OVRnSEVFdEExczZIdlZOeVhDa0IxZHNERFAweWZVU01wdTlXdU9sWFVxUFc0dXFWX2ZBblZDSzdlT01WXzlzdW9FM01ub2IxWDFsWjF5SEhUNFdVemplSk9nS0tXajlsN0xFLTdJdC1heU1EYzc5QWNiTTQtMktzcGZrVnVkdUtJREVCYmQ5UjkyakVhcDVEU1Ew</guid></item><item><title>业内人士对德克萨斯州麻疹疫情的看法：疫情-健康新闻- NPR | An Insider's View of the Texas Measles Outbreak : Shots - Health News - NPR</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiugFBVV95cUxNd3hwTEFGNHAzdGhRbm12cXZKRlF6Mkp3d2dzOUxoQndtcmlnTFdSMG5MTmpud0tkTWdWeGQ4NXBGeHhvbG9WbUNmY2p5ekdmV1d4YWNLU3JLbnNKNzZ2amFyUTluQjFHcGJkNV9pZkJVcDhLb3BZMXJXZWk2OUIya2hKMTk1YnZ5anRvanV2OGVhTWFSZzJGSkJERlBBNERRR011TURTVUhZUmJsNU9pR1lkMmg5dm54Rmc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="storytext" class="storytext storylocation linkLocation"&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;Katherine Wells has been an epidemiologist working to protect the public from disease outbreaks for 25 years. Until January, she had never encountered measles.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I mean, we considered measles eradicated in the United States," she said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Now, as public health director for Lubbock, Texas, Wells is at the center of a measles outbreak that has infected &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025" target="_blank"&gt;more than 700 people in Texas alone&lt;/a&gt;, sent more than 90 to the hospital and killed two otherwise healthy children.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The outbreak is &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2025/05/08/texas-measles-spread-oklahoma-new-mexico/" target="_blank"&gt;the largest since 2000&lt;/a&gt;, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Infections have surpassed the number of cases that occurred during a 2019 outbreak in New York, previously the largest one, the CDC said.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"It's frustrating," Wells said, "because we have the solution, which is a very effective vaccine."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Wells strongly believes her best chance to stop the viral infections is to &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/04/14/1244690933/vaccine-expert-worries-child-measles-deaths-are-being-normalized" target="_blank"&gt;boost vaccination&lt;/a&gt; across West Texas, where immunization rates among kindergarteners have dropped in many counties, as they have &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7341a3.htm" target="_blank"&gt;nationally&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;One of her toughest challenges: Anti-vaccine advocates have flooded the region with &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/04/23/nx-s1-5372760/measles-misinformation-poll" target="_blank"&gt;false claims&lt;/a&gt; about risks from vaccines. "They are moving ten times the speed we are," Wells told Tradeoffs when we caught up with her to talk about her experiences. Those false messages not only undermine the public's confidence in vaccines, she said, they sow distrust in public health more broadly.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Countering the misinformation takes money, Wells said, and the federal government — a reliable partner to local health officials in the past — has taken a step back. Wells' city and state abruptly lost federal public health funding in March when the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services cancelled more than $11 billion in grants nationwide. A spokesman for the state of Texas told Tradeoffs there aren't funds available to send to Lubbock, though the state has provided other types of support.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Wells isn't giving up. "We can't let that noise disrupt what we need to do," she said. "We still need to focus on our community. We need to get vaccines in arms, even if that takes having one-on-one conversations with individuals."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Below are highlights from our conversation with Wells, edited for length and clarity.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On the shock of facing a measles outbreak &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Public health always happens at 4:30 on a Friday afternoon. That afternoon my staff told me that we had two cases, two potential cases, of measles in the hospital. And that's not unusual. You always have doctors that see a rash and they want to test for measles. So I didn't think much of it. That next Monday, I'm actually on board for one of our community nonprofits, and I was sitting in that board meeting and the woman next to me said, 'My husband is a trainer of paramedics out in the rural areas and yesterday he told me that there was a lot of measles in Gaines County.' I literally got up out of my seat, walked out and started making some phone calls.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It was scary. I'm going, well, am I overreacting or is this really something? But my gut feeling inside said there's something more going on. … If you underreact, then it's so contagious, it's just like exponential growth. So you want to get in as quickly as possible and figure out exactly how many cases there are. What's going on, on the ground? Are there other sick individuals? How can we make sure it stays in that one community and doesn't spread to other communities out in the region?&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On the ways  federal upheaval has complicated the measles fight&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;We're watching the CDC, HHS colleagues being laid off. All of this uncertainty. … I don't know what's going to be cut, what public health's going to look like at the local level.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But we have this team of people coming into work, seven days a week, helping families that are impacted with measles, combating the misinformation about vaccines, working with our providers who are needing to get children tested or adults tested, talking to businesses that might have had a measles exposure.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;That core public health work is continuing. And that's just an amazing workforce that's getting, you know, beat up in the national media, accused of their job not being important. But these people, because of their caring for the community, are continuing to show up every day, day in and day out, and making sure that the work that needs to happen during a measles outbreak happens.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On facing the 'machine' that's churning out vaccine disinformation &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It is definitely a challenge. I almost call it a misinformation machine. … It's just hard to keep up with &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/04/23/nx-s1-5372760/measles-misinformation-poll" target="_blank"&gt;the messaging&lt;/a&gt;. You feel like you combat one bullet point on some kind of false information and then they pivot and find another. … You're watching the Children's Health Defense swoop in and start talking to the parents of the children who have died — giving false hope to a community and peddling cod liver oil and vitamin A.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Being healthy — or taking these supplements — is not going to prevent your child from getting measles. And we don't know which child is going to have severe complications from measles. We don't know who's going to end up in the hospital and we don't know, unfortunately, which child may die.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On how to help people who are afraid of vaccines  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Trying to get somebody to take an injection when they're not sick, to prevent illness, just causes a lot of fear of the unknown. I've talked to a lot of parents that have said, "Well, we never had measles or polio or mumps in our community. So why, even if the risk for vaccines is so minuscule, why even take that risk if that disease doesn't exist?" We're seeing more physicians in our community willing to speak up on the importance of vaccine, more physicians willing to take the time with their patients to have those conversations.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;I think the one that really touched my heart was a mother with five young children, who had never vaccinated her children before. … She felt comfortable enough to come in and have that conversation with one of our nurses and got all five children vaccinated against measles with the MMR. … So we are getting through to individuals. It's just a slow process. She's just one of many parents that are now coming into the public health department — because we are that trusted messenger — to get the vaccine. … It's uplifting. You're so exhausted. I mean, we have worked three months straight without a day off, and it just gives you that boost of energy again— and some hope.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On cultivating community for the future of public health&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It makes me want to double down on my work in public health. … Ten years from now, I hope that the narrative around vaccines is changed and we're back into a place where people can trust science and trust public health, and listen to those messages, and believe in community.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;I still have some hope for all of this. There are 2,000 other health department directors out here, in the United States, who do this work day in and day out. And public health really happens on that local level – with individuals who know their community and want to make their community a better place.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dan Gorenstein is executive editor and Melanie Evans is a reporter for &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://tradeoffs.org/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Tradeoffs&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, a nonprofit news organization that reports on health care's toughest choices.

    &lt;p&gt;A sprinkle of cinnamon on your porridge, a pinch of turmeric in your curry, or a dash of ginger in your biscuits – these popular spices are kitchen staples around the world. For centuries, spices haven’t just been used to flavour food but also valued in traditional Ayurvedic and Chinese medicine for &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4003790/"&gt;their healing properties&lt;/a&gt;. But could something as innocent as a spoonful of spice interfere with your medication?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/cinnamon"&gt;Take cinnamon&lt;/a&gt;, for example. Sourced from the bark of Cinnamomum trees, it contains active compounds like cinnamaldehyde, eugenol and coumarin. Cinnamon oil, derived from the bark or leaves, is often used in food flavouring, fragrances and herbal remedies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cinnamon has been linked to a range of potential health benefits: it’s rich in antioxidants, it may reduce inflammation, it helps &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10708057/#main-content"&gt;regulate blood sugar levels&lt;/a&gt;, it &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1756464622001153?via%3Dihub"&gt;lowers the risk&lt;/a&gt; of heart disease, and even improves brain function. Traditionally, it’s also been used &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4003790/"&gt;to ease digestion&lt;/a&gt; and ward off infections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666566224000443?via%3Dihub"&gt;a recent study&lt;/a&gt; from the University of Mississippi has raised concerns that cinnamon could reduce the effectiveness of certain medications. In lab tests, cinnamaldehyde was found to activate receptors that speed up how drugs are cleared from the body – potentially making them less effective. While this research is still in the early stages and hasn’t yet been tested in humans, it raises important questions about how cinnamon interacts with modern medicines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The type of cinnamon matters too. The cinnamon commonly found in supermarkets – cassia cinnamon – is cheaper, widely available and comes from parts of Asia. Ceylon cinnamon, often labelled as “&lt;a href="https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/cinnamon"&gt;true cinnamon&lt;/a&gt;,” originates from Sri Lanka and is generally more expensive. Cassia cinnamon contains higher levels of coumarin, a natural compound that can harm the liver in high doses, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9783661/"&gt;according to studies.&lt;/a&gt; Coumarin is also a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210261222004254"&gt;known anticoagulant&lt;/a&gt;, meaning it helps prevent blood clots, which is useful in medicine but risky when combined with blood-thinning drugs like warfarin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
            &lt;p class="placeholder-container"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There have been &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2468600X21000177"&gt;a few case reports&lt;/a&gt; suggesting that cinnamon supplements could increase the risk of bleeding when taken with anticoagulants. This is probably due to coumarin affecting liver enzymes responsible for breaking down drugs like warfarin. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8144503/"&gt;Some research&lt;/a&gt; also suggests cinnamon could potentially interact with other medications, including painkillers, antidepressants, anti-cancer drugs and diabetes medications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But before you throw out your spice rack, it’s important to remember: the risks come from high doses, particularly in supplement form. A light sprinkle of cinnamon on your porridge is unlikely to cause problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Small doses&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another spice with medicinal promise – and potential risks – &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/pharmacology/articles/10.3389/fphar.2020.01021/full"&gt;is turmeric&lt;/a&gt;. Known for its vivid yellow colour and use in both cooking and traditional medicine, turmeric contains curcumin, a compound praised for its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, information on turmeric’s interactions with medications is still limited. Most of what we know comes from lab and animal studies, which don’t always translate directly to humans. Still, there’s evidence that curcumin can affect how some drugs are metabolised, particularly by interfering with liver enzymes. This means it could &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28734960/"&gt;potentially interact&lt;/a&gt; with antidepressants, blood pressure medications, chemotherapy drugs and certain antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turmeric also has natural blood thinning properties, which &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/pharmacology/articles/10.3389/fphar.2020.01021/full"&gt;could amplify&lt;/a&gt; the effects of medications like warfarin or aspirin. &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/pharmacology/articles/10.3389/fphar.2020.01021/full"&gt;Animal studies suggest&lt;/a&gt; turmeric may also lower blood sugar, meaning it could increase the effects of anti-diabetic drugs or insulin. Additionally, turmeric has been shown to &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/pharmacology/articles/10.3389/fphar.2020.01021/full"&gt;reduce blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;, which, when combined with blood pressure medications, could cause an excessive drop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with cinnamon, these effects are most often linked to high dose supplements, not the small amounts used in food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
            &lt;p class="placeholder-container"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ginger is another spice celebrated for its health benefits, particularly its anti-nausea and anti-inflammatory effects. But its active compounds, &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/books/NBK565886/"&gt;including gingerol&lt;/a&gt;, may also influence how your body handles medications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ginger can act as a mild blood thinner, which means combining it with anticoagulants could raise the risk of bleeding. The &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2405457724002171"&gt;evidence is mixed&lt;/a&gt; when it comes to ginger and diabetes: while &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/books/NBK565886/"&gt;some studies suggest&lt;/a&gt; it may lower blood sugar, more research is needed to fully understand the effect it may have when taken alongside anti-diabetic medications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;High doses&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While lab studies suggest these spices may affect how the body processes certain medications, the vast majority of these effects have been observed in high doses –usually from supplements, not everyday cooking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re taking medications, especially blood thinners, diabetes medicines, or chemotherapy drugs, it’s worth having a quick chat with your doctor or pharmacist before starting any new herbal supplements. But for most people, using spices in typical culinary amounts is safe – and a delicious way to add both flavour and potential health benefits to your meals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So go ahead: sprinkle, pinch, or dash – just be mindful of what’s in your medicine cabinet – and be wary of taking any herbal supplement in high does.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

They are in the water you drink, food you eat, air you breathe, and have even entered your heart (literally). Scientists have found microplastics in human heart tissues. A &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38446676/" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; involving over 200 surgery patients revealed that nearly 60% had microplastics or even smaller nanoplastics in a major artery. Those with plastic particles were 4.5 times more likely to suffer a heart attack, stroke, or death within roughly 34 months post-surgery compared to individuals whose arteries contained no plastic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Robert G. DeBease, a Doctor of Traditional Naturopathy and Chiropractic with 27 years of practice, is sounding the alarm and has shared practical solutions to detoxify these harmful particles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Microplastics are now being found in the human heart, and the more you have, the higher your risk of a heart attack. They’re not just in your water bottles or food packaging… they’re now turning up in your brain, lungs, gut, testes—and even your blood,” Dr. DeBease, who has over 1.2 million followers on Instagram, wrote in a post. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. DeBease, who has dedicated his career to holistic health, emphasizes that while microplastics are pervasive, their impact can be mitigated. He recommends four evidence-based strategies to reduce microplastic accumulation and protect long-term health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Fri, 09 May 2025 12:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi8wFBVV95cUxOMVBxbFRtQXkzU2V0dXhPN2R4bjFCMThocUZxZ3VyVjRiNFU4RnV0UE5kVlBxeUFJbVMzMmxYUGRBMVRRVWh2SXd3cXh0ZEhPbkNpRmd2dEVfZ2h1RWhkTnY1RXc4TC1tNU5uWkVLa0ZCdU9MY0JfUnFfdmpwMm9nN2VvVm5Kd1VKcEdUeldJeW1jR0JRdVYtcVRUOHFacElQY0dtZlBzREV2dkkwOFBiRmwtXzNFX3kzQVFHazBlNWw1QkxKcUpfRFZZdWFjUEFSN0dzN0d3Ri01YlZlOEwwR3NFVGpDdzB6aU5GaHRJNExyZ0U</guid></item><item><title>B族维生素可能阻止青光眼进展-神经科学新闻 | B Vitamins May Halt Glaucoma Progression - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZkFVX3lxTE56dmt3SV9rX0kyV2lDWXdOb3YxdjJKMks2TnhqaU5aTDQ0ZzFfeW9KaGxVVjVQSU1DdXhGVFBzRF84YVhGM2F0NjNrSW9XeUFOWDVJeThDOXJnR1VOb3hNVWJpREtBd9IBa0FVX3lxTE1zeGJQUXpNWkpNTWxDcEhBalc4cDQ1eENBVnV6YlVpQ05zQVRXR29vb0xYSVpxM1hoaVVZTG5jYUVCdDVLVTlhTjBhcmVoT3BfY3VKeVhiQWl6Y2s1c3F2MUppT1hlaE0weWZF?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;Glaucoma damages the optic nerve and is usually managed by reducing eye pressure, though treatment effects vary. Researchers have long suspected a link with homocysteine, but new findings reveal it is a bystander, not a driver of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, metabolic disruptions affecting the retina’s vitamin use appear key, prompting scientists to test vitamin B6, B9, B12, and choline supplements in animal models. Remarkably, this vitamin mix halted or slowed nerve damage without reducing eye pressure, and a clinical trial is now underway to test its potential in humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Homocysteine Role Debunked:&lt;/strong&gt; High homocysteine does not drive glaucoma but reflects metabolic changes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vitamin Therapy Promising:&lt;/strong&gt; B vitamin and choline supplements halted or slowed optic nerve damage in rodents.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Human Trials Begun:&lt;/strong&gt; A clinical trial is now recruiting patients to test this approach in slowing glaucoma progression.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Karolinska Institute&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In glaucoma, the optic nerve is gradually damaged, leading to vision loss and, in the worst cases, blindness. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;High pressure in the eye drives the disease, and eye drops, laser treatment or surgery are therefore used to lower the pressure in the eye and thus slow down the disease. Unfortunately, however, the effect varies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109682"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/glaucoma-b-vitamins-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/glaucoma-b-vitamins-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/glaucoma-b-vitamins-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/glaucoma-b-vitamins-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/glaucoma-b-vitamins-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/glaucoma-b-vitamins-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/glaucoma-b-vitamins-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/glaucoma-b-vitamins-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows an eye." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/glaucoma-b-vitamins-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/glaucoma-b-vitamins-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/glaucoma-b-vitamins-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/glaucoma-b-vitamins-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/glaucoma-b-vitamins-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/glaucoma-b-vitamins-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/glaucoma-b-vitamins-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;In experiments on mice and rats with glaucoma, the researchers gave supplements of the B vitamins B6, B9 and B12, as well as choline. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Glaucoma researchers have long theorised that the substance homocysteine is somehow relevant to understanding the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, researchers at Karolinska Institutet have investigated the role of homocysteine in several ways. In the current study, the researchers discovered that when rats with glaucoma were given elevated levels of homocysteine, their disease did not worsen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also found that high levels of homocysteine in the blood of people with glaucoma did not correlate with how quickly the disease progressed, and that glaucoma was not more common in people with a genetic susceptibility to forming high levels of homocysteine. Based on these findings, the researchers concluded that homocysteine does not drive the disease but is a consequence of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since homocysteine is a natural part of the body’s metabolism, the researchers wanted to investigate metabolic pathways involving homocysteine in both rodents and humans with glaucoma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They then saw several abnormalities, the most important of which were metabolic changes linked to the retina’s ability to use certain vitamins. This change meant that metabolism was slowed down locally in the retina – and this played a role in the development of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘Our conclusion is that homocysteine is a bystander in the disease process, not a player. Altered homocysteine levels may reveal that the retina has lost its ability to use certain vitamins that are necessary to maintain healthy metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That’s why we wanted to investigate whether supplements of these vitamins could protect the retina,’ says co-lead on the paper James Tribble, researcher and assistant professor at the Department of Clinical Neuroscience at Karolinska Institutet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In experiments on mice and rats with glaucoma, the researchers gave supplements of the B vitamins B6, B9 and B12, as well as choline. This had a positive effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In mice that had a slower developing glaucoma, the damage to the optic nerve was completely halted. In rats, which had a more aggressive form of the disease with faster progression, the disease was slowed down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In these experiments, eye pressure was left untreated, which the researchers highlight as particularly interesting – it suggests that the vitamin mix affects the disease in a different way than lowering eye pressure does.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘The results are so promising that we have started a clinical trial, with patients already being recruited at S:t Eriks Eye Hospital in Stockholm,’ says James Tribble.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both patients with primary open-angle glaucoma (slower progression) and pseudoexfoliation glaucoma (faster progression) are included.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read more about the clinical trial here.

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'This is what early stages of ALS looks like.

But these can worsen rapidly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some people may live for up to 10 years, and, in rarer circumstances, even longer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The exact cause is largely unknown, but current research points towards a complex interplay of genetic, environmental, and possibly lifestyle factors—and it often hits seemingly fit and healthy people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Last year, Leeds Rhinos star Rob Burrow, 41, died after a four-and-a-half-year battle with the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Locked-in syndrome (LIS) is a rare neurological disorder that can also occur in some progressive cases of ALS. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Fri, 09 May 2025 12:21:25 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>带状疱疹疫苗可将心脏病风险降低23 ％ ，对100万人的研究发现- CNN | Shingles vaccine reduces risk of heart disease by 23%, study of one million people finds - CNN</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiwFBVV95cUxPOUQ4QlpPMFhGcm9rdmw3a08tTWtDVjdMbFV5UU1wWG1Sb2kwVlMzbjJQR1VBYWt4S3Z1ZUxaNFNHbXkwX2lJSEJOMElyT0pLMGtvRTRFSlhITm1QUUdXS25qMXJsN2x4WGoxcVhrT0tTWDhrdmVSUDN2YVBlS0RhY255UmJzLVR5LWkw0gGQAUFVX3lxTE12RlN5enAzR19hUENlNHVDei1kYmRMZ1p6Ul85V1RhRzZPczJGSEdzWDM4d3BQSXZqYjh5OUdCSVQwVmJDTW9NY2xNN19kd1lXcVZiVk1yMGlTSE9GZld4ZkVOODd4b21LZ19JX2dyV1VSMVA3SE1oaktlUWRMd1FQRFlvZk9VVWp2d192SFJObA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;

            Getting the shingles vaccine could do more than just prevent a painful red rash — it may also lower the risk of heart disease and stroke, according to a new South Korean study of more than one million people published in the &lt;a href="https://www.escardio.org/The-ESC/Press-Office/Press-releases/shingles-vaccine-lowers-the-risk-of-heart-disease-for-up-to-eight-years" target="_blank"&gt;European Heart Journal.&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmafvq9ir00023j6n1tncd0rs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/shingles/data-research/index.html#:~:text=About%201%20in%203%20people,have%20shingles%20more%20than%20once." target="_blank"&gt;highly common&lt;/a&gt; herpes strain, also called varicella-zoster virus (VZV), can cause chickenpox in childhood and later develop into shingles in older or immuno-compromised adults. The shingles vaccine is already considered a top-line defense against the virus, but &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/16/health/shingles-vaccine-dementia-prevention-wellness"&gt;recent studies&lt;/a&gt; have pointed to other unexpected health benefits.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmafvq9ir00033j6nwhe2j6s8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            An analysis of health outcomes for 1,271,922 people age 50 and older found a 23% lower risk of cardiovascular disease among those who were vaccinated for shingles. The reduced risk was most noticeable up to eight years after vaccination among males, people under 60, and even those with “unhealthy lifestyles,” such as chronic smoking or drinking, according to the May 6 study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmafvq9ir00043j6num94p1sl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Since shingles can cause inflammation in blood vessels and lead to blood clots, which in turn raise the risk of heart disease, preventing shingles through vaccination might also help reduce these cardiovascular risks,” explained Hayeon Lee, a coauthor and researcher from the Lee Kyung Hee University College of Medicine in an email. It’s also possible that the nerve damage caused by shingles could disturb the heart’s rhythm, leading to irregular palpitations and even cardiac arrest, per the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmafvq9ir00053j6ne1o0v4er@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The vaccine may be better at preventing shingles in younger patients and males because of their more robust immune systems, Lee said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmafvq9ir00063j6nkbc2werc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “If a vaccine helps lower the risk of both infection and serious chronic conditions, it becomes an even more valuable public health tool,” Lee said. “This study supports a broader understanding of vaccination — not just as a shield against infectious diseases, but as part of a more comprehensive approach to maintaining long-term health.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmafvq9ir00073j6n6v862hzn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            More research is needed to determine a direct causal link between vaccination and reduced cardiovascular event risk, but this analysis is the largest and most comprehensive so far, presenting a compelling case for those on the fence about vaccination, said Dr. Sharon Curhan, a physician and epidemiologist at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, who was not involved in the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmafvq9ir00083j6nws7v0690@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Since this herpes strain can lie dormant in the body for years after exposure before it reactivates into shingles, you don’t need a history of chickenpox to get the vaccine, Curhan said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmafvq9ir00093j6n5svhtw3p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In fact, more than 99% of adults age 50 years and older worldwide have been exposed to VZV, and many may not have had, or known they had chickenpox at all, according to estimates from the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/shingles/hcp/vaccine-considerations/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmafvq9ir000b3j6n62pr2p9a@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Patients from the study used an older variation of the shingles vaccine that is being phased out of most countries.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmafvq9ir000c3j6nspj3km9b@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The live zoster vaccine, no longer available in the US &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/shingles/hcp/vaccine-considerations/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;as of 2020&lt;/a&gt;, contains a living but weakened form of the virus used to generate an immune response. It’s since been swapped for Shingrix, a two-shot recombinant zoster vaccine containing only part of the virus — which has shown to be more effective.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmafvq9ir000d3j6nklet201u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            More research is needed to compare the various health benefits of these different vaccine variations, said Dr. Pascal Geldsetzer, an assistant professor of medicine at Stanford University who was not involved in the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmafvq9ir000e3j6n0busxm50@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The biggest limitation of this type of research is that you’re essentially comparing people who get vaccinated to those who don’t get vaccinated,” Geldsetzer said. “We know that those people who decide to get vaccinated are often very different from those who don’t in their health motivations and behaviors.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmafvq9ir000f3j6n7y3j4zx5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Researchers were able to sort for several demographic variables such as age, sex, income level and pre-existing conditions like high blood pressure, diabetes and high cholesterol. They also considered the frequency of medical visits and use of specific medications based on national insurance records, Lee said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmafvq9ir000g3j6nop1mg1ig@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Still, some variables, like diet, other vaccinations, and proper adherence to treatments, can always slip through the cracks in non-clinical trials which use large data sets like the one used in this study, Geldsetzer said. For this reason, he hopes future studies can be randomized and use data from a clinical setting.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmafvq9ir000h3j6nptuep5ys@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Additionally, Lee said future research should observe more racially and ethnically diverse populations, as immune responses can vary across different populations.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmafvq9ir000j3j6nlcctus08@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            These findings follow several other studies identifying the possible health benefits of shingles vaccination.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmafvq9ir000k3j6nzqiuk6bk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In April, Geldsetzer and a team of researchers from Stanford published &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08800-x" target="_blank"&gt;a study&lt;/a&gt; that found people who received the vaccine had a 20% reduced risk of dementia compared with those who didn’t get it.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmafvq9ir000l3j6nkmesiz7e@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This study took advantage of a “natural experiment” after Wales rolled out its shingles vaccination program in 2013. Due to limited vaccine supply, government officials decided that only Welsh adults born on or after a very specific date would be eligible, so researchers could directly compare the health outcomes of two groups of individuals over time while limiting covariables.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmafvq9ir000m3j6nnk6d2kfh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This is likely because shingles doesn’t just cause inflammation in the blood vessels, said Geldsetzer. It also inflames nerves throughout the body, which can lead to long-lasting pain disorders and, in the case of dementia, brain tissue damage.
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

Alarming research has shown their presence in human blood, saliva and vital organs like the liver, kidneys and placenta. Recently, they've even been found in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="u-speakableText-p2"&gt;A recent study published in Nature Medicine and &lt;a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2025/02/03/health/plastics-inside-human-brain-wellness/index.html" target="_self"&gt;reported by CNN&lt;/a&gt; found significantly higher concentrations of &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-03453-1" target="_self"&gt;microplastics in cadaver brain samples&lt;/a&gt; compared to liver and kidney tissues. Even more concerning, brain tissue from dementia patients in the study showed up to 10 times more microplastic buildup than tissue from healthy brains -- underscoring just how deeply these particles can embed themselves in our bodies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The good news is you can take steps to minimize your microplastic intake. Before you cook your next meal, let's head to the &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/home/kitchen-and-household/best-cookware-sets/" target="_self"&gt;kitchen&lt;/a&gt; and see which items among your food and cookware may be secretly hiding microplastics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Are microplastics harmful?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microplastics have become a serious problem for pollution, and now scientists worry about the potential health effects too. An estimated &lt;a href="https://www.ciel.org/breathing-plastic-the-health-impacts-of-invisible-plastics-in-the-air/" target="_self"&gt;22,000,000 micro and nanoplastics&lt;/a&gt; are inhaled by humans each year, and that is largely because they are so hard to avoid. You are exposed to microplastics in &lt;a href="https://hsc.unm.edu/news/2024/08/hsc-newsroom-post-minimizing-microplastics.html" target="_self"&gt;three ways&lt;/a&gt;: inhalation, ingestion or touch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microplastics &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2309822?query=featured_home" target="_self"&gt;have been shown&lt;/a&gt; to cause a number of issues in the human body. Microplastics and nanoplastics found in blood vessels &lt;a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/whats-lurking-in-your-body-mayo-researchers-probing-health-risks-of-tiny-plastic-particles/" target="_self"&gt;have been linked&lt;/a&gt; to an increased risk of heart attack, stroke and, in severe cases, even death. Tissue inflammation, cell death and lung and liver impacts &lt;a href="https://magazine.hms.harvard.edu/articles/microplastics-everywhere" target="_self"&gt;have all been noted&lt;/a&gt;. In animals and marine life, it also can cause oxidative and DNA damage, as well as cancer. Mice were shown to have reduced sperm count, ovarian scarring and hereditary metabolic disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-all-top spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much is still unknown about the exact effects of microplastics, but studies so far have been sobering.

Australian researchers &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S004896972205392X" target="_self"&gt;estimate&lt;/a&gt; that Teflon-coated cookware contains thousands, maybe millions, of microplastic particles, while a simple crack or fracture in your pan &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S004896972205392X" target="_self"&gt;could mean&lt;/a&gt; exposure to over two million microplastic particles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Plastic food containers&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your Uber delivery could inadvertently be damaging your health, and it has nothing to do with what you order. With the rise of home delivery services, plastic containers are more common than ever, but these containers &lt;a href="https://www.ewg.org/news-insights/news/2023/11/safer-storage-avoiding-microplastic-concerns-while-managing-holiday" target="_self"&gt;can easily add&lt;/a&gt; microplastics to your food when heated or washed. One study found that all reusable plastic takeout containers typically used by restaurants contain microplastics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Plastic utensils&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large c-shortcodeImage-hasCaption"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_caption g-inner-spacing-right-small g-text-xxsmall"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plastic utensils can leach microplastics into your food when exposed to high heat levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Kinga Krzeminska/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies also show that plastic utensils &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016041202400326X" target="_self"&gt;release microplastics&lt;/a&gt; into your food, especially when used with hotter foods. When you ingest the food, you also ingest microplastics that settle into your body and bloodstream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Tea bags&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;It may come as a surprise, but microplastics could be hiding in your tea bags. When you brew tea, the bag is exposed to extremely high temperatures that &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10389239/" target="_self"&gt;can release&lt;/a&gt; its microplastics. This comes from polypropylene, a key component in the manufacturing of tea bags. Researchers at Spain's Autonomous University of Barcelona found that billions of microplastic and nanoplastic particles &lt;a href="https://www.uab.cat/web/newsroom/news-detail/-1345830290613.html?detid=1345940427095" target="_self"&gt;are released&lt;/a&gt; from a single tea bag for every millimeter of water it is submerged in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large c-shortcodeImage-hasCaption"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_caption g-inner-spacing-right-small g-text-xxsmall"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research has shown that a single plastic tea bag can release billions of microplastic fragments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Zarina Lukash/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Certain spices&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Depending on how it is packaged, that bottle of paprika could be full of microplastics. Many spices today use plastic packaging, which is concerning because one recent study found microplastics in all plastic containers tested. This can result in food contamination, which &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0269749122019613" target="_self"&gt;has increased&lt;/a&gt; in recent decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Plastic straws&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plastic straws are especially concerning because &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2772416623000992" target="_self"&gt;studies show&lt;/a&gt; that they release microplastics and nanoplastics, which can then be directly inhaled. Unfortunately, plastic straws are extremely prevalent, with about eight million metric tons of plastic &lt;a href="https://www.nrdc.org/stories/single-use-plastics-101" target="_self"&gt;found in waterways&lt;/a&gt; each year. Once these straws and other plastics are in the water, they can affect not just the water but also the soil and animals found in it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Canned food linings&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;BPA was a controversial &lt;a href="https://www.ewg.org/news-insights/news/bpa-update-tracking-canned-food-phaseout" target="_self"&gt;material used&lt;/a&gt; in the manufacturing of canned food linings that could cause serious health effects. Today, non-BPA acrylic or polyester epoxies are more commonly used, but these are not proven safe either, as they too contain microplastics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kitchen material swaps to reduce microplastics&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Luckily, you have alternatives. Before putting on your apron, consider adding these items to your kitchen to lower your risk of exposure to microplastics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Wooden or stainless spatulas&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are alternatives to plastic spatulas. Consider trying out a &lt;a href="https://www.earlywooddesigns.com/products/wooden-kitchen-utensil-set" target="_self"&gt;wooden utensil set&lt;/a&gt; or one made from stainless steel. This can significantly reduce your exposure to microplastics while upgrading your used utensils.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Wooden or stainless steel utensils&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of plastic utensils, try to use stainless steel utensils that can be better for the body and also the environment. Wooden utensils can also be a great substitute, working as a more eco-friendly option for your kitchen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Glass or stainless steel food containers&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can't do much about how restaurants choose to package their food, but you can avoid using them in the future. At home, try to stick to glass, ceramic and stainless steel containers to skip the microplastics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Loose tea leaves and strainers or infusers&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tea bags can be filled with plastic, but a safer alternative could be loose tea leaves. Many companies nowadays offer loose tea leaves that can be used with a stainless steel strainer or infuser, which works the same as a tea bag but can be much healthier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Spices in bulk or glass containers&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To avoid potential contamination from your spices, switch to glass or ceramic packaging instead. This allows your spices to remain on your shelf without being infused with potentially harmful microplastics that can seep into your food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Reusable metal or bamboo straws&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plastic straws take a toll on both the environment and your body, causing serious issues for both. A better alternative would be metal or bamboo straws that can be washed and reused. Even paper straws are a better alternative than plastic ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-original c-shortcodeImage-hasCaption"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_caption g-inner-spacing-right-small g-text-xxsmall"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reusable metal or bamboo straws are great alternatives to plastic ones. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Luliia Bondar/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Fresh produce or frozen produce&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plastic linings in canned food can hold microplastics, so to eliminate your exposure, look for foods that are packaged in glass instead. You can also opt to use fresh and frozen foods and produce that skips the packaging altogether.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Cast iron, carbon steel or stainless steel cookware&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plastic cookware is common in many kitchens, but there are alternatives. Products like &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/home/kitchen-and-household/best-stainless-steel-skillet/" target="_self"&gt;stainless steel skillets&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/home/kitchen-and-household/best-frying-pan/" target="_self"&gt; frying pans&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/home/kitchen-and-household/lighter-cast-iron-frying-pan-options/" target="_self"&gt;cast iron pans&lt;/a&gt; can all be great ways to upgrade your cookware without risking further exposure to microplastics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The bottom line&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microplastics can lurk in our kitchens, hiding in our cookware and utensils and making their way into our food. Though research continues, microplastics have been shown to cause damage to the human body, causing huge concerns over the products we use and the materials used to make them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, hope is not lost.

According to Triathlete, advanced sports dietitian Taryn Richardson believes athletes may be &lt;a href="https://www.triathlete.com/nutrition/microplastics-in-sports-nutrition/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:more exposed to these microscopic threats;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;more exposed to these microscopic threats &lt;/a&gt;than most.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;What's happening?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;While exposure to microplastics is unavoidable no matter who you are, they surround athletes almost by necessity. Athletes eat plastic-wrapped nutrition bars and drink from plastic water bottles, as they're lightweight and easily handled mid-training or during competition. They wear lightweight, elastic, breathable gear made from plastic materials. They spend plenty of time out in open air and in the water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Adding to this is the fact that when athletes sweat, their pores open up, making it even easier for microplastics to enter their bodies. This all adds up to a potentially significant health risk that Richardson believes may continue to grow as we learn more about microplastics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"It's going to get bigger from here," Richardson told Triathlete. "We've only just been able to quantify [microplastics] in human blood. We're only just beginning."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;Why is understanding microplastics important?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Microplastics are tiny plastic particles one nanometer to five millimeters in size that are either intentionally manufactured or created as larger plastic products break down. They can be found just about anywhere you can imagine: the ocean, the air, the land, our food — even our blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In 2022, microplastics were &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160412022001258" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:measured in human blood;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;measured in human blood&lt;/a&gt; for the first time ever, raising many serious questions about their impact on our health. We know that some plastics contain toxic chemicals and that clogged arteries are potentially deadly, so it follows that microplastics might be seriously dangerous. The science is not entirely clear on this yet, but studies have made some unsettling connections between microplastics and serious illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;A recent review of almost 3,000 studies determined that microplastics can potentially contribute to everything from respiratory illness to neurodegenerative diseases to cancer and more. While we don't truly know the extent of these connections, nor the long-term effects of microplastics in the body, this information it's alarming to say the least. It's also critical to know if we want to make informed decisions about our health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;What's being done about plastic pollution?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Our plastic problem is an overwhelming one, but some brilliant people out there are working to find solutions — such as the Oak Ridge National Laboratory researchers who recently developed a more effective plastic recycling process that creates less emissions and uses less energy or the scientists who figured out how to convert plastic into asphalt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Join our &lt;a href="https://www.thecooldown.com/tech-newsletter/?recmNOkhbOTwfKZqN" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:free newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;free newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for weekly updates on the latest innovations &lt;strong&gt;improving our lives&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;shaping our future&lt;/strong&gt;, and don't miss &lt;a href="https://rb.gy/ivhzmj" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:this cool list;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;this cool list&lt;/a&gt; of easy ways to help yourself while helping the planet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Fri, 09 May 2025 11:30:55 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinwFBVV95cUxNYVpuYUNLem02WkFMcWFSS09mMTRvRC1QR0Q2eXIwcUxWT0xOaHJKZWstRHp6c1AyZDBvalBmMGp1OHRUQWVxTndTaXZTNFp4R1pyaTI1dFNHbnN1bUdTMGppMUhNX01BUjR1QUJOdUhXQ2c1b3RreFpoaHRaZ3VrVE9qbDZhV05TTFVqZmh2WldPZzhTclVVVmJHYlkxQVE</guid></item><item><title>歌手患有毁灭性的“副作用” ，服用Ozempic一年后无法逆转- LADbible | Singer suffers devastating 'side-effect' that can't be reversed after taking Ozempic for one year - LADbible</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMisAFBVV95cUxQUjEtWE9HV01kRElOTk5qSEcwUUY2MW0xV2ZSUjdJSDRXdnc0OHVTZWduQ1JUcjBFeE1FSl9CM0VLRWFEUFozRl9maF9ZaTZNcGdSV1FuR2JEZVJyZFJ6RTNnYnhlWWNtX3FFcVliOTJfUzUyQ0VWU1kzZ1MtQm95X3NoejJGdDRJekVmYi1iVWNGUG83cjFGR1hnazgyT0Nrc3M2bU84bExEX20xZF9rTQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;A singer has shared the heartbreaking health issues she is facing as a result of taking Ozempic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Avery is known for &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/music"&gt;songs&lt;/a&gt; such as 'Go Screw Yourself (GSY) and 'Meant to Live', but the artist took to &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/social-media"&gt;social media&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year to reveal that after just one year of taking Type-2 diabetes medication Ozempic, she has been left with complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;In a candid video on &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/instagram"&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt;, she said it all 'explains why I’m in pain all the time' after a trip to the doctors'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;The &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/us-news"&gt;American&lt;/a&gt; artist claimed: "I have significant bone loss," adding in the caption that she has 'osteoperosis in some parts' of the body and 'osteopenia' in others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Osteoperosis is when bones get thinner and weaker, while Ostepenia is to do with bone density loss. However, &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/health"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; professionals have now explained if this is linked to the controversial medication, which has recently been used by a number of &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/celebrity"&gt;celebrities&lt;/a&gt; for weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-image_articleImage__eyzAn"&gt;&lt;cite class="image-credit_imageCredit__YMlqS"&gt;Avery shared that she is having bone issues after taking Ozempic (Instagram/@avery)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Doctor Myro, a medical expert with over 879,000 subscribers on YouTube, admitted that people on Ozempic actually get osteoporosis 'all the time'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;But he pointed out: "There currently is no evidence that it's [Ozempic] that's causing that osteoporosis. It is a disease of skinny people, less body weight, less pressure on the bones, less bone density."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;He added that when you lose weight in any capacity, you also lose some bone too, along with muscle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;The doctor pointed out: "Doing it without weight training and proper nutrition with lots of protein, huge mistake."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Healthline further state &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.healthline.com/health-news/ozempic-muscle-mass-loss#What-the-science-says-about-sarcopenia-and-GLP-1-drugs-like-Ozempic"&gt;that&lt;/a&gt; people that take glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/drugs"&gt;drugs&lt;/a&gt; such as Ozempic, Wegovy and Mounjaro can experience rapid weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;“According to a clinical trial of Ozempic, after 68 weeks on the medication, 86.4% of participants lost 5% or more of their body weight, and 69.1% lost 10% or more of their body weight,” the website stated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Losing weight can bring on a number of health benefits, but this can also bring on a decrease in muscle mass and a lower bone density, the health experts explain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;There are still no studies that explicitly link a reduced bone density with GLP-1 drugs, but it is said that significant weight loss can lead to bone loss, which can then lead to Sarcopenia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Dr Rekha Kumar, an endocrinologist in NYC and Chief Medical Officer of Found, explained to Healthline: "Sarcopenia affects the elderly population and typically is associated with aging.

Up to 30 per cent of men in the UK are said to be affected by the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Studies suggest it normally takes men about five-and-a-half minutes to orgasm during sex. But for about one in three, this occurs within three minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists say that both psychological and physical factors can lead to the problem, including stress, depression and anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;One 2014 study detailed the benefits of kegels for men dealing with lifelong premature ejaculation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However it is said that a regimen of tensing and relaxing the pelvic floor muscles, known as kegel exercises, has been shown to help extend the length of intimacy by two minutes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One 2014 study asked male participants to perform kegel exercises for an hour three times a week for 12 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the study, published in the journal Therapeutic Advances in Urology, Italian doctors from the Sapienza Univeristy of Rome included 40 men who had dealt with premature ejaculation for much of their lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;By the end of the study, 83 per cent of the patients had gained control of their ejaculatory reflex and were able to ‘last’ about two minutes and forty seconds longer than the average duration at the start of the study—about 39 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

That is incredible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We need to show that using these tests in people without symptoms can help identify cancers earlier when they can be successfully treated, thereby preventing advanced cancer and reducing the numbers dying from cancer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prof Sasieni said he hopes that “by 2032, there should be sufficient evidence to say categorically how many lives can be saved by annual screening”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added: “That could lead to national rollout being completed within the next 10 years.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He suggested the NHS should be able to negotiate “a much better price per test” with manufacturers for annual screening rather than every two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NHS might expect an additional 15 million blood tests per year with the technology, which is around a 2.5 per cent increase on current figures, but should not be a problem, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 hCNBSR sc-482ou5-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 hXrpsW"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="4" class="sc-482ou5-0 lfIPRg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.the-independent.com/2025/02/20/9/51/iStock-113121982.jpeg" srcset="https://static.the-independent.com/2025/02/20/9/51/iStock-113121982.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;crop=3%3A2%2Csmart&amp;amp;trim=85%2C134%2C0%2C0&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.the-independent.com/2025/02/20/9/51/iStock-113121982.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;crop=3%3A2%2Csmart&amp;amp;trim=85%2C134%2C0%2C0&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Cancer types studied included bladder, breast, cervical, bowel, kidney, liver and bile-duct, lung, ovarian, pancreatic, prostate, skin and blood cancers such as leukaemia" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 QHifS inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-482ou5-1 eZtLil" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 fsbheq inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-101588"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 jEeRhv"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 kBlcBC kIlksO"&gt;Cancer types studied included bladder, breast, cervical, bowel, kidney, liver and bile-duct, lung, ovarian, pancreatic, prostate, skin and blood cancers such as leukaemia&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 hAhJPR"&gt;

The practice offers in-person visits as well as telemedicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The practice is accepting new oncology and hematology patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rodriguez treats cancer patients and blood cancer patients, but under hematology, also treats patients with noncancerous anemia or low platelets, which can happen as a result of interactions with medications or aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rodriguez received both his undergraduate and medical degrees from the University of Kansas. He did his residency and fellowship at the University of Kansas Medical Center. He spent an additional two years at the medical center before moving to western Kansas to work for HaysMed, where he worked for just less than 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://hayspost.com/posts/a05ca048-415e-412f-bcea-55ff325a76b9"&gt;Rodriguez was one of two former HaysMed doctors who sued the hospital, arguing the noncompete clauses in their contracts, which would have kept them from practicing within a 110-mile radius of Hays, were too restrictive.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://hayspost.com/posts/057d44cb-ad96-4aab-951d-a71a18cbee0a"&gt; The doctors and hospital came to a resolution through meditation, but the terms of that agreement were kept confidential.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="py-8"&gt;&lt;img class="mx-auto w-full sm:w-full md:w-full" src="https://media.eaglewebservices.com/public/2025/5/1746731753831.jpeg" alt="Amanda Volchko, PA"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="text-center italic text-gray-700 text-sm pt-2"&gt;Amanda Volchko, PA&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Volchko was born and raised in New Jersey. She trained in Philadelphia before a recruiter hired her to work in Hoxie. Rodriguez met Volchko while working in Hays, and she expressed an interest in working with cancer patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"My No. 1 directive at this point is to bring treatment locally," Rodriguez said. "In my time at my previous employment, everyone had to come to our location, come to Hays, come to the University of Kansas."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're trying to keep people as close to home as possible. Our primary directive is to get as much of that care done locally as possible, including cancer evaluation, chemotherapy administration, and diagnostic imaging and labs. "&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rodriguez said getting treatment close to home makes a "huge" difference for cancer patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you can imagine any time someone has to get systemic treatment for a malignancy, it's not the best day of their life," he said. "Even when you do it 100% correctly, it still takes a toll on the person."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bringing care closer to patients means they don't have to drive hours for care. That is physically better for the patient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It helps emotionally," Rodriguez said, "and it really does help financially. Sometimes funds are limited. These treatments are expensive."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patients rarely come for treatment alone. Rodriguez said local treatment results in less stress for the family members and friends who are assisting the patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The fact that we come to them is greatly beneficial and so appreciated by everyone I have worked with in these first few weeks," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because there are no cures for the diseases that Rodriguez treats, an oncologist aims to extend life and enhance quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In the end, we're trying to buy people more time to live their life, to be with friends, family, and experience things they love," Rodriguez said. "The less time you spend with me, the better. The less time you have to spend traveling, even better than that. We're trying to have our cake and eat it too, where they still get the excellent care they would receive somewhere like the University of Kansas."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also wanted patients to know he will be their doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Whether Amanda [Volchko] sees you or not, I am the one making those final plans. I will be making those plans even if I'm on vacation or if it's in the middle of the night, I will be your person," Rodriguez said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said he will also work with other physicians as needed, adding that through his experience, he's made many connections with other doctors across the state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rodriguez, who is a Goodland native, said he and his wife, who is a Larned native, wanted to stay in western Kansas and give back to rural communities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"My desire had always been to go back and help the people that helped me," he said. "I didn't get to this place alone. I had excellent teachers and a community that shaped me into the person I am today. I have a sincere desire to help them."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The practice's appointments are filling fast. The Oakley clinic is full through July. Rodriguez said he wanted to thank the community for supporting the practice thus far.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm really excited to get this project going," Rodriguez said. "It's been a dream of mine since graduating from medical school. It's finally happening, and the support that I have received from the community has been nothing but spectacular. I look forward to the rest of my career doing this very thing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To contact the practice, call 620-720-2744.

This applies to adults, including pregnant and breastfeeding women, the elderly, and children aged 11 to 17. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to Dr Ahmed, most people only need around 10 micrograms, which is equivalent to 400 units.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Vitamin D helps regulate the amount of calcium and phosphate in the body - keeping bones, teeth and muscles healthy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Whilst Dr Ahmed agreed that the optimum range is likely higher than the ones usually stated, he said taking too much vitamin D can be really dangerous, especially if you don't get your blood checked regularly&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While Dr Ahmed agreed with NHS guidelines that recommend a supplement dose of no more than 100 micrograms units a day, he said some people do need a much higher dose. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'These are patients who have very low vitamin D on their blood tests', he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the US, the minimum threshold of vitamin D, set out by the institute of medicine, is 20ng/ml. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, the UK's threshold for deficiency is much lower, at 12ng/ml, a level that has long been criticised by international health experts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The amount you need as a supplement depends on your symptoms, your ethnicity, your skin colour, but also your blood test result', Dr Ahmed cautioned. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is why the doctor, who has over 95,500 followers on Instagram, urged anyone who takes vitamin D supplements to get a blood test to see if they are taking too much of the so-called sunshine vitamin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said: 'I urge most people taking vitamin D supplements to get their levels checked regularly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;You have to take it carefully and responsibly and not take too much of a high dose.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Ahmed is not the first medic to warn against megadoses of vitamin D.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;NHS surgeon Doctor Karan Rajan previously suggested looking for vitamin D supplements that contain vitamin K2, which helps reduce the risk of calcium being deposited in the blood stream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While supplements can help to boost vitamin D levels, experts say adequate sunlight exposure and a healthy diet that includes things like oily fish, red meat and fortified foods, are the best sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Fri, 09 May 2025 09:36:20 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>从疫情防范到珍贵的冷冻唾沫， NIH合同终止深度切入- statnews.com | From pandemic preparedness to precious frozen spit, NIH contract terminations cut deep - statnews.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijgFBVV95cUxPUXhrOWM1aUx0WHIxUFZ4bEdxNDFNU1V0V3k0bG51V2tQZ0w0c0V1cm9QbGt0dC1IdWpvNy1FcWJ5dXhtZ3JlVVNOSjM5M3VKTVBOQkZ6aXgyMXlhZjloMWcxSjQ1RGRVdVdod0ZubDZkVjE5b2c1S3NsTzVMTk5ZYzdpU3Nmc1Z6d1JEckdR?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content the-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-flow wp-block-post-content-is-layout-flow"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jay Tischfield prides himself on his long track record of cellular custodianship. As the founding director of the Human Genetics Institute of New Jersey at Rutgers University, he maintains one of the largest university-based DNA banks in the world — much of it, on behalf of the U.S. government. Starting about three decades ago, the National Institutes of Health began outsourcing the storage and distribution of samples from several nationwide studies to Tischfield and his network of finely tuned freezers. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Among the millions of samples he oversees are about 23,000 tubes of frozen spit collected from Americans suffering from psychiatric and substance use disorders over 15 months in the early 2010s. Back then, Tischfield’s team extracted the DNA from cells floating in those saliva samples and began to decode it. Scientists have since used that information to track alcohol and drug consumption trends in the U.S. and find genetic connections between substance use and mental health conditions like depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The DNA data from the project, called NESARC-III, are housed online in an NIH repository available to researchers all over the world. But the physical specimens — the raw material backups — exist in only one place: at Rutgers with Tischfield. They were supposed to stay there, for a few more years, at least. But as deep cuts to the NIH’s contracting budget start to take effect, the future of this valuable resource is now in doubt. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Late last week, Tischfield received an email from the NIH informing him that his five-year, $676,000 contract for storing the NESARC-III samples was being terminated early. He has not yet received any instructions on what to do with all that precious frozen spit.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;“At this time, I have no idea as to the disposition of these valuable samples or whether an appeal is allowed,” he told STAT in an email.&lt;/p&gt;
