It was a last-ditch attempt to curb the spread of a terrifying virus that had already killed &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://data.who.int/dashboards/covid19/deaths?n=o" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;many thousands of people&lt;/a&gt; worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;In London, theatre worker Tony Beckingham and his partner decided to use their daily exercise to cycle into the centre of the city one evening. "We thought it'd be really fun to see no-one around," he says. It wasn't. Places the pair knew well, like Piccadilly Circus and Leicester Square, perennially abuzz with people, were chillingly quiet. "It was really upsetting – instantly," says Beckingham.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;This deletion of the public from city streets, venues and businesses &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-52103747" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;first began in China&lt;/a&gt;, where Covid-19 emerged. Quarantine orders were soon replicated in other countries after the World Health Organization (WHO) &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.who.int/europe/emergencies/situations/covid-19" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;declared a pandemic&lt;/a&gt; on 11 March 2020.

Those countries instead chose other measures, such as restrictions on large gatherings of people, extensive testing and quarantining infected people or travel restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Five years later, the scientific studies and data have piled up, offering a detailed, long-term assessment of whether these countries were right to reject this most drastic of public health interventions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 jFCfG"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-a34861b-1 jxzoZC"&gt;&lt;img src="/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-a34861b-0 cOpVbP hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0kw2b6n.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0kw2b6n.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0kw2b6n.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0kw2b6n.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0kw2b6n.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0kw2b6n.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0kw2b6n.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0kw2b6n.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0kw2b6n.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0kw2b6n.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Alamy For billions of people around the world, the lockdown measures imposed during the early stages of the Covid-19 pandemic were intensely lonely (Credit: Alamy)" class="sc-a34861b-0 efFcac"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-a34861b-2 hesJxn"&gt;Alamy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 bdPeAJ"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-8353772e-0 iUqqeb"&gt;For billions of people around the world, the lockdown measures imposed during the early stages of the Covid-19 pandemic were intensely lonely (Credit: Alamy)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The Swedish city of Gothenburg is a haven for dog-lovers, says HR administrator and blogger Anna Mc Manus, "We have a very dog-friendly city here," she says. "We even have a dog-friendly cinema." As countries around the world, including Sweden's neighbours Norway, Finland and Denmark, ushered in national lockdowns in March 2020, Mc Manus was aware that her own government had &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-52076293" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;decided to buck the trend&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;She heard how dog owners in some nations couldn't even take their pets out for walks because of lockdown rules. South Africa &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-52047374" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;was one such country&lt;/a&gt;. This struck Mc Manus as terrible. At the time, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://citydogexpert.com/the-covid-chronicles-dogenburg/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;she wrote a blog post&lt;/a&gt; in which she said, "I am convinced that my government is acting in a secure and correct way". However, she also expressed concern that her fellow Swedes were not always following the official &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7537539/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;public health guidelines around social distancing&lt;/a&gt;, such as limiting the number of people who could meet together in a group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Mc Manus remembers taking frequent walks in beauty spots, but also that she and her colleagues continually wore masks &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200504-coronavirus-what-is-the-best-kind-of-face-mask" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;to help prevent Covid-19 transmission&lt;/a&gt; at the veterinary hospital where she worked in 2020. Plus, she and her partner avoided restaurants and meeting up with lots of other people. Even now, Mc Manus says she is not sure what to make of Sweden's official strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"I want to base it on facts – like how many people died," she says.

Ingeborg Forthun at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health and researchers in other countries including Sweden &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://academic.oup.com/eurpub/article/34/4/737/7675929" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;published a study in May 2024&lt;/a&gt; that compared excess deaths in Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Finland during the first years of the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;While Sweden avoided strict government imposed controls, instead relying mainly on &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/public-health/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2023.1206732/full" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;voluntary behavioural changes&lt;/a&gt; from is citizens, the other three nations imposed &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1359610120300952?via%3Dihub" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;strict lockdowns&lt;/a&gt; in the early stages of the pandemic. &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://eurohealthobservatory.who.int/news-room/articles/item/norway-country-snapshot-the-role-of-public-health-agencies-and-services-in-the-response-to-covid-19" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;Norway&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://eurohealthobservatory.who.int/monitors/hsrm/hsrm-countries/hsrm/finland/preventing-transmission/physical-distancing/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;Finland&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://eurohealthobservatory.who.int/monitors/hsrm/hsrm-countries/hsrm/denmark/preventing-transmission/physical-distancing/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;Denmark&lt;/a&gt; closed schools and most other aspects of public life while also asking people to work from home, but they stopped short of confining people to their homes in the way other countries &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://eurohealthobservatory.who.int/monitors/hsrm/hsrm-countries/hsrm/united-kingdom/preventing-transmission/physical-distancing/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;such as the UK&lt;/a&gt; did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="quote-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-9967660-0 WkJHg"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-9967660-2 kcfPbO"&gt;We probably kept some older and vulnerable people alive for a longer period – Ingeborg Forthun&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Perhaps unsurprisingly, the researchers found a noticeable spike in excess deaths in Sweden during the initial waves of the pandemic during the spring and winter of 2020, when Covid-19 was able to spread more freely than in neighbouring nations. But while excess mortality fell in the three other countries in 2020, it rose compared to Sweden in 2021 and 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"The four countries have a comparable number of excess deaths when you account for the fact that population sizes differ," says Forthun. What lockdowns did affect, in part, was the timing of when spikes in excess deaths occurred. Of Norway's approach, Forthun adds: "We probably kept some older and vulnerable people alive for a longer period." Whereas authorities in Sweden &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-55347021" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;were criticised in 2020&lt;/a&gt; over high numbers of deaths at care homes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Some economists have combined similar data with comparisons of economic performance indicators between the same four Nordic countries to argue that, overall, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ecaf.12611" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;Sweden's approach was justified&lt;/a&gt; due to the relatively low economic costs. But such arguments are controversial and the lack of a lockdown in Sweden remains an area for heated debate among some.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;One Swedish epidemiologist, Nele Brusselaers, of the Karolinska Institute, has criticised her country's Covid-19 strategy. She moved to Belgium during the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"I'm a medical doctor so of course I care about lives," she says. "We want to save every single life." She says many of her fellow Swedes are "still in denial" about Covid-19 though some have come to question the lack of lockdown in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Brusselaers, who lived in Sweden in 2020, notes how her posts about Covid-19 on social media resulted in fierce pushback from some who disagreed with her stance on lockdown as an appropriate strategy. "You get so much hatred," she says. "That's not something I was used to."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 jFCfG"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-a34861b-1 jxzoZC"&gt;&lt;img src="/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-a34861b-0 cOpVbP hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0kw2b7k.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0kw2b7k.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0kw2b7k.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0kw2b7k.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0kw2b7k.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0kw2b7k.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0kw2b7k.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0kw2b7k.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0kw2b7k.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0kw2b7k.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images Sweden's approach to controlling the virus contrasted dramatically with that of its neighbours in the early stages of the pandemic (Credit: Getty Images)" class="sc-a34861b-0 efFcac"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-a34861b-2 hesJxn"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 bdPeAJ"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-8353772e-0 iUqqeb"&gt;Sweden's approach to controlling the virus contrasted dramatically with that of its neighbours in the early stages of the pandemic (Credit: Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Even today, some people find it hard to move past the hostility they faced on the topic of lockdowns. One university researcher approached by the BBC for this article said they were so traumatised by the abuse they received online in 2020 that they never intended to comment on Covid-19 control measures, or lockdowns, publicly again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Furthermore, some people who lived in countries without lockdowns, and who disagreed with their government's approach, are still reeling from the experience. Tanzania never had any Covid-19 lockdowns. The country's former &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-56412912" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;President, John Magufuli&lt;/a&gt;, who dismissed lockdowns and other public health interventions, died &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-56437852" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;in 2021&lt;/a&gt;. Magufuli's approach to the pandemic was "unscientific", says history lecturer Fadhili Mtani at the Muslim University of Morogoro in Tanzania. "He advocated for &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-52519853" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;traditional herbs&lt;/a&gt; and later he &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-55900680" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;rejected vaccines&lt;/a&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;But Mtani recalls visiting hospitals where members of his own family had passed away of an illness. "I saw people suffocating in the hospitals," he says. "The hospital said we should not say it's Covid." Official figures suggest &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/region/tanzania" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;around 840 people have died of Covid-19 in Tanzania&lt;/a&gt; since the start of the pandemic. Mtani says that the government has not made accurate statistics available, however. An international collaboration aimed at &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)02796-3/fulltext" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;estimating the global excess deaths&lt;/a&gt; during the first two years of the pandemic has put the total number of deaths in Tanzania at somewhere between 102,000-188,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Mtani argues that Tanzania should have enforced a lockdown, though without placing excessive restrictions on the movement of workers. "The majority of people are poor. To deny movement for them is to deny their existence," Mtani explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Many scientists emphasise that lockdowns were crucial for saving lives in the early part of the pandemic, before vaccines were available, and also for limiting the pressure on health services. By March 2020, this pressure was already severe in the UK, says Adam Kucharski, professor of infectious disease epidemiology, at the London School of Hygiene &amp;amp; Tropical Medicine. "The NHS was overwhelmed," Kucharski explains, referring to the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/sep/26/doctor-in-tears-at-covid-inquiry-says-what-nhs-staff-saw-was-indescribable" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;emotional testimony of doctors&lt;/a&gt; who have spoken to the UK's public inquiry into the government’s Covid-19 response. "It's ridiculous to suggest [the NHS] wasn't under effectively breaking pressure by that point," adds Kucharski.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Kucharski also says that, because of the UK's global connections and the large number of young people who live together &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://theconversation.com/more-young-people-in-the-uk-are-living-with-parents-and-grandparents-heres-what-you-need-to-know-if-youre-considering-it-216280" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;or with their parents&lt;/a&gt; compared &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20190821-why-so-many-young-swedes-live-alone" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;to Sweden&lt;/a&gt;, for example, it might have been much harder for the UK to control Covid-19 transmission without imposing a lockdown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;He also points to &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abd9338" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;a 2021 study&lt;/a&gt; that attempted to quantify the effect of specific government interventions on the spread of Covid-19, using data from 41 countries. It reveals that certain aspects of national lockdowns might have been more impactful than others. The researchers found, for example, that banning gatherings of more than 10 people or closing schools and universities was especially effective, reducing transmission by more than 35% on average. Shutting restaurants and bars seemed to make slightly less difference to transmission, however.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;What's more, the researchers suggest that adding a strict stay-at-home order on top of such measures "only had a small additional effect" in terms of slowing down Covid-19 – estimated at below 17.5% on average.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 jFCfG"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-a34861b-1 jxzoZC"&gt;&lt;img src="/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-a34861b-0 cOpVbP hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0kw2b8l.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0kw2b8l.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0kw2b8l.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0kw2b8l.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0kw2b8l.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0kw2b8l.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0kw2b8l.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0kw2b8l.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0kw2b8l.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0kw2b8l.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images The effects of Tanzania's early response to Covid-19 is still not visible in the official government statistics (Credit: Getty Images)" class="sc-a34861b-0 efFcac"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-a34861b-2 hesJxn"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 bdPeAJ"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-8353772e-0 iUqqeb"&gt;The effects of Tanzania's early response to Covid-19 is still not visible in the official government statistics (Credit: Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Countries that chose not to lock down severely may also have had more time to prepare for the arrival of Covid-19, or social and structural reasons as to why the Sars-CoV-2 virus was less likely to spread quickly there versus other nations. Even then, there are surprising comparisons to be made. Take Iceland and New Zealand, for instance. Both are wealthy island nations with relatively small populations but while New Zealand introduced &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://nzhistory.govt.nz/page/new-zealand-enters-nationwide-lockdown-fight-against-covid-19" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;a strict lockdown on 25 March 2020&lt;/a&gt;, Iceland never did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"They [Iceland] had more of a mitigation strategy," says Leah Grout, a research data analyst specialising in public health at the Southern California University of Health Sciences. Grout was &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/14034948221149143" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;lead author on a research paper&lt;/a&gt; about the contrasting Covid-19 strategies and outcomes of these two countries. Iceland introduced &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.stjornarradid.is/efst-a-baugi/frettir/stok-frett/?NewsId=c65cf658-6eb6-11ea-9462-005056bc4d74" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;a test and trace programme&lt;/a&gt;, in which infections and contacts between people were monitored so that individuals – rather than entire populations – were asked to observe quarantine for a time. This measure was also used in many countries that also applied lockdowns, when those lockdowns were lifted. Iceland had some restrictions on social gatherings and it did &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-56412790" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;close its borders to some travellers&lt;/a&gt;, briefly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"New Zealand had one of the lowest mortality rates globally with their approach," says Grout. "Iceland also fared pretty well." Plus, the economic impacts on both countries were limited, she adds. Other researchers have made similar findings &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1757780223002305" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;regarding New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/13/15/8470" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;Iceland&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Much was written in 2020 about various countries' efforts to tackle the Covid-19 pandemic. But, in retrospect, that seems much too early to come to any real conclusions. &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://theconversation.com/uruguay-quietly-beats-coronavirus-distinguishing-itself-from-its-south-american-neighbors-yet-again-140037" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;Uruguay was lauded at the time&lt;/a&gt; for apparently managing to keep Covid-19 at bay, despite never enacting a strict lockdown. The country's government enforced some forms of social distancing, including the closure of some gyms, and Uruguay's borders were also &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.cesam.org/documents/CESAM-COVID19-OVERVIEW-WEEK_2021_04.pdf" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;closed to certain travellers&lt;/a&gt;, for instance.

Excess deaths in 2021, for example, were nearly 19% above the expected figure, based on historical trends. The study's authors put this down mostly to the spread of Covid-19 but add that impacts from the pandemic on the ability to provide healthcare in other ways probably also played a role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Similarly, Japan was able to keep mortality from Covid-19 to a relatively low level in the early part of the pandemic. By the summer of 2022, Covid-19 &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://jogh.org/2022/jogh-12-03073" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;deaths had reached 36,200&lt;/a&gt;. Today, they stand &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/15587088" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;at 130,000&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Some researchers argue that Japan’s approach proved to be the right one overall. "Even without lockdown, suppression of epidemic curves has been largely successful," argues Hiroshi Nishiura, a professor in the graduate school of medicine at Kyoto University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Despite this, Yasuharu Tokuda, a clinical epidemiologist and director of the Muribushi Okinawa Center for Teaching Hospitals in Okinawa, Japan, argues that a tougher approach might have been beneficial. "Some patients could not be admitted to the hospital because of the lack of available beds," he says. "If we have a strong viral pandemic, then we need to have a stricter lockdown in Japan." Research suggests that &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-024-18866-3" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;there might be resistance to such an idea&lt;/a&gt; among members of the public in Japan, however.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="quote-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-9967660-0 WkJHg"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-9967660-2 kcfPbO"&gt;I became quite introverted and now I find I don't want to interact with people as much as I did before – Bill Allison&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;It is important to reflect on just how drastic a measure lockdown really is. Kucharski, for one, calls it a "blunt" tool. "We should never have got to that point where we were in so much trouble, with so little visibility of what the pandemic was doing," he says. It was due to a lack of certainty over what would happen next, and a dearth of other interventions on the table, that the UK was more or less forced into lockdown, he suggests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Many have still not got over the effects of lockdown. In March 2020, Bill Allison, a former civil servant in Scotland, was in his mid-60s. He had many plans for his retirement – he wanted to see the world. Back then, Allison was also an avid pub-goer who frequently met up with his friends for a pint. Lockdown stopped him in his tracks. He says he followed the rules at all times but this left him feeling a profound sense of loneliness and isolation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"I gathered up all the scraps of wood that I had and decided to see if I could make them into an electric guitar," he says. "I would work late at night. There was nothing else to do, really." He found a guitar-making group online, through which he met people with similar interests. "I made quite a lot of new friends."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;But when the world gradually began to open up again, Allison was struck by a strong sense of what he had been missing and was hard to regain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"The pub near me, it's nothing like as busy as it was before Covid," he says. "I became quite introverted and now I find I don't want to interact with people as much as I did before. I was discussing it with a few of my friends. […] We all feel very unhappy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Soon to turn 72, Allison says his pre-pandemic travel plans remain on hold. "I'm kind of getting to the age where I don't really want to do a nine-hour flight to the other side of the world anymore. It's kind of knocked me back."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 jFCfG"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-a34861b-1 jxzoZC"&gt;&lt;img src="/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-a34861b-0 cOpVbP hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0kw2b9m.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0kw2b9m.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0kw2b9m.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0kw2b9m.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0kw2b9m.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0kw2b9m.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0kw2b9m.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0kw2b9m.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0kw2b9m.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0kw2b9m.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images The long-term effects of the pandemic lockdowns on children whose education was disrupted have yet to be fully understood (Credit: Getty Images)" class="sc-a34861b-0 efFcac"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-a34861b-2 hesJxn"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 bdPeAJ"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-8353772e-0 iUqqeb"&gt;The long-term effects of the pandemic lockdowns on children whose education was disrupted have yet to be fully understood (Credit: Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Authorities in some countries that attempted to enforce strict lockdowns and a "zero Covid" policy were greeted with violent protests from members of the public.

Ultimately, the vast majority of nations did enact lockdowns at some point during 2020 or 2021 and it would be hard to suggest that they are all significantly worse off because of that intervention, specifically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Still, five years later, the harshness of lockdowns and their effects on millions if not billions of people has become clearer. Even some researchers who have found evidence that lockdowns saved lives have &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0261759" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;cautioned against turning to this measure in haste&lt;/a&gt; in the future.

"It needs to be super clear." That means everyone could know ahead of time what circumstances would trigger a lockdown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;In Gothenburg, Mc Manus remembers the debates she once had with her fellow Swedes over whether her country was doing the right thing in 2020.

from getting married when a revelation from the past turned her life upside down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Through research into her ancestry and family tree, her brother-in-law made an alarming discovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Luke Emerton found that a number of women on the paternal side had died from breast cancer at a young age - including Hannah's grandmother.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;This led to the 34-year-old having genetic testing and finding out she had a faulty gene, which dramatically increases the risk of certain cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The BRCA genes are present in every person, both men and women, but when a fault occurs in one of them it can result in DNA damage and lead to cells becoming cancerous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;People with a genetic variant have a 50% chance of passing it on to their children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Luke told BBC Scotland News how he stumbled upon the discovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;He said: "We were trying to pull together a family tree for Hannah's dad for his birthday and we found there was a line of female relatives on her dad's side who had died of breast cancer at a young age. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"We clocked it with her gran, Agnes, who died at 33. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"Then we started noticing a pattern."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;He said the enormity of his discovery had yet to hit home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Luke said: "Looking back, it's so strange how all of this has come from that one gift.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"I'm so glad we found out this way and that Hannah knows about it and can act on decreasing the risk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"The fact she has been able to pre-empt all of this is incredible."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eeiVGB"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-518485e5-0 DkKTF"&gt;'I had to know'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Prof Zosia Miedzybrodska, of the University of Aberdeen, decsribed BRCA 2 as a "huge gene" and said it could mutate and go wrong "in many ways".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;And she said the percentage difference between male and female cancers was "quite significant".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"The risk increase for a woman with breast cancer is anywhere up to 85%," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"For prostate cancer it's 27% and for male breast cancer it's 10%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"The only way you know if you have the faulty BRCA 2 gene is if there is a history of breast, prostate or ovarian cancer in the family."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Cruise ship entertainer Hannah booked an appointment to discover if she had the gene, which also dramatically increases the risk of ovarian cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;She told BBC Scotland News: "I had to find out if I had the faulty BRCA 2 gene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"Some people don't want to know but for my sanity, I really had to know."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 jFCfG"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image"

Houston and Harris County leaders are getting ready in case the outbreak makes it to Southeast Texas.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON — Local officials held a news conference Tuesday afternoon, their first joint update, on their plan to be proactive to prevent the spread of measles.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They said as of now there are no active cases of measles in Houston or Harris County. Officials are, however, closely watching school districts and daycares with low vaccination rates, which is less than 95%.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Director of Houston Health Stephen Williams said they are providing education on the virus for everyone, which includes those daycares and school districts.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is not normal to see an outbreak like this in the United States,” Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgo said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The City of Houston is aware of its circumstances. We’ve reached out to all of our stakeholders,” Houston Mayor John Whitmire said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plan discussed looks to closely watch daycares and school districts with low vaccination rates, providing educational material and holding vaccine clinics this weekend throughout the Houston Metro area.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re going to look at the numbers and follow the numbers regardless of the neighborhood,” Williams said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officials emphasized that there are currently no confirmed cases in the Houston Metro or Harris County area. Each one of the speakers said now is the time to get vaccinated to stay proactive, not reactive.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What is it about this particular measles outbreak that has caught your attention?” KHOU 11 News reporter Amanda Henderson asked.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“How rapidly it’s spreading in West Texas,” Dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine Dr. Peter Hotez said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Everyone here says we need to address this now, why?” Henderson asked.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Well, prevention is really how we keep our community safe, particularly our most vulnerable population,” Texas Children’s Pediatrics Chief Medical Officer Dr. Sapna Singh said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Texas Children’s Pediatrics will host a free MMR vaccine clinic on March 8 and 15 from 8 a.m. to noon at their TCP West Loop location. You can find the location of mobile health vans on their website.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Legacy Community Health will host a free MMR vaccine clinic on March 8 at 6441 High Star and 3811 Lions Ave.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vaccines are for those 12 months and older.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;

                    &lt;p class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Measles cases continue to climb&lt;/h2&gt;                    &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of Tuesday, the Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS) reported &lt;a href="/article/news/health/measles/texas-measles-outbreak-update/285-4272c68c-74c3-4fe7-981a-e8e1b67054ad" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" id="isPasted"&gt;159 cases&lt;/a&gt; of measles across nine counties in West Texas. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officials say 129 of those cases are in Gaines and Terry counties. The vast majority of patients are children under 18. A Lubbock child has died from measles.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
                    &lt;p class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Officials expect more cases&lt;/h2&gt;                    &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a state Capitol hearing Monday, DSHS Commissioner Jennifer Shuford warned that more cases linked to the outbreak are likely. Health officials have not yet determined the source of the outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We don't know the individual who introduced it into the community or what the risk factor was for bringing it in. We know that measles is alive and well in other parts of the world, and so all it takes is one traveler to bring it in," Shuford said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She also noted that the virus has spread rapidly due to lower vaccination rates in affected areas.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;p class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How long could the outbreak last?&lt;/h2&gt;                    &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health officials estimate that the outbreak could last two and a half months or longer, depending on vaccination efforts and containment measures.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Photojournalist Scott McKenney contributed to this report.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

A later NHS test showed his reading was normal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;In another one-star review, a woman wrote that her husband took two home tests for "peace of mind" and both were negative. An NHS blood test then showed high levels of PSA and he was diagnosed with stage four prostate cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The British In Vitro Diagnostics Association, which represents the blood testing industry, says that while home tests are appropriate in many circumstances, "this particular type of [PSA] test may not give an accurate indication of prostate health when taken outside the NHS".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Instead it says men concerned they may have cancer should see their GP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 bdPeAJ"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-8353772e-0 iUqqeb"&gt;Dr Sam Merriel, a GP and prostate cancer researcher, says patients "may not get the  full picture" from at-home PSA tests&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;In the NHS, doctors often use PSA testing as part of a wider consultation about prostate health, bringing in other risk factors like age, ethnicity and family history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Dr Sam Merriel, a GP and prostate cancer researcher at the University of Manchester, says a full NHS laboratory test can give a far more detailed picture than a cheap home kit that is either positive or negative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"The actual PSA reading is really important to understand because, as a GP, if I saw a PSA of 4.0 I'd be treating that very differently from a PSA of 400," he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"You just don't get that level of information from a fast home test, so patients might not get the full picture."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eeiVGB"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-518485e5-0 DkKTF"&gt;'Dangerously outdated'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Prostate Cancer UK describes the growth of home testing as "the symptom of a wider problem".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"Too many men still don't realise they can access tests through a GP and the guidelines for doctors are dangerously outdated," says Amy Rylance from the charity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Sir Chris Hoy has been calling for the age to be lowered at which those at higher risk, such as black men or those with a family history, can ask their GP for PSA testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The government says current guidelines should not stop doctors from offering a test under the age of 50, but critics say the rules are unclear and there are huge variations in diagnosis rates between GP surgeries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Prostate Cancer UK has also been calling for a change to allow medics to proactively talk to higher risk patients about the pros and cons of testing instead of waiting for them to come forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;A spokesman for the Department of Health says it has asked the UK National Screening Committee, which advises the NHS, to review the evidence on testing, with a response expected later this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"Prostate cancer patients are waiting too long for diagnosis and treatment but through our National Cancer Plan we will transform the way we treat cancer," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="embed-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 jVHuOl"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 05 Mar 2025 01:44:08 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWkFVX3lxTE96TXpvekE2LWVFNTFPOTUzUlE4TGd4cGFnYm9YQzNLaTRqTU1VTnQ3SVJNczlnc0tDVFNXZVZMY050Z1BvaXkzTVRXTmt6RWdPYk4xMVJvNnowd9IBX0FVX3lxTE9wTUg0QW03M0x0Rl94SmxoOWRIelE5b21aQzJFYUNBU0t0QTA4X2xaYjFUb2ZqMHRRU3poQ1d6SktWTmpaVUI4OTV4WXF3dHVySVkxanZVZVRvV2J4cURv</guid></item><item><title>Dysentery is on the rise in Oregon.

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Men's semen quality is associated with how long they live, according to a study of nearly 80,000 men, &lt;a href="https://apps.crossref.org/pendingpub/pendingpub.html?doi=10.1093%2Fhumrep%2Fdeaf023" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Human Reproduction&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;The study followed the men for up to 50 years and found that those with a total number of motile sperm (sperm that can move or 'swim') of more than 120 million could expect to live two to three years longer than men with a total motile sperm count of between 0 and 5 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the largest study to examine the link between semen quality and mortality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research was led by Dr. Lærke Priskorn, a senior researcher, and Dr. Niels Jørgensen, chief andrologist, both working in the Department of Growth and Reproduction at Copenhagen University Hospital—Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They analyzed data from 78,284 men who had their semen quality assessed between 1965 and 2015 at the public semen analysis laboratory in Copenhagen due to reported couple infertility. This meant that semen quality among the men ranged from very good to those with no sperm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assessment of semen quality included semen volume, sperm concentration, and the proportion of sperm that were motile and a normal shape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the follow-up period, the researchers used the data contained in unique Danish national registers, to see how many died from any cause. During this time there were 8,600 deaths, representing 11% of this group of men.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Out of this group, 59,657 men provided semen samples between 1987 and 2015, and for this group more information was available, including educational level as an indicator of socioeconomic status, and registered diagnoses of medical conditions in the 10 years prior to giving a sample.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;The researchers adjusted their analyses to take account of the extra information that was available for the men who gave samples from 1987 onwards, as that could affect the results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Priskorn said, "Previous research has suggested that male infertility and lower semen quality could be associated with mortality. We conducted this study to test the hypothesis and at the same time get an absolute estimate of how much semen quality predicts a man's lifespan and to understand whether diagnosed diseases prior to semen quality assessment might explain some of the reported association.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We calculated the men's life expectancy according to their semen quality and found that men with the best quality could expect to live two to three years longer, on average, than men with the lowest semen quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"In absolute terms, men with a total motile count of more than 120 million lived 2.7 years longer than men with a total motile count of between 0 and 5 million. The lower the semen quality, the lower the life expectancy. This association was not explained by any diseases in the ten years before semen quality assessment or the men's educational level."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers suggest that poor semen quality may be an indicator of other, underlying factors that affect both fertility and overall health. This might have the potential for detecting &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/health+problems/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;health problems&lt;/a&gt; at the time men have their semen quality investigated.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;p&gt;Dr. Jørgensen said, "We need to better understand the association between semen quality and men's general health. However, this study suggests that we can identify subgroups of men with impaired semen quality who are apparently healthy when their semen quality is assessed, but who are at increased risk of developing certain diseases later in life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Thus, fertility evaluations, which are typically conducted when the men are relatively young, would serve as an opportunity for detecting and mitigating the risks of other health problems in the longer term. In the current study, we did not analyze whether poor semen quality was associated with earlier deaths from particular causes, such as cancer or heart disease, and this is something we will be studying in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Using other groups of men, we will also try to identify relevant biomarkers that can identify subgroups of men at increased risk. This is key to initiating relevant prevention strategies."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A strength of the study is its large size. Limitations include lack of information on health behaviors; assessment of the men's health before semen sampling was limited to diagnoses obtained from the National Patient Register, and only for men who gave samples from 1987; and it was not possible to distinguish between men who had no motile sperm because of an obstruction in their genital tracts and those who had no motile sperm for other reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://apps.crossref.org/pendingpub/pendingpub.html?doi=10.1093%2Fhumrep%2Fdeaf027" target="_blank"&gt;commentary&lt;/a&gt; to accompany the paper, Distinguished Emeritus Professor John Aitken from the School of Environmental and Life Sciences at The University of Newcastle, Australia, calls it a "landmark" publication and sets out the various mechanisms that could be contributing to the link between poor semen quality and shorter life span.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;"In this commentary, I have highlighted several potential mediators of such an association, including &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/genetic+defects/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;genetic defects&lt;/a&gt; on the sex chromosomes (X or Y), a compromised immune system, comorbidities, lifestyle factors and chemical pollutants capable of compromising telomeric integrity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Given the complexity of these factors, we might ask whether they are acting independently, or do they reflect the existence of some fundamental pathological process that cuts across all of these epidemiological pathways?" he writes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He suggests a process called &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/oxidative+stress/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;oxidative stress&lt;/a&gt; could be involved in the process. This is an imbalance in the body of molecules called '&lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/free+radicals/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;free radicals&lt;/a&gt;' and antioxidants, which inhibit oxidation. Free radicals are known to damage cells and to influence &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/semen+quality/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;semen quality&lt;/a&gt;, and oxidative stress is known to be involved in the aging process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He writes, "Any factor (genetic, immunological, metabolic, environmental or lifestyle) that enhances overall levels of oxidative stress could reasonably be expected to drive changes in the semen profile and subsequent patterns of mortality, as observed by Priskorn et al. . . ."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Furthermore, an etiology grounded in oxidative stress might also explain the relationships observed between complications of pregnancy (preeclampsia, gestational hypertension and gestational diabetes) and female mortality later in life . . .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"An overarching oxidative stress hypothesis also accords with the observation that circulating antioxidant levels are generally higher in women than men, just as their telomeres are usually longer . . . So perhaps, for both genders, the secret to achieving both high fecundity and healthy aging is to monitor oxidative stress and adopt measures to maintain a balanced redox state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Could it be that simple? Clearly, much food for thought."&lt;/p&gt;

            People who have higher levels of strong, agile sperm may live nearly three years longer than those with poor swimmers incapable of making it to their destination,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;according to new research. The large-scale study followed more than 78,000 men for 50 years.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7v1uezi000g3b6mqvemisx3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The ability of sperm to properly swim through the female reproductive tract to reach and fertilize an egg is called motility.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7v1uezi000h3b6msqm5o603@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “In absolute terms, men with a total motile count of more than 120 million (per milliliter of semen) lived 2.7 years longer than men with a total motile count of between 0 and 5 million,” said lead study author Lærke Priskorn, a researcher and doctoral candidate at Copenhagen University Hospital — Rigshospitalet in Denmark, in a statement.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7v1uezi000i3b6mnpv7y7lc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            To translate that into ages, a man with extremely poor sperm motility might be expected to live up to&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;77.6 years, while a man with extremely high motility might survive to 80.3 years, according to the study &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/humrep/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/humrep/deaf023" target="_blank"&gt;published Tuesday&lt;/a&gt; in the journal Human Reproduction.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7v1uezi000j3b6mgjodmhfj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The fact that there is an association between semen quality and longevity is an important finding,” said Dr. Michael Eisenberg, professor of urology and director of male reproductive medicine and surgery at Stanford University School of Medicine. He was not involved in the new research.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7v1uezi000k3b6mwu5eash6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There have been prior studies that suggest this link between reproductive health and overall health,” Eisenberg said in an email.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7v1uezi000l3b6mtqeygho0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In the new report, researchers compared the quality of sperm samples taken between 1965 and 2015 from men undergoing infertility testing in Copenhagen. The quality of the men’s sperm was then compared with national medical records gathered by the Danish national health service.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7v1uezi000m3b6m7k9mwti4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The lower the semen quality, the lower the life expectancy,” Priskorn said. “This association was not explained by any diseases in the ten years before semen quality assessment or the men’s educational level.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7v1uezi000n3b6m9ndhmxv1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Motility counts are typically provided in &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10929669/" target="_blank"&gt;percentages,&lt;/a&gt; not total numbers. The &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240030787" target="_blank"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; considers a man’s sperm normal if about 42% of the sperm in each sample of ejaculate is capable of swimming to their destination.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7v1uezi000o3b6mo032c7zz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            However, a motility count of less than 5 million per milliliter of semen&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;is associated with a severe case of &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/22477-oligospermia-low-sperm-count" target="_blank"&gt;oligospermia&lt;/a&gt;, or low sperm count, which often leads to male infertility, the study said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7v1uezi000p3b6m73x8jkvq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A sperm motility of about 125 million per milliliter of semen is normal for a fertile male, Eisenberg said. However, that doesn’t guarantee male fertility, experts say.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7v1uezi000q3b6mdit0i6s6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If not for fertility, why would testing semen be a benefit? Because it could also be a marker for male health problems at younger ages, said John Aitken, a distinguished professor emeritus from the School of Environmental and Life Sciences at the University of Newcastle, Australia, who was not connected to the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7v1uezi000r3b6m1kxuiczv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “In men, it appears to be their semen profile that is providing the most significant information concerning their future health and wellbeing,” Aitken wrote &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/humrep/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/humrep/deaf027" target="_blank"&gt;in an editorial&lt;/a&gt; published alongside the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7v1uezi000s3b6mdbkesnwq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “If spermatozoa really are the canaries in the coal mine of male health, the obvious question to ask is, why?” Aitken posited. “What possible factors could link the ultimate life expectancy of males with the quality of their semen profile in early adulthood?”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7v1uezi000t3b6mzxst3ngu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            According to Aitken, one answer explaining the association might be oxidative stress, caused when free radicals run rampant. Free radicals are unstable molecules that can damage DNA and cellular function and lead to cell death throughout the body, including the testes and sperm.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7v1uezi000u3b6mstkpzyhp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Any factor (genetic, immunological, metabolic, environmental or lifestyle) that enhances overall levels of oxidative stress, could reasonably be expected to drive changes in the semen profile and subsequent patterns of mortality,” Aitken posited.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7v1uezi000v3b6mt39cgbjh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Smoking, excessive alcohol, sun exposure, pesticides, industrial chemicals and air pollutants are just a few of the ways free radicals are activated, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/diet/antioxidants-fact-sheet" target="_blank"&gt;National Cancer Institute&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7v1uezi000w3b6mn42ie0h7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The body does have a way to fight back — with antioxidants. Nicknamed “free radical scavengers,” antioxidants can prevent and repair damage caused by some types of free radicals, experts say.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7v1uezi000x3b6mvemsz3z7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            While supplements have failed to show promise against free radicals, fruits, vegetables, nuts and grains with key vitamins and minerals are excellent sources of antioxidants, according to the Cleveland Clinic.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7v1uezi000y3b6mdt5yuadh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Citrus fruits, red and green peppers, and broccoli are full of the antioxidant vitamin C, while nuts, sunflower seeds, spinach and broccoli are good sources of vitamin E, another antioxidant, the clinic &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/oxidative-stress" target="_blank"&gt;states on its website&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7v1uezi000z3b6m7zt8t1b4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Salmon and tuna contain selenium, as does brown rice, eggs and whole wheat bread. Beta carotene, another antioxidant, can be found in carrots, apricots, kale, mangos and sweet potatoes.

We continue to monitor the situation. If there is a confirmed case of measles, the OSDH will notify the public and share information necessary to protect the public's health."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OSDH later said in a statement: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="Quote"&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt; "The individual was negative for measles but positive for having immunity.&lt;br&gt; There is a process for confirming a case of measles, and that can only be done through the Oklahoma State Department of Health (OSDH). While residents may be tested and diagnosed at a health care facility, that facility must work with the OSDH to confirm a positive case. Many factors contribute to having a confirmed positive case. It is important to be aware of what type of test is conducted. If measles is suspected, multiple types of tests can be performed to determine if measles is present or if the individual has immunity to measles." "Health care facilities and schools are encouraged to follow their normal reporting processes to OSDH to ensure timely public health investigations. These processes should be followed prior to any public posting about reportable diseases. The OSDH is monitoring the situation and will notify the public and news media if/when a case is confirmed in Oklahoma. In the meantime, if you receive information about a case that is not directly from the OSDH, please contact us before reporting." &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bartlesville Public Schools said "a staff member at Wayside Elementary School was diagnosed with measles by an Oklahoma hospital. However, the Oklahoma State Department of Health has not been able to confirm that diagnosis." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2 News is reaching out to the school district and the Oklahoma State Department of Health to clarify the initial alert. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bartlesville Public Schools issued a warning after a staffer at an elementary school tested positive for measles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a post on the district's Facebook page, they said a staffer in Wayside Elementary School tested positive for the measles on March 4, one day after being inside the school. Custodians at that school did complete a deep cleaning and are now going back over as many areas as possible.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles is a highly contagious and airborne disease. Most people in the United States have a low risk for contracting it due to a vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A child who was not vaccinated has died from measles in West Texas, the first death in an outbreak that began late last month and the first from measles in the U.S. since 2015.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.kjrh.com/health/cdc-deploys-rapid-response-officers-to-texas-to-address-the-measles-outbreak" class="ListItem " data-cms-ai="0"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="Link" href="https://www.bps-ok.org/page/measles" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;The school posted about the disease on their website to help inform parents.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The district included specific vaccination rates for their students: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="Quote"&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;As of March 2025, 92% of the district's students had received 2 doses of the MMR vaccine, 3% had received 1 dose, and the remaining 5% had received no doses or their status was unclear in our database.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The two doses of vaccine normally provide lifelong immunity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Oklahoma State Health Department has more details on the measles—&amp;gt; &lt;a class="Link" href="https://core-docs.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/documents/asset/uploaded_file/1582/BPS/5370471/Measles.pdf" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;Fact Sheet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The highly contagious norovirus is rampant in South Florida.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Norovirus has torn through the United States this winter, peaking early in some parts of the country but taking hold in South Florida over the last few weeks. It arrives with cramps, diarrhea, vomiting, fever, dizziness and fatigue, symptoms that set in about 12 to 48 hours after exposure to viral particles. On average, one person with norovirus will infect two to seven others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s a tough illness to have to deal with,” said Dr. Maria Garcia, an emergency medicine physician at Baptist Health South Florida.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Garcia is seeing firsthand what &lt;a href="https://data.wastewaterscan.org/?plantId=d3ff13c4&amp;amp;target=Noro_G2&amp;amp;selectedLocation=%7B%22label%22%3A%22North%20Miami,%20FL%22,%22level%22%3A%22plant%22,%22value%22%3A%22d3ff13c4%22%7D"&gt;Florida wastewater data&lt;/a&gt; over the most recent 21 days confirms: Norovirus concentration levels through the state are high. Federal surveillance data only shows reported outbreaks in Florida through the end of January. Florida, like most of the south, had higher levels than in previous years as of Jan. 31, according to the Centers for Disease Control &amp;amp; Prevention (CDC).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="s2nPlayer k-gbDoqmaV" data-type="float" data-s2n-api="dfm_stn_player_script_id_gbDoqmaV"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among those who caught the virus is Leslie O’Shea, of Fort Lauderdale, who said she missed three days of work last week due to the symptoms. She even slept on the bathroom floor, feeling lightheaded and struggling to stand up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This was the sickest I have been in a long time,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similar experiences fill social media posts, with photos of people in bed declaring “I wouldn’t wish norovirus on my worst enemy” and “This virus is straight from the pits of hell.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts say the surge of cases is being driven by a new dominant strain of norovirus called GII.17[P17], which has displaced a strain that had been around for decades. Lower population immunity to this new strain could explain this year’s harsh wave of the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This new strain, the CDC said, is linked to cruise-ship outbreaks in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, South Florida’s proximity to cruise ports may be exacerbating the spread. According to the CDC’s &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vessel-sanitation/cruise-ship-outbreaks/index.html"&gt;Vessel Sanitation Program&lt;/a&gt;, nine voyages that have departed from or docked in Florida this year have&lt;a href="https://www.sun-sentinel.com/2025/02/11/cdc-tracks-another-norovirus-outbreak-on-florida-based-cruise-ship/"&gt; resulted in outbreaks&lt;/a&gt; — seven were confirmed to be norovirus. Passengers exposed to norovirus often have overnight stays in Florida and travel through local airports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;So, what to do?&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medical experts want Floridians to know that hand sanitizer does not kill norovirus. You need to thoroughly wash your hands with soap and water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Norovirus is also hard to kill on surfaces, where it can live for days to weeks. If someone in your household vomits in the bathroom, you need to clean every contaminated surface with a disinfectant (typically bleach). The virus also can spread through &lt;a href="https://www.sun-sentinel.com/2024/12/21/norovirus-is-rampant-blame-oysters-cruise-ships-and-holiday-travel/"&gt;contaminated food&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Hand washing is key after you use the bathroom and before you prepare food,” said Dr. Indulekha Gopal, medical director for infection control at Broward Health North. “The main way it spreads is person to person and not washing your hands properly.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s what else you need to know, according to medical experts:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It doesn’t take much of the virus to make someone sick. Only a small particle is needed to pass on the infection.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Doctors recommend that adults and children stay hydrated with Pedialyte. “Pedialyte is less irritating to the stomach than Gatorade and people tolerate it better,” Gopal said. “Make sure to sip it frequently.” Dehydration can lead to other symptoms, like dizziness.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zofran or antinausea medications may be necessary to curb the vomiting and fluid loss and allow you to take a fever reducer. However, antidiarrheal medications can be tricky, said Garcia from Baptist Health South Florida. “Some bacterial infections present similar symptoms and antidiarrheal medications will worsen them. You need to discuss it with a healthcare provider,” she said. “My recommendation is to avoid them.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can’t get norovirus from someone coughing or sneezing, so masking won’t help.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Symptoms from norovirus usually last one to three days.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can still spread norovirus for days after you’re feeling better. “If you are preparing food and had norovirus a few weeks ago, you may be still shedding, so adhere to strict hand hygiene protocols,” Gopal said.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people get better after a few days. But not everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you are dizzy, weak and the vomiting is out of control, you may have to seek medical attention,” Gopal said. “Dehydration can be problematic for young children, the elderly and anyone who is immunocompromised.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;There is no antiviral treatment for norovirus, and while there isn’t currently a vaccine, drug manufacturer Moderna is working on one. Any norovirus vaccine would require an educated guess as to which strains would be likely to circulate in a given year, which is the same concept behind the annual flu vaccine.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, it is possible to get norovirus more than once in a season, Garcia added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If there are multiple strains around, you might have had the virus and created immunity to one strain and someone is around you with another strain and you get infected again,” she said. “That’s why washing your hands is so important.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;South Florida Sun Sentinel health reporter Cindy Goodman can be reached at cgoodman@sunsentinel.com.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Another parent said he was refusing to inoculate his 1-year-old because he didn’t want to “experiment” on his child.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;These and other recent discussions about measles vaccinations at Dr. Alex Cvijanovich’s Albuquerque, New Mexico, pediatric practice have been fraught since the highly contagious virus started making national headlines — and they’re only getting more challenging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“The people who are willing, are willing to give it early,” said Cvijanovich, who is also a spokesperson for the American Academy of Pediatrics. “But the people who have dug in their heels, it just becomes a more frustrating conversation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;As virus cases rise and the United States recorded its&lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/person-dies-measles-west-texas-outbreak-rcna193812" target="_blank"&gt; first measles death in a decade&lt;/a&gt;, pediatricians are in a dilemma. How do they convey the seriousness of the virus to vaccine-skeptical parents while also quelling the anxieties of families who want to immunize their newborns but can’t yet?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;It’s a delicate balancing act, according to six doctors in practices from West Virginia to Washington state. The measles, mumps and rubella vaccination has a proven track record against the highly contagious disease, with two doses of the shot 97% effective against measles, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/mmr/public/index.html#:~:text=One%20dose%20of%20MMR%20vaccine%20is%2093%25%20effective%20against%20measles,(weakened)%20live%20virus%20vaccine." target="_blank"&gt;according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;. Decades of &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccine-safety/vaccines/mmr.html" target="_blank"&gt;studies have shown it to be safe&lt;/a&gt; and have refuted false claims that it is linked to autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The measles outbreak so far has been concentrated in West Texas. But it comes at a pivotal moment for the country: Vaccine hesitancy, on the uptick for years, accelerated during the Covid pandemic. And now misinformation about vaccines has been spreading, fueled in part by Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who led a large anti-vaccine advocacy group before becoming head of Health and Human Services last month. Shortly after his confirmation, Kennedy vowed to investigate the schedule for childhood vaccines that prevent dangerous diseases like measles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Pediatricians say they’re seeing a lot of fear, both from parents who trust vaccinations and those who don’t, and they worry the anxiety from both sides will create confusion that will hamper public health efforts. The death of &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/person-dies-measles-west-texas-outbreak-rcna193812" target="_blank"&gt;an unvaccinated child&lt;/a&gt; in Texas last month has not been enough to sway everyone to immunize their children, and pediatricians are worried more kids will get sick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“I feel like this is still snowballing,” said Dr. Lesley Motheral, a pediatrician in Lubbock, Texas. “I think we still have a lot of work to do, to be very honest with you.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/mmr/public/index.html" target="_blank"&gt; CDC recommends&lt;/a&gt; administering the first MMR shot at around age 1 and the second at ages 4 to 6. In cases where an infant has been exposed to measles or is traveling to a known outbreak area, pediatricians can administer a dosage as early as 6 months old — something some parents have pleaded for as more measles cases are reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Most children in the United States receive their MMR vaccinations on schedule, with nearly 93% receiving the shots by kindergarten, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7341a3.htm" target="_blank"&gt;according to the CDC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;But in West Texas, where the measles outbreak is concentrated with at least &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-feb-28-2025" target="_blank"&gt;159 reported cases&lt;/a&gt;, vaccination rates are significantly lower. In Gaines County, the epicenter of the outbreak, the immunization exemption rate was more than 17% for the 2023-2024 school year, according to &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/immunizations/data/school/conscientious-exemptions" target="_blank"&gt;health department data&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Experts say that at least 95% of a community must be vaccinated to protect against a measles outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“We rely on herd immunity for measles prevention,” said Dr. Christina Hermos, division chief of pediatric infectious disease and immunology at UMass Memorial Children’s Medical Center. “Measles is so incredibly contagious that you only need one person flying in or traveling to a region to give a nonimmune person a case.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The respiratory virus spreads rapidly because it is transmitted through droplets that can linger in the air or on surfaces for up &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/causes/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;to two hours&lt;/a&gt;, meaning an infected person doesn’t have to remain in a room to contaminate other people. Measles causes a telltale rash, but an infected individual can spread the virus up to four days before the rash appears.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Measles also causes fevers and red, watery eyes and &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccine-safety/vaccines/mmr.html" target="_blank"&gt;can lead to complications&lt;/a&gt; such as pneumonia or, in rare cases, brain damage and death. For every 1,000 children who get measles, about one to three will die from respiratory and neurologic complications, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/hcp/clinical-overview/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;the CDC says&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The United States &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/hcp/clinical-overview/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;declared measles eliminated in 2000&lt;/a&gt;, despite some cases being reported since.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Pediatricians now fear the country could backslide in its containment efforts, especially because Kennedy has long criticized childhood vaccinations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;As the measles outbreak has unfolded under his watch, he has not urged widespread vaccination, &lt;a href="https://amp.cnn.com/cnn/2025/03/03/health/warren-letter-rfk-vaccines" target="_blank"&gt;drawing ire&lt;/a&gt; from health experts and politicians. In an &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/robert-f-kennedy-jr-measles-outbreak-call-action-all-us" target="_blank"&gt;op-ed published on Fox News’ website&lt;/a&gt;, he called the decision to vaccinate “a personal one” and wrote, “All parents should consult with their healthcare providers to understand their options to get the MMR vaccine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Elizabeth Meade, a Seattle pediatrician, said she finds it “enormously concerning” to have a vaccine-skeptic person as the nation’s health secretary. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“I think there is this real sense among people in the United States that they are not at risk for these diseases, especially if they’re not traveling outside of the U.S.,” said Meade, who is also an American Academy of Pediatrics spokesperson. “Unfortunately, it is just not true.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Some parents who once supported immunization have since changed their minds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“I see incredibly intelligent people coming in,” said Hermos, who in addition to being an infectious diseases doctor is an associate professor of pediatrics at UMass Chan Medical School. “Their child has a full vaccination record, and then they’re due for their next one, and they’re completely convinced that they’re making a decision between two potentially harmful things for their kids, like, ‘I could potentially harm them with this vaccine versus I could potentially harm them with this disease of the vaccine.’” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;In Morgantown, West Virginia, pediatrician Dr. Lisa Costello has found that acknowledging the common ground she has with vaccine-hesitant parents is helpful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“Everyone’s coming from the space that they’re trying to do what’s best for their child that they love, and it’s a matter of having those conversations and sharing from the medical literature we have on this,” said Costello, an assistant professor of pediatrics at West Virginia University. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;But it’s keeping some parents of newborns home out of fear that, because others in the practice might not be vaccinating their children regularly, their tiny babies who are too young to get the MMR shot could be at risk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The doctors said there are steps that parents can take to protect their children if they are too young to get the vaccination, such as asking the adults who spend time near their kids if they are vaccinated themselves; asking at their day care if all children who are eligible for vaccinations have been immunized; and not being around anyone who is or recently was sick. They also recommended bringing up early vaccination with their pediatrician.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“There are those folks now that are calling that are anxious about it and want to get it even earlier than the recommended schedule,” said Dr. Steven Abelowitz, medical director of Ocean Pediatrics in Orange County, California. “It’s OK to do it after six months, but make sure the insurance covers it and it’s not out of pocket.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;In Texas, Motheral said her local health department has been giving free MMR vaccinations. She hopes more people will agree to receive them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“It is so sad that a disease that we once felt was eradicated in this country, and really still should be, is making a resurgence,” she said. “Even one death for measles is too many.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Tue, 04 Mar 2025 22:44:04 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitgFBVV95cUxPa1BNdVoxRXlNT1JZOWNrRFEwTHZINUJOWFVsV2s2dGg0cXhWekkyckdZUXFEQ2JZNVJnQnUwV3BIT19YeENIZWV6QUQyb050Ym02bHE2QnEtSmlFUS1qNjNlNWVxLXFrbkoyb3d4Nk5ueHJsZ3NiS2pnVDBQS1ROWmZZd3gxTGlJNnBwNXBXZk1ZTE5sVGRnWS1xdlFYWUxlOU5tTHlpVG15WmVGRHVVUnlvVk8wZ9IBVkFVX3lxTE1LYjB3QnBLN3RBVHNNT2VrMnpJYWZQQnlhemFCS2tVMmd2T1otRnhNN1ZuZjZ2WkVxb21FYkdhTEl3UldQTXduV19ILWdxN0xXcG9sZDBR</guid></item><item><title>What Is a 'Labia Puff' — and Why Are Women Getting It? - AOL</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicEFVX3lxTE0wYTh3UEtmRU9KZTlyOEk4QmFQSkJxa1hLQkVRcmFMQ1d2Z2tGX3R0UjVMbU9IUFRKUDRZb25vb3RBTDRkLWNZX0xjbUxrWW5tU2daNzBTZXN0SjdsYmxIemJqSm5mNUdiTTJURnlJa28?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cavan Images/Getty; Inti St Clair/Getty&lt;/p&gt; (Left:) Stock image of a doctor with a syringe; (Right:) A woman wears a bikini.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;A trendy &lt;a href="https://people.com/cosmetic-procedures/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:cosmetic surgery procedure;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;cosmetic surgery procedure&lt;/a&gt; promises to give women a more youthful look — on their vulvas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Called a 'Labia Puff', the procedure injects &lt;a href="https://people.com/celebs-are-getting-their-filler-dissolved-but-is-everyone-else-8772012" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:fillers;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;fillers&lt;/a&gt; or fat into the labia majora, the outer lips of a woman’s genitals, to give it a fuller look.

			&lt;p&gt;Analysis of human brain tissue revealed differences in how immune cells behave in brains with  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="153764" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; disease compared to healthy brains, indicating a potential new treatment target.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;University of Washington-led research, published in 2023, discovered &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microglia"&gt;microglia&lt;/a&gt; in the brains of people with Alzheimer's disease were &lt;span&gt;in a pre-inflammatory state &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;more frequently, making them less likely to be protective.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microglia are immune cells that help keep our brains healthy by clearing waste and preserving normal brain function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response to infection or to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/for-the-first-time-scientists-capture-video-of-brains-clearing-out-dead-neurons"&gt;clear out dead cells&lt;/a&gt;, these nifty shape-shifters can become less spindly and more mobile to engulf invaders and rubbish. They also &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1202529"&gt;'prune' synapses during development&lt;/a&gt;, which helps shape the circuitry for our brains to function well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's less certain what part they play in Alzheimer's, but in people with the devastating neurodegenerative disease, some microglia respond too strongly and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/imcb.12301"&gt;may cause inflammation&lt;/a&gt; that contributes to the death of brain cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately,  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/clinical-trials" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73032" data-postid="153764" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/braincomms/fcaa109"&gt;anti-inflammatory medications for Alzheimer's haven't shown significant effects&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_143533" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-143533" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/ComputerArtworkOfSynapseBetwwwnNeurons_R_U_642.jpg" alt="Blue neurons connecting " class="size-medium wp-image-143533" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/ComputerArtworkOfSynapseBetwwwnNeurons_R_U_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/ComputerArtworkOfSynapseBetwwwnNeurons_R_U_642-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/ComputerArtworkOfSynapseBetwwwnNeurons_R_U_642-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-143533" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Computer Illustration of a synapse between two neurons. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MADmTH5y7O4/"&gt;Science Photo Library/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;To look closer at the role of microglia in Alzheimer's disease, University of Washington neuroscientists Katherine Prater and Kevin Green, along with colleagues from multiple US institutions, used brain autopsy samples from research donors – 12 who had Alzheimer's and 10 healthy controls – to study the gene activity of microglia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using a new method to enhance &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SnRNA-seq"&gt;single-nucleus RNA sequencing&lt;/a&gt;, the team was able to identify in depth 10 different clusters of microglia in the brain tissue based on their unique set of gene expression, which tells the cells what to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;hree of the clusters hadn't been seen before, and one of them was more common in people with Alzheimer's disease. This type of microglia has genes turned on that are involved in inflammation and cell death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, the researchers found that microglia clusters in the brains of people with Alzheimer's disease were more likely to be those in a pre-inflammatory state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means they were more likely to produce inflammatory molecules that can damage brain cells and possibly contribute to the progression of Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The microglia types in the brains of people with Alzheimer's disease were less likely to be protective, compromising their ability to pull their weight in cleaning up dead cells and waste and promoting healthy brain aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_103339" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-103339" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/08/PhotomicrographOfMicrogliaInAD.jpg" alt="Photomicrograph of microglia from a brain affected by Alzheimer's disease." class="size-full wp-image-103339" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/08/PhotomicrographOfMicrogliaInAD.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/08/PhotomicrographOfMicrogliaInAD-589x415.jpg 589w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/08/PhotomicrographOfMicrogliaInAD-600x422.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-103339" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Photomicrograph of microglia (green) from a brain affected by Alzheimer's.

So we can't just look at a person's brain and say for sure what type of microglia they have; keeping track of how microglia change over time could help us understand how they contribute to Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"At this point, we can't say whether the microglia are causing the pathology or whether the pathology is causing these microglia to alter their behavior," &lt;a href="https://newsroom.uw.edu/news-releases/study-links-changes-in-brain-immune-cells-to-alzheimers"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; Prater.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This research advances our understanding of these cells' role in Alzheimer's disease and suggests certain microglia clusters may be targets for new treatments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team is hopeful that their work will lead to the development of new therapies that can improve the lives of people with Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Now that we have determined the genetic profiles of these microglia, we can try to find out exactly what they are doing and hopefully identify ways to change their behaviors that may be contributing to Alzheimer's disease," Prater &lt;a href="https://newsroom.uw.edu/news-releases/study-links-changes-in-brain-immune-cells-to-alzheimers"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"If we can determine what they are doing, we might be able to change their behavior with treatments that might prevent or slow this disease."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s43587-023-00424-y"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Aging&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An earlier version of this article was published in August 2023.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Researchers said the findings are concerning, especially because rates of throat and tongue cancers in men linked to HPV are rising.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;45% of those surveyed did not know of other cancer risks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, the survey included 1,005 respondents who completed the survey in early February of this year.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among respondents, 45% did not know if HPV was linked to cancers other than cervical cancer. A similar percentage, 42%, said HPV was more common in women than in men. HPV is actually more common in men, but only women are screened for the virus, the authors said.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is concerning because more men are infected with HPV than women and they could unknowingly spread it to their partners,” said Electra Paskett, PhD, a professor in The Ohio State University College of Medicine, &lt;a href="https://cancer.osu.edu/news/hidden-dangers-and-myths-what-you-need-to-know-about-hpv-and-cancer"&gt;&lt;u&gt;in a press release &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;from the university’s Wexner Medical Center.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tonsil and tongue-based cancers could become most common&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, many of the cancers caused by HPV, including cervical and oropharyngeal (tonsil and tongue base) do not produce symptoms until they are advanced. Ohio State researchers said the rapidly rising rates of HPV-related oropharyngeal (tonsil and tongue base) cancers could be among the most common forms of cancer in adults between the ages of 45 and 65 years old if trends continue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once exposed, there are currently no treatments for HPV infections, and many who are unvaccinated unknowingly carry and spread high-risk strains of the virus&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It can take years or even decades for the genetic changes caused by HPV to take effect and transform into cancer,” said Matthew Old, MD, a head and neck surgeon at Ohio State. “Once exposed, there are currently no treatments for HPV infections, and many who are unvaccinated unknowingly carry and spread high-risk strains of the virus. That’s why vaccination is so important.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, 42 million Americans are estimated to have HPV.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cervical cancer mortality higher in rural counties&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In related news, a cross-sectional study found a recent increase in cervical cancer incidence in rural US counties, specifically among white women, and the incidence was 25% higher and mortality 42% higher in rural counties in recent years.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2830824"&gt;&lt;u&gt;The study &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;was published in &lt;em&gt;JAMA Network Open, &lt;/em&gt;and authors said the findings underscore discrepancies in vaccine uptake and lower screening coverage in rural areas.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data came from the National Program of Cancer Registries and Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (NPCR-SEER) database. Between 2001 and 2019, 222,425 cervical cancer cases were identified, of which 84.3% were from urban counties and 59.9% were in White women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cervical cancer incidence increased by 0.85% per year (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.08% to 2.05%) in rural counties from 2012 to 2019 after decreasing from 2001 to 2012. Incidence in urban counties decreased from 2001 to 2013, then plateaued from 2013 to 2019.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Overall, mortality was 1.42 (95% CI, 1.33 to 1.51) times higher in rural vs urban counties during 2015 to 2019,” the authors said. Rural Black, White, and Hispanic women were all more likely to die from cervical cancer compared to urban counterparts.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The findings from this study highlight the importance of enhancing preventive care (HPV vaccination and screening access) in rural US counties, which remains suboptimal in comparison with their urban counterparts,” the authors concluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Kennedy Jr., the health secretary who has drawn criticism for his muted response to the outbreak. Last week &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/26/us/texas-measles-outbreak-death.html" title=""&gt;a child died&lt;/a&gt;, the first measles death in the United States in a decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The C.D.C. has no authority to go into Texas or any other state on its own; when an outbreak occurs, the agency must be invited in by state health officials. The partnership, known as an Epi-Aid, is a rapid-response effort in which the Epidemic Intelligence Service Officers — the “disease detectives” — will provide local officials support for one to three weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“The measles outbreak in Texas is a call to action for all of us to reaffirm our commitment to public health,” Mr. Kennedy said in the statement. “By working together — parents, health care providers, community leaders and government officials, we can prevent future outbreaks and protect the health of our nation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Measles is a highly contagious respiratory illness that can be life-threatening. Vaccines can offer broad protection and are usually administered to children. The two doses are typically given in a combination measles-mumps-rubella, or M.M.R., vaccine and prevent more than 97 percent of measles infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Mr. Kennedy said last week that the administration was supporting the Texas Department of Health through “technical assistance and vaccines,” including sending 2,000 M.M.R. shots and providing laboratory support for better tracking the virus that is causing the outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;He said Health and Human Services officials had also been in communication with local public health officials, and had updated the C.D.C. website with guidance on how to manage the disease — including administering vitamin A, which &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7076287/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;studies have shown can help treat measles&lt;/a&gt; in malnourished children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;But Mr. Kennedy has not used his bully pulpit to encourage vaccination. A longtime critic of vaccines who has used his platform to suggest, without evidence, that the measles vaccine causes autism, Mr. Kennedy has repeatedly said that he is not anti-vaccine, he is simply pro-choice, and wants parents to have enough information to make decisions about vaccination on their own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;He initially &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/26/us/texas-measles-outbreak-death.html" title=""&gt;downplayed the measles outbreak&lt;/a&gt; during a Cabinet meeting last week, when he dismissed the child’s death as “not unusual.” Over the weekend, he switched gears, writing an opinion piece for Fox News in which he offered only a tepid endorsement of vaccination, saying the vaccine can “protect individual children from measles.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-2"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;But his message came with a caveat. “The decision to vaccinate is a personal one,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The New York Times</author><pubDate>Tue, 04 Mar 2025 19:31:37 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifEFVX3lxTE05T2syZWZyQjBRSWd5b0hPbVhtS1JhdU1DYmV2MS1kcnZEdkpqNjZvUFoxNTBKaUZvTFJ2d3VBZmU0QW03azJDaU1adUNRX3NEY1ZiWno2TUdycWhPMFA5bGFjeDBnb0dUcFJDaG9BMF9lZnZzQUR3WEYzNUk</guid></item><item><title>Brain damage reported in 13% of kids who have died of flu this season, CDC finds - Livescience.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiwwFBVV95cUxNOThubl93OVJVMWJCenNHRVhTOVRCSU5XZXdyTU1oblR5eHFEMk1nS2E3aHJXcTJ6clhGXzZaNHdvSlVEVFRuN1dtcnl6a0Y2aGNLS0VoY2dxeVRFOHhCQUtyVGJic29ZWktLWW9UWlc5NkFlUnRIS3Y3cTZEcFZvc3U5SW5ENHhZZjFGN3JBa3BpNjVMdGZQa1A1UHowYVpPTmVpb1BPQ05mRnpFd0o4S19fZHcySUJkRU1ZTy1seWtpeGM?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-body" class="text-copy bodyCopy auto"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roughly 1 in 8 child flu deaths in the U.S. so far this year have been linked to brain damage, according to a report released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. is experiencing its most &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/flu/the-us-is-having-its-most-active-flu-season-in-15-years" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/flu/the-us-is-having-its-most-active-flu-season-in-15-years"&gt;&lt;u&gt;severe flu season&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in more than a decade, Live Science previously reported. More than 19,000 people have died including 68 children, at least nine of whom had flu-associated brain complications, according to a CDC &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7406a3.htm?s_cid=mm7406a3_w" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7406a3.htm?s_cid=mm7406a3_w" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; published on Feb. 27.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In January, the CDC received anecdotal reports of children becoming critically ill and dying with influenza-associated encephalopathy or encephalitis (IAE), a spectrum of neurological syndromes. Encephalopathy is a group of conditions that cause brain dysfunction while encephalitis causes brain swelling, according to the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/6058-encephalitis" target="_blank" data-url="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/6058-encephalitis" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. IAE symptoms include seizures, decreased level of consciousness, hallucinations and personality changes lasting more than 24 hours, according to the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC doesn't normally track cases of IAE, so it's not clear whether the number of cases reported this season is higher than in previous years. However, they did warn doctors to be on the lookout for IAE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is not known whether cases observed in the 2024–25 season vary from expected numbers," the CDC report authors wrote. "Clinicians should consider IAE in children with influenza and abnormal neurologic signs or symptoms."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/flu/how-do-people-die-of-the-flu" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/flu/how-do-people-die-of-the-flu"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do people die of the flu?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flu is among the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/56598-deadliest-viruses-on-earth.html#section-influenza" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/56598-deadliest-viruses-on-earth.html#section-influenza"&gt;&lt;u&gt;deadliest viruses&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the world. While it kills around 1.8 people per 100,000 infections, flu infects enough people that thousands die from it every year in the U.S. Nervous system injury, including IAE, is one of the main causes of flu fatalities among children, according to a 2021 study published in the journal &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7789050/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7789050/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Medical Science Monitor.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-vjExxfrXj2sxHjFSqWRMc9" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-vjExxfrXj2sxHjFSqWRMc9 slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;To investigate anecdotal reports of IAE, the CDC contacted state health departments for data on influenza-associated deaths in children across flu seasons between 2010 and 2025. Flu can spread all year round, but there are more cases in the fall and winter (the flu season), with activity peaking between December and February, according to the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/season.html" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/season.html" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;CDC&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC found that as of Feb. 8 in the 2024-2025 season, 68 children had died with flu, with IAE documented in nine (13%) of those cases. That compares to a rate of 9% across all years, but it varied season to season and peaked at 14% in the 2011-2012 season, according to the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the CDC couldn't identify whether the current rate of IAE was abnormal, the report highlighted the importance of vaccination and recommended flu shots for all eligible people aged 6 months or older so long as influenza viruses are circulating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Influenza vaccination is an important tool for preventing influenza and its associated complications," the report authors wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="flu-vaccine-uncertainty-3"&gt;Flu vaccine uncertainty&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early data suggest that this year's flu shots have &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/flu/this-years-flu-shot-was-up-to-78-percent-effective-at-preventing-hospitalization-in-kids-early-data-find" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/flu/this-years-flu-shot-was-up-to-78-percent-effective-at-preventing-hospitalization-in-kids-early-data-find"&gt;&lt;u&gt;dramatically reduced seasonal flu hospitalizations&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. However, uncertainty hangs over the next vaccination round for the 2025-2026 season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flu mutates quickly. So every year, manufacturers use strains circulating in the Southern Hemisphere to predict the strains most likely to circulate in the coming season and create updated versions of the flu vaccine targeted to those strains. A U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) advisory panel normally meets around this time of year to decide which strains should be included in the vaccines for the next season. That meeting was scheduled for Mar. 13 but was canceled without reason, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/us-fda-confirms-cancellation-vaccine-advisers-meeting-2025-02-27/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/us-fda-confirms-cancellation-vaccine-advisers-meeting-2025-02-27/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Reuters reported&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on Feb. 28.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is concern among experts that the cancellation could disrupt the production of flu vaccines, which could mean higher rates of serious illness and death, Live Science previously reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An FDA spokesperson told Reuters on Feb. 28 that it would make recommendations to manufacturers public in time for updated vaccines to be available for the 2025-2026 season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the second time a vaccine advisory panel has been disrupted since Robert F. Kennedy Jr. took over as head of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Reuters reported. Kennedy Jr. is a notable vaccine skeptic, though he's &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://11/news/articles/c0mzk2y41zvo" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c0mzk2y41zvo" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed="hawklinks" data-placeholder-url="https://11/news/articles/c0mzk2y41zvo" data-google-interstitial="false" data-merchant-name="HAWK 6887 HAWK 3810" data-merchant-id="560567" data-merchant-network="Generic" data-merchant-url="bbc.co.uk"&gt;&lt;u&gt;denied being anti-vaccine&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-freeText-vjExxfrXj2sxHjFSqWRMc9-FdmpY9gQ7zQdZ1YrANqLil04kMsckKGJ" class="slice-container freeText-wrapper freeText-vjExxfrXj2sxHjFSqWRMc9-FdmpY9gQ7zQdZ1YrANqLil04kMsckKGJ slice-container-freeText"&gt;&lt;div class="info-block"&gt;&lt;p class="infoDisclaimer"&gt;This article is for informational purposes only and is not meant to offer medical advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

                    &lt;p&gt;Tossing and turning more as you age? You’re not alone — and experts think they know why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.drshelbyharris.com/"&gt;Dr. Shelby Harris&lt;/a&gt;, a sleep psychologist in White Plains, N.Y., explained that stress, sleep structure and hormonal changes can impact sleep as people age.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"As we start to move into our 60s, 70s, you have more issues with the depth of your sleep, so your sleep is just lighter in general," Harris told &lt;em&gt;CBS News&lt;/em&gt;. "There's sleep disorders, like &lt;a href="https://www.healthday.com/a-to-z-health/sleep-disorder/why-can-t-i-sleep-2659520817.html"&gt;insomnia&lt;/a&gt;, that happens, and then you have to go to the bathroom more at night."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28159095/"&gt;Research shows&lt;/a&gt; up to 70% of people 65 and older have chronic sleep problems, and hormonal shifts play a big role in that, especially for women.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We have more hot flashes, night sweats. You actually have more sleep apnea in women as well, and just more insomnia too," Harris said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There may also be some evolutionary reasoning behind why older adults get less deep sleep, Harris added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The deepest stage of sleep is where your muscles are repairing, you're growing — and as you're getting older, you don't need that ideally as much as you do when you're younger," Harris said, adding that younger kids get a lot of deep sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"(Older adults) just wake up a lot more because of pain and movement and having to urinate," she added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What's more, Harris told &lt;em&gt;CBS News&lt;/em&gt; it’s a myth that older adults don’t need much sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"If a doctor tells you that is normal to get a lot less as you get older, definitely seek some other advice," Harris said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along with keeping a cool, dark and quiet sleep environment, she offered these tips:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Meditate during the day. “If you have a busy brain, meditating five minutes during the day can help to actually ease your brain more at night,” Harris said.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Limit daytime sleep. To try and get better sleep at night, you can also try spending less time in bed during the day, Harris added. That means reducing naps. &lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Stick to a regular bedtime.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If sleep issues last more than a few weeks, it’s important to talk with a doctor, Harris urged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We do have a lot of treatments like cognitive behavior therapy for insomnia, you might need a sleep study, medication," she said. "We have lots of options." &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


                    

                    
                &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Called a 'Labia Puff', the procedure injects &lt;a href="https://people.com/celebs-are-getting-their-filler-dissolved-but-is-everyone-else-8772012" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;fillers&lt;/a&gt; or fat into the labia majora, the outer lips of a woman’s genitals, to give it a fuller look. As Dr. Karen Leong, a plastic surgeon who offers the procedure &lt;a href="https://drkarenleong.com/surgical/vaginal-rejuvenation/labia-puff/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt;, “a ‘labia puff’ can give you a younger, more rejuvenated-looking vulva. As collagen production slows down with age, it is possible for sagging and wrinkles to appear on our bodies, including the vulva area.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; But “while older women often want rejuvenation after childbirth or menopause,"  plastic surgeon &lt;a href="https://www.irasavetskymd.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Dr. Ira Savetsky&lt;/a&gt; told&lt;em&gt; &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/03/03/health/labia-puff-surgery-makes-vaginas-look-more-youthful-say-plastic-surgeons/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;The New York Post&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, younger women "who have lost weight" are seeking the procedure as well, looking for "volume restoration."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Some women feel that this change makes the area look aged or less aesthetically pleasing,” Savetsky added.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; These &lt;a href="https://people.com/lisa-rinna-talks-beauty-and-dissolving-facial-fillers-exclusive-8641764" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;fillers&lt;/a&gt; can carry a price tag of up to $5,000. But plastic surgeon &lt;a href="https://biancamolinamd.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Dr. Bianca Molina&lt;/a&gt; told the &lt;em&gt;NYP&lt;/em&gt;, the procedure is “super hot right now.”

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Reddit’s r/Menopause community sounded off on the procedure, with one &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Menopause/comments/1fmg6ci/comment/loakza0/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Redditor&lt;/a&gt; saying, “I am on my 2nd UTI in six months and the whole mess down there is on fire.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Normal aging will deflate the labia a little …  IT’S OK! No one cares,” wrote another &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Menopause/comments/1fmg6ci/comment/lobpc6i/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Redditor&lt;/a&gt;. “The idea that women think they need filler to make their labia look better is ridiculous and a very sad statement about our culture.”

The filler made everything much better, and I do not have pain any longer. I think it’s a viable treatment for people who have similar issues.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; And as one Redditor&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DIYaesthetics/comments/1g5bauc/comment/lsf63be/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt; pointed out&lt;/a&gt;, that the criticism is misogynistic: “Not sure why ppl are clutching their pearls over this when these micro [erectile dysfunction] guys out here jacking up their Johnsons with fillers for years.

					&lt;p&gt;Let's be honest—most guys have stood in front of the mirror at some point, flexing and wondering how to pack on more muscle. Whether you want to look better at the beach or just be stronger for everyday life, &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/muscle-building-tips-for-guys/" target="_blank"&gt;building muscle&lt;/a&gt; is probably on your radar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Due to the social stigma attached to getting 'bigger,' we see quite a few guys with muscle-building goals. Most of the time, this is a purely cosmetic goal, but there are several ways that growing your muscles can support your overall health. On top of just feeling stronger in general, developing muscles can also increase bone density and improve your metabolic health," says &lt;strong&gt;Marshall Weber&lt;/strong&gt;, Owner and Personal Trainer at &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://jackcityfitness.com/trainer/marshall-weber/" target="_blank"&gt;Jack City Fitness&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  
&lt;p&gt;"Building muscle isn't just about looking good—it's also central to metabolism, longevity, and overall health. Increased muscle mass is associated with healthy weight maintenance, better knee stability (and decreased injury risk) as we age, and increased functional strength with aging," adds &lt;strong&gt;Chris Pruitt&lt;/strong&gt;, CEO &amp;amp; Certified Trainer at &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://workouthealthy.com/" target="_blank"&gt;WorkoutHealthy&lt;/a&gt;, with more than 16 years of experience in fitness and &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/functional-training-exercises-to-build-strength/" target="_blank"&gt;strength training&lt;/a&gt;. Stick with us, and we'll show you exactly which exercises will get you the results you want—no more wasting time in the gym.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"To maximize muscle growth, men need to train major muscle groups twice per week, as long as they're recovering properly and continually adding resistance," says Pruitt. "For guys that want to see results, you have to hit the iron at least 2 to 3 times per week. Remember that form is one of the most important things here. Progressive overload is also important to safely explore but will really mean nothing if your form is not looking too good," adds Weber.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"For guys that are struggling to pack on muscle, remember that you have to take in the fuel to match your training efforts. Eating enough protein for muscle building is crucial, and without proper fuel in your tank, your body is not going to change all that much," says Weber. "Mistakes that would get in the way of gaining muscle include no progressive overload, bad nutrition, and no recovery. If you're in a rut, small tweaks to your rep schemes, protein consumption, and sleep are often alchemized into gold," adds Pruitt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overhead presses build major mass in the shoulders. I am equally a fan of dumbbell and barbell overhead presses, but the dumbbell variation is more forgiving on novice lifters who have not perfected the barbell technique.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To perform a dumbbell overhead press, begin standing with a dumbbell in each hand, held at shoulder height. Press the dumbbells overhead until your arms lock out. Bring them together at the top for a maximal squeeze. Return to the starting position. Aim to perform three to four sets of eight to 12 reps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"For overhead press, the number one culprit of poor form is allowing the back to arch. So keep your core tight, and engage the glutes," says Weber. "Maintain proper core stability and avoid hyperextending through the lower back," adds Pruitt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dumbbell rows train the horizontal rowing motion which develops the posterior shoulders, upper back, and biceps.&lt;span aria-hidden="true"&gt;6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To perform dumbbell rows, begin with a dumbbell in one hand and the other hand positioned on a bench with your torso leaning forward. Row the dumbbell upward until your upper arm is in line with your torso. Return to the starting position. Aim to perform three to four sets of eight to 12 reps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Maintain a neutral spine and pull through your elbows and not just your hands to get those lats activated," says Pruitt. "Remember to keep the back flat! If you are trying to go too heavy, your back will begin to round and could potentially lead to injury," adds Weber.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This list of exercises for men to build muscle wraps up with the dip. Dips are a bodyweight exercise that builds the triceps, shoulders, and chest. You can use a bench to perform dips, but I prefer parallel bars or rings to allow full body weight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To perform dips, begin on parallel bars with your arms straight going downward, gripping the bars. Lower your chest toward the floor by bending your elbows and pivoting at the shoulder joint. Lower until your upper arms are parallel with your torso. Drive through both hands to return to the starting position. Aim to perform three to four sets of eight to 12 reps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Lean slightly forward and control your descent so you don't overload your shoulders," says Pruitt. "These are always different for the person, but avoid leaning forward too much to avoid hurting the shoulders," adds Weber.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Feet shoulder-width, do not lock out at the top," says Pruitt. "Some people think that locking the knees at the top of a leg press gives a little bit of a break to catch your breath. This can put some serious strain on the lower back, especially when you try to unlock them and get back into the press," says Weber.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Focus on hinging at the hip versus bending from the waist and ensure the barbell remains close to your body," says Pruitt. "Pay attention to your spine during this move. You MUST push the hips backward while you get into the deadlift to avoid bending at the waist. This is so often the exercise that takes people out of the gym because it tweaks their back," says Weber.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;h2 class="o-slide-title" data-num="6"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Pushups&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
	
&lt;figure id="754022"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class="lazyload" src="https://www.eatthis.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2023/09/pushups.jpeg?quality=82&amp;amp;strip=all&amp;amp;w=640" alt="pushups, exercises for men to build muscle"&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="lazyload" src="" xmlns='"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"' viewbox='"0' data-src="https://www.eatthis.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2023/09/pushups.jpeg?quality=82&amp;amp;strip=all&amp;amp;w=640" alt="pushups, exercises for men to build muscle"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Shutterstock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First up on this list of exercises for men to build muscle is the pushup. Pushups are an amazing bodyweight exercise. They work your shoulders, chest, triceps, and core with no equipment and allow a variety of progressions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To perform a standard pushup, start in a plank position, and lower your chest and body toward the floor by bending at your elbows and shoulders while maintaining a braced core. When your body is about an inch off the ground, drive through both hands to return to the top position. Aim to perform three to five sets of 15 reps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make this exercise more difficult, you can move your hands closer together or shift your body forward while keeping your hands in place to decrease the leverage and increase the muscular difficulty. Finally, advanced individuals can work towards a one-arm pushup.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;h2 class="o-slide-title" data-num="7"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Air Squats&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
	
&lt;figure id="752572"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class="lazyload" src="https://www.eatthis.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2023/08/man-squats.jpeg?quality=82&amp;amp;strip=all&amp;amp;w=640" alt="man doing squats, exercises for men to build muscle"&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="lazyload" src="" xmlns='"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"' viewbox='"0' data-src="https://www.eatthis.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2023/08/man-squats.jpeg?quality=82&amp;amp;strip=all&amp;amp;w=640" alt="man doing squats, exercises for men to build muscle"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Shutterstock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Squats are a must-do exercise for muscle size in your lower body. Standard squats start with your feet hip-width distance apart. Sit back, and lower your hips by bending at the waist and knees until your thighs are parallel to the floor. At the bottom of your squat, drive through both feet to return to the starting position. Aim to perform three to five sets of 15 reps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make the exercise more challenging, you can add a jump at the top of each repetition or carry some external weight such as a backpack.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;h2 class="o-slide-title" data-num="8"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Lunges&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
	
&lt;figure id="729859"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class="lazyload" src="https://www.eatthis.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2023/05/reverse-lunges.jpg?quality=82&amp;amp;strip=all&amp;amp;w=640" alt="reverse lunges exercise"&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="lazyload" src="" xmlns='"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"' viewbox='"0' data-src="https://www.eatthis.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2023/05/reverse-lunges.jpg?quality=82&amp;amp;strip=all&amp;amp;w=640" alt="reverse lunges exercise"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Shutterstock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lunges are another great lower-body exercise to build muscle in the glutes, quads, and hamstrings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perform a lunge by stepping forward with a large step and lowering your whole body by dropping your back knee toward the floor. When your knee is an inch off the floor, press through the front foot to return to the starting position. Aim to perform three to five sets of 15 reps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make the exercise more challenging, perform an explosive jump between each repetition, or elevate your front or rear foot on a step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-article__related-link"&gt;&lt;span class="c-article__related-link-inner"&gt;&lt;a class="related-link" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/69-year-old-trainers-fitness-habits/" target="_blank"&gt;A 69-Year-Old Trainer Shares the 7 Fitness Habits That Keep Her Looking 25&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;h2 class="o-slide-title" data-num="9"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Pull-ups&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
	
&lt;figure id="728448"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class="lazyload" src="https://www.eatthis.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2023/04/pull-ups-exercise.jpg?quality=82&amp;amp;strip=all&amp;amp;w=640" alt="illustration of pull-ups exercise"&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="lazyload" src="" xmlns='"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"' viewbox='"0' data-src="https://www.eatthis.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2023/04/pull-ups-exercise.jpg?quality=82&amp;amp;strip=all&amp;amp;w=640" alt="illustration of pull-ups exercise"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Shutterstock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pull-ups &lt;em&gt;technically&lt;/em&gt; require equipment since you need somewhere to hang onto and pull yourself up. Play structures or public parks often have suitable bars for pull-ups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using an overhand or underhand grip, hang onto a bar, and pull your chest to the bar by bending at the elbows and shoulder. Aim to perform three to five sets of 15 reps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can make pull-ups more difficult by changing grip variations, increasing speed on the upward movement while slowing the downward movement, or by adding external weight.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;h2 class="o-slide-title" data-num="10"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Sprints&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
	
&lt;figure id="754701"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class="lazyload" src="https://www.eatthis.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2023/09/sprinting.jpeg?quality=82&amp;amp;strip=all&amp;amp;w=640" alt="sprinting exercise"&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="lazyload" src="" xmlns='"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"' viewbox='"0' data-src="https://www.eatthis.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2023/09/sprinting.jpeg?quality=82&amp;amp;strip=all&amp;amp;w=640" alt="sprinting exercise"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Shutterstock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Believe it or not, performing all-out sprints and similar training builds muscle in the lower body, similar to resistance training. You can also progress fairly easily by increasing your speed or distance covered in each sprint. I recommend starting with 40-meter sprints and performing five to 10 total sprints per workout.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;h2 class="o-slide-title" data-num="11"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Single-Leg Squats&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
	
&lt;figure id="771268"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class="lazyload" src="https://www.eatthis.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2023/12/single-leg-squat.jpeg?quality=82&amp;amp;strip=all&amp;amp;w=640" alt="man doing single-leg squat"&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="lazyload" src="" xmlns='"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"' viewbox='"0' data-src="https://www.eatthis.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2023/12/single-leg-squat.jpeg?quality=82&amp;amp;strip=all&amp;amp;w=640" alt="man doing single-leg squat"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Shutterstock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Performing a squat on one leg, sometimes called a "pistol squat," is challenging. However, it allows you to put your entire body weight on a single leg, drastically increasing your ability to continue to build muscle in your legs after regular squats become too easy to properly stimulate further muscle growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Begin this exercise standing, and straighten one leg out in front of you. Lower your body by bending the planted leg, keeping your other leg extended the whole time. At the bottom, push through your planted foot to return to the top position. Aim to perform three to five sets of 15 reps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This exercise is beyond the reach of most individuals. However, if you progress to the point where you can perform this exercise, the handstand pushup is a very effective way to build muscle in your chest and shoulders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start in a handstand, lower your chest, and face toward the floor. When you reach the bottom, press through both hands to return to the top position.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;h2 class="o-slide-title" data-num="13"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Deadlifts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deadlifts are one of the most powerful lifts you can perform. They train the quads, glutes, hamstrings, and back muscles. You can lift very heavy weights with a deadlift, allowing major muscle-building stimulus to your entire lower body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To perform a barbell deadlift, begin with a barbell on the floor with the appropriate amount of weight on each side. Step up to the bar until it's just away from your shins. Hinge at the waist, and grip the bar with an overhand or alternating grip. Keeping a braced, neutral spine, drive through the floor, and lift the bar until your knees and hips are locked out.

&lt;p&gt;The bench press is one of the most popular exercises, and for good reason. It allows you to lift major weights with your chest muscles, shoulders, and arms, providing a major mass building to these areas. I personally prefer dumbbell bench presses as they allow a smoother, more natural range of motion. That being said, you can do them with a barbell as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To perform dumbbell bench presses, begin seated at the foot of a weight bench with a dumbbell in each hand. Lie back on the bench, and position the dumbbells on each side of your chest with your arms bent at the elbow. Press upward until your arms lock out straight up. You can bring the dumbbells together at the top of the motion for the maximal muscle squeeze. Return to the starting position. Aim to perform three to four sets of eight to 12 reps.&lt;/p&gt;

The response would also require a lot of people to conduct contact tracing and, if Ebola is the culprit, could involve vaccinating infected people’s close contacts. Additionally, because these viruses spread from person to person, there would be a greater chance the infection could spread outside the region where it starts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The hemorrhagic fever scenario would be more concerning. Between 2014 and 2016, Ebola killed &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://libguides.mskcc.org/publichealth/VHF" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u class=" "&gt;11,000&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; people across Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone in the largest outbreak of that infection on record; another large outbreak in the DRC led to nearly 2,300 deaths between 2018 and 2020. &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/ebola-and-marburg-haemorrhagic-fevers-outbreaks-and-case-locations#full-publication-update-history" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u class=" "&gt;Multiple smaller outbreaks&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of related viruses sporadically erupt across the continent, including two active outbreaks in Tanzania and Uganda, the latter of which recently claimed the life of a &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/28/health/ebola-elon-musk-doge.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u class=" "&gt;four-year-old boy&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Still, the toolkit for responding to these outbreaks has come a long way: new vaccines – which may soon include &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gp4kqer46o" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u class=" "&gt;one being trialed&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in Uganda – have &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/ebola/ebola-vaccine-cut-deaths-half-during-drc-outbreak-study-shows" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u class=" "&gt;dramatically reduced&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the risk of death due to Ebola infection.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;(&lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/high-cases-flu-season" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;b class="cXscX "&gt;This is the worst flu season in 15 years. Here's why—and how to protect yourself.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Gathering information about what people ate, drank, and did before getting sick is a good way to generate ideas for what’s causing any outbreak – and that effort is under way in the DRC. The first people involved in the outbreak had reportedly eaten meat from wild bats, which has raised some concern that a hemorrhagic fever virus, &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.science.org/content/article/bat-species-may-be-source-ebola-epidemic-killed-more-11000-people-west-africa" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u class=" "&gt;endemic&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in some of these creatures could be the cause of the outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;More definitive information comes from testing samples from affected patients, along with samples from their food, water, and environment. Although it’s unclear yet whether spillover caused the current outbreak, moments like this are reminders to Vora that the human threat to ecosystem health ultimately circles back to hurt us. Deforestation and conflict create more opportunities for people to interact with stressed, sickened animals, increasing the risk we’ll share their diseases.  “We live in an interconnected world,” says Vora. “The health of humans depends on the health of animals – and also, nature.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>National

class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Measles is one of the most infectious diseases in the world. Infections kill one to three people for every 1,000 infected and can cause severe brain swelling, called encephalitis, in one in 1,000 cases. The disease also causes general misery, including a characteristic top-down rash, fever, runny nose, and red and watery eyes. The measles vaccine is &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/mmr/public/index.html#:~:text=Two%20doses%20of%20MMR%20vaccine%20are%2097%25%20effective%20against%20measles,are%20eliminated%20from%20the%20body." data-link-name="in body link"&gt;97% effective&lt;/a&gt; at preventing the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;At least 146 people have been sickened in &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/texas" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt;, primarily in unvaccinated communities in the South Plains region. More than 20 people have been hospitalized, and an unvaccinated school-aged child died – the first American measles death since April 2015.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Kennedy’s initially muted response to the outbreak has drawn intense criticism. Kennedy erroneously said in a &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/measles/kennedy-minimizes-measles-outbreak-wake-texas-death" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;cabinet meeting&lt;/a&gt; that the outbreak killed two people in Texas, and then, “it’s not unusual” to have outbreaks. In fact, measles sickened 285 people in the entirety of 2024. The Texas outbreak alone accounts for nearly half of last year’s total relatively early in the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Over the weekend, Kennedy then penned an opinion piece in &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/robert-f-kennedy-jr-measles-outbreak-call-action-all-us" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Fox News&lt;/a&gt; in which he argued vaccination was a “personal choice”, said vitamin A could “dramatically reduce measles mortality” and stopped short of explicitly recommending measles vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“Good nutrition remains a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nutrition/features/micronutrient-facts.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;best defense&lt;/a&gt; against most chronic and infectious illnesses,” Kennedy wrote. “Vitamins A, C, and D, and foods rich in vitamins B12, C, and E should be part of a balanced diet.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Although studies have shown that vitamin A could be an effective supportive therapy for children already infected with measles, &lt;a href="https://methods.cochrane.org/equity/vitamin-measles#:~:text=While%20no%20adverse%20events%20were,same%20benefit%20from%20vitamin%20A." data-link-name="in body link"&gt;most research&lt;/a&gt; has been conducted in low- and middle-income countries, particularly in Africa, where measles death rates and malnutrition are more common.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“It could lead to the impression of a false equivalency,” Dr Peter Hotez, the dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine and the co-director of Texas Children’s Hospital Center for Vaccine Development, told the Post. “To make the best decision for your children, you can either vaccinate or give vitamin A … That would be highly misleading.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Kennedy’s actions also sparked outrage from Elizabeth Warren, the Democratic Massachusetts senator who demanded Kennedy clarify his “intentions” for US vaccine policy in a Monday letter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class=" dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-12" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;skip past newsletter promotion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;aside aria-label="newsletter promotion" class="dcr-av5vqf"&gt;&lt;div class="dcr-10et71f"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-rsfwa"&gt;Sign up to &lt;span&gt;This Week in Trumpland&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-1xjndtj"&gt;A deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SecureSignup" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"newsletterId":"the-stakes-us-election-edition","successDescription":"A deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1eusqlu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy Notice: &lt;/strong&gt;Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

All the cases were at University Park, the main campus at the university which has about 42,000 students.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It isn't clear whether the patients are staff or students, but university officials say they have found the 'origin' of the outbreak and are now reaching out to close contacts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Students who were in the Mifflin Hall between February 17 and 24 and the Thomas building on February 20 between 1 and 3pm are being warned they may have been exposed to the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Officials say the risk of infection is 'low', but that students should check their vaccination status and isolate and contact health services if they have symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Chickenpox is mild for most, but can be deadly for unvaccinated adults who are immunocompromised or pregnant. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It comes amid mounting outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases in the US, with &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/texas/index.html" id="mol-4a418ad0-f91a-11ef-a89f-159a71514c7a"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt; recording&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14447249/us-states-red-alert-measles-outbreak-kills-infects.html"&gt; the nation's first death from measles in a decade&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Three cases of chickenpox have been detected on Penn State's University Park campus. Shown above is Old Main, the main administrative building at the university&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is not the first time the university has issued an alert over chickenpox, after a possible exposure ahead of a dance marathon was reported in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Chickenpox is a highly contagious diseases that typically triggers an itchy rash with red spots and fluid-filled blisters on the chest, back and face.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is caused by the varicella virus, and primarily affects children but can occur at any age — and is more likely to be deadly among adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The disease spreads via touching a rash or breathing in droplets expelled in the coughs and sneezes of patients that contain the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About 1.5 out of every 100,000 child patients die from the disease, compared to about 30 out of every 100,000 adults who contract the infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In serious cases, chickenpox can cause infected blisters, pneumonia, bleeding disorders and brain swelling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The disease can be prevented with two doses of the varicella vaccine, brand name Varivax, which is at least 97 percent effective against the chickenpox virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors say otherwise healthy children who are infected may not need treatment, but in adults and those at high risk of complications doctors may prescribe antiviral medications to reduce symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In its release, a spokesperson for Penn State said: 'The risk of infection is low for individuals who have received both doses of the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Breakthrough cases [cases in vaccinated patients] tend to present with milder symptoms, including fewer blisters and little or no fever. Those who have previously had chickenpox are generally immune and reinfection is extremely rare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Symptoms of chickenpox pictured in a male patient (stock)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above shows nationwide vaccination rates for chickenpox in the US&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'[But] given the approaching University spring break, individuals should be especially mindful of potential exposure and symptoms.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The US started to vaccinate against chickenpox in 1995, becoming the first country in the world to do so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Children were offered two doses of the vaccine, which uses a live and weakened form of the chickenpox virus, at 12 to 15 months and four to six years of age.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Uptake nationwide surged to 97 percent of all children entering kindergarten having received at least one dose of the vaccine in 2016 to 2017, but it has declined since — with 93.7 percent of children entering kindergarten now having received at least one dose in 2023 to 2024, the latest year.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In Pennsylvania, state data shows that 93.2 percent of children entering kindergarten had received both doses of the chickenpox vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other countries including the UK now also recommend the vaccine, with the British green-lighting the shot in November 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The UK had previously avoided recommending the vaccine, warning that this may raise the risk of some people catching the disease in adulthood — when it is more likely to cause a serious illness. But it has since shifted this view, noting that the vaccine reduces the number of cases and hospitalizations with the illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Before the vaccination program, about 4million cases, 13,500 hospitalizations and 100 to 150 deaths from chickenpox were reported in the US every year, says the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now, the agency estimates there are fewer than 150,000 cases, 1,400 hospitalizations and 30 deaths recorded annually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Commenting on the success of the program in 2022, CDC epidemiologist Mona Marin said: 'For chickenpox to go from being an inevitability of childhood to being rarely seen in just one generation is truly remarkable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The significance of the vaccine program — in lives saved, in sickness and hospitalizations avoided and in prevention of disruption to schools and family life — cannot be overstated.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

 &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Canadian researchers said switching from bottled to filtered tap water alone could slash their intake by 90 per cent — from roughly 90,000 to 4,000 particles each year&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Brandon Luu, a resident physician in internal medicine at the University of Toronto and report co-author said today: 'Bottled water alone can expose people to nearly as many microplastic particles annually as all ingested and inhaled sources combined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Switching to tap water could reduce this exposure by almost 90 per cent, making it one of the simplest ways to cut down on microplastic intake.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The report, published in the journal &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://genomicpress.kglmeridian.com/view/journals/brainmed/aop/article-10.61373-bm025c.0020/article-10.61373-bm025c.0020.xml"&gt;Brain Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, also said other 'significant' sources of microplastic intake included using plastic tea bags and how food is heated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Heating food in plastic containers — especially in the microwave — can release substantial amounts of microplastics and nanoplastics,' Dr Luu added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Avoiding plastic food storage and using glass or stainless steel alternatives is a small but meaningful step in limiting exposure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'While these changes make sense, we still need research to confirm whether lowering intake leads to reduced accumulation in human tissues.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The earlier study, published last month in Nature Medicine, saw US scientists analyse the brain tissue of 52 people who died in 2016 and 2024. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They found the levels of microplastic found in people's brains was in 2024 was about 50 per cent higher than in those who died in 2016, suggesting the concentration in our bodies is rising as the environment becomes more polluted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Experts say you can cut your exposure to microplastics by swapping out plastics in your home for natural materials, metal and glass&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The &lt;span&gt;University of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a target="_self" href="/news/new-mexico/index.html" id="mol-cc2a2ae0-e23e-11ef-81c2-1faa0029a1c4" class=""&gt;New Mexico&lt;/a&gt; researchers also found higher amounts of tiny plastic particles in the brains of dementia patients who had died compared to those without the condition, suggesting a potential link. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, they noted that this didn't show that plastics harmed brain health. Instead, it merely hinted at a correlation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Nicholas Fabiano, an expert in psychiatry at the University of Ottawa and lead author of the Brain Health commentary, said:&lt;span&gt; 'The dramatic increase in brain microplastic concentrations over just eight years, from 2016 to 2024, is particularly alarming.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This rise mirrors the exponential increase we're seeing in environmental microplastic levels.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;To get into the brain, plastics have to cross the blood-brain barrier — a layer of cells surrounding the brain which acts as a filter to prevent the entry of harmful substances.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Microplastics have worried scientists for decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While the long-term effects of microplastics on human health remain unclear concern is rising&lt;span&gt;  because avoiding them is almost impossible.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A recent study even found using a single tea bag could release &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/sciencetech/article-14229649/Scientists-issue-urgent-warning-drinking-TEA-billions-dangerous-microplastics.html"&gt;billions of dangerous microplastics into the body&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Microplastics have been found in variety of other human tissue including the intestines and even &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/sciencetech/article-13493443/scientists-microplastics-male-semen.html"&gt;in men's sperm&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr. Luu also recommended that the public avoid using plastic containers while heating up food in a microwave. The cooking process can release 'substantial amounts' of plastics which contaminate your meal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Using glass and steel containers for food storage instead of plastic can also limit your exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the Mayo Clinic, dementia is the umbrella term for a group of symptoms which affects memory, thinking, and social behavior. Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Memory loss is the most known symptom, but there are many others which can develop slowly over the course of several years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These include problems finding words and communicating with others, visual and spatial abilities like easily getting lost, confusion, and losing coordination of your movements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There can also be a behavioral change, with dementia patients often experiencing depression, agitation, or unexplained outbursts of anger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The World Health Organization estimates that over 55 million people have dementia, with a half-million Americans expected to be diagnosed this year alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To this point, treatment has focused on maintaining a healthy lifestyle into old age, and the new study has added another step in that process - avoid plastics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Maybe it’s measles.’ Don’t do that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Anti-vaccine influencers and organizations have rallied around vitamin A as protection against and treatment for measles for years. &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/rfk-jr-samoa-measles-vaccine-crisis-rcna187787" target="_blank"&gt;During outbreaks&lt;/a&gt;, anti-vaccine groups have organized drives to fundraise and send vitamin A to affected communities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Adalja of Johns Hopkins said Kennedy’s references to vitamin A only serve to discourage the MMR vaccine among his followers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“When RFK Jr. is talking about vitamin A, people are going to say, oh, that’s his code word that we should be doing that, not the MMR vaccine,” Adalja said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Tue, 04 Mar 2025 16:11:24 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqAFBVV95cUxOU0Q4X1FnMklXZHJJLThlaERWSEFkWjctNENYVWRVaGZOcUtZOFFudEtPbW5UQjJNNmFkWkM5eUJGaTJQYW1yU2cyZm5YWjFkb3ZWUUI1Zk8zVjNEbHpQM3NBMnJEUVBBamZ0T0c4eS1UcXVEbElzNElIRXZnSjdfNlJwd2N5UzZZVTE5a3paUlE5QWFOMUw0WjdRSHIwRENtWGJfdTI2dm7SAVZBVV95cUxPZFI4M2s5cTV0c19QSHdCblNRRnJhYk41a25ISWpYeXU0UGhOWGhXZ0Fwd0t2ZDhoRlo2Nml1OEM3MmRlTk8zcnZTV0dQTkNqdDhzMmNHQQ</guid></item><item><title>Longer breastfeeding linked to blood-pressure lowering effects of certain infant gut bacteria - National Institutes of Health</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMizgFBVV95cUxPQ21BQlh4aXVReUNLMTZib1ZoNXhpdUluQmZkT2tIeGRCb1M4MU1NYUJ1Q0ZtU0pvdUxucDFLOVhQZGhURFp1aWxUeHU5d2paNUloY2Z3YXJ0bU5ua0RxcFhSZEV2dXoxNUE4QTU5ZmpPUDA5T0d2SWYyZ1hOc0dZdmVvZ2VVelB0YUR0Q2lSdjJSTjZ0OUxBUjQ3YlVtd3NHOGJOV2JWdllMYk1uTml2S2VpYWdHMEJ0QVFlQzJMTGZGVUIwVnQxcWNFMk9pQQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div about="/news-events/news-releases/longer-breastfeeding-linked-blood-pressure-lowering-effects-certain-infant-gut-bacteria" typeof="sioc:Item foaf:Document" class="ds-1col node node--nih-news-release media-advisory  view-mode-full node--full node--nih-news-release--full clearfix"&gt;

Nursing for at least six months may spur beneficial gut bacteria connected to better heart health years later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An observational study supported by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) found that infants who had more diverse bacteria in their gut had lower childhood blood pressure, and this protective association was stronger if they were breastfed for at least six months. The findings published in the &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/JAHA.124.037447"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Journal of the American Heart Association&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the research, investigators reviewed data from 526 children enrolled in a prospective study in Denmark. They looked for connections between infant gut bacteria, which can be influenced by nutrition and supports a variety of &lt;a href="https://www.niehs.nih.gov/health/topics/science/microbiome"&gt;health functions&lt;/a&gt;, and childhood blood pressure. To assess this, they collected fecal samples to analyze bacteria in the infants’ intestines during their first week, month, and year of life. Three and six years later, they measured the children’s blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The researchers found children with more diverse gut bacteria at one month had lower blood pressure six years later. They then assessed the influence of breastfeeding, which was measured in this study for durations of at least six months. They discovered that among children breastfed for at least six months, the blood-pressure lowering effect of having more diverse bacteria in their gut was even stronger. Specifically, those with a greater diversity of gut bacteria throughout the first month of life had systolic blood pressure that was about 2 mm Hg lower six years later if they were breastfed for at least six months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Researchers believe there may be several reasons for these associations. Certain gut bacteria have evolved specialized biologic machinery that allows them to convert otherwise indigestible carbohydrates in breast milk into calories and substances that can be used by the body. Specific &lt;em&gt;Bifidobacterium &lt;/em&gt;species, including &lt;em&gt;B. infantis&lt;/em&gt;, are superstars when it comes to breaking down these carbohydrates and turning them into short-chain fatty acids that may influence blood pressure and support cardiovascular health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In infants who are not breastfed, bacteria that do not have breast milk carbohydrates to feed on may instead break down carbohydrates that line the intestines. This could result in a condition called a “leaky gut,” where bacteria and fat could enter the bloodstream. A leaky gut has been linked to inflammation and increased blood pressure in adults.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the researchers found that some types of bacteria, including &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/007715.htm"&gt;H. pylori&lt;/a&gt;, were present in some infants and these bacteria were linked to increased blood pressure years later. H. pylori, which can be passed from a mother to child, can create persistent levels of low inflammation and may influence a “leaky gut.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make participants in the study as comparable as possible, the researchers accounted for a mother’s medical history, their diet during pregnancy, pregnancy complications, when and how a child was born, and how long they were breastfed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About 4% to 7% of children worldwide have high blood pressure, which can start when the fetus develops in the womb. These rates have doubled since 2020, which is why researchers are studying factors that may offset these risks and improve cardiovascular health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study was supported by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) grant &lt;a href="https://reporter.nih.gov/search/6ru5spxg_Eyk3QPBUZVr2A/projects"&gt;K01HL141589&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

But although swearing is a near-universal feature of language, it is still considered taboo by many.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Olly Robertson is not one of them. “It’s something that we all share, and it is really magical. It holds so much power over us as societies,” said Robertson, a psychology researcher at the University of Oxford. “It does something for us.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://subscribe.washingtonpost.com/newsletters/#/bundle/postmost?method=SURL&amp;amp;location=YAHOO&amp;amp;initiative=feed" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Subscribe to The Post Most newsletter for the most important and interesting stories from The Washington Post.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Subscribe to The Post Most newsletter for the most important and interesting stories from The Washington Post. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;One of those things is an increase in pain tolerance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Swearing is “a drug-free, calorie-neutral, cost-free means of self-help,” said Richard Stephens, a researcher and senior lecturer in psychology at Keele University in England.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Researchers are working to understand the mechanisms underlying swearing’s impact in a number of circumstances, with a major focus on pain. With that knowledge, Stephens said, swearing can more effectively be used in a clinical setting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;- - -&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Pain reduction through swearing&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In 2009, Stephens and his colleagues published the first study linking swearing with hypoalgesia - a reduced sensitivity to pain. Subjects were asked to participate in a cold pressor task, in which they held their hands in ice water for as long as possible while repeating either a swear word of their choosing or a non-swear word. Swearing was associated with not only increased pain tolerance but also decreased perceived pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Studies followed showing similar, yet sometimes varied, effects. In 2020, for instance, Stephens and Robertson investigated the use of the swear “f---” compared with a neutral word and two made-up swear words - “fouch” and “twizpipe” - and found that swearing was linked with increased pain tolerance but had no significant effect on pain perception.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;That association between swearing and increased pain tolerance is not specific to the English language. In 2017, Robertson and Stephens published a study investigating the cross-cultural effect of swearing on pain, comparing Japanese and English speakers. In Japan, Robertson said, swearing is not socially ingrained the way it is in Britain, so she doubted that it would have the same effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;While doing the cold presser task, native English speakers repeated either the swear “f---” or a control word - “cup” - and native Japanese speakers repeated a Japanese word that means s--- or a control word “kappu,” meaning cup. Regardless of language, swearing was linked with greater pain tolerance. “Which I wasn’t expecting at all, because I was expecting to see that social effect,” Robertson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;- - -&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Swearing has benefits beyond physical pain&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In addition to pain tolerance, swearing has been linked to bolstered social bonds, improved memory, and even an alleviation of the social pain of exclusion or rejection. “Neurologically, the pathways for physical pain and emotional pain are the same,” Robertson said. “So when you have heartbreak, it’s the same neural structures. It’s the same biological blueprint, and that’s why it feels so visceral, because it literally is.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;More recently, swearing has been shown to be linked with an increase in strength. Looking at the impact of swearing on strength was a logical progression, Stephens said, because he and others had shown that swearing while in pain often was associated with increased heart rate, similar to what happens during a “fight or flight” stress response, where your body releases a surge of adrenaline and blood is diverted to your muscles to prepare for action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In 2018, Stephens and his colleagues found that, in an anaerobic power test on a bike, swearing was linked with an improvement in participant strength. However, they were unable to identify any physiological variable - including heart rate - that correlated with the finding. Stephens has since shifted his focus more to the psychological. “My research has been trying to understand what’s the psychological mechanism by which swearing brings about these effects, both for pain and for physical strength,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;But what exactly connects swearing with greater strength and pain tolerance remains a mystery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Over the past few years, Stephens has focused on state disinhibition theory: “the idea that, by swearing, we just get ourselves in a place where we’re more disinhibited, and in a disinhibited state, we push ourselves further, go for it a little bit more,” he said. “So we’ll put up with the ice-cold water for a few more seconds, or [in a strength task] we’ll squeeze on the hand gripper with a little more force.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;- - -&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The optimal swearing dosage&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Up until this point, testing the link between swearing and pain has been done in a controlled, laboratory setting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Nick Washmuth, professor of physical therapy at Samford University in Alabama, is focused on the potential for swearing to be used in a clinical context, which means understanding not only the mechanisms by which swearing affects pain but also how a person’s environment, age, how much they already swear in their everyday lives, the intensity of the swear word and other variables could influence the effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“We need to better understand those factors and how they play a role to be able to prescribe swearing in a medical sense, in a clinical sense,” Washmuth said. “Is there an optimal dosage for swearing?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;For those who would like to use swearing to help with pain or increase strength, Washmuth suggested starting by selecting a swear word that feels powerful, that you would naturally use if you stubbed your toe, for instance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“If no word comes to mind, the f-word is the most commonly self-selected swear word by participants in these studies and is considered one of the most powerful swear words out there,” he said. “Swear at a steady pace once a second to once every three seconds, at a normal speech volume.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;But if audible swearing is not your thing, do not despair. Washmuth is now studying whether internal swearing could do the trick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Swearing out loud is frowned upon in many public places, right? So we’re trying to determine if you can swear using your inner monologue to get the same effect,” Washmuth said. “Can you swear in your head to decrease pain or improve strength?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Related Content&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/03/04/australia-chinese-electric-vehicles-byd/?utm_source=yahoo&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=nss_yahoo" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Australia, with no auto industry to protect, is awash with Chinese EVs;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Australia, with no auto industry to protect, is awash with Chinese EVs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/03/04/panama-canal-trump-china/?utm_source=yahoo&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=nss_yahoo" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:After Trump threats, Hong Kong firm to sell stake in Panama Canal ports;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;After Trump threats, Hong Kong firm to sell stake in Panama Canal ports &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2025/02/28/federal-workers-oklahoma-city-bombing/?utm_source=yahoo&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=nss_yahoo" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Federal workers haunted by Oklahoma City bombing fear Trump’s barbs;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Federal workers haunted by Oklahoma City bombing fear Trump’s barbs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo Life</author><pubDate>Tue, 04 Mar 2025 15:58:24 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikAFBVV95cUxQTkxTVlRmWVhKckJlRG9ZbWFXdXZKeUR3VXdJMXdlR1hPM01fWm1DTUVjcU1taVlEVEItdVZUQkp6TDRZXy1TeFhmNU5VMnpRbjNWejdJVExyNkVrMEFkUDlKc1JuT1pJeVlyUU9KY3diQTBNWjY3M3Z0UFJPaTVTUFZ2U2MteHJXTFFYakhEZU4</guid></item><item><title>Study Illuminates the Genetic Architecture of Bipolar Disorder - National Institute of Mental Health</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiswFBVV95cUxOeXBldi1oX1Q3MW1Gc05sSHZtUllpVG15eTdLcV9ySVF2Qmw5U09NcTJ5c1NBcHNRT0l1azhEeE9DZXJlNmp3ZHpEWUxBT1dyOTZfWlZkMWtjNVJYdk8zTGFzWWtLaUR5blBFNHpLUnR4Y3h2aE5zX05FQzlhTlQyNWxSX2wwR2R4cjRUMEQxQTVyaGRCdE1yRHJfQnRzUnJUV09kYWtIekE3clE3ZkJ4QnBOWQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article id="main_content_inner"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bipolar disorder involves fluctuating periods of manic episodes (marked by extremely “up” or irritable moods) and depressive episodes (marked by very “down” moods or lack of pleasure). Although effective treatments are available, symptoms often return over time, and maintaining long-term treatment can be challenging. Evidence suggests a person’s risk for developing bipolar disorder is influenced by many genes, but open questions remain about the full range of genes involved and whether they differ for specific subtypes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What did the researchers do in the study?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The largest genome-wide study of people with &lt;a href="/health/topics/bipolar-disorder" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="671a97d2-3609-4116-bd60-d2299e9333c4" data-entity-substitution="canonical"&gt;bipolar disorder&lt;/a&gt; sheds new light on the genetic architecture and biological mechanisms involved in this common and often disabling mental illness. The findings from the study, funded by the National Institute of Health, may pave the way for more targeted and personalized treatments that could improve the lives of people with bipolar disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The worldwide collaborative study was led by researchers in the Bipolar Disorder Working Group of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium. The study included 158,036 people living with bipolar disorder and 2,796,499 people without the disorder across 79 clinical, community, and self-report cohorts—making it the largest such study to date. The participants were of European, East Asian, African American, and Latino ancestries, in contrast to previous studies conducted almost exclusively with people of European ancestry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What did the results show?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results revealed an over four-fold increase in the number of genes associated with bipolar disorder, identifying nearly 300 gene locations and 36 unique genes most likely to be linked to the disorder. Many of these genes overlapped with those previously implicated in the risk for other mental disorders such as schizophrenia and depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also identified differences in the genetic architecture across bipolar disorder subtypes. The findings suggest that genetics play a key role across a broad spectrum of conditions that fall under the umbrella of bipolar disorder. These range from less common but more severe conditions that lead people to seek psychiatric care to conditions that are less disabling but more common.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next big challenge for the field is to understand why bipolar disorder varies so much from person to person and the degree to which genetic factors can explain individual variation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Reference&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;O’Connell, K.

The study found that nearly 14% of adults between the ages of 18 and 64 reported a past diagnosis, a figure substantially higher than estimates from just over a decade ago. Researchers also uncovered notable differences in diagnosis rates across various demographic groups, including sex, age, race, education level, and where people live.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For years, researchers have suspected that the number of adults diagnosed with ADHD has been climbing. However, solid data on this trend has been lacking. While studies have examined ADHD prevalence in adults using older data or data from other countries, up-to-date, nationally representative information for working-age adults in the U.S. has been scarce. It’s important to focus on this age group because ADHD can significantly affect many aspects of their lives, such as job performance, financial stability, relationships, overall health, and even risky behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To address this knowledge gap, researchers turned to a newly available resource: the 2023 National Wellbeing Survey. This survey offered a unique opportunity to get a current snapshot of self-reported ADHD diagnoses in this population. Around the time this study was being prepared for publication, another research group released similar estimates using a different data source. This led the researchers to compare their findings with these new estimates to provide a more complete picture of the current situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There were several reasons to believe that the percentage of working-age adults who have been diagnosed with ADHD by a health care provider has increased over time. However, there is limited population-representative data to test that idea,” said study author Andrew S. London, associate dean for Maxwell Programs in DC and professor of sociology at Syracuse University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“At the time we began this paper, we believed &lt;a href="https://www.maxwell.syr.edu/research/lerner-center/health-research/national-wellbeing-survey" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;the National Wellbeing Survey&lt;/a&gt; was the only recent national data set that would allow such estimates to be made. While the paper was in review, another set of estimates became available. Hence, at the Editor’s and Reviewers’ suggestion, we spent considerable time in this paper talking about similarities and differences in the estimates obtained from the two studies. This research fills a major gap in the literature.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 2023 National Wellbeing Survey included responses from 7,053 working-age adults across the United States. This survey is conducted online annually and aims to represent the non-institutionalized adult population between 18 and 64 years old who can read English. Participants are recruited from online panels managed by a company called Qualtrics Panels. For the 2023 survey, a large number of panel members were contacted, and nearly 15,000 completed the survey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To ensure the quality of the data, responses were checked for issues like rushing through the survey or giving the same answer repeatedly, and some responses were removed from the final dataset due to quality concerns. While online surveys often have lower response rates than traditional mail or phone surveys, the response rate for this survey was comparable to other national online surveys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the survey, participants were asked if a healthcare professional had ever told them they had any of a list of medical conditions, including “ADHD or Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD).” The researchers then analyzed the percentage of people who answered “yes” to this question. They looked at the overall percentage and also broke it down by different demographic characteristics such as sex (male or female), age group (18-29, 30-39, 40-49, and 50-64 years), race and ethnicity (White, Black/African American, Hispanic, Asian/Pacific Islander, and other/multiple race), whether they were born in the U.S. or not, education level (less than high school, high school graduate, some college, bachelor’s degree or higher), and urban or rural residence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To ensure the survey results accurately reflected the U.S. working-age population, the researchers used statistical weights. These weights adjusted the sample to match the known demographics of this population in terms of sex, age, race, education, and urban/rural location.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the researchers noticed that the survey sample initially appeared less healthy than what is typically seen in national health surveys. Because health status can be related to ADHD, they made an additional adjustment to the weights to ensure the sample’s health profile was more in line with national averages, specifically matching the self-rated health distribution from the 2023 National Health Interview Survey. They then calculated the percentages of self-reported ADHD diagnoses using both the original weights and these adjusted weights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study’s primary finding was that 13.9% of working-age adults in the U.S. reported having ever received an ADHD diagnosis from a healthcare professional. This number is considerably higher than a 2012 estimate of 4.25% for a similar population and also higher than a recent estimate of 7.8% for all adults aged 18 and older in 2023 from the other study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was somewhat surprising that the levels were as high as they were,” London told PsyPost. “That said, they seem consistent with rates of diagnosis in childhood plus the growth in new adult diagnoses. Thus, they seem plausible. The increase over time may reflect changes in diagnostic criteria for children and adults, greater acceptance of adult diagnosis, over- and mis-diagnosis, and methodological issues.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that diagnosis rates varied across all the demographic factors they examined. Women were more likely to report a diagnosis than men, although the difference was relatively small. Younger adults had much higher rates of diagnosis compared to older adults, with the highest rates in the 18-29 age group and the lowest in the 50-64 group. Non-Hispanic White adults had higher rates than other racial and ethnic groups. U.S.-born adults reported diagnoses more frequently than those born outside the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Individuals with less education were more likely to report an ADHD diagnosis than those with higher education levels. Finally, people living in mid-sized metropolitan areas (with populations between 250,000 and 1 million) had the highest rates, compared to those in the largest metropolitan areas (over 1 million population).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To put their findings in perspective, the researchers also analyzed data from the 2023 National Center for Health Statistics Rapid Surveys System, the same data source used in the other recent study. Using this dataset and focusing on working-age adults, they estimated a slightly lower prevalence of 9.6%. While this is still a substantial figure and higher than previous estimates, it is lower than the 13.9% found in the National Wellbeing Survey. The researchers point out that the difference might be due to variations in the specific online panels used for each survey, subtle differences in survey methods, and how quality control was handled in each study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers acknowledge that their study has some limitations. The National Wellbeing Survey, even with adjustments, may not perfectly represent the overall health of the U.S. population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The sample was drawn from an online panel and weighted to make it demographically representative of the population,” London noted. “We also adjusted the weight to enhance sample generalizability. There are better methodologies—gold-standard methodologies—for drawing probability samples of populations. Such samples are better for generalizing results to the population level.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While we have confidence in our estimates, we would like to see surveys that use the gold-standard sampling approach collect data on lifetime and current ADHD, as well as symptoms. This would allow for potentially more-precise estimates, validation of our estimates, and research on factors that are associated with ADHD. We are doing some of the work on factors association with ADHD now with the National Wellbeing Survey.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite these limitations, this study offers valuable, up-to-date estimates of self-reported ADHD diagnoses among working-age adults in the U.S. These findings highlight a potential increase in diagnoses and significant demographic variations. The researchers hope their work will encourage further research to confirm these trends and better understand the reasons behind them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We would like to contribute current research on adult ADHD and its consequences across a range of life-course domains—health, substance use, marriage/family outcomes, etc,” London said. “The National Wellbeing Survey allows for that in a way that no other national, population-representative survey does. We hope this research will raise awareness, stimulate more data collection, and encourage others to do research in this area.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/10870547251319861" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Self-Reported ADHD Diagnosis Status Among Working-Age Adults in the United States: Evidence From the 2023 National Wellbeing Survey&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Andrew S.

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;During National Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month, the First Lady and I offer our heartfelt prayers to every American battling the horrific disease of colorectal cancer, as well as their families, friends, and loved ones.  In honor of those we have lost to this colorectal cancer, my Administration is strongly committed to ending our Nation’s chronic disease epidemic and making America healthy again.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Every year, 150,000 Americans are diagnosed with—and 50,000 die from—colorectal cancer making it the leading cause of cancer death among Americans aged 18 to 49.  Citizens with inflammatory bowel disease or a personal or family history of the disease face a heightened risk and should talk to their doctor about new advancements in cancer screening.  Regular screening is recommended beginning at age 45 as it has been shown that early detection of cancer may result in more effective treatment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cancer is a devastating disease, but there is reason for hope.  Since 1975, medical advancements have saved an estimated 940,000 Americans from colorectal cancer thanks to the incredible efforts of our exceptional American doctors and researchers.  By improving prevention and screening processes we have given our people more precious moments with those they hold dear. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The United States is at the forefront of medical technology—and recently, the Food and Drug Administration approved the first blood test for people at average risk for colon cancer.  This advancement is another tool in the toolbox, including the colonoscopy and stool DNA tests—giving citizens the ability to choose the option that works best for them in consultation with their doctor.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;My Administration commits to lowering cancer rates and conquering chronic illness, which will create a Nation and a world free of cancer.  We solemnly stand beside those who have lost their loved ones to this dreadful disease—and we pray that God provides courage and strength to those still fighting it, and to all those who are touched by its effects.  As my Administration continues to push the boundaries of medical innovation, we pledge to build a brighter, healthier future for all Americans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two cases of measles have been confirmed in New York City as of the end of February, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.health.ny.gov/press/releases/2025/2025-02-27_measles.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;New York City Health Department&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Officials didn’t disclose the ages or vaccination status of the two cases, but they are &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuXleWGn7kE" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;urging parents&lt;/a&gt; to vaccinate their children.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The news comes as &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/03/02/us-news/measles-alert-issued-in-new-jersey-county-following-three-confirmed-cases/"&gt;New Jersey has issued a measles alert&lt;/a&gt; in response to three confirmed cases in Bergen County.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;New York City has confirmed two measles cases as of the end of February. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to NYC’s health department, the two cases are unrelated, with one occurring earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“For each case, our agency conducts routine case and contact investigation and we ensure proper follow-ups for exposed persons.” acting commissioner of the NYC Health Department Dr. Michelle Morse told &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2025/03/03/measles-new-york-city/81204974007/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;USA Today&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Measles is highly contagious and can be deadly.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The city had 14 cases in 2024, making up nearly all of New York State’s 15 total cases. The rest of New York State has no confirmed cases yet this year.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;Measles were declared officially eliminated in the US in 2000, but cases have been on the rise in recent years. According to the CDC, there have been 164 cases across the US as of Feb. 27, spreading across Alaska, California, Georgia, Kentucky, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York City, Rhode Island and Texas. Twenty percent of those cases have resulted in hospitalization.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Texas has had the biggest outbreak with 146 cases, and last week reported the country’s &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/02/28/us-news/texas-measles-cases-rise-to-146-in-an-outbreak-that-led-to-a-childs-death/"&gt;first measles death&lt;/a&gt; since 2015.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Measles, also called rubeola, shows no symptoms for the first 10 to 14 days after infection. Those who are infected then typically experience cough, sore throat, runny nose, pink eye, white spots inside the mouth, a blotchy skin rash and fever, which can rise as high as 104 to 105.8 F.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Public health officials are urging people to vaccinate their children after the US recorded its first measles death since 2015. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;





&lt;p&gt;It’s also highly contagious — people with measles can spread it for several days before the rash even appears. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to the New York City Health Department. if a person has measles, 90% of those around them who are not vaccinated or immune through previous infection will get it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Health officials have urged usage of the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine as individual protection against the virus and to promote herd immunity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“As a pediatrician and the State’s doctor, I want to remind everyone that immunization is safe and the best protection for your children against measles and other potentially deadly diseases,” State Health Commissioner Dr. James McDonald said in a PSA. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Measles is a very contagious, serious respiratory disease that causes rash and fever. In some cases, measles can reduce the immune system’s ability to fight other infections like pneumonia. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The city had 14 cases in 2024, making up nearly all of New York State’s 15 total cases.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;REUTERS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I encourage anyone not vaccinated against measles to receive at least one dose of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine and get their children vaccinated with two doses.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Morse added to &lt;a href="https://pix11.com/news/local-news/new-york-city-reports-measles-cases-raising-public-health-concern/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;PIX11&lt;/a&gt;: “If you get the vaccine, the risk for measles for you is incredibly small, it leads to 97% coverage.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While it’s very rare to get measles if you’re fully vaccinated, breakthrough infections do happen, with the CDC noting that they make up about 5% of total infections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are common in places where there in an outbreak, meaning there are more people with the virus, increasing potential exposure.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;On Sunday, Health and Human Services Secretary &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/02/18/us-news/rfk-jr-calls-for-new-age-of-radical-transparency-at-hhs-tells-critics-they-can-retire/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Robert F. Kennedy Jr.&lt;/a&gt; — who has been outspoken in his vaccine skepticism — promoted the measles jab &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/robert-f-kennedy-jr-measles-outbreak-call-action-all-us?title=op-ed%20for%20Fox%20News" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;in a Fox News Digital op-ed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Measles is a highly contagious respiratory illness with certain health risks, especially to unvaccinated individuals,” he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Prior to the introduction of the vaccine in the 1960s, virtually every child in the United States contracted measles,” he went on, pointing to a fatality rate of 1 in 1,205 cases from 1953 to 1962.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Vaccines not only protect individual children from measles, but also contribute to community immunity, protecting those who are unable to be vaccinated due to medical reasons,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

	New cases of the &lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/measles/" id="auto-tag_measles" data-tag="measles"&gt;measles&lt;/a&gt; have been reported in New York City and New Jersey as an &lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/rfk-jr-measles-outbreak-texas-vaccines-1235281134/"&gt;outbreak in Texas&lt;/a&gt; — which has already &lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/child-dies-measles-outbreak-west-texas-1235280838/"&gt;led to one child’s death&lt;/a&gt; — continues, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2025/03/03/measles-new-york-city/81204974007/"&gt;USA Today&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;reports.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	The New York Department of Health said two cases have been reported in NYC, though so far, none have cropped up in the rest of the state. Across the river in New Jersey, three cases have been reported, according to that state’s department of health. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	The first case in NYC was reported earlier this year, and the new one appears to be unrelated (there were 14 measles cases reported in the city in 2024). In a &lt;a href="https://www.health.ny.gov/press/releases/2025/2025-02-27_measles.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;, New York State Health Commissioner Dr. James McDonald said, “As a pediatrician and the State’s doctor, I want to remind everyone that immunization is safe and the best protection for your children against measles and other potentially deadly diseases.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	The NJ Department of Health &lt;a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.nj.gov/health/cd/topics/measles.shtml"&gt;issued&lt;/a&gt; a similar call for vaccinations, saying that all three cases of measles in the state have been found in people who are unvaccinated. 

	&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	Last week, a school-aged child died from measles in West Texas, marking the first reported measles death in the United States in a decade. The child, who died after being hospitalized the previous week, was not vaccinated, the Texas Department of State Health Services confirmed.

&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	The outbreak in West Texas has spread rapidly across nine counties, with 146 cases identified since late January. It’s the worst measles outbreak in Texas in more than 30 years. The majority of the cases have emerged from Mennonite communities, where many children are “undervaccinated,” a state health department spokesperson said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	Last week, Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. downplayed the severity of the outbreak, saying, “It’s not unusual to have measles outbreaks every year.” Kennedy, a &lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/rfk-jr-tried-kill-covid-vaccine-1235240065/"&gt;known vaccine&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/fda-cancels-flu-vaccine-meeting-rfk-jr-hhs-1235281638/"&gt;skeptic&lt;/a&gt;, has since published an &lt;a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/robert-f-kennedy-jr-measles-outbreak-call-action-all-us"&gt;op-ed&lt;/a&gt; telling parents to consider vaccines without suggesting or recommending them outright. &lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;p&gt;Many Americans remain unaware of the cancer risk for both men and women posed by human papillomavirus (HPV), a new Ohio State University poll has found.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most people don’t know much about &lt;a href="https://www.healthday.com/a-to-z-health/public-health/hpv-and-genital-warts-647278.html"&gt;HPV&lt;/a&gt; and its long-term cancer risks, and also have key misperceptions about how the virus is spread, the poll found.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, the majority of people are unaware that the virus is more common among men than women, and is associated with rising rates of cancers that directly impact men.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, people still see HPV as mostly associated with &lt;a href="https://www.healthday.com/a-to-z-health/women-health/cervical-cancer-2665820966.html"&gt;cervical cancer&lt;/a&gt; risk in women, and shrug off the importance of vaccination for men, results show.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This lack of awareness might explain why HPV vaccination rates have been slow to increase, researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We have a vaccine that has been shown to reduce the risk of HPV infection by up to 90%,” &lt;a href="https://cancer.osu.edu/find-a-researcher/search-researcher-directory/electra-d-paskett"&gt;Electra Paskett&lt;/a&gt;, a cancer control researcher with the Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, said in a news release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This is a powerful tool for cancer prevention that has only been available to us in the past few decades, and we are seeing the impact of those vaccines now through the scientific data,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The federal Healthy People 2030 goals call for at least 80% of teens to be vaccinated against HPV by the end of the decade, according to the &lt;a href="https://progressreport.cancer.gov/prevention/hpv_immunization"&gt;National Cancer Institute&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But only about 57% of boys and 61% of girls have gotten the HPV vaccine, the NCI says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the survey, Ohio State researchers asked people if they agree or disagree with basic statements about HPV. Responses showed an astonishing lack of knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, about 42% of people believe HPV is more common in women than in men, the poll found.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This is concerning because more men are infected with HPV than women and they could unknowingly spread it to their partners,” Paskett said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Likewise, nearly half of respondents (45%) didn’t know that HPV is linked to cancers other than cervical cancer in women.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, HPV does cause more than 9 out of every 10 cases of cervical cancer, but the virus also causes cancers of the penis, anus, head and neck among men, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hpv/about/cancers-caused-by-hpv.html"&gt;U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About 4 out of every 10 cases of cancer caused by HPV occur among men, the CDC says. Every year, more than 15,000 American men develop cancers caused by HPV.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There also have been rapidly rising rates of HPV-related tonsil and tongue base cancers, noted &lt;a href="https://cancer.osu.edu/find-a-doctor/search-physician-directory/matthew-o-old"&gt;Dr. Matthew Old&lt;/a&gt;, a head and neck surgeon with the Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These cancers could become one of the top three cancers among middle-aged U.S. men 45 to 65 by 2045, and the most common cancer in elderly men in the next 10 years, recent estimates suggest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the new survey, 40% of poll respondents believed that people with HPV have symptoms. In truth, HPV infections are largely silent for years, with symptoms developing only after the virus has caused cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It can take years or even decades for the genetic changes caused by HPV to take effect and transform into cancer,” Old said in a news release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CDC stats show that the vaccine has been effective in cutting down on HPV since its approval for girls in 2006 and subsequent approval for boys in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Infections with the HPV strains that cause most cancers have dropped 88% among teen girls and 81% among young adult women, the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hpv/vaccination-impact/index.html"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt; says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HPV is sexually transmitted, and once someone is infected there are no drugs that will rid them of the virus, experts said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The HPV vaccine, &lt;a href="https://www.drugs.com/gardasil.html"&gt;Gardasil 9&lt;/a&gt;, is recommended between ages 9 and 12 for maximum effectiveness, prior to potential exposure, Paskett said. However, she added that the vaccine also is now available to adults up to age 45.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Many who are unvaccinated unknowingly carry and spread high-risk strains of the virus,” Old said. “That’s why vaccination is so important.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

This unique form of art is not just an ancient tribal tradition but a popular contemporary mode of self-expression. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the potential health risks associated with the injected tattoo ink have largely been overlooked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists are now investigating the long-term effects of &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/tattoos-increase-the-risk-of-developing-lymphoma/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;tattoo&lt;/a&gt; ink within the body and whether it could contribute to health issues, including cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-tattoo-ink-s-journey-in-the-body"&gt;Tattoo ink’s journey in the body&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the tattoo artist punches the ink into the skin, your body identifies the pigments as foreign substances. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/tattoos-and-body-art-found-on-1200-year-old-peruvian-mummies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;ink&lt;/a&gt; stays in the skin, making the tattoo permanent, but some travels in the blood and collects in the lymph nodes, which help protect the body from illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts are concerned that tattoo ink in the lymph nodes might cause long-term swelling and possibly lead to cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-tattoo-ink-and-health-concerns"&gt;Tattoo ink and health concerns&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study from the University of Southern Denmark (&lt;a href="https://www.sdu.dk/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;SDU&lt;/a&gt;) and the &lt;a href="https://www.helsinki.fi/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Helsinki&lt;/a&gt; suggests that tattoo ink may compromise the immune system’s performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the lymphatic system plays a pivotal role in the immune response, any disruption caused by foreign substances could have long-term consequences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Henrik Frederiksen is a consultant in haematology at Odense University Hospital (&lt;a href="https://en.ouh.dk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;OUH&lt;/a&gt;) and a clinical professor at SDU.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We can see that ink particles accumulate in the lymph nodes, and we suspect that the body perceives them as foreign substances,“ noted Fredericksen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This may mean that the immune system is constantly trying to respond to the ink, and we do not yet know whether this persistent strain could weaken the function of the lymph nodes or have other health &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/cancer-cells-collaborate-to-survive-challenging-conditions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;consequences&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists worry that if the immune system keeps fighting ink particles, it might cause unusual cell growth, which can lead to cancer. But since cancer develops slowly, it’s hard to know the true effect of tattoos on health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-connection-between-tattoos-and-cancer"&gt;Connection between tattoos and cancer&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analyzing the long-term effects of tattoos requires extensive data spanning considerable time periods. Scientists at SDU have found a solution by exploiting data from the Danish Twin Tattoo Cohort, encompassing over 5,900 Danish twins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By observing tattoo patterns and corresponding cancer diagnoses, they concluded that tattooed individuals had higher skin and lymphoma cancer rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This provides us with a stronger method for investigating whether tattoos themselves may influence cancer risk,” said Jacob von Bornemann Hjelmborg, professor of biostatistics at SDU.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-influence-of-tattoo-size"&gt;Influence of tattoo size&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study further unveiled that tattoo size matters. Large tattoos showed a stronger link to cancer risk than smaller ones. Concerning lymphoma, people with large tattoos had a nearly three times higher &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/our-lifetime-cancer-risk-may-be-established-before-we-are-born/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;occurrence rate&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This suggests that the bigger the tattoo and the longer it has been there, the more ink accumulates in the lymph nodes,” said Signe Bedsted Clemmensen, assistant professor of biostatistics at SDU.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;”The extent of the impact on the immune system should be further investigated so that we can better understand the mechanisms at play.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-tattoos-remain-fashionable"&gt;Tattoos remain fashionable&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite health concerns, the popularity of tattoos continues to rise. The Danish Twin Tattoo Cohort study revealed that nearly 40% of women and 30% of men will have tattoos by age 25.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This trend is a global phenomenon, with increasing social acceptance of tattoos, particularly among youths and women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-does-tattoo-ink-color-matter"&gt;Does tattoo ink color matter?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The safety of tattoos also hinges on the composition of the ink. Various pigments contain different chemicals, potentially harmful when absorbed into the body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the current research doesn’t identify specific ink colors as direct cancer causes, future research may examine this aspect further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-future-of-tattoo-research"&gt;Future of tattoo research&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers are shifting focus to understand how ink particles interact with the body on a molecular level. They aim to determine whether certain types of lymphoma are more strongly linked to tattoos and how long-term exposure to ink affects immune system function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We want to gain a better understanding of the biological mechanisms – what happens in the lymph nodes when they are exposed to ink particles over decades? This can help us assess whether there is a real health risk and what we might do to reduce it,” concluded Clemmensen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding the potential health risks associated with tattoos is thus paramount for informed decisions regarding tattoos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ongoing-research-efforts"&gt;Ongoing research efforts&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Danish Twin Tattoo Cohort is a research project designed to study whether tattoos could be linked to cancer. Scientists want to understand if tattoos increase &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/breakthrough-discovery-about-cell-migration-will-help-defeat-cancer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;health risks&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s tricky because people have different genetics and lifestyles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study compares twins – who share the same genes but may have different tattoo habits. By doing this, researchers can see if tattoos alone have any health effects or if other factors, like family history or environment, play a bigger role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2017, a government agency in Denmark estimated that 14% of the population had tattoos. By 2021, tattoos had become even more popular, with 30-40% of people under 35 having at least one. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As more people get tattoos, scientists want to learn whether ink inside the body has any long-term health effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In short, tattoos are not just designs on the skin. When ink is injected, it stays in the body, and some of it may move to other areas. Scientists are still figuring out if this could lead to serious health problems like cancer. Until more research is done, it’s important to stay informed and understand the potential risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-025-21413-3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;BMC Public Health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 04 Mar 2025 13:30:15 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimAFBVV95cUxNY0c4eF9RbG8tX3ppUGwyRVRjaEZRS200UDkxdFJsRGwxdGU3QzJrZERNXzNkSlhlSkFlUXdVWkd4d3NLRkhJRGkwVTZPZDNTSFlVUThIa3FDWFNKazJ6dVE1el9kTHhOd01LR1dEZzgtMVJzeWdaSWdEZGlmMmxRNkY0UzN3MUU3Y2xjc3hhbmtaUG16NWF3cw</guid></item><item><title>Developing resilience in the face of the ‘MonSter’ that’s MS - Multiple Sclerosis News Today</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipgFBVV95cUxORDNOWFNQQ0N0TnFQZk1aOU9EaFo1aVVRaG1wa2xIbFF2N3lyQ1hjRDFtUTRibmt3dEdfWmdDaVZKRTFhVDZzUlpDVmZlOWtOSXAxSW8xNllZRWdSRGxoS1NRV19Ud200WlhFMVN2MkExckNlT3FWQUowd3d1U3ROQzdjR1VEMk9qY2d0dlcySzI3Qm5OSHNIWmktendrNHVqUUxkcmFR?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="pf-content"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Day 4 of 31&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is Melinda Livermont’s story:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the initial &lt;a href="http://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/multiple-sclerosis-diagnosis/mri-magnetic-resonance-imaging/"&gt;MRI scans&lt;/a&gt;, spinal tap, and blood work, hearing the actual words from the doctor — “You have &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/next-steps-after-ms-diagnosis/"&gt;multiple sclerosis&lt;/a&gt;” (MS) — is a distinct shock that every person &lt;a href="http://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/multiple-sclerosis-diagnosis/"&gt;diagnosed with MS&lt;/a&gt; must face. It feels like losing a battle. Yet, amid the fear and confusion, there comes a moment for standing up and proclaiming inside oneself: “This too is worth every ounce of the fight.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Waking up each day more exhausted than the day before, without any chance of knowing what a &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/expert-voices/2022/10/12/expert-voices-sleep-well-multiple-sclerosis/"&gt;restful night of sleep&lt;/a&gt; feels like, became my reality. But losing half my &lt;a href="http://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/multiple-sclerosis-symptoms/vision-problems-in-ms/"&gt;vision&lt;/a&gt; completely from the nose down, due to a &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/ms-lesions/"&gt;lesion&lt;/a&gt; on my optic nerve, allowed me to refocus on the beauty in life and people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/expert-voices/2022/06/15/expert-voices-pain-management-people-with-multiple-sclerosis/"&gt;Constant pain&lt;/a&gt; from head to toe has become my normal. When a new “ouch” emerges, it’s almost a blessing — a signal from my body alerting me to something new that needs attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walking has become a challenge I’ve learned to adapt to with the help of science. What I call my bionic sleeve — an electrode-fitted device — sends the right signals from my brain to my nerves, enabling me to walk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m grateful that I fall less often now than I did before. Each small victory, like showing my physical therapist a new skill I’ve mastered, fills me with pride.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/living-with-multiple-sclerosis/"&gt;my MS journey&lt;/a&gt;, I’ve come to accept that change is constant. Life can shift dramatically in the blink of an eye. I don’t appreciate the disease — I’ve dubbed it the MonSter — that is MS, or the diagnosis I received in 2018. But I deeply value the resilience it has taught me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every day, I show up for the fight, no matter what MS chooses to throw at me. One thing is certain: I will never back down!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;In recognition of Multiple Sclerosis Awareness Month in March, the MS Community Spotlight campaign features a series of stories highlighting the real-life experiences of people affected by MS, written in their own words.
