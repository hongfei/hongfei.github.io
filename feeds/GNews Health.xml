If anything, they just got worse. Then, the coughing started—which the mother-of-three thought was the so-called hundred day cough that ran rampage last winter.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It wasn't until she began experiencing breathlessness a few days before &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/christmas/index.html" id="mol-20bb5730-8813-11f0-b761-7f9717a666fb"&gt;Christmas&lt;/a&gt; that she thought it could be something more serious. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scans taken on December 20 revealed that she had a significant amount of fluid in her lungs, which doctors were concerned could be a warning sign of blood cancer —and what would be an incurable diagnosis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At this point, her haematologist mentioned that around half of patients diagnosed with a different type of cancer, called thymoma—a rare type of cancer that starts in the thymus gland in between the lungs—also have an autoimmune disorder. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Maeve thought she was suffering from common digestive issues when she was unable to finish her meal whilst on holiday with her family in October half term &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Maeve (pictured left) with her children Oonagh, 9, Cormac, 5, and Ciaran, 2&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Maeve went to the GP who gave her antacids to ease her symptoms &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt; Even still, her doctors' primary concern was blood cancer.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Recalling the heartbreaking ordeal, Ms Fanning told the Daily Mail: 'When they detected fluid in my lungs and said they'd need to start treatment immediately my heart sunk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Two of my children have birthdays in January, so after my biopsy, I ran around trying to get the last bits together—balloons and presents—the call came two days later. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'On January 4 I was told I likely had blood cancer and that they had a bed for me. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It was heartbreaking having to explain to my children that I wasn't going to be there for them. They watched from the window as I left, crying their eyes out.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ten days later, Ms Fanning was discharged from hospital whilst doctors waited on test results to confirm whether it was blood cancer or in fact thymoma. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'When I asked what my prognosis was, I was told I would just have to be patient and wait for the results. It was horrendous.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Devastatingly, the tests confirmed stage four thymoma that had spread to the lining of her lungs, meaning it was incurable—an avoidable prognosis had it been caught earlier. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;It was only in December when she started experiencing breathlessness alongside a persistent cough that she thought it could be something more serious &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Maeve went to A&amp;amp;E and was immediately referred for scans which revealed fluid in her lungs &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Given her symptoms, doctors were concerned that she could have blood cancer which had spread to the lining of her lungs - an incurable prognosis &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Maeve was admitted for scans and a biopsy that same day &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now Ms Fanning is doing everything she can to see her three children—Oonagh, 9, Cormac, 5, and Ciaran, 2— grow up, despite being told that palliative chemotherapy, which would give her two years at most, was the only option. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Like many other cancers, experts do not know exactly causes thymoma. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The thymus is a gland in the chest, between the lungs, which produces and releases hormones and helps the body fight off infections.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But it is thought that people diagnosed with thymoma are more likely to also have an autoimmune disease—which is caused by the immune system mistakenly attacking healthy cells in the body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The thymus gland helps keeps the immune system functioning properly, which may explain the link between autoimmune disease and thymoma. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, despite being diagnosed with oral lichen planus a year earlier—an autoimmune disorder affecting the skin which lines the inside of the mouth—after suffering from painful mouth ulcers, the link with thymoma was never mentioned until it was too late. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ms Fanning started chemotherapy just over a week later on February 14 2025, but after just one round she was told the dose was too high and her body was struggling to cope. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At this point she weighed just over 6 stone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;After spending 10 days in hospital, Maeve was discharged without treatment as doctors waited on the results of further scans which would confirm her diagnosis &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;After an agonising wait, Maeve was eventually diagnosed with stage four thymoma - a rare but aggressive type of cancer which forms in the thymus gland between the lungs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Heartbreakingly, Maeve was given a very bleak prognosis of two years at most and was told that palliative care was the only option &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Maeve also suffers from a rare autoimmune disease which has been linked with thymoma &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her oncologists reduced the dose and despite responding well to the first three rounds, the treatment had stopped working by round five. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She is now undergoing second line chemotherapy every three weeks to try and keep the cancer under control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She has paired her medical treatment with complimentary private treatment in the form of  hyperthermia—which works by heating body tissue to help damage and kill cancer cells—hyperbaric oxygen therapy, curcumin infusions and light therapy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These treatments—which were recommended to her by her nutritionist who specialises in cancer care—will hopefully alter her diagnosis and help her beat cancer for good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ms Fanning added: 'These treatments are life changing, and in some cases have seen people's cancer regress from stage four to earlier stages. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'For me its too early to say but I want to do absolutely everything I can to ensure I am alive to see by beautiful children grow up. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'When I was diagnosed, my youngest was just 18 months old and at the time I wasn't sure if Christmas 2024 would be my last with them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It's a horrendous situation, every mother's worst nightmare and this is why I need to do everything I can to ensure I am still with them.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Together with her friends and family Ms Fanning has set up a &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/jgux5c-help-maeve?"&gt;GoFundMe Page&lt;/a&gt; to help cover the costs of her treatment which sees her travel down to London twice a week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They have so far raised around £42,000 which she hopes will see her through until Christmas. Altogether her treatments cost around £11,000 a month—a cost she could never cover alone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She is now due to start proton beam therapy at University College London Hospital later this month which uses high energy proton beams to treat very rare types of cancers close to vital organs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Wed, 03 Sep 2025 12:56:46 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipwFBVV95cUxNOTdVNzNkN3JybzduQThteWFzX2dZZklFLTNIalBjRGxJYlBVQjFCc3RHSTdRMUoxYm13cUFjNEJ3RU53X0hvc0QxNmltVXJxTUFUQ3ZJMlU4N2hNZ0x2c2xYTlJtNXFmaFh1ZFZWMUNITEVXc3ZoS2RNcnFXVFIxQmJER0RNbmY5YlROYlMzMjhqUnNTOUIxM09RQzFsUDRVMmNJTkdOb9IBrAFBVV95cUxQN0xlLVQ0Y2xyV1pjcUQtblNtS3Rnb24yTGlvLVJlVkY3WDdBcmtEc2FJWHFXZDZWMDhpb1NYX2tyTFN1WTY4YU1Mci1BR3BjdDMtbWQyUkpmSlJjVTRtWHQ4WmotLTZSaFJCbzN2b0ZvRjgzYzVwNkwtc2hSN0JZdjFfVEFaNzkta1VQRXZObGcweUJxMHVnUXZoaHhmUXZiaWVkUWFXaUJmSFlf</guid></item><item><title>研究发现，体内脂肪可能是心力衰竭的主要原因- AOL.com</title><link>https://www.aol.com/internal-fat-may-leading-cause-115100564.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;A new theory suggests signals from fat tissue, not just the heart, may drive a common type of heart failure. (CREDIT: Shutterstock)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, or HFpEF, has puzzled doctors for years. Nearly four million Americans and more than 30 million people worldwide live with this condition, yet treatment options remain limited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike traditional heart failure, where the heart muscle weakens and struggles to pump, HFpEF looks normal on scans. The heart still pushes blood forward, but it cannot relax and fill properly between beats. That stiffness makes you feel short of breath, drained of energy, and sometimes swollen in the legs, belly, or lungs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For decades, high blood pressure was thought to be the primary culprit. But a new idea challenges that view. According to Milton Packer, MD, Distinguished Scholar in Cardiovascular Science at Baylor University Medical Center and Visiting Professor at Imperial College London, the real driver may not be the heart at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His team suggests that signals coming from fat tissue could be behind much of the disease. Their theory, called the Adipokine Hypothesis, was published in &lt;em&gt;JACC&lt;/em&gt; and presented at the 2025 European Society of Cardiology Congress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Central illustration: Lines of evidence supporting the Adipokine Hypothesis of HFpEF. (CREDIT: Packer M, JACC 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Fat as a Messenger, Not Just Storage&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people picture fat as little more than stored calories. In reality, fat is a living organ that sends out chemical messages across the body. These messengers, called adipokines, are proteins and hormones that can influence your heart, blood vessels, metabolism, and immune system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When fat is healthy, adipokines protect organs, reduce inflammation, and help control fluid balance. But when fat becomes excessive and unhealthy, the signals change. Harmful adipokines are released in higher amounts while the protective ones decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This shift in fat biology, Packer explains, transforms fat into an organ that drives stress, inflammation, and scarring inside the heart. “Up to now, there has been no unifying hypothesis to explain HFpEF. That has resulted in significant misunderstanding and a lack of direction in both diagnosis and therapy,” he said. “This bold new framework helps to identify the true cause of HFpEF in most people. That should make an enormous difference in guiding effective treatments.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Related Stories&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How Fat Signals Disrupt the Heart&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new framework outlines several ways that adipokines from unhealthy fat might set HFpEF in motion. One route is inflammation. When fat tissue becomes stressed, it attracts immune cells that release even more inflammatory chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These molecules damage blood vessel linings and heart muscle cells. Another pathway is vascular stiffness. Arteries lose flexibility, making it harder for blood to move and raising pressure inside the heart. Over time, scarring—or fibrosis—sets in. That scar-like tissue prevents the heart from relaxing and filling properly. Add in metabolic stress from conditions like diabetes or high blood pressure, and the cycle accelerates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The result is a heart that seems to pump normally but fails to deliver enough blood to meet the body’s needs during exertion. Climbing a flight of stairs may suddenly feel exhausting, not because the heart cannot squeeze, but because it cannot fill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;The Adipokine Hypothesis: Secretion of Adipokines From Biologically Transformed Visceral Adipose Tissue Leads to HFpEF. (CREDIT: JACC)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Strong Evidence Builds the Case&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Adipokine Hypothesis pulls together findings from many different fields. Patients with HFpEF almost always show extra fat stored deep inside the body, often wrapping around organs like the heart. Laboratory experiments in animals and cells demonstrate that adipokines can directly impair relaxation of heart muscle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blood vessel studies confirm that harmful adipokines limit dilation, which forces blood pressure up. And clinical data reveal that HFpEF commonly strikes those with metabolic syndrome—a cluster of obesity, high blood sugar, and high blood pressure—pointing again to fat’s central role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What makes this idea powerful is that it unites these scattered observations under one roof. Instead of viewing obesity, diabetes, and hypertension as separate risks, it links them through the signals fat tissue sends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Shifting the Way Doctors Think&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Packer is correct, HFpEF is not only a heart problem but a systemic disease. The heart shows the symptoms, but the roots spread across the body, starting with fat. This perspective changes how doctors might diagnose and treat patients. Rather than focusing only on cardiac function, physicians could measure inflammation markers, study fat distribution, and check waist-to-height ratios.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Mediators of Adipocyte Dysfunction to the Heart. Adipose tissue can secrete a broad array of molecules and cellular constituents that can act in an endocrine or paracrine manner to exert favorable or deleterious effects on the heart. (CREDIT: JACC)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Packer stresses that body mass index, or BMI, is a poor guide because it is influenced by muscle and bone. Instead, the waist-to-height ratio is more telling. A healthy ratio is less than 0.5, meaning your waist is less than half your height.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most HFpEF patients have a ratio above 0.5, and often above 0.6, even if they do not meet obesity criteria by BMI. “In patients with an elevated waist-to-height ratio, clinicians should be very vigilant to ask about potential symptoms of HFpEF,” he noted. Shortness of breath, often blamed on weight alone, may signal a treatable heart problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Treatments May Already Be Here&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;One striking implication of the hypothesis is that drugs may help by changing fat biology rather than directly targeting the heart. Several medications already approved for other uses appear to reshape adipokine profiles. GLP-1 receptor agonists such as semaglutide and tirzepatide, originally designed for diabetes and weight loss, have shown encouraging effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By shrinking unhealthy fat and restoring healthier signaling, these drugs may reduce inflammation and scarring that drive HFpEF. Experimental studies support the idea, and more clinical trials are underway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lifestyle measures that reduce harmful fat—like diet, exercise, or surgery—could also prove essential. If confirmed, this approach would offer a range of new strategies for the millions struggling with the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse collapsed"&gt;Characterization of Adipokine Domains. In healthy people, adipocytes primarily secrete Domain I adipokines, with minimal secretion of Domain II adipokines and with suppression of Domain III adipokines. In people with visceral adiposity or obesity, adipose tissue secretes primarily Domain III adipokines, with suppression of Domain I adipokines. (CREDIT: JACC)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Looking Ahead&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Adipokine Hypothesis is still a theory, not a proven fact. Much of the current evidence comes from models and associations. Scientists need more large-scale clinical studies to pinpoint which adipokines matter most, how they interact with other risk factors, and whether altering them truly improves outcomes. Still, experts see promise. Packer himself notes that 33 years ago he proposed the neurohormonal hypothesis for another type of heart failure, and that theory transformed treatment. The hope is that this new one could spark a similar revolution for HFpEF.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If confirmed, the Adipokine Hypothesis could shift both prevention and treatment of heart failure. Doctors may screen patients using waist-to-height ratios, giving earlier warning of risk. Patients with high ratios could receive therapies aimed at reducing harmful fat signals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Already approved drugs like semaglutide may gain new roles in managing HFpEF. For patients, this means that shortness of breath and fatigue often brushed aside as “just weight issues” might be recognized as treatable heart symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At a public health level, the findings highlight the urgent need to address rising obesity rates, since HFpEF cases are expected to rise sharply in coming decades. By tackling fat as an active organ, science may open new doors for prevention and care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note: The article above provided above by &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The Brighter Side of News;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;The Brighter Side of News&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Like these kind of feel good stories?

			&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/beta-blockers-cardiac-jacks-of-all-trades"&gt;Millions of people worldwide&lt;/a&gt; take &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_blocker"&gt;beta blockers&lt;/a&gt; to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems, especially after a heart attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But two new studies suggest that for many patients, these drugs may no longer be helpful – and in some cases, they could even be harmful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beta blockers work to lower heart rate and blood pressure, reducing the oxygen demands of the heart. Traditionally, they've been prescribed after a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/doctor-realizes-hes-having-a-heart-attack-while-treating-heart-attack-patient"&gt;heart attack&lt;/a&gt; (myocardial infarction) to give the heart time to heal and reduce the risk of a second attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/heart-cancer-strikes-very-rarely-an-expert-reveals-why"&gt;Heart Cancer Strikes Very Rarely. An Expert Reveals Why.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's the catch: since beta blockers were introduced more than four decades ago, modern medical care approaches (including &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/coronary-angioplasty/about/pac-20384761"&gt;stents&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/how-statin-drugs-protect-the-heart"&gt;statins&lt;/a&gt;) have dramatically improved recovery after a heart attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, many hearts rebound better than they once did. For women whose hearts recover well, the new research suggests that beta blockers may do more harm than good – increasing the risk of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-takeaway-food-packaging-could-increase-your-risk-of-heart-failure"&gt;cardiovascular issues&lt;/a&gt; and even death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Beta blockers have long been a foundational treatment after acute myocardial&lt;br&gt;
infarction; their use was initially supported by the results of early randomized trials," &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa2504735"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers in one of their published papers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"However, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.318.7200.1730"&gt;these trials&lt;/a&gt; were conducted in an era that predates what is now modern standard care."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test whether beta blockers still make sense today, scientists in Spain and Italy studied 8,438 patients across 109 healthcare centers who had survived a heart attack and had a left ventricular &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/heart-failure/diagnosing-heart-failure/ejection-fraction-heart-failure-measurement"&gt;ejection fraction&lt;/a&gt; (EF) above 40 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A normal EF – a measure of how efficiently the heart pumps blood– is 55–70 percent; below 40 percent indicates significant dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roughly half of the patients were treated with beta blockers in addition to standard care, while the other half were not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After an average of 3.7 years of follow-up, there was no significant difference between these groups in rates of a second &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cardiac-arrest-and-heart-attacks-arent-the-same-heres-how-to-tell-them-apart"&gt;heart attack&lt;/a&gt;, hospitalization for heart failure, or death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers then ran the numbers on just the 1,627 women – a group who were older, had more comorbidities, and received fewer guideline-based therapies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Women on beta blockers actually fared worse, with higher risks of complications and death. The risk was greatest in women whose hearts had &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/common-drug-better-than-aspirin-for-repeat-heart-attacks-study-finds"&gt;recovered the best&lt;/a&gt; and in those taking the highest doses. This pattern did not appear in men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_172873" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-172873" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/BetaChart.jpg" alt="Beta-blocker chart" class="wp-image-172873 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/BetaChart.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/BetaChart-528x415.jpg 528w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/BetaChart-600x472.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-172873" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Beta blockers showed no improvements in health outcomes in the study cohort.

(Ibáñez et al., &lt;em&gt;NEJM&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers emphasize that beta blockers still have roles in treating other conditions, such as &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrhythmia"&gt;arrhythmia&lt;/a&gt; and high blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It may take time for medical guidelines to be revised, but they hope to see a more individualized approach to beta-blocker use in the future – particularly for those whose hearts have recovered well, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fcvm.2022.1051995"&gt;which is the majority nowadays&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These results will help streamline treatment, reduce side effects, and improve quality of life for thousands of patients every year," &lt;a href="https://www.mountsinai.org/about/newsroom/2025/beta-blockers-the-standard-treatment-after-a-heart-attack-may-offer-no-benefit-for-heart-attack-patients-and-women-can-have-worse-outcomes"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; cardiologist Borja Ibáñez, from the National Centre for Cardiovascular Research in Spain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa2504735"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1093/eurheartj/ehaf673"&gt;&lt;em&gt;European Heart Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Simple carbs include food items like white bread, pastries, and sugary drinks. When eaten, these break down quickly into glucose, thus causing rapid spikes and crashes in blood sugar levels. However, when we have complex carbs-- like whole grains, legumes, and vegetables-- they are digested slowly due to their high fiber content. And so, they slowly release glucose, thus providing steady energy, preventing sudden sugar spikes, and improving insulin sensitivity over time.

Perhaps a kind friend could have suggested to Bi that there were other explanations. Instead, Bi had a set of legal adversaries and a supportive echo chamber. On Facebook, GCs and IPs alike expressed sympathy for Bi’s tragic posts: Everyone knew bad surrogates existed, and based on Bi’s claims, it sounded like Smith was one. Aimee Eyvazzadeh, a Bay Area fertility doctor and influencer, called Smith “a criminal” and “a psycho.” Bi’s $1,275-an-hour lawyer, Elizabeth Sperling, wondered whether digging through social media posts might show Smith engaging in “strenuous activity” that could explain the death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Bi’s husband focused on stabilizing the family, a move he credits with saving their marriage. He blamed the hospital, not Smith, but told me that the litigation is “her grieving process.” He tried to stay out of the legal stuff so that Bi couldn’t blame him too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;&lt;span class="lead-in-text-callout"&gt;Smith had planned&lt;/span&gt; to go back to work shortly after giving birth. Instead, she couldn’t stop bleeding. Even though SAI had determined she hadn’t breached the contract, the escrow stopped paying, leaving Smith reliant on disability benefits as she faced an increasing pile of terrifying bills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;When Smith was finally cleared to return to work, a month after Leon died, Bi emailed Smith’s HR department to ask about her health plan. Bi also reported Smith to a federal agency, claiming that Smith was committing fraud. The stress on Smith was already high: Her supervisor at work had found her crying on and off for a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Smith hadn’t heard from Bi since her terse reply to the condolence email. Then, Bi texted her a screenshot of a Facebook post about another GC who’d had an abruption at almost 32 weeks—but that GC had called 911 and the baby had lived.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Next, Bi iMessaged a photo of Leon’s corpse to Smith’s 7-year-old son’s iPad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;&lt;span class="lead-in-text-callout"&gt;In the months&lt;/span&gt; after Leon died, Bi:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Called the FBI 12 times. Reported Smith, SAI, the hospital, and Clarity escrow to more than a dozen state and federal regulators and numerous professional organizations. Launched a new round of her $30 million venture fund, backed by Marc Andreessen and David Sacks, President Trump’s “AI and crypto czar,” on Leon’s due date. Posted Leon’s ChatGPT-written endorsement from heaven, offering his “eternal blessings” for her work. Created TikToks, Instagram Reels, Facebook posts, X threads, LinkedIn Updates, and a website for her advocacy. Posted links disclosing Smith’s full name, photo, address, employer, mortgage license number, and son’s first name to her website. Asked her husband, again and again, how it was possible that Smith had carried her son but felt “nothing” about his death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="GenericCalloutWrapper-IJXIe hyVpEN callout--has-top-border" data-testid="GenericCallout"&gt;&lt;figure class="AssetEmbedWrapper-fkZDUs kHRAYC asset-embed"&gt;&lt;div class="CaptionWrapper-jYrTxZ bkfwbX caption AssetEmbedCaption-fyuOdR eXMqGf asset-embed__caption" data-testid="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;span class="BaseWrap-sc-gzmcOU BaseText-eqOrNE CaptionText-brNLzD deqABF imSbFE hMBSFK caption__text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Baby Leon’s empty crib.&lt;/p&gt;

She got on lithium for her bipolar disorder in early 2021 and began looking for surrogates as soon as she stopped feeling “sedated.” I spoke to the therapist Bi hired to consult with her and Valdeiglesias. She told me that, of the 792 intended parents she has evaluated for surrogacy or gamete donation in the last decade, she has declined to recommend only about a dozen. “I’m not gatekeeping,” she said. When it comes to serious mental illness, she added, it’s up to them to disclose. One of Bi’s fertility doctors, meanwhile, told me it’s not his place to scrutinize intended parents. He defers to the recommendation of the psychological interviewer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;If an intended parent gets turned down, they can usually find another therapist, another clinic, another agency. But without anyone questioning her plans, Bi seemed betrayed by the challenges of third-party reproduction. “Surrogacy is supposed to be the safest route,” she wrote on Instagram. It wasn’t just Leon’s death that pushed Bi into her spiral of legal action and social media posts. It was the apparent lack of control of having her child inside another woman’s body—the most basic fact of surrogacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WIRED</author><pubDate>Wed, 03 Sep 2025 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihwFBVV95cUxNU3FOeG1jSkVJTFBtXzR6U3FmeUp1UlRnVEpzM0VHeUlxbEpaVjVQQ1Y5VEN6eERXME1BQlppVS1XazRJd1o3dWFzUGEtNWxLbnZuaWlaTXp6YVJkb0F6b19xOXJ3c3pYVzB6MFlDZ2hBTnBNX0ZmdmpiUW5IZU9OU0YxdXRpc2M</guid></item><item><title>根据物理治疗师的说法，每个人在70岁后都应该做的6项基本运动，以增强力量和行动能力-汤姆指南</title><link>https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/fitness/here-are-the-6-exercises-everyone-should-do-after-turning-70-according-to-a-physical-therapist</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-body" class="text-copy bodyCopy auto"&gt;
&lt;p id="fa324cd6-a030-4aef-a3e4-537f69370a8f"&gt;If you’re looking for exercises to improve your strength, balance, mobility, and function as you get older, you’ve come to the right place. As we age, strengthening the muscles in our body is more important than ever — strength training is one of the most effective ways to prevent sarcopenia, or the loss of muscle mass. It can also help build stronger bones and improve your balance and stability, reducing your risk of falls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re a complete beginner or are returning to exercise following a long break, the good news is that things don’t have to be overly complicated. In fact, just using your bodyweight and performing a few simple exercises a few times a week can make all the difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-seasonal" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="fa324cd6-a030-4aef-a3e4-537f69370a8f-2"&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@dr.nancy.dpt" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.tiktok.com/@dr.nancy.dpt" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dr Nancy&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a physical therapist who specializes in exercises for older adults, and in a video posted to her social media accounts, she shares the six exercises she prescribes to patients between 70 and 90 years old. All of the exercises can be completed from home, and all you’ll need is a can of food from your cupboard, a chair, and a tea towel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mid-article-leaderboard" class="ad-unit sm:hidden block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These exercises focus on the lower body, but you’ll still be working your core muscles if you do them correctly.

Here’s how to do them with good form:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-1-lateral-step-over" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-1-lateral-step-over"&gt;&lt;span&gt;1. Lateral step over &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p id="443f71f4-d1bc-44e4-9d5f-d9d5a3bc0ccf"&gt;For this exercise, use a can of food from the cupboard and place it on the floor. Step to one side of the can, and stand tall, engaging your core with your hands on your hips. Lift one leg and step over the can laterally, then follow with your other foot. Then, repeat the move, stepping back to the other side. Aim for three sets of 10 reps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-2-box-squats" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-2-box-squats"&gt;&lt;span&gt;2. Box squats &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p id="83cd6595-3a1b-4b5f-a9d9-02508c9de23a"&gt;For this exercise, place a box on top of a chair. Ensure the chair is sturdy and doesn’t have wheels. Squat down, bending at your knees and keeping your core engaged until your glutes touch the box, then push down through your feet to return to a standing position, squeezing your glutes at the top. As you get stronger, make the box lower to the chair, then remove it entirely. To make the exercise easier, extend your arms away from the body. To make it harder, place your hands on your hips. Aim for three sets of 10 reps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-N8njy3Gr7pTwNE2JpojJ8k" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-N8njy3Gr7pTwNE2JpojJ8k slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get instant access to breaking news, the hottest reviews, great deals and helpful tips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a id="elk-3-standing-hip-extension" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-3-standing-hip-extension"&gt;&lt;span&gt;3. Standing hip extension&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p id="4c413bab-30f5-4b5a-ab7e-1294638f3ea9"&gt;For this exercise, stand facing a wall and place both hands on the wall for support. Shift your bodyweight into one leg, and straighten the other leg, keeping your foot flexed, before taking the leg back and lifting it a few inches off the floor. Keep kicking back for 10 reps, then switch onto the other leg. Aim for three sets of 10 reps on each leg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-4-single-leg-slides" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-4-single-leg-slides"&gt;&lt;span&gt;4.

Stand with your feet hip-width apart, and engage your core. Place one foot on a tea towel, and keeping a slight bend in both knees, slide the leg out to the side, then bring it back in, then slide it back behind you, moving slowly and with control. Keep the rest of your body still — it should only be the one leg that is moving. Complete 10 reps, then switch to work on the other leg. Complete three sets of 10 reps on each side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-5-standing-hip-flexion" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-5-standing-hip-flexion"&gt;&lt;span&gt;5.

From here, engage your core and lift one leg off the ground, keeping a 90-degree bend in your knee to march your leg up towards your torso. Place the leg back on the floor, and repeat on the other side. Keep alternating sides. Aim for three sets of 10 reps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-6-lateral-toe-taps" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-6-lateral-toe-taps"&gt;&lt;span&gt;6. Lateral toe taps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p id="3f83bd91-41e0-4166-8164-df7a56faf5d2"&gt;For this exercise, start with your feet hip-width apart and your core engaged. Place your hands on your hips. From here, lift one leg off the floor, point your toe, and tap the leg out to the side of your body. Return to your starting position, and repeat on the other side. Aim for three sets of 10 reps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check id="9e3ca6d5-f2f2-4f35-9bfd-900f60099211"&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: Shutterstock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p id="e47481eb-b462-4ccb-b677-9d3f09f76f41"&gt;To make this workout easier, drop the number of sets — start by completing one, and work your way up. To make it harder, increase the difficulty of the exercises by increasing your range of motion — remove the box on the chair during the squats, or the size of the step in the lateral step overs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This exercise will work the muscles in your lower body as well as your core, and test your balance and stability. A lot of the exercises will work one side of the body at a time, and you might notice the exercises are easier on one side. This is normal, and working on your weaker side can help correct any imbalances in the body, reducing your risk of falls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Follow &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqKAgKIiJDQklTRXdnTWFnOEtEWFJ2YlhObmRXbGtaUzVqYjIwb0FBUAE?hl=en-US&amp;amp;gl=US&amp;amp;ceid=US%3Aen" data-url="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqKAgKIiJDQklTRXdnTWFnOEtEWFJ2YlhObmRXbGtaUzVqYjIwb0FBUAE?hl=en-US&amp;amp;gl=US&amp;amp;ceid=US%3Aen" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tom's Guide on Google News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; to get our up-to-date news, how-tos, and reviews in your feeds.

You’re feeling sick, we get sick, too. Just maneuver through it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;His father taught him that a husband provides, a wife takes care of children. Emotional equity wasn’t built in their home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/brokenforbetter/?hl=en" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;couple&lt;/a&gt; had survived infidelity and rebuilt their lives as marriage coaches. They lived through the death of their teenage son in a car accident and became grief leaders. But when Schaer watched his wife Denette suffer from &lt;a href="/story/life/health-wellness/2023/07/12/what-is-perimenopause-first-signs-typical-age-and-what-to-know/70311139007/" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;perimenopause&lt;/a&gt; symptoms that grew to sharp mood swings, forgetfulness and extreme fatigue – he couldn't bear losing the woman he’d known for three decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“I needed to find compassion and empathy,” Schaer, 49, says. “Nothing in life I would have my wife walk through by herself. I had to figure how to help.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="gnt_em gnt_em_img"&gt;&lt;img class="gnt_em_img_i" fetchpriority="high" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/08/28/USAT/85859503007-b-4-a-9093-copy.jpg?width=980&amp;amp;height=654&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp" data-gl-srcset="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/08/28/USAT/85859503007-b-4-a-9093-copy.jpg?width=1960&amp;amp;height=1308&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp 2x" decoding="async" alt="Kurt and Denette Schaer say talking about perimenopause has brought them closer together."&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_em_img_ccw gnt_em_img_ccw__cap gnt_em_img_ccw__crd" data-c-caption="Kurt and Denette Schaer say talking about perimenopause has brought them closer together." data-c-credit="Octavio Jones, For USA TODAY"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;He set the thermostat in their Tampa home to 69 degrees&lt;strong&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt; built what he calls a wind tunnel of fans above his wife’s side of the bed and bought a white noise machine to block out the irritating way his breathing sounded. He did laundry and other chores; many he admits that he should have been doing all along. He learned about hormone therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“But most important,” he says, “I listened.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Just as Gen X and millennial women are changing the way they approach perimenopause and menopause, piercing through the cultural zeitgeist, so are their husbands and partners. &lt;a href="https://mindpumppodcast.com/2582-the-strange-signs-symptoms-of-perimenopause-with-dr-mary-claire-haver/" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Bro fitness podcasts&lt;/a&gt; are now talking about hormones and strength training. Men are joining their wives for medical appointments, going to &lt;a href="https://ravoke.com/four-days-life-health-journey/" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;menopause retreats&lt;/a&gt;, and making TikTok videos and &lt;a href="https://ravoke.com/four-days-life-health-journey/" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;documentaries&lt;/a&gt;. They are doing so with both a sense of urgency and sometimes humor. One man even named his wife’s menopause symptoms “Agnes” to remind them that it is part of his wife, but not all of her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;But the process by which men are approaching menopause in this generation is akin to other ways they are defining masculinity. Or, at the very least, exploring how they have understood what it means to be a man. Maybe masculinity still does mean taking care of and protecting your partner, being the breadwinner and remaining stoic all the same. But just like the men who understood changing a diaper in the 1990s didn't take away their manliness, so can participating in their spouse's emotional needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;This evolution in masculinity, where vulnerability and authenticity are valued, moves away from the restrictive path in which the men interviewed by USA TODAY were raised. It’s not just changing them, but their marriages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;Women are welcoming men to the menoconversation&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Perimenopause and menopause shouldn’t simply be discussions in a gynecologist’s office, says &lt;a href="https://www.tamsenfadal.com/about" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Tamsen Fadal&lt;/a&gt;, who wrote &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/How-Menopause-Charge-Health-Reclaim/dp/0306833549" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;“How to Menopause.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;And yet it was almost always relegated to the exam room, somewhere with stirrups in sight&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;It's not only about the body temperature changes. There's the so-called "menobelly." The irritability or walking into a room only to forget why seconds later. Oh, and a plummeting sex drive, which almost always makes women spiral into shame.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“This can create conflict in the relationship if you don’t bring men into it,” Fadal says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="gnt_em gnt_em_img"&gt;&lt;img class="gnt_em_img_i" fetchpriority="high" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/08/27/USAT/85853944007-1472421737.jpg?width=980&amp;amp;height=653&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp" data-gl-srcset="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/08/27/USAT/85853944007-1472421737.jpg?width=1960&amp;amp;height=1306&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp 2x" decoding="async" alt='Tamsen Fadal, author of “How to Menopause," says inviting men to the menopause conversation will help relationships.'&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_em_img_ccw gnt_em_img_ccw__cap gnt_em_img_ccw__crd" data-c-caption='Tamsen Fadal, author of “How to Menopause," says inviting men to the menopause conversation will help relationships.' data-c-credit="Craig Barritt, Getty Images For ADAPT Community"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;There are few studies on how men view menopause, but one of the most recent shows that almost three of four men now say they talk with their partner about menopause. These men also discuss treatment options, according to &lt;a href="https://journals.lww.com/menopausejournal/fulltext/2019/10000/the_mate_survey__men_s_perceptions_and_attitudes.6.aspx" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Menopause, the Journal of the Menopause Society.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Perimenopause, the time leading up to the menopause where a woman's period stops, can last up to 10 years and include a fluctuation in hormones. It can present with symptoms ranging from frozen shoulder to achy joints and often women suffer for years before diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;These are men who grew up with fathers who ignored menopause. These are men who now are realizing their mothers went through this and they didn’t even know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;After all, there's a silence that had always accompanied women going through menopause. If they dared asked for help, it was about masking symptoms − and feelings − in order to please others. It was to not draw any more attention to the fact that they were aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;These also are men who see that while divorce rates overall are dropping,&lt;a href="/story/life/health-wellness/2025/08/14/divorce-women-perimenopause-menopause/85622804007/" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt; divorces among adults 50&lt;/a&gt; and older are increasing. Seven in 10 women blame perimenopause or menopause for the breakdown of their marriage, according to a survey in the United Kingdom by the &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/family-law-menopause-project-newson-health-research-partner-shahzady/" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Family Law Menopause Project and Newsom Health Research and Education.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Fadal helped make &lt;a href="https://themfactorfilm.com/" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;“The M Factor,”&lt;/a&gt; a documentary about menopause. When it was screened earlier this year, the majority of audiences were women. Then she noticed a shift.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“Women were starting to bring their husbands or partners to help them understand this,” she says. “Half of the population will go through menopause, and we need the other half to understand it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;Finding his vulnerability in talking about menopause&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@theparentexpress" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Jesse Robertson&lt;/a&gt; was driving home from his sales job when he heard menopause expert &lt;a href="/story/life/health-wellness/2024/10/17/mary-claire-haver-menopause-the-m-factor/75702888007/" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Dr. Mary Claire Haver&lt;/a&gt; on a health podcast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;He was astounded by how often &lt;a href="/story/life/health-wellness/2025/07/23/hormone-therapy-estrogen-perimenopause-antidepressants/85282744007/" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;women are misdiagnosed&lt;/a&gt;, the misunderstandings about hormone therapy, and his own ignorance. So, he posed a question on his parenting TikTok account this summer: “Do women want husbands to talk to them about menopause?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Hundreds of women told him they wanted men to learn more. The husband and father of two shifted his videos to menopause and perimenopause. He approaches it not as an expert, but someone learning along with other men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;While it has grown his audience and given him a sense of pride in helping others, there’s been another more important transformation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;It has brought him closer to his wife of 17 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="gnt_em gnt_em_img gnt_em_img__inset"&gt;&lt;img class="gnt_em_img_i" fetchpriority="high" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/08/28/USAT/85866080007-jesse-robertson-and-wife.jpg?width=300&amp;amp;height=400&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp" data-gl-srcset="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/08/28/USAT/85866080007-jesse-robertson-and-wife.jpg?width=600&amp;amp;height=800&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp 2x" decoding="async" alt="Jesse Robertson says that learning more about perimenopause and menopause have brought him closer to his wife."&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_em_img_ccw gnt_em_img_ccw__cap gnt_em_img_ccw__crd" data-c-caption="Jesse Robertson says that learning more about perimenopause and menopause have brought him closer to his wife." data-c-credit="Jesse Robertson"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“It’s allowed me to have more vulnerable conversations with her,” says Robertson, 47, who lives in the Minneapolis area. “If I can talk to her about this, something sensitive, personal, and kind of uncomfortable for me, we can talk about anything.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;a href="/story/entertainment/celebrities/2021/12/15/bell-hooks-quotes-books-love-feminism/8910938002/" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Bell Hooks&lt;/a&gt;, the late author and cultural critic, said that even the most loving of couples fall into the trap of avoiding emotions and projecting expectations onto the other person. It's a comfortable game, one that has furnished endless aisles of self-help books. Women are from venus. Men are from mars, right?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;To love, she said, men and women must be willing to hear each others' truths without punishment or exception.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Now Robertson hears from men and couples who are watching his menopause videos together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“It isn’t just women who have to go through it,” he says. “It’s something that partnerships have to go through.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;Men need to learn more and stop being (expletives)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Todd Maxwell was scrolling through his phone when he came across one of Robertson’s videos describing symptoms that sounded like his wife: fatigue and brain fog, frozen shoulder, and mood swings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“I think this is what you might have,” he told her. “Perimenopause.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;She was only 40. When she told doctors, they discounted&lt;a href="/story/news/health/2024/12/04/menopause-perimenopause-the-excerpt/76758146007/" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt; her symptoms&lt;/a&gt;, blaming the shoulder issues on exercise and the fatigue on their four children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;When she had confided in Maxwell about hot flashes, he says he had made jokes about it. “It was awkward, and I didn’t know what to say,” he says. “I should have been more understanding.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;They separated this summer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“I told her that I’m really sorry it took me this long to realize that I could have been more helpful,” says Maxwell, 47. “Men need to learn more and stop being (expletives.)”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Maxwell, an oil lineman, lives in a small town in Alberta, Canada. He grew up believing men don’t show emotion. Sharing how he felt, he thought, feel could only add to his wife’s burden.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;He threw himself into being the kind of father that he never had – the kind that goes to hockey games and listens. But, he says, he didn’t put that same energy into understanding his wife.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Until now. He started therapy. He’s reading books and watching videos to learn more about perimenopause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“Now if I want to talk to my wife about how I’m feeling, I write in my journal. I take a walk,” he says. “I think about her feelings, what she needs. I want to be here for her, for my daughters and my sons."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;Men need to understand menopause is more than mood swings&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;When &lt;a href="https://www.daveymaherfitness.com/" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Dave Maher&lt;/a&gt; began training women over 40, he saw that no matter what they ate or how much they exercised, they weren’t losing weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="gnt_em gnt_em_img"&gt;&lt;img class="gnt_em_img_i" fetchpriority="high" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/08/28/USAT/85873375007-dave-maher-trainer.jpg?width=980&amp;amp;height=628&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp" decoding="async" alt="Trainer Dave Maher says that treatment during menopause and perimenopause can improve health - from the brain to the heart."&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_em_img_ccw gnt_em_img_ccw__cap gnt_em_img_ccw__crd" data-c-caption="Trainer Dave Maher says that treatment during menopause and perimenopause can improve health - from the brain to the heart." data-c-credit="Dave Maher"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;It was also about hormones and estrogen, things that change drastically during perimenopause and menopause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“It’s insulting for us to tell midlife women to just eat less and move more,” he says. “Women have been gaslit and lied to and suffered needlessly.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Perimenopause and menopause treatment is about health and longevity, not simply feeling better. It's about decreasing risks for &lt;a href="https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/about-dementia/managing-the-risk-of-dementia/additional-treatments-for-dementia-risk/hormones" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9178928/" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt;, about &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10559623/" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;building strength&lt;/a&gt; to stay out of an assisted living facility. It's about the quality of the last third of a woman's life. As Maher learned more, his business shifted to helping women better understand and get treatment – from hormone therapy to nutrition – in midlife.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“Men need to understand it’s not just mood swings,” says Maher, 41. “It’s the collapse of estrogen and progesterone and testosterone. Women need this to be healthy – for their hearts, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11387275/" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;their brains&lt;/a&gt;.

While trawling survey data on household spending to try to understand why &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-00676-z" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-00676-z" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;rates of obesity and type 2 diabetes were rising&lt;/a&gt; so rapidly in his home country, he was surprised to note that people were buying smaller quantities of sugar, salt and other ingredients generally associated with these conditions than they had in previous decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only when Monteiro and his colleagues dug deeper did they find the culprit. People were buying less sugar to prepare cakes and desserts, but eating more of it in pre-made pastries and breakfast cereal. They were buying less salt, but consuming more of it in frozen pizzas, chicken nuggets and dehydrated packet soups. “We realized the problem was our traditional dietary patterns were being replaced by foods that are processed so many times that they can no longer be recognized in the final products. We called them ultra-processed foods.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02750-0" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-02754-w/d41586-025-02754-w_51412836.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;Ultra-processed foods — it’s time for an improved definition&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monteiro, a nutrition and public-health researcher at the University of São Paulo, first used &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01600-3" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01600-3" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;the term ultra-processed food&lt;/a&gt; (UPF) in a paper in 2009, arguing that people interested in promoting healthy diets should focus more on the degree, extent and purpose of processing than on nutrient profiles&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. It was a radical idea that caught the attention of other researchers, who, over the next decade or so, published dozens of papers linking UPFs with obesity and a range of other health problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Governments took notice, too. In 2014, Brazil began advising people to avoid UPFs. Other countries, including France, Belgium and Israel, followed suit. Robert F. Kennedy Jr, secretary of the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), has been a critic of UPFs, saying in January that they are “poisoning the American people”. In May, the US government announced plans for a research agenda to support nutrition policy and improve people’s diets, in part by improving understanding of the impacts of UPFs on health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although there’s good evidence that diets high in UPFs are associated with poor health, some scientists are sceptical that the UPF category is useful for research or as the basis for dietary advice, arguing that it is too broad and ill-defined. It makes little sense, they say, to lump together foods as diverse as shop-bought yogurts and wholegrain breads with doughnuts and potato crisps. And they wonder whether UPFs are largely linked to poor health just because they tend to be high in fat and sugar, and low in fibre and vitamins. Questions remain, but recent research findings can provide some guidance for people trying to make healthy choices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Changing diets&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For hundreds of thousands of years, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-01681-w" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-01681-w" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;humans have been processing food&lt;/a&gt; by cooking it. The fermentation, milling, salting, pickling and smoking of food also have long histories. Canning, pasteurization and the use of additives, such as artificial sweeteners and colouring agents, date back to the nineteenth century. Today, many foods undergo multiple forms of advanced processing, such as fractionation into constituent sugars, oils and fibres; hydrogenation to alter physical properties; and extrusion, which subjects ingredients to high temperature, pressure, shear forces and rapid expansion. These foods are generally classified as UPFs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UPF consumption has grown since the 1950s, initially in high-income countries and, since the 1990s, in low- and middle-income countries&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR2" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Surveys suggest that UPFs make up almost 60% of calorie intake in the United States and United Kingdom, 48% in Canada and 42% in Australia (see ‘Ultra-processed intake’). Traditional eating patterns have proved more enduring in Romania (15% of calorie intake), Italy (18%), Brazil (22%) and France (31%).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;picture class="embed intensity--high"&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="//media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-025-02754-w/d41586-025-02754-w_51396482.jpg?as=webp 767w, //media.nature.com/lw319/magazine-assets/d41586-025-02754-w/d41586-025-02754-w_51396482.jpg?as=webp 319w" sizes="(max-width: 319px) 319px, (min-width: 1023px) 100vw,  767px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img class="figure__image" alt="ULTRA-PROCESSED INTAKE.

Dozens of studies have linked diets high in UPFs with increased risks of obesity, cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, fatty liver disease, cancer, asthma, depression and &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02066-z" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02066-z" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;anxiety&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR3" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR5" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a study published last year, for example, epidemiologist Mingyang Song and his colleagues at Harvard University in Boston, Massachusetts, analysed data on the diets and health of more than 110,000 US adults, who were tracked over a median period of more than 30 years. Song found that those with the highest proportion of calories from UPFs were 4% more likely to die of any cause during the study than were those with the lowest intake. Higher UPF consumption was associated with increased mortality from neurodegenerative diseases, but not from cardiovascular or respiratory disease or from cancer&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR4" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Diets that included more processed meat, poultry, seafood and sugary drinks were associated with higher risks after researchers controlled for factors such as body mass index, physical activity, alcohol consumption and family health history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01969-1" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-02754-w/d41586-025-02754-w_51250548.png"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;How to make America healthy: the real problems — and best fixes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also suggested that nutritional quality could be a big factor in why diets high in UPFs might be unhealthy. The increase in risk was much lower for those with diets that, although high in UPFs, were still defined as healthy according to a diet-scoring system called the Alternative Healthy Eating Index. Those diets included a lot of vegetables and nuts, and limited the intake of sugary drinks, red and processed meats, salt and trans fats. “The association between UPF consumption and mortality was much weaker once we accounted for dietary quality,” says Song.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, other research indicates that nutritional composition is not the whole story. When Samuel Dicken, a clinical scientist at University College London, reviewed 37 studies that reported health outcomes linked with UPFs, he found that almost all of the associations remained after researchers controlled for nutritional composition&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR6" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dicken and his colleagues subsequently ran a trial in which adults who were overweight or obese were asked to follow one of two diets defined as healthy according to the UK Eatwell Guide (see &lt;a href="http://go.nature.com/4fpdeen" data-track="click" data-label="http://go.nature.com/4fpdeen" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;go.nature.com/4fpdeen&lt;/a&gt;), and then switched to the other diet. One of the diets was made up mostly of UPFs and the other mostly of minimally processed foods, but the two diets were &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-02096-5" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-02096-5" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;matched for levels of protein&lt;/a&gt;, carbohydrate, fat, fibre, sodium and sugar. Participants lost twice as much weight (an average of 2 kilograms versus 1 kg) on the minimally processed diet compared with the UPF diet&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR7" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. The findings, published in August, suggest that the increased prevalence of health problems linked to a UPF diet in other studies cannot be fully explained by poor nutritional composition. So what other mechanisms might be involved?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Beyond processing &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dicken’s study is one of only a handful of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on UPFs. Unlike retrospective and observational studies, RCTs can demonstrate causal links and so might offer a clearer picture, researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first RCT on UPFs was carried out by a team led by integrative physiologist Kevin Hall, who until April was at the US National Institutes of Health (NIH), part of the HHS. For more than a decade, Hall has sought to overcome some of the limitations of nutrition research by confining study participants to a research hospital, so that their diets can be precisely recorded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2015, he was approached by two Brazilian researchers at a meeting after he presented the results of one such study, comparing a low-carbohydrate, animal-product-based diet with a low-fat vegan diet. “They told me they had enjoyed my talk, but that my focus on nutrients was very twentieth century and that really, I should be thinking about the extent and purpose of processing food,” says Hall, who had not then heard of UPFs. He was sceptical but intrigued enough that he devised a trial in which 20 adults stayed at the NIH Clinical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, and consumed a diet high in either UPFs or unprocessed food for two weeks before swapping diets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;picture class="embed intensity--high"&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="//media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-025-02754-w/d41586-025-02754-w_51384280.jpg?as=webp 767w, //media.nature.com/lw319/magazine-assets/d41586-025-02754-w/d41586-025-02754-w_51384280.jpg?as=webp 319w" sizes="(max-width: 319px) 319px, (min-width: 1023px) 100vw,  767px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img class="figure__image" alt="Employees in protective clothing and hard hats check hundreds of breaded chicken nugget pieces on a factory production line conveyor belt." loading="lazy" src="//media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-025-02754-w/d41586-025-02754-w_51384280.jpg"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;p class="figure__caption u-sans-serif"&gt;&lt;span class="mr10"&gt;Breaded chicken nuggets are inspected before being packaged at a factory near Orléans in France.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Credit: Guillaume Souvant/AFP via Getty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like many other researchers, Hall defined UPFs using a system developed by Monteiro. Known as NOVA, it classifies food into four groups according to the extent, type and purpose of processing&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR8" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Unprocessed or minimally processed foods, such as vegetables and pasta, are at one end of the scale. At the other end are UPFs, which undergo multiple industrial processes and usually contain substances rarely used in home kitchens, such as high-fructose corn syrup, hydrogenated oils and additives, including colouring and emulsifiers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants in Hall’s RCT could eat as much as they liked, but the food presented to them was matched for nutrient groups. To Hall’s surprise, the results, published in 2019, showed that participants consumed around 500 calories more per day on average while on the UPF diet — and gained an average of 0.9 kg over the two weeks&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR9" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. They lost that same amount of weight while on the unprocessed diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Hall dug further into the results to try to understand why people on some diets, including those high in UPFs, eat more calories, he and his colleagues found that people consumed more if they ate quicker&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR10" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Participants also consumed more calories when the foods were energy dense (containing more calories per gram) and “hyper-palatable” — containing ingredients high in combinations of fat, carbohydrates, sugar and salt, which, some researchers say, activate reward signals and circumvent satiety mechanisms in the brain&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR11" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Energy-dense foods provide more calories in less time than those with fewer calories per gram because they are easier to eat, and many UPFs are energy dense because their water content has been removed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00549-7" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-02754-w/d41586-025-02754-w_50690036.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;How a junk-food splurge can change your brain activity&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But questions remained about what might be driving the extra intake, so Hall set up another trial, this time involving 36 people who spent a week each eating a minimally processed diet and three UPF diets: one was energy dense and hyper-palatable; another was energy dense but not hyper-palatable; and the last was neither energy dense nor hyper-palatable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is ongoing, but early findings show that participants ate more and gained more weight while on the energy-dense, hyper-palatable UPF diet compared with the minimally processed diet. Most of the increases in consumption and body weight that occurred on the energy dense, hyper-palatable UPF diet also occurred on the energy dense diet low in hyper-palatable foods, suggesting that energy density could be the more important factor to health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous research has suggested that eating more slowly and eating diets with low energy density are associated with lower calorie consumption — and that various factors, including &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-03243-8" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-03243-8" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;food texture&lt;/a&gt;, can affect eating speed&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR12" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In one study, Ciarán Forde, a nutrition researcher at Wageningen University &amp;amp; Research in the Netherlands, asked 50 adults to eat as much as they liked during four lunches. He found that they ate much less when presented with hard-textured foods, such as potato waffle fries, than when given soft-textured foods such as mashed potato, regardless of whether the foods were UPFs&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR13" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. “What we saw was that the speed of eating and the texture properties of meals drive consumption, not the degree of processing,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forde’s team went on to ask 41 adults to follow, for 14 days, either a UPF diet consisting of foods with harder textures associated with slow eating, or a UPF diet made up of softer foods linked to faster eating, and then swap over. The meals presented were matched for energy density, and, Forde says, the energy density of foods that participants actually consumed turned out to be the same as well. Although the full results are yet to be published, participants consumed 369 fewer calories per day, on average, when their diet consisted of slowly consumed foods than when it contained those linked to faster consumption, according to initial results Forde presented at a meeting of the American Society for Nutrition in Orlando, Florida, in June.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe a combination of energy density and food texture explains why people eat more, says Forde, who has received funding from multinational food companies. “Maybe it’s not something magic in ultra-processed foods that we don’t understand. Rather it’s just about factors we’ve long known, about how foods are eaten and how they drive meal size.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Malla explains that while antipsychotic medications are effective, they only go some way to addressing symptoms of disease. "Antipsychotic medication really only works for positive symptoms, which are things that should not be there, like illusions or hallucinations," says Malla. Negative symptoms are the absence of things that should be there, such as emotional expression, ability to generate thoughts and ability to relate socially to people. The reverse of which would be social withdrawal, a lack of experience, feelings and so on.

Malla puts this down to families wanting to keep mental illness within the household so that any stigma associated with having a family member with schizophrenia can be "kept under wraps". He says that marriage is a key concern for families, and anything that might affect an offspring's marriageability will be dealt with as a family. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Malla points out that families in Canada are as interested in taking care of their sons and daughters, brothers and sisters, as they are in India. But he says that the sophisticated legalisation of contact and confidentiality with patients can be a problem. A young adult in North America can more easily leave home and cut off contact if they wish, he says. But this could lead to worse outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/inm.13198" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;Family interventions have been shown to be effective&lt;/a&gt; in improving recovery from psychosis. "In Chennai, a patient hardly ever comes to the clinic without a family member. We hypothesised that it would result in a better outcome on negative symptoms," says Malla. "And that's exactly what we found." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Wed, 03 Sep 2025 09:07:02 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMioAFBVV95cUxQRDlSR3BvOWpEZVpJZkZMLVlpV3ppdl80cmRKMDRoMl8wRmdVVVBQeDlqRlBtM19VUW5TdVdHSHh5MTItd1FkbGluT3pPVzItNEhqVlM4ek03T0Fwa1ZoTlJ1OFlHd21FNGVXX1hqR0luNmxrbjVvTE1yMnBvaEVwdE1aMDVNUFNjcVZKTllHcEROR1JNZWRpODVwbE5LQTRZ</guid></item><item><title>减肥后皮肤松弛：专家希望你知道的事情-纽约时报</title><link>https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/03/well/loose-skin-after-weight-loss.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The New York Times</author><pubDate>Wed, 03 Sep 2025 09:00:12 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifkFVX3lxTE8xRnJodDZGOEdxTk1aOGpjUWlRTGF4cHJFUm14N1hSVVN2b3FFX0UzdmVXN0xnQlUteEJFYWtPbmRjcHdrT0l6TVM4bmlQNFpOV3pBbl9INWtYbGc0ak9Rd2g1Nm4wSU5QSm5SRm5qV0Jsdk9MM01HbWgtR3VpZw</guid></item><item><title>运动病患者，欢欣鼓舞：科学家说这实际上可能有所帮助- Gizmodo</title><link>https://gizmodo.com/motion-sickness-sufferers-rejoice-scientists-say-this-might-actually-help-2000651372</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content prose dark:prose-invert lg:prose-lg lg:leading-[29px] font-serif max-w-none "&gt;
              
              
              &lt;p&gt;Normally, I’d start this sort of article by saying something along the lines of, “Everyone knows how horrible it is to feel motion sick.” But that’s not entirely true—plenty of people can text, read, and do all sorts of things in a moving vehicle without feeling the slightest bit nauseous. If that sounds like you, you’ll have to trust me—a chronic sufferer of motion sickness—when I say that it wholeheartedly sucks.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Plus, many drugs used for motion sickness come with an unwanted side effect: drowsiness. While that’s useful for a long-haul red-eye, it definitely kills the mood on a road trip. That’s why researchers have looked into whether music can help people recover from carsickness, and they might be onto something.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Motion sickness significantly impairs the travel experience for many individuals, and existing pharmacological interventions often carry side-effects such as drowsiness,” Qizong Yue, a researcher at Southwest University in China, said in a &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/news/2025/09/03/happy-music-could-help-you-recover-from-motion-sickness-frontiers-human-neuroscience"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. “Music represents a non-invasive, low-cost, and personalized intervention strategy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Simulated carsickness hell&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fnhum.2025.163610"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published today in the journal Frontiers in Human Neuroscience, Yue and colleagues induced carsickness in study participants with a driving simulator (you couldn’t pay me enough to get into that) and then played different types of music while monitoring them for potential recovery. According to their results, soft and joyful music best supported recovery. Perhaps surprisingly, even sad music was worse than doing nothing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The team divided the 30 participants, who had reported moderate levels of previous carsickness, into six groups—four who listened to music as they recovered from motion sickness, one who didn’t, and one whose simulations stopped before the participant became carsick.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Everyone wore &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/eeg/about/pac-20393875"&gt;electroencephalogram&lt;/a&gt; (EEG) caps—tools that measure electrical activity in the brain. The researchers hoped to identify brain signals indicative of carsickness by comparing the neural activity of the first five groups with that of the sixth group—the one for which the simulation stopped before participants could become nauseous (ok, maybe you could pay me to be in group six).&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The researchers first measured each participant’s EEG signals as they sat still in the simulator. The participants subsequently underwent a driving task and communicated their level of carsickness. At the end of the task, some participants listened to music for 60 seconds.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The team then asked them how carsick they still were. The participants reported that joyful music reduced carsickness by 57.3%, soft music reduced it by 56.7%, and passionate music by 48.3%. While those who didn’t listen to music reported 43.3% fewer carsickness symptoms after the 60 seconds, participants who listened to sad music reported a reduction of just 40%.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The researchers suggest that soft music might relax tensions that worsen carsickness, and joyful music may provide a distraction by triggering brain reward systems. Sad music could aggravate negative feelings and, as a result, worsen a person’s general discomfort.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Your brain when you’re motion sick&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the EEG data revealed changes in participants’ occipital lobe brain activity when they said they were carsick. Specifically, the device recorded less complex activity when participants reported feeling significantly nauseous. As they recovered, brain activity in this area gradually returned to normal levels.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“Based on our conclusions, individuals experiencing motion sickness symptoms during travel can listen to cheerful or gentle music to achieve relief,” Yue explained. “The primary theoretical frameworks for motion sickness genesis apply broadly to sickness induced by various vehicles. Therefore, the findings of this study likely extend to motion sickness experienced during air or sea travel.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, “the primary limitation of this study is its relatively small sample size,” the researcher added. “This constraint results in limited statistical power.” What’s more, one’s brain might react differently to a simulation than real-life conditions. In other words, more research with larger samples is needed to confirm both the carsickness brain activity patterns and to continue investigating the impact of music on motion sickness.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Moving forward, the team will study different types of motion sickness and the influence of music taste. And if any of the researchers are reading this article, I’d like to suggest investigating the anecdotal evidence of how singing helps prevent and/or recover from motion sickness. It would finally prove to my family that I literally &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; to belt out the lyrics to all of Taylor Swift’s songs when we hit those windy roads.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;For years, health authorities have warned against red meat consumption, with the  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-does-the-world-health-organisation-do" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73079" data-postid="172897" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt;'s  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="172897" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; research arm classifying it as "probably carcinogenic to humans". But a controversial &lt;a href="https://cdnsciencepub.com/doi/10.1139/apnm-2023-0594"&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; challenges that position, suggesting that animal protein might protect against cancer deaths rather than cause them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://monographs.iarc.who.int/agents-classified-by-the-iarc/"&gt;International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC)&lt;/a&gt;, part of the WHO, has long classified red meat, including beef, pork, lamb and mutton, as probably carcinogenic. And processed meats such as bacon and sausages are classified as definite carcinogens. This judgment reflects multiple studies linking red meat to &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11357-025-01646-1"&gt;colorectal cancer&lt;/a&gt;, forming the basis of dietary advice to limit intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet the new research by Canada's McMaster University suggests the opposite: that people who consume more animal protein may actually have &lt;a href="https://cdnsciencepub.com/doi/10.1139/apnm-2023-0594"&gt;lower cancer mortality rates&lt;/a&gt;. But, before you rush out to buy a pack of sausages, there are some important points you should note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study's methods contain important nuances that complicate its &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/eating-meat-could-protect-against-cancer-related-death-study-suggests"&gt;headline-grabbing conclusions&lt;/a&gt;. Rather than examining red meat specifically, the researchers analysed consumption of "animal protein", a broad category that &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2304-8158/13/11/1771"&gt;includes red meat, poultry, fish, eggs and dairy products&lt;/a&gt;. This distinction matters significantly because fish, particularly &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/14/3/640"&gt;oily varieties such as mackerel and sardines&lt;/a&gt;, are associated with being cancer-protective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By grouping all animal proteins together, the study may have captured the protective effects of fish and certain dairy products rather than proving the safety of red meat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dairy products themselves present a complex picture in cancer research. Some studies suggest they &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2161831322002095?via%3Dihub"&gt;reduce colorectal cancer risk&lt;/a&gt; while potentially &lt;a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/british-journal-of-nutrition/article/association-between-dairy-products-consumption-and-prostate-cancer-risk-a-systematic-review-and-metaanalysis/ADBD3EA24DE6E07CE23E0F110012916C"&gt;increasing prostate cancer risk&lt;/a&gt;. This mixed evidence underscores how the broad "animal protein" category obscures important distinctions between different food types.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, which was funded by the &lt;a href="https://www.ncba.org/"&gt;National Cattlemen's Beef Association&lt;/a&gt;, America's primary beef industry lobbying group, contains several other limitations. Crucially, the researchers didn't distinguish between processed and unprocessed meats – a distinction that &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01635580701684872"&gt;countless studies have shown to be vital&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Processed meats such as bacon, sausages and deli meats consistently show higher cancer risks than fresh, unprocessed cuts. Additionally, the research didn't examine specific cancer types, making it impossible to determine whether the protective effects apply broadly or to particular cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the study also examined plant proteins, including legumes, nuts and soy products such as tofu, and found they had no strong protective effect against dying of cancer. This finding contradicts previous research suggesting that &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13668-025-00688-3#Sec11"&gt;plant proteins are linked to decreased cancer risk&lt;/a&gt;, adding another layer of complexity to an already confusing picture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings don't diminish the established health benefits of plant-based foods, which provide fibre, antioxidants and other compounds associated with reduced disease risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_151583" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-151583" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/salad_with_many_plants_642.jpg" alt="salad with numerous items" class="wp-image-151583 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/salad_with_many_plants_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/salad_with_many_plants_642-444x415.jpg 444w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/salad_with_many_plants_642-600x561.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-151583" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The new study doesn't undermine the wealth of evidence that plant-based foods are good for you.

Excessive red meat intake remains linked to other serious health conditions, including &lt;a href="https://www.imrpress.com/journal/IJVNR/85/1-2/10.1024/0300-9831/a000224"&gt;heart disease and diabetes&lt;/a&gt;. The key lies in moderation and balance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The conflicting research highlights the complexity of nutrition science, where isolating the effects of individual foods proves remarkably difficult. People don't eat single nutrients in isolation – they consume complex combinations of foods as part of broader lifestyle patterns. It's more important to focus on overall dietary patterns rather than fixating on individual foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/17/12/1947"&gt;balanced plate approach&lt;/a&gt;, featuring a variety of protein sources, plenty of vegetables and fruits, and minimally processed foods, remains the most evidence-based path to optimal health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While this latest study adds a new dimension to the meat debate, it's unlikely to be the final word. As nutrition science continues to evolve, the most prudent approach remains the least dramatic: moderation, variety and balance in all things.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/264088/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Researchers have developed plant-based microbeads that block fat absorption in the gut.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Current strategies for weight loss, such as gastric bypass surgery or medications that block fat absorption, often come with significant risks or unpleasant side effects. Scientists are now exploring a different option: edible microbeads made from green tea polyphenols, vitamin E, and seaweed. Once swallowed, these beads attach to dietary fats inside the digestive tract. Early studies in rats that were fed high-fat diets suggest this method could provide a safer and more widely available alternative to traditional surgery or drug-based treatments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yue Wu, a graduate student at Sichuan University, is scheduled to present the team’s findings at the ACS Fall 2025 Digital Meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Losing weight can help some people prevent long-term health issues like diabetes and heart disease,” says Wu. “Our microbeads work directly in the gut to block fat absorption in a noninvasive and gentle way.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The Challenge of Fat Absorption&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weight gain can be influenced by both genetic and lifestyle factors, one of the most important being diet. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, a high-fat diet is defined as one in which 35% or more of daily calories come from fat rather than protein or carbohydrates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some approved drugs, such as orlistat, reduce fat absorption by interfering with the enzymes that break down dietary fats. While effective, orlistat has been linked to serious side effects in certain patients, including damage to the liver and kidneys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, Wu and her colleagues wanted to target the fat absorption process with their weight-loss intervention but do so without negative side effects. “We want to develop something that works with how people normally eat and live,” says Wu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_490711" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-490711" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="https://scitechdaily.com/images/Fat-Trapping-Microbeads.jpg"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-490711" src="https://scitechdaily.com/images/Fat-Trapping-Microbeads-777x777.jpg" alt="Fat Trapping Microbeads" srcset="https://scitechdaily.com/images/Fat-Trapping-Microbeads-777x777.jpg 777w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Fat-Trapping-Microbeads-400x400.jpg 400w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Fat-Trapping-Microbeads-150x150.jpg 150w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Fat-Trapping-Microbeads-768x768.jpg 768w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Fat-Trapping-Microbeads-1536x1536.jpg 1536w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Fat-Trapping-Microbeads-2048x2048.jpg 2048w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Fat-Trapping-Microbeads-450x450.jpg 450w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Fat-Trapping-Microbeads-1200x1201.jpg 1200w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Fat-Trapping-Microbeads-120x120.jpg 120w" sizes="(max-width: 777px) 100vw, 777px"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-490711" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;These plant-based microbeads absorb and trap fat. Credit: Yue Wu&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get started, the team created tiny plant-based beads that spontaneously form through a series of chemical bonds between the green tea polyphenols and vitamin E. These structures can form chemical tethers to fat droplets and serve as the fat-binding core of the microbeads. The researchers then coated the spheres in a natural polymer derived from seaweed to protect them from the acidic environment of the stomach. Once ingested, the protective polymer coating expands in response to the acidic pH, and the green tea polyphenols and vitamin E compounds bind to and trap partially digested fats in the intestine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Integrating Microbeads into Diets&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The microbeads are nearly flavorless, and the researchers foresee them being easily integrated into people’s diets. For example, the microbeads could be made into small tapioca- or boba-sized balls and added to desserts and bubble teas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers assessed the microbeads as a weight-loss treatment in rats. They put the animals into three groups (eight rats per group), those which were fed a high-fat diet (60% fats) either with or without microbeads and those which were fed a normal diet (10% fats) for 30 days. Rats fed the high-fat diet and microbeads:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lost 17% of their total body weight, while rats in the other groups didn’t lose weight.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Had reduced adipose tissue and less liver damage compared to rats fed the high-fat and normal diets without microbeads.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Excreted more fat in their feces compared to rats not given microbeads. The extra fat in the rats’ feces had no apparent ill effects on the animals’ health.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the eight rats on high-fat diets that consumed microbeads showed similar intestinal fat excretion, but without the gastrointestinal side effects the researchers observed with a fourth group of rats they treated with orlistat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wu and her team have started working with a biotechnology company to manufacture the plant-based beads. “All the ingredients are food grade and FDA-approved, and their production can be easily scaled up,” says Yunxiang He, Sichuan University associate professor and co-author on Wu’s presentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They’ve also initiated a human clinical trial in collaboration with the West China Hospital of Sichuan University. “This represents a major step toward clinical translation of our polyphenol-based microbeads, following our foundational results,” says Wu. “We have officially enrolled 26 participants in our investigator-initiated trial, and we anticipate that preliminary data may become available within the next year.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meeting: ACS Fall 2025&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research was funded by National Key R&amp;amp;D Program of China; the National Excellent Young Scientists Fund; the National Natural Science Foundation of China; the Talents Program of Sichuan Province; the Double First-Class University Plan of Sichuan University; the State Key Laboratory of Polymer Materials Engineering; the Tianfu Emei Program of Sichuan Province; the Postdoctoral Special Funding of Sichuan Province; the Postdoctoral Funding of Sichuan University; the Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Leather Chemistry and Engineering; and the National Engineering Research Center of Clean Technology in Leather Industry.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;They have been promoted as a remedy for anxiety and sleeplessness, with &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BlskNOvFJQW/?taken-by=myblanquil"&gt;celebrities&lt;/a&gt; and influencers swearing by their calming effects. Weighted blankets – heavy throws filled with glass beads or plastic pellets – have gone from a niche therapeutic tool to a mainstream wellness must-have, promising better sleep and reduced stress for anyone struggling to unwind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But do they deliver on these bold claims, or are we simply paying premium prices for an expensive  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-a-placebo" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="102371" data-postid="172882" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;placebo&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/weighted-blankets-really-can-do-wonders-for-a-good-nights-sleep"&gt;Weighted Blankets Really Can Do Wonders For a Good Night's Sleep&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Occupational therapists have used weighted blankets since the 1970s to help children with  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/autism-spectrum-disorder" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73013" data-postid="172882" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;autism&lt;/a&gt; and adults with sensory processing disorders. They became commercially available in the 1990s, but remained largely within special needs communities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That changed dramatically in recent years when companies began targeting what they call the "casually anxious" – essentially, anyone struggling with modern life's stresses. The marketing worked: Time magazine even named the weighted blanket one of the &lt;a href="https://time.com/collection/best-inventions-2018/5454469/gravity-blanket/"&gt;top 50 "inventions" of 2018&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The concept behind weighted blankets is appealingly simple. Typically weighing between two and 13 kilograms (experts &lt;a href="https://www.hollandandbarrett.com/the-health-hub/conditions/sleep/sleep-help/how-do-weighted-blankets-work/"&gt;recommend choosing one that's 10% of your body weight&lt;/a&gt;), they use what occupational therapists call "deep pressure stimulation". The gentle, even pressure across your body mimics the sensation of being held or hugged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What the science says&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research picture is more nuanced than the marketing suggests. Several studies do show promising results, but with important qualifications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7970589/"&gt;study of 120 psychiatric outpatients&lt;/a&gt; found that weighted blankets improved insomnia symptoms over four weeks in people with major  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/depression" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73097" data-postid="172882" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;, bipolar disorder, anxiety and  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-adhd" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73112" data-postid="172882" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;ADHD&lt;/a&gt;. The researchers concluded they were "a safe and effective intervention for insomnia in patients with some mental health disorders".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smaller studies have shown similar patterns. One found that &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1300/J004v24n01_05"&gt;63% of adults reported lower anxiety&lt;/a&gt; after just five minutes under a weighted blanket, while another study of psychiatric inpatients found &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/0164212X.2015.1066220"&gt;60% experienced reduced anxiety&lt;/a&gt; during their hospital stay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, these studies all focused on people with diagnosed mental health conditions, not the general population that companies are now targeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is where the science diverges from the marketing: reviews of the research consistently show that benefits for healthy people are &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38686123/"&gt;much harder to prove&lt;/a&gt;. While weighted blankets may help people with clinical anxiety or sleep disorders, there's &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39341068/"&gt;insufficient evidence&lt;/a&gt; that they benefit casual users without existing mental health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, about half the research on weighted blankets &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32204779/"&gt;doesn't meet quality standards&lt;/a&gt; for robust scientific evidence – a significant problem given the confident health claims found on product websites and &lt;a href="https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/health/wellness/a28713038/weighted-blanket-health-benefits/"&gt;glowing reviews&lt;/a&gt; in lifestyle magazines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Who might benefit?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This doesn't mean weighted blankets are entirely useless for healthy people. Shift workers, who must sleep during daylight hours when their brains are naturally alert, might find them helpful for combating the known health effects of &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/shift-work-can-harm-sleep-and-health-what-helps-202302282896"&gt;irregular schedules&lt;/a&gt;. Healthcare workers, firefighters and pilots who rely on &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-37061-9"&gt;strategic power naps&lt;/a&gt; could benefit from faster sleep onset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The placebo effect also shouldn't be dismissed. If a weighted blanket helps you feel calmer and sleep better, even if the mechanism isn't what manufacturers claim, that's still a positive outcome, provided you understand what you're buying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weighted blankets do carry some risks. They shouldn't be used by anyone who cannot easily move beneath their weight, including young children. People with  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="172882" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, asthma, sleep apnoea, &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-copd/"&gt;COPD&lt;/a&gt;, circulation problems, high blood pressure or claustrophobia should consult their GP before opting to use one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No studies have reported serious harms, but common sense suggests checking with a healthcare provider if you have underlying health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a low-risk intervention that might complement &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10105495/"&gt;good sleep hygiene&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.sleepfoundation.org/how-sleep-works/benefits-of-sleep"&gt;regular sleep cycles&lt;/a&gt;, weighted blankets aren't inherently problematic. The issue lies in overselling their capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're considering buying one, be realistic about your expectations. You're not buying a miracle cure for modern anxiety but rather a potentially comforting sleep aid that might help you feel more settled at bedtime. For many people struggling with sleep, that gentle pressure and sense of security could be worth the investment, even if the science behind it isn't quite as solid as the marketing suggests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The real question isn't whether weighted blankets work, but whether they work for you, and whether the premium price is justified for what might ultimately be an expensive hug.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/263591/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;A 70-year-old woman became the first in Massachusetts to test positive for West Nile virus this year, the Massachusetts Department of Public Health &lt;a href="https://www.mass.gov/news/state-health-officials-announce-seasons-first-human-case-of-west-nile-virus-in-massachusetts"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; Tuesday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The woman was exposed to the disease in Middlesex County, officials said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The department did not disclose details about specifically where or when the woman was exposed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mosquito-borne virus can be transmitted to humans through mosquito bites, the department said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first mosquitos positive for West Nile virus were &lt;a href="https://www.boston.com/news/health/2025/07/13/west-nile-virus-detected-in-two-boston-mosquito-samples/"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; June 17, found in Boston’s West Roxbury and Hyde Park neighborhoods. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials &lt;a href="https://www.boston.com/news/local-news/2025/08/13/the-risk-for-west-nile-virus-is-now-high-in-10-mass-communities-heres-what-to-know/"&gt;warned residents&lt;/a&gt; in early August about the rise of the virus, declaring the risk to be “high” in 10 Massachusetts communities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The current risk for the virus is high in 10 municipalities in Suffolk and Middlesex counties, the department said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This season, there have been 319 West Nile-positive mosquito samples so far, the department said. In July, a goat in Lunenburg was the first animal to be infected with the virus in 2025. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; “While September brings cooler air and the return to school for many in the state, the risk from WNV is going to be elevated for some time. Residents should continue to take precautions to avoid mosquito bites,” said Public Health Commissioner Robbie Goldstein. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials &lt;a href="https://www.boston.com/news/health/2025/07/13/west-nile-virus-detected-in-two-boston-mosquito-samples/"&gt;warned&lt;/a&gt; residents to be wary of the mosquitos, and take proper precautions like applying insect repellent when outdoors, draining standing water, and installing or repairing window screens. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The mosquitoes will be with us until the first hard frost,” said State Epidemiologist Dr. Catherine M. Brown. “People should use mosquito repellent with an EPA-registered active ingredient, clothing to reduce exposed skin, and consider rescheduling outdoor activities that occur during the evening or early morning.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were &lt;a href="https://www.mass.gov/news/state-public-health-officials-announce-seasons-first-west-nile-virus-positive-mosquito-sample-0"&gt;19 cases&lt;/a&gt; reported in 2024 and &lt;a href="https://www.mass.gov/news/state-health-officials-announce-risk-level-changes-for-west-nile-virus-in-massachusetts"&gt;six cases&lt;/a&gt; in 2023, according to the department.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;A protein called ferritin light chain 1 (FTL1) may play a significant role in brain aging, a new study reveals, giving scientists a new target for understanding and potentially preventing &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/human-brains-rapidly-aged-in-the-pandemic-and-it-wasnt-just-the-virus"&gt;brain deterioration&lt;/a&gt; and disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FTL1 was brought to light through a careful comparison of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippocampus"&gt;the hippocampus&lt;/a&gt; part of the brain in mice of different ages. The hippocampus is involved in memory and learning, and it is one of the regions that suffers most from age-related decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study team found that FLT1 was the one protein in this region that old mice had more of and young mice had less of.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work was led by a team from the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), and the researchers are hopeful that their findings will enlighten human treatments for neurodegenerative conditions, such as &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimer-s-disease"&gt;Alzheimer's disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-single-brain-scan-halfway-through-your-life-can-reveal-how-fast-youre-aging"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Single Brain Scan Halfway Through Your Life Can Reveal How Fast You're Aging&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our data raise the exciting possibility that the beneficial effects of targeting neuronal FTL1 at old age may extend more broadly, beyond cognitive aging, to neurodegenerative disease conditions in older people," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s43587-025-00940-z"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers in their published paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FTL1 is known to be related to storing iron in the body, but hasn't come up in relation to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-brains-youthfulness-or-lack-of-it-could-predict-how-long-you-live"&gt;brain aging&lt;/a&gt; before. To test its involvement after their initial findings, the researchers used genetic editing to overexpress the protein in young mice, and reduce its level in old mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_172283" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-172283" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/BrainNeurons.jpg" alt="Cultured neurons" class="wp-image-172283 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/BrainNeurons.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/BrainNeurons-600x298.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-172283" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Neurons with a lot of FTL1 (right) had fewer branching arms, a sign of lower connectivity.

Aging&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results were clear: the younger mice showed signs of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimers-breakthrough-lithium-reverses-memory-loss-in-mice"&gt;impaired memory&lt;/a&gt; and learning abilities, as if they were getting old before their time, while in the older mice there were signs of restored cognitive function – some of the brain aging was effectively reversed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before we get ahead of ourselves, this has only been demonstrated in mouse models, and there's a lot of work to do before this can be confirmed in people, but the early signs are promising when it comes to keeping older brains in a healthier state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is truly a reversal of impairments," &lt;a href="https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2025/08/430551/protein-slows-aging-brain-and-we-know-how-counter-it"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; biomedical scientist Saul Villeda, from UCSF. "It's much more than merely delaying or preventing symptoms."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further tests on cells in petri dishes showed how FTL1 stopped neurons from growing properly, with neural wires lacking the branching structures that typically provide links between nerve cells and improve brain connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the analysis carried out by the researchers, it seems that increased FTL1 may interfere with the mitochondria that act as the power stations of our cells. Mitochondria are closely &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2016.01.028"&gt;linked to aging&lt;/a&gt; – it's as if they're light bulbs that get dimmer and dimmer as we get older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part of the difficulty in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/humans-age-faster-at-2-specific-times-in-their-life-study-finds"&gt;studying aging&lt;/a&gt; is picking apart which changes in the body are the result of aging, and which changes might be driving it. Through the collection of tests run here, it seems FTL1 is one of those drivers – at least in the hippocampuses of mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future research can now look at how this might be applied to people, and possibly neurodegenerative diseases such as  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="172280" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/breakthrough-parkinsons-gene-discovery-sheds-light-on-evolutionary-origin"&gt;and Parkinson's&lt;/a&gt;. It's also going to be important to find out more about how FTL1 affects the brain, and what the full set of consequences of limiting it might be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're seeing more opportunities to alleviate the worst consequences of old age," &lt;a href="https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2025/08/430551/protein-slows-aging-brain-and-we-know-how-counter-it"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Villeda. "It's a hopeful time to be working on the biology of aging."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s43587-025-00940-z"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Aging&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

The antioxidants in cabbage work to combat inflammation, and assist with weight management. Diabetic patients can safely eat cabbage through raw salads, curries and by fermenting it into sauerkraut or cooking it in soups and stews, because it contains very few carbohydrates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disclaimer: This article contains only information and should not replace professional medical guidance.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Tue, 02 Sep 2025 23:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>在中型试验中，非处方鼻喷雾剂似乎将新冠病毒感染率降低了67% - ARS Technica</title><link>https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/09/otc-nasal-spray-seemed-to-cut-covid-infections-by-67-in-mid-sized-trial/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;h2&gt;COVID context&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like all trials, there are limitations. As mentioned, the number of infections here is small—the impressive efficacy numbers could potentially vanish in a larger trial with more infections. And, while the trial had a high-quality design, it was undertaken in just one location in Germany and mostly involved healthy white women between the ages of 20 and 46, so the findings are not generalizable. The study was also funded by a pharmaceutical company that makes an azelastine nasal spray (though not the one that is sold over the counter in the US).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, with the previous studies, the trial offers some hope that this accessible nasal spray could be used as a viral prophylactic for respiratory seasons in the future. And the results land at a time when access to COVID-19 vaccines—which have firmly proven to be safe and highly effective—has been severely restricted in the US by health secretary and anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it stands now, it appears that only people ages 65 and over, and those at higher risk of COVID-19 will have access to the shots this year, though some aspects of that access are murky, including how people will prove they're at high risk. For healthy children, teens, and adults under 65, there may be no access or extremely limited access. That includes groups that medical experts recommend get vaccinated, namely healthy pregnant people and children ages 6 months to 23 months, both of which are considered at high risk from COVID-19 by medical experts, but not federal guidance under Kennedy. Experts also recommend access for healthy people who have contact with vulnerable people, such as cancer doctors, people who live with immunocompromised family members, and people who work in nursing homes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With limited vaccine access and the normal slew of respiratory viruses on the horizon, a simple nasal spray is an appealing addition to the defenses. The main side effects are fairly minor, including bitter taste in the mouth, nosebleeds, and tiredness.&lt;/p&gt;

Another patient would go to Bronson QuickCare Plus for stitches and treatments for broken bones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No services will change, but accessing the correct form of care is expected to improve, officials said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We recognized that there is some need to better understand the levels of care and where to obtain that care," Padgett told News Channel 3. "So, really, where do you go? What's your best walk-in option? And we recognize that with the different locations, names, it was confusing. So, we listened to that feedback and wanted to help our patients understand how to make this easier for them to make that decision."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cost is an important factor for many patients. According to officials, the walk-ins' new names will help patients better understand how much they'll be billed when they go to the right place for the correct care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We want to do everything we can to help those patients understand their options and what to expect when they receive their bill," Padgett said. "So, launching this advertising campaign, getting in what we're looking, you'll see more of is trying to educate on the different real life health scenarios and where to go to get that care."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patients confused about their billing can contact Bronson Healthcare's 24/7 care advisor line at 269-341-7788.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WWMT</author><pubDate>Tue, 02 Sep 2025 20:56:56 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi6gFBVV95cUxNVmJXcTh4SnZ3LTIxa1BMNlpic3dhZ1VzWjEwa0ZYNHhBYmpWNmlRUnU2eDdWODNzcXJDdlpUQ0ZoSWRXblBKMERrRXZDM25xWHMxMVpnaHhJX0lJY3FYV2FVLTJPTndvc19JM3Ryd0NuekJ6SjBkSER5dmlFQVg2UTk1UkVjUGxSSG5La1hnaURIU2s3akVuc0pMUUQ4ZmVFaHF4amE3VnBxLXkwZVA2MlBhcENsOXEwdmpwcDRRMGNlMzJ0ZkpWRHFMTVg3T1dYUjV2WnBNN0dvQlMtalFCYnQwMzRURmxUQUE</guid></item><item><title>德克萨斯州新冠肺炎疫情飙升：新型“Stratus”变种的注意事项-达拉斯新闻</title><link>https://www.dallasnews.com/news/public-health/2025/09/02/covid-19-surges-in-texas-what-to-know-about-new-stratus-variant/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;Cases of &lt;a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/topic/covid-19/" target="_self" rel="" title="https://www.dallasnews.com/topic/covid-19/"&gt;COVID-19&lt;/a&gt; are spiking in Texas as a new variant spreads across much of the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;COVID variant XFG, nicknamed Stratus, accounts for three-fourths of COVID cases in the U.S., according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/covid/php/variants/variants-and-genomic-surveillance.html" target="_self" rel="" title="https://www.cdc.gov/covid/php/variants/variants-and-genomic-surveillance.html"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;.

Nearly 18% of tests reported to the CDC from Texas, Oklahoma, New Mexico, Arkansas and Louisiana were positive for COVID. A breakdown by individual states was not available, but the positivity rate nationwide is only 11.2%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;Cases are likely far higher because many people test at home and do not report the results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="dmnc_features-cta-social-article-cta-social-module__sI3E3 p-7 mb-6 w-full h-64 border-t border-b border-black flex flex-col gap-7"&gt;&lt;div class="dmnc_features-cta-social-article-cta-social-module__2nIGz flex items-center justify-center gap-x-7"&gt;&lt;div class="dmnc_features-cta-social-article-cta-social-module__VBR0d flex-auto w-full flex flex-col"&gt;&lt;p class="dmnc_features-cta-social-article-cta-social-module__jO6ca secondaryBold secondaryBold-8 text-center"&gt;D-FW Public Health Alerts&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dmnc_features-cta-social-article-cta-social-module__3beff secondaryRoman secondaryRoman-20 text-center text-gray-dark"&gt;Get the latest public health updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="dmnc_features-cta-social-article-cta-social-module__WpP95 flex flex-col gap-7 items-center"&gt;&lt;p class="dmnc_features-cta-social-article-cta-social-module__8MgJa flex flex-wrap text-gray-dark secondaryRoman secondaryRoman-20 text-center justify-center"&gt;By signing up, you agree to our &lt;a class="dmnc_features-cta-social-article-cta-social-module__lU9-l border-b border-gray-dark hover_border-0 focus_border-0 active_border-0" href="/help/terms-of-service/"&gt;Terms of Service&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="dmnc_features-cta-social-article-cta-social-module__lU9-l border-b border-gray-dark hover_border-0 focus_border-0 active_border-0" href="/help/privacy-policy"&gt;Privacy Policy.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;Dallas County Health and Human Services Director &lt;a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/news/2020/04/09/meet-dr-philip-huang-the-lake-highlands-grad-who-is-helping-direct-how-dallas-county-responds-to-the-coronavirus/" target="_self" rel="" title="https://www.dallasnews.com/news/2020/04/09/meet-dr-philip-huang-the-lake-highlands-grad-who-is-helping-direct-how-dallas-county-responds-to-the-coronavirus/"&gt;Dr. Philip Huang&lt;/a&gt; said Tuesday that all five wastewater monitoring sites in Dallas County have shown recent increases in COVID. Because case reporting for COVID is no longer mandated, monitoring largely relies on wastewater testing and lab reports from hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;While the rate of COVID is not near the critical levels seen at the height of the pandemic, Huang said residents should take precautions to prevent spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;“Definitely we’re concerned about it, especially for those populations that are most vulnerable, the older populations and those with underlying health conditions,” Huang said in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;Symptoms of Stratus include congestion, cough, fever, runny nose, fatigue and muscle aches, similar to previous variants. In a &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/25062025_xfg_ire.pdf" target="_self" rel="" title="https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/25062025_xfg_ire.pdf"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; released in June, the World Health Organization says it is monitoring the strain but that it does not appear to pose an additional public health threat compared to other variants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;Stratus recently surpassed the variant Nimbus, better known by its catchier moniker &lt;a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/news/public-health/2025/06/18/new-covid-variant-nimbus-can-cause-razor-blade-throat-what-to-know/" target="_self" rel="" title="https://www.dallasnews.com/news/public-health/2025/06/18/new-covid-variant-nimbus-can-cause-razor-blade-throat-what-to-know/"&gt;“razor blade throat,”&lt;/a&gt; named for the excruciating pain it causes. Patients have likened the sensation to swallowing razor blades or shards of glass. The variant is still spreading, accounting for 14% of cases, according to CDC data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="body-text-header"&gt;Confusion over vaccines&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;The spike in cases comes as widespread confusion about who will be eligible to get a vaccine this fall is growing. In May, U.S. Health Secretary &lt;a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/news/public-health/2025/05/27/covid-vaccines-no-longer-recommended-for-healthy-children-and-pregnant-women/" rel="" title="https://www.dallasnews.com/news/public-health/2025/05/27/covid-vaccines-no-longer-recommended-for-healthy-children-and-pregnant-women/"&gt;Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced&lt;/a&gt; that COVID vaccines are no longer recommended for healthy children and pregnant women — a move questioned by some public health experts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/news/public-health/2025/05/20/new-federal-rules-for-covid-boosters-could-delay-shots-for-healthy-adults-kids/" rel="" title="https://www.dallasnews.com/news/public-health/2025/05/20/new-federal-rules-for-covid-boosters-could-delay-shots-for-healthy-adults-kids/"&gt;Food and Drug Administration provided new requirements&lt;/a&gt; for the shots, saying the vaccine would be available to adults 65 and older and children and younger adults with at least one health problem that puts them at higher risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;Last month, &lt;a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/news/public-health/2025/08/27/fda-approves-updated-covid-19-shots-but-limits-access-for-some-kids-and-adults/" target="_self" rel="" title="https://www.dallasnews.com/news/public-health/2025/08/27/fda-approves-updated-covid-19-shots-but-limits-access-for-some-kids-and-adults/"&gt;U.S. regulators announced that new shots&lt;/a&gt; from Pfizer, Moderna and Novavax are approved for all seniors. But the Food and Drug Administration narrowed its use for younger adults and children to those with at least one high-risk health condition, such as asthma or obesity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/news/public-health/2025/08/20/covid-shots-for-kids-still-recommended-by-us-pediatric-group-in-break-with-cdc/" target="_self" rel="" title="https://www.dallasnews.com/news/public-health/2025/08/20/covid-shots-for-kids-still-recommended-by-us-pediatric-group-in-break-with-cdc/"&gt;American Academy of Pediatrics is still calling for COVID shots &lt;/a&gt;for healthy children beginning at 6 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;Until recently, the U.S. — following guidance from independent experts who advise the CDC — has recommended annual COVID-19 vaccinations for everyone age 6 months and older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;But Kennedy fired every member of that Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices earlier this year. &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/cdc-vaccine-advisers-covid19-rsv-a85baa8a9296fd857af5ce33ae3b6cfd" rel=""&gt;The replacements&lt;/a&gt; he selected have yet to make new recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;Approved COVID vaccines are expected to remain effective against both the Stratus and Nimbus variants, according to the World Health Organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;Dallas County has ordered the updated COVID vaccine but is waiting on delivery from the state, Huang told county commissioners. The county has set up &lt;a href="https://www.dallascounty.org/departments/dchhs/clinical-services/immunization-clinics.php" rel=""&gt;Community Vaccine Clinics&lt;/a&gt; where residents can get COVID, flu and RSV vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Associated Press contributed to this report.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Dallas News</author><pubDate>Tue, 02 Sep 2025 20:53:13 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMivgFBVV95cUxOUU1TbHBXXzdxRURxY3lRLS0tRHFlcHBTa2JHR1h6OUxIbjNScDROaHRLVFJKcVVIX1k5MjhRRWwxOHEyemFkcVRDaXZidVdEbUMyZlpEWWozRHB4bVJNakxYWVJOcmxZVGc1WVl1M09zX2pYV2VoNklnWDRsVFdSTkJxMkR0cTllNkZpMnc3YXhjbEJpZG45TjlTNTBLMENmUGdhQV9SU21nYXpVMWlPM2Z1TnF4SnFBVHNERkhR</guid></item><item><title>医生发现了新的潜在治疗方法，可以治疗让患者双手疼痛感冒的病症-每日邮报</title><link>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15058391/Doctors-discover-new-potential-treatment-condition-leaves-sufferers-hands-painfully-cold.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists have identified a possible cure for a condition that causes chronic cold hands and blights hundreds of millions of people worldwide. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Raynaud's - estimated to impact up to five percent of adults worldwide, including up to 30 million Americans - causes miniature spasms in the blood vessels in the fingers, toes, ears or nose, which in turn cuts off the blood supply. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;It is the body's response to cold temperatures in which smaller arteries that supply blood to the skin constrict dramatically and limit blood supply to certain areas of the body.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sufferers often go numb in these areas as the blood is limited and skin turns white. During severe attacks, Raynaud's can cause extremely painful symptoms, and even painful sores or tissue death (gangrene) in the affected areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While there is no known cure for Raynaud's, doctors at Yubei District People's Hospital in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/china/index.html" id="mol-e071b5b0-8813-11f0-9002-d369dead878b"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; have reported how a minimally invasive surgery could hold the key to keeping symptoms at bay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://amjcaserep.com/abstract/index/idArt/948422"&gt;They detail a case&lt;/a&gt; involving a 67-year-old female patient with a 10-year history of Raynaud's who was admitted to the hospital as her condition worsened and led to gangrene in her right index and middle fingers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To help alleviate the symptoms, the doctors performed a periosteal distraction osteogenesis (PDO), a minimally invasive operation to stimulate the growth of new bone in areas that have sustained bone loss, which can occur in very severe cases of Raynaud's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The procedure involves separating the membrane covering a bone to create a gap. This then allows new bone to form in the gap to repair any bone defects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Raynaud's - estimated to impact up to 5 percent of adults worldwide - causes miniature spasms in the blood vessels, cutting off the blood supply to the fingers and toes (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is often used to treat diabetic foot ulcers and bone loss by promoting the formation of new blood vessels and bone regeneration, leading to improved healing rates and a reduced need for amputations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In this case, the medical team at Yubei District People's Hospital decided to apply the treatment to the female patient's hand to treat her gangrene. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Gangrene occurs when the blood supply to a certain area of the body is interrupted, usually through an injury or infection, and flesh begins to die.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The anonymous case study was also suffering from 'hand ischemia', a condition where blood flow to the hands is reduced or blocked, leading to tissue damage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After undergoing a PDO, the doctors reported that the patient's gangrene 'gradually progressively healed', and the pain in both hands caused by the Raynaud's 'markedly diminished.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is believed a PDO could work for Raynaud's as it promotes blood vessels to heal and this could prevent spasms from occurring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It could also help heal bone loss when the condition progresses. Bone loss associated with Raynaud's is known as acro-osteolysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They concluded: 'This report supports recent studies that have shown the potential for periosteal distraction osteogenesis in the management of cases of severe and irreversible Raynaud disease of the digits.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;More research is being done around Raynaud's and scientists recently discovered a link between the condition and two gene mutations  - one linked to stress and the other to embryo development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In a paper published in the journal Nature Communications, researchers in the UK and &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/germany/index.html" id="mol-3ac79a90-691a-11ee-86b3-2b7100f3870f"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt; carried out the largest genetic study of the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They used electronic medical records from the UK Biobank, a database containing genetic and health information from 439,294 people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team identified 5,147 people diagnosed with Raynaud's and discovered a variation in two genes that predisposed people to the syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One variation was the alpha-2A-adrenergic receptor for adrenaline, or ADRA2A. This is a stress receptor that causes the small blood vessels to contract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption" aria-label="To enrich screen reader interactions, please activate Accessibility in Grammarly extension settings"&gt;It is the body's response to cold temperatures in which smaller arteries that supply blood to the skin constrict dramatically and limit blood supply to certain areas of the body - most commonly the fingers, but sometimes also the toes, ears, and tip of the nose &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Raynaud's affects women more than men, appears most frequently between the ages of 15 to 30 years old and having a parent, sibling or child with the syndrome appears to increase the risk of primary Raynaud's&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The second variation was the IRX1, a type of protein shown to be involved in early embryo development and cellular differentiation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers discovered a potential benefit of using the antidepressant medication mirtazapine to treat Raynaud's, as it inhibits the function of ADRA2A.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, it has not yet been proven safe or effective for this use through clinical trials. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers were able to replicate some of their findings using data from people of British Bangladeshi and Pakistani origin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team also found people with a genetic predisposition to low blood sugar levels have an increased risk of the syndrome, suggesting people should avoid long periods of low blood sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers' findings help to understand, for the first time, why the small vessels react so strongly in patients, even without external stimuli like exposure to cold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There are two main types of Raynaud's: primary and secondary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Primary is the most common and is not a result of a medical condition a person may have and can be so mild a person may not need treatment. It also may go away on its own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;As Raynaud's symptoms first appear, fingers will turn white as blood flow is restricted. As the tissues lose oxygen, fingers will turn a bluish hue.

It is less common than primary but often more severe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Healthcare experts have identified potential lifestyle and medical causes of the disease, which can include smoking, certain medications, connective tissue diseases, diseases of the arteries and carpal tunnel syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They've also identified risk factors, including age, sex, climate and family history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Raynaud's affects women more than men, appears most frequently between the ages of 15 to 30 years old and having a parent, sibling or child with the syndrome appears to increase the risk of primary Raynaud's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As Raynaud's symptoms first appear, fingers will turn white as blood flow is restricted. As the tissues lose oxygen, fingers will turn a bluish hue. As blood flow returns, fingers turn red and people may experience tingling, swelling and/or painful throbbing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As there is no cure or current treatment for the syndrome, the goal is to manage the symptoms by reducing their frequency and severity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;mol-permabox id="mol-e8d93a50-8810-11f0-9002-d369dead878b"&gt;&lt;div class=" mol-factbox health art-ins" data-version="2" id="mol-f37642f0-0dac-11e8-8d90-317dbab06c13" data-permabox-url="/news/fb-5372739/What-Raynauds-disease.html"&gt;&lt;div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"&gt; &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Raynaud's condition, triggered by drops in temperature or an increase in stress, causes the blood vessels in the fingers and toes contract, cutting off blood supply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It can also affect the tiny arteries in the nose, ears and tongue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Typically, Raynaud's causes the fingers or toes to turn white and numb.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Then, as the blood flow returns, they turn blue and eventually red, accompanied by a burning sensation. Attacks can last from a few minutes to an hour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nine out of ten cases are in women, with most sufferers having their first attack before the age of 40.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Although attacks peak in the cold winter months, symptoms can be triggered by everyday tasks such as taking food out of the freezer, air conditioning, or even stress — all of which cause blood vessels to contract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Most patients can cope by wrapping up warm, although some develop painful weeping ulcers, which can become infected. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Although Raynaud's is common, only a small number of patients go on to develop a more serious connective tissue disease called scleroderma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It can cause disability and can be life-threatening, which is why it is important to be diagnosed early on so any complications of the condition can be properly treated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Raynaud's has a straightforward treatment and can be temporarily cured with a drug called nifedipine which relaxes the muscles of your heart and blood vessels and lowers blood pressure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/mol-permabox&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Tue, 02 Sep 2025 20:51:50 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>彭萨科拉的新高血压诊所强调改变生活方式以改善心脏健康- WEAR-TV</title><link>https://weartv.com/news/local/new-hypertension-clinic-in-pensacola-emphasizes-lifestyle-changes-for-better-heart-health</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="StoryText-module_storyText__FWhP"&gt;&lt;p&gt;PENSACOLA, Fla. -- High blood pressure can be deadly. Studies estimate half of all adults in the United States suffer from it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors Madison Gilbert and Josie Blasius are ambulatory care pharmacists. They run the new hypertension clinic at Ascension Sacred Heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every day, they treat patients with high blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the first time since 2017, the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology are telling doctors to switch things up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Updated guidelines emphasize earlier treatment and lifestyle modification.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Weight management, having a healthy BMI, another big focus is sodium reduction," Dr. Gilbert said. "And then another thing we look at is also anywhere we can limit other outside factors -- smoking, caffeine, other medications that may also increase your blood pressure."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also emphasize natural approaches to lowering blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Focusing on those fruits and veggies, lean proteins, a healthy diet and then getting an exercise as well," Dr. Blasius said. "And so down the line this will help decrease their overall pill burden and and help with maybe a more natural blood pressure lowering for them in the future."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The American Heart Association's blood pressure chart is the same as it was in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But they now advise doctors to use a new screening tool with patients. It's called "prevent."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Takes into account blood pressure, smoking history, age, and cholesterol," Dr. Gilbert said. "And also really cool, it adds on your zip code. So it's a potential to look at social determinants of health.

In mice, blocking an immune “alarm” pathway reduced these cells and improved mood-related behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings highlight how stress reshapes the brain’s immune environment and suggest why one-third of patients may not benefit from current antidepressants. This immune link could provide biomarkers for tailored treatments and help explain depression’s overlap with neurological conditions like stroke and Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Immune Link:&lt;/strong&gt; Chronic stress triggers neutrophils from skull bone marrow to enter the brain’s meninges, influencing mood.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pathway Identified:&lt;/strong&gt; Blocking type I interferon signaling reduced brain neutrophils and depressive behaviors in mice.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Treatment Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; Findings could guide new immune-targeted therapies for depression resistant to standard drugs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Cambridge&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Immune cells released from bone marrow in the skull in response to chronic stress and adversity could play a key role in symptoms of depression and anxiety, say researchers.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The discovery – found in a study in mice – sheds light on the role that inflammation can play in mood disorders and could help in the search for new treatments, in particular for those individuals for whom current treatments are ineffective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around 1 billion people will be diagnosed with a mood disorder such as depression or anxiety at some point in their life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While there may be many underlying causes, chronic inflammation – when the body’s immune system stays active for a long time, even when there is no infection or injury to fight – has been linked to depression. This suggests that the immune system may play an important role in the development of mood disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous studies have highlighted how high levels of an immune cell known as a neutrophil, a type of white blood cell, are linked to the severity of depression. But how neutrophils contribute to symptoms of depression is currently unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In research published today in &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;, a team led by scientists at the University of Cambridge, UK, and the National Institute of Mental Health, USA, tested a hypothesis that chronic stress can lead to the release of neutrophils from bone marrow in the skull.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These cells then collect in the meninges – membranes that cover and protect your brain and spinal cord – and contribute to symptoms of depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As it is not possible to test this hypothesis in humans, the team used mice exposed to chronic social stress. In this experiment, an ‘intruder’ mouse is introduced into the home cage of an aggressive resident mouse. The two have brief daily physical interactions and can otherwise see, smell, and hear each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that prolonged exposure to this stressful environment led to a noticeable increase in levels of neutrophils in the meninges, and that this was linked to signs of depressive behaviour in the mice. Even after the stress ended, the neutrophils lasted longer in the meninges than they did in the blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysis confirmed the researchers’ hypothesis that the meningeal neutrophils – which appeared subtly different from those found in the blood – originated in the skull.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further analysis suggested that long-term stress triggered a type of immune system ‘alarm warning’ known as type I interferon signalling in the neutrophils. Blocking this pathway – in effect, switching off the alarm – reduced the number of neutrophils in the meninges and improved behaviour in the depressed mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This pathway has previously been linked to depression – type 1 interferons are used to treat patients with hepatitis C, for example, but a known side effect of the medication is that it can cause severe depression during treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Stacey Kigar from the Department of Medicine at the University of Cambridge said: “Our work helps explain how chronic stress can lead to lasting changes in the brain’s immune environment, potentially contributing to depression. It also opens the door to possible new treatments that target the immune system rather than just brain chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s a significant proportion of people for whom antidepressants don’t work, possibly as many as one in three patients. If we can figure out what’s happening with the immune system, we may be able to alleviate or reduce depressive symptoms.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reason why there are high levels of neutrophils in the meninges is unclear. One explanation could be that they are recruited by microglia, a type of immune cell unique to the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another possible explanation is that chronic stress may cause microhaemorrhages, tiny leaks in brain blood vessels, and that neutrophils – the body’s ‘first responders’ – arrive to fix the damage and prevent any further damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These neutrophils then become more rigid, possibly getting stuck in brain capillaries and causing further inflammation in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Mary-Ellen Lynall from the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Cambridge said: “We’ve long known that something is different about how neutrophils behave after stressful events, or during depression, but we didn’t know what these neutrophils were doing, where they were going, or how they might be affecting the brain and mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings show that these ‘first responder’ immune cells leave the skull bone marrow and travel to the brain, where they can influence mood and behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Most people will have experienced how our immune systems can drive short-lived depression-like symptoms. When we are sick, for example with a cold or flu, we often lack energy and appetite, sleep more and withdraw from social contact. If the immune system is always in a heightened, pro-inflammatory state, it shouldn’t be too surprising if we experience longer-term problems with our mood.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings could provide a useful signature, or ‘biomarker’, to help identify those patients whose mood disorders are related to inflammation. This could help in the search for better treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, a clinical trial of a potential new drug that targets inflammation of the brain in depression might appear to fail if trialled on a general cohort of people with depression, whereas using the biomarker to identify individuals whose depression is linked to inflammation could increase the likelihood of the trial succeeding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings may also help explain why depression is a symptom common in other neurological disorders such as stroke and Alzheimer’s disease, as it may be the case that neutrophils are being released in response to the damage to the brain seen in these conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it may also explain why depression is itself a risk factor for dementia in later life, if neutrophils can themselves trigger damage to brain cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;The research was funded by the National Institute of Mental Health, Medical Research Council and National Institute for Health and Care Research Cambridge Biomedical Research Centre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this neuroscience and depression research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#d7b4a5b6beb0f9b5a5beb2a5bbb2ae97b6b3babeb9f9b4b6baf9b6b4f9a2bc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Craig Brierley&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://cam.ac.uk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Cambridge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Craig Brierley – University of Cambridge&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-62840-5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Chronic social defeat stress induces meningeal neutrophilia via type I interferon signaling in male mice&lt;/a&gt;” by Stacey Kigar et al. &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chronic social defeat stress induces meningeal neutrophilia via type I interferon signaling in male mice&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inflammation is increasingly recognized as a risk factor for psychiatric disorders.

Transcriptional analysis suggests CSD increases type I interferon (IFN-I) signaling in meningeal neutrophils.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blocking this pathway via the IFN-I receptor (IFNAR) protects against the negative behavioral effects of CSD stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our identification of IFN-I signaling as a putative mediator of meningeal neutrophil recruitment may facilitlate development of new therapies for stress-related disorders.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 02 Sep 2025 20:15:10 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMic0FVX3lxTE1DWnFUckhEbkFLWGNIOEYzZF9hUmdDNFJfdjVhd1ZYNTVlcXJCaDNUaTVqMWdKalUzbEVtYkZPelhSWnVHVkdyV3EyN0dZdkRNcks1aEVMcXAxRGNrLThHQXdodVVIckNlQnNfNV8wbnRBOWs</guid></item><item><title>植物性营养素可以提高免疫细胞对抗癌症的能力- Medical Xpress</title><link>https://medicalxpress.com/news/2025-09-based-nutrient-boost-immune-cells.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="mt-4 article-main"&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a new study, researchers from the University of Chicago discovered that zeaxanthin, a plant-derived carotenoid best known for protecting vision, may also act as an immune-boosting compound by strengthening the cancer-fighting activity of immune cells. The findings, which are published in &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports-medicine/fulltext/S2666-3791(25)00397-0" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Cell Reports Medicine&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, highlight the potential of zeaxanthin as a widely available supplement to improve the effectiveness of cancer immunotherapies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;"We were surprised to find that zeaxanthin, already known for its role in &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/eye+health/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;eye health&lt;/a&gt;, has a completely new function in boosting anti-tumor immunity," said Jing Chen, Ph.D., Janet Davison Rowley Distinguished Service Professor of Medicine and senior author of the study. "Our study shows that a simple dietary nutrient could complement and strengthen advanced &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/cancer/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; treatments like immunotherapy."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How does this nutrient work?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study builds on years of work by Chen's lab to better understand how nutrients influence the immune system. By screening a large blood nutrient library, the team identified zeaxanthin as a compound that directly enhances the activity of CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells, a crucial type of immune cell that kills &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/tumor+cells/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;tumor cells&lt;/a&gt;. These cells rely on a &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/molecular+structure/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;molecular structure&lt;/a&gt; called the T-cell receptor (TCR) to recognize and destroy abnormal cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that zeaxanthin stabilizes and strengthens the formation of TCR complex on CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells upon interacting with the cancer cells. This, in turn, triggers more robust intracellular signaling that boosts T-cell activation, cytokine production, and tumor-killing capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;h2&gt;Zeaxanthin improves immunotherapy effects&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In mouse models, dietary supplementation with zeaxanthin slowed tumor growth. Importantly, when combined with immune checkpoint inhibitors—a type of immunotherapy that has transformed cancer treatment in recent years—zeaxanthin significantly enhanced anti-tumor effects compared to immunotherapy alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To extend the findings, the researchers tested human T cells engineered to recognize specific tumor antigens and found that zeaxanthin treatment improved these cells' ability to kill melanoma, multiple myeloma, and glioblastoma cells in laboratory experiments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our data show that zeaxanthin improves both natural and engineered T-cell responses, which suggests high translational potential for patients undergoing immunotherapies," Chen said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A safe and accessible candidate&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zeaxanthin is sold as an over-the-counter supplement for eye health, and is naturally found in vegetables like orange peppers, spinach, and kale. It's inexpensive, widely available, well-tolerated and, most importantly, its safety profile is known—which means it can be safely tested as an adjunct to cancer therapies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study also reinforces the importance of a balanced diet. In their previous research, Chen's group discovered that &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2023-11-nutrient-beef-dairy-immune-response.html"&gt;trans-vaccenic acid (TVA), a fatty acid derived from dairy and meat&lt;/a&gt;, also boosts T-cell activity—but through a different mechanism. Together, the findings suggest that nutrients from both plant and animal sources may provide complementary benefits to immune health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Clinical applications of zeaxanthin&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the results are promising, the researchers emphasize that the work is still at an early stage. Most of the findings come from laboratory experiments and animal studies. Thus, &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/clinical+trials/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; will be needed to determine whether &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/zeaxanthin/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;zeaxanthin&lt;/a&gt; supplements can improve outcomes for cancer patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our findings open a new field of nutritional immunology that looks at how specific dietary components interact with the immune system at the molecular level," Chen said. "With more research, we may discover natural compounds that make today's cancer therapies more effective and accessible."&lt;/p&gt;

They found an inverted U-shaped lifespan trajectory, with brain activity rising through adolescence, peaking between ages 27 and 36, and then gradually declining.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This pattern reflects peak cognitive efficiency in adulthood and highlights the importance of maintaining brain health later in life. The findings deepen our understanding of brain development and aging, offering a scientific foundation for age-tailored cognitive training and brain health strategies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inverted U-Shape:&lt;/strong&gt; Cognitive control brain activity peaks in early adulthood, then declines with age.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Peak Interval:&lt;/strong&gt; Ages 27–36 represent the highest efficiency in focus and cognitive flexibility.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brain Health Implications:&lt;/strong&gt; Results underscore the need for targeted cognitive support in midlife to slow decline.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Science China Press&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cognitive control refers to the cognitive process through which individuals regulate attention, thought, and action to achieve specific goals, allowing them to focus on objectives while excluding distractions. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, maintaining concentration on reading in a library where people are conversing relies heavily on the cognitive control’s regulation of attention. In adults, cognitive control abilities typically remain at a high level, resulting in organized behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, children and older adults may experience behavioral regulation difficulties due to the immature or declining state of their cognitive control systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the patterns of cognitive and behavioral changes related to cognitive control have been well established and serve as diagnostic criteria for development- and aging-related diseases, systematic research on the corresponding brain activities’ changes with age remains limited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revealing the lifespan trajectories of brain activity associated with cognitive control could deepen our understanding of the mechanisms underlying brain development and aging and provide theoretical support for customized cognitive training programs based on regional brain activity characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary of Findings&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study collected 139 neuroimaging studies related to cognitive conflict tasks (e.g., judging the direction of the center arrow in ←←→←← while ignoring the arrows on both sides), encompassing 3,765 participants aged 5 to 85 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through systematic meta-analysis using seed-based effect size mapping (SDM), generalized additive models (GAM), and model comparison methods, researchers were able to construct the lifespan trajectory of brain activities associated with cognitive control for the first time (see Image).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The core finding revealed a significant inverted U-shaped lifespan developmental trajectory, where brain activity gradually increases during childhood and adolescence, peaks during adulthood, and slowly declines in later life. The GAM-fitted peak age was found to be between 27 and 36 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Model comparisons indicated that the optimal fitting model for these brain regions was the square root model, rather than the commonly used quadratic function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notably, the researchers did not observe other potential trajectory patterns, such as linear changes or an increase-then-stable, underscoring the dominance of the inverted U-shape in the development of cognitive control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, it was found that adolescents and older adults exhibited more pronounced lateralization of brain function compared to young and middle-aged adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous studies have revealed an inverted U-shaped developmental trajectory of cognitive control ability at the behavioral level. This study further elucidates the neural basis of this trajectory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings indicate that the peak intervals of brain functions related to cognitive control occur between 27 and 36 years, aligning closely with the commonly defined middle adulthood stage (young adult phase).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This period coincides with the peak of individual intellectual maturity and overall cognitive ability, providing a scientific explanation for the high social productivity and creativity exhibited by humans during this phase from a neural mechanism perspective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notably, the gradual decline in brain function following this peak period suggests the need to prioritize the maintenance and exercise of brain function during middle adulthood to mitigate potential cognitive decline associated with aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Therefore, this study not only deepens our understanding of the lifespan developmental patterns of the neural mechanisms underlying human cognitive control but also provides critical theoretical support for formulating targeted brain health promotion strategies and optimizing cognitive functions across different age groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Zhenghan Li from Hangzhou Normal University is the first author of the article, while Dr. Guochun Yang from the Guangdong Intelligent Science and Technology Research Institute serves as the corresponding author.

Understanding its trajectory across the lifespan is crucial for optimizing cognitive function throughout life, particularly during periods of rapid development and decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While existing studies have revealed an inverted U-shaped trajectory of cognitive control in both behavioral and anatomical domains, the age-related changes in functional brain activities remain poorly understood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To bridge this gap, we conducted a comprehensive meta-analysis of 139 neuroimaging studies using conflict tasks, encompassing 3765 participants aged 5 to 85 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We adopted the seed-based d mapping (SDM), generalized additive model (GAM), and model comparison approaches to investigate age-related changes in brain activities to characterize the lifespan trajectories of cognitive control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our analyses revealed two key findings: (1) The predominant lifespan trajectory is inverted U-shaped, rising from childhood to peak in young adulthood (between 27 and 36 years) before declining in later adulthood; (2) Both the youth and the elderly show weaker brain activities and greater left laterality than young adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results collectively reveal the lifespan trajectories of cognitive control, highlighting systematic fluctuations in brain activities with age.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 02 Sep 2025 20:03:04 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifEFVX3lxTE1EbWNud3ExQXQzcGNfWkdzOTEzV2dXb3BtaFJRdjUya0VXeGs4WUhmWDlxWDlRMDFpM3RQWGJwWE8zd2VhVFc4Zi1kV013QkZXV1BSM3dDc0lrQTBMN1pXZksxUHJva0Y4bXpuVGdLLVNxWkY2dXd5a3RNRzk</guid></item><item><title>“fibermaxxing”的危险......专家揭示了饮食趋势如何增加患癌症的风险-每日邮报</title><link>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15058047/dangers-fibermaxxing-experts-warn-risk-cancer.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's no secret that America has a fiber problem.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Data from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) suggests about 95 percent of Americans don't get the federally recommended amount of fiber in a day from foods like berries, apples, broccoli and lentils.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Fiber is crucial for regulating healthy digestion. It helps bulk up stools to make them easier to pass, promoting regular bowel movements. It also slows gastric emptying, which leads to longer feelings of fullness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the shorter term, not getting at least 21 to 38 grams of daily fiber, depending on age and sex, can lead to constipation, bloating, cramping and gas. But over time, low fiber has been linked to chronic inflammation, &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/diabetes/index.html" id="mol-51e2f670-8808-11f0-9c1a-d73045d9f333"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, heart disease and colon &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-51e28140-8808-11f0-9c1a-d73045d9f333"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, health experts are now sounding the alarm over getting too much fiber.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Social media users are promoting 'fibermaxxing,' or loading up on large amounts of fiber, particularly from the plethora of emerging sodas and snacks high in the nutrient. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dietitians and physicians told DailyMail.com that while fiber is essential for maintaining healthy digestion, too much can lead to 'gastrointestinal distress,' including constipation, bloating, gas and abdominal pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And in the long term, getting upwards of 50 grams per day may lead to a rare chance of intestinal blockages. Emerging research also shows certain kinds of fiber like inulin, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14554801/healthy-soda-alternatives-celebrities-cancer-poppi-olipop.html"&gt;found in high-fiber drinks like Poppi&lt;/a&gt;, may increase the risk of liver cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;About 95 percent of Americans don't get enough fiber-rich foods like broccoli and whole grains. But experts have warned of the dangers of eating too much (stock image) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Paris Hilton is among Poppi's high profile fans. The soda is high in inulin, a type of fiber that some studies have linked to cancer &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Candace Pumper, a registered dietitian at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, told DailyMail.com: 'Consuming adequate fiber within established guidelines in our diet is important for optimal health and bodily function. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Dietary fiber provides many functional benefits – such as adding bulk to stool, which is important for promoting regular bowel movements and preventing constipation – and physiological benefits through fermentation by the gut microbiome.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These effects have been shown to lower cholesterol, regulate blood sugar, promote satiety and reduce inflammation, Pumper said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Regulating these functions, she noted, is associated 'with a decreased risk of heart disease, type 2 diabetes, obesity, and colorectal cancers.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She added: 'Most Americans are not meeting the recommended daily amount of dietary fiber, making its optimization an important health strategy for reducing their risk.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To help fill these gaps, snacks and sodas high in fiber have gained popularity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Poppi and Olipop, for instance, contain between three to nine grams of inulin, a form of dietary fiber found naturally in some plants chicory root, garlic, onions, and Jerusalem artichoke. It is also considered a fructan, a type of prebiotic, meaning it can help feed 'good' bacteria in the gut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Gut bacteria convert inulin and other prebiotics into short-chain fatty acids, which can help strengthen the gut's protective lining and reduce inflammation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, a growing body of research suggests repeated inulin consumption could lead to long-term health issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Andrew Gewirtz, a biomedical science professor at Georgia State University, &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://news.gsu.edu/2018/10/18/adding-refined-fiber-to-processed-food-could-have-negative-health-effects-study-finds/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"&gt;conducted a 2018 study&lt;/a&gt; that found mice who had inulin added to their diets developed jaundice, a sign of liver failure. After six months, they showed signs of liver cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And a &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S277257232300198X"&gt;2024 case study&lt;/a&gt; authored by the same team suggested inulin 'may be carcinogenic.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Olipop is one of the most popular fiber-rich soda brands, generating $500million in sales last year&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The man in the case study had his first colonoscopy to screen for colon cancer at age 56, which came back normal. But seven years later, another screening showed a malignant tumor at the start of his large intestine. The disease had also spread to his lymph nodes.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now in his 60s, the man had no known colon cancer risk factors like obesity, alcohol use, or family history, and his diet was rich in organic, home-grown vegetables. His only lifestyle change in the time between screenings was adding four grams of inulin powder daily to his diet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Gena Hamshaw, a registered dietitian at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City, told DailyMail.com: 'While inulin in sodas may favor a healthy balance of intestinal flora, it doesn’t offer all of the benefits of other types of fiber, such as the inhibition of cholesterol absorption that’s associated with soluble fiber. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It’s important to remember that there are different types of fiber, each with benefits, and the best means of reaping all of their benefits is to eat a varied diet.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Drinking several of these sodas could quickly increase overall fiber consumption. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;DailyMail.com &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14554801/healthy-soda-alternatives-celebrities-cancer-poppi-olipop.html"&gt;previously reached out&lt;/a&gt; to Poppi and Olipop regarding these claims but did not hear back. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Olipop &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.axios.com/2025/03/29/poppi-olipop-healthy-soda-warning"&gt;told Axios&lt;/a&gt; in a March statement: 'Like any fiber, inulin may cause temporary digestive discomfort as the body adjusts to increased fiber intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'That's why both nutrition experts and OLIPOP recommend starting with one can and gradually increasing over time.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Brea Lofton, a registered dietitian nutritionist at health and wellness company Lumen, told this website that while it 'is undoubted that fiber can be beneficial for a number of reasons,' consuming excessive amounts, 'especially when you increase your fiber intake too quickly, can lead to gastrointestinal distress.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Experts told DailyMail.com to get a variety of fiber sources instead of relying on one or two from processed foods (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Pumper said: 'Sudden increases in fiber or consuming too much fiber, whether above the recommended daily amount or all at once, may cause bloating, gas, and abdominal discomfort. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Overdoing it can also cause constipation and impair nutrient absorption.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is because the gut microbiome needs time to adjust to increased fiber if someone generally consumes under the recommended amount.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Hamshaw told this website that while rare, 'an intestinal blockage could be the result of extremely high fiber intake, especially without good hydration and enough chewing of food.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In large quantities and without enough water to help with absorption, undigested fiber can form a dense mass called a bezoar. This risk is highest in people with digestive conditions like Crohn's disease or previous bowel surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Another long-term concern is that excessive fiber intake may inhibit absorption of important minerals, including iron, zinc, and calcium,' Hamshaw said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said while there is no firm limit, getting upwards of 50 grams of fiber per day is enough to cause complications. Dr Omer Awan, a medical professor at the University of Maryland with a specialization in epidemiology, meanwhile told DailyMail.com the limit might be closer to 70 grams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Hamshaw told this website: 'It's also good to keep in mind that the plant foods with the most dietary fiber, including fruits, vegetables, seeds, grains, and nuts, are typically nutrient-dense foods. These foods offer phytonutrients, minerals, and vitamins as well as dietary fiber. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Fiber-fortified snacks and sodas can definitely be part of a healthful dietary pattern. But if maximizing nutrient intake is your goal, then the best strategy is to favor naturally occurring fiber that’s found in otherwise nutritious foods.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

They'd rather not think about the next one.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But for Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy (CIDRAP) Director Michael Osterholm, PhD, MPH, the mistakes that were made during the emergency phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the lessons learned, provide an opportunity to explore how a future pandemic caused by an even deadlier virus than SARS-CoV-2 could play out.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Big One: How We Must Prepare for Future Deadly Pandemics&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;, Osterholm and his co-author and longtime collaborator Mark Olshaker weave together two threads. One is an assessment of how the COVID-19 pandemic was handled by the US government and public health agencies like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Osterholm says it's the culmination of a project that began early on in the pandemic, when he and Olshaker recognized that many mistakes were being made and they authored several op-eds that were critical of the federal response.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"At that point, we realized we really needed to write a book about this pandemic when it finally ends, and what lessons should be learned," he says in an upcoming episode of the Osterholm Update podcast.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Along the way, Osterholm and Olshaker address many of the most prominent controversies that have come to dominate the national discussion about the pandemic, from lockdowns and school closures to communications failures and the debates over masking and vaccine mandates. The aim was not just to highlight the mistakes or place blame, but to understand the lessons that can be drawn from those mistakes and then applied to the next pandemic.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Some of the problems we collectively encountered were structural, and not quick or easy to solve," Osterholm and Olshaker write. "But they all have to be addressed if we are to have a chance of triumphing in the microbe wars."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;'A great mystery story'&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The next pandemic is the focus of the other strand of the book, a "thought experiment" developed by Osterholm and Olshaker that traces the path of a hypothetical virus that originates in Somalia, soon jumps to a nearby refugee camp in Kenya, and then spreads like wildfire around the globe. The virus, eventually labeled SARS-CoV-3, combines the infectiousness of SARS-CoV-2 with the lethality of the original SARS virus (which caused a global outbreak in 2003) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) virus.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"What would happen if you had a virus that had the capacity to infect like COVID, but the ability to kill like MERS or SARS?" asks Osterholm, who is also a Regents Professor and the McKnight Presidential Endowed Chair in Public Health at the University of Minnesota. "And believe it or not, we have now found viruses—in bats in caves in China—that have that construct. So this is not just science fiction; we actually know these viruses exist."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The scenario describes the impact of the virus as it spreads and causes havoc around the globe, but it also delves into the response from US and global officials, the public reaction, and the role of the media. For many readers, it might feel like being transported back to early 2020.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;What would happen if you had a virus that had the capacity to infect like COVID, but the ability to kill like MERS or SARS?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Olshaker says they wanted to create a "nightmare scenario" that was realistic, scientifically plausible, not over-the-top, and gripping. He compares it to the true crime books he's co-authored.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"What we have here is great mystery story, which is what public health really is, as well as high technological drama," he says.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/michael-t-osterholm-phd-mph/the-big-one/9780316258340/?lens=little-brown-spark"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Big One: How We Must Prepare for Future Deadly Pandemics&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; is out today.

              &lt;p&gt;A common treatment given after heart attacks may not be worthwhile for a large segment of the population. New trial data finds that most people who suffer a heart attack do not benefit from taking beta-blockers afterward.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A large international team of researchers conducted the trial, which compared the outcomes of nearly 10,000 heart attack patients who were either given beta-blocker therapy or not.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;aside class="pullquote text-center"&gt;“This trial will reshape all international clinical guidelines.”&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;On average, people with preserved heart function given beta-blockers were no less likely to die or to experience a second heart attack than those not given beta-blockers, the researchers found. Secondary data also showed that women might actually face a higher risk of complications from taking these medications.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“This trial will reshape all international clinical guidelines,” said senior study author Valentin Fuster, president of Mount Sinai Fuster Heart Hospital, in a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/08/250831010539.htm"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; from Mount Sinai.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Why doctors use beta-blockers&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;For more than 40 years, &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-pressure/in-depth/beta-blockers/art-20044522"&gt;beta-blockers&lt;/a&gt; have been a key aspect of treating and managing cardiovascular disease. These drugs block the effects of adrenaline on the body’s beta-receptors, which then reduces heart rate and lowers blood pressure (among other bodily changes). They’re often used to reduce stress on a badly damaged heart following a heart attack (myocardial infarction), in theory lowering the risk of a second heart attack or other cardiovascular issues.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But heart medicine has evolved greatly since the arrival of the first beta-blockers in the 1960s. New treatments and improved knowledge have made it easier for doctors to prevent these infarctions from causing as much damage to the heart as before. And that’s led some researchers to wonder whether beta-blockers should still be considered a front-line treatment following heart attacks, including the team behind this large new trial.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;A therapy in need of a reboot&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The team’s trial, named REBOOT, involved roughly 8,500 people. The patients had all experienced relatively mild heart attacks and appeared to have a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) above 40%. LVEF measures how well our left ventricle (the main pumping chamber) pumps out blood. A healthy LVEF is typically considered above 51%, while slightly reduced function is between 40% and 50%.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Half of the patients were randomized to receive beta-blockers after being discharged from the hospital, while the other half received none. Both groups were then tracked for several years (median length 3.7 years).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;By the study’s end, there wasn’t any significant difference in outcomes between the two groups. Deaths (from any cause), secondary heart attacks, and hospitalizations from heart failure occurred just as often in the beta-blocker group as they did in the control group.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Since these kinds of heart attacks represent the majority of cases (roughly 80%) today, the team’s findings—&lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2504735"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; over the weekend in the New England Journal of Medicine—indicate that beta-blockers shouldn’t be a standard treatment for most heart attack patients, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Harmful for some, useful for others&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;While beta-blocker therapy may be worthless for most male heart attack patients, it could be actively dangerous to women in particular.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In a secondary analysis of the REBOOT results, &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/advance-article/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehaf673/8243876"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in the European Heart Journal, women on beta-blockers had higher rates of heart attacks, hospitalization, and death than women not on the drug. On closer inspection, this added risk was only seen in women who maintained normal heart function (LVEF above 50%). Though it’s not entirely clear why only women might experience this risk, studies have found that heart attacks can &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/news/2024/02/09/the-slowly-evolving-truth-about-heart-disease-and-women#:~:text=As%20for%20better,in%20their%20arteries."&gt;present differently&lt;/a&gt; in women compared to men and cause differing symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The findings should better optimize the long-term care of heart attack patients, who are often already prescribed multiple medications to keep their cardiovascular health in check. “These results will help streamline treatment, reduce side effects, and improve quality of life for thousands of patients every year,” said lead author Borja Ibáñez, scientific director of Spain’s National Center for Cardiovascular Research (CNIC), in a statement.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That said, the REBOOT trial won’t bury beta-blockers for good. The drugs may still help prevent complications in people with severe heart attacks and are &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/22318-beta-blockers"&gt;widely used&lt;/a&gt; for other conditions, including congestive heart failure, migraines, and even performance anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;
              
                          &lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="108" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmf2vr8sw000o3b7abepiwsjm@published"&gt;I’m a straight, cis female. My whole adult life, vaginal sex has always been sort of meh to me. I love the foreplay, my clitoris is very sensitive, and I get easily turned on. But when it comes to the actual intercourse part, it’s always felt like nothing at best and vaguely painful at worst. I’ve seen doctors, but the symptoms of conditions like vaginismus and vulvodynia don’t really match mine. It kind of just feels like I have no nerve endings in there at all. I’ve also gone to bed with enough men to know it’s not just a bad partner. Toys do nothing for me either.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="13" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmf2vr8w8000p3b7atmv99318@published"&gt;A few months ago, my boyfriend and I decided to try something new.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="125" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmf2wpz4j005y3b7apvy06pmb@published"&gt;We had anal sex. I’d always been resistant to anal because I have some digestive issues, but wanted to try it, so we did, and WOW. It’s like whatever nerves are missing from my vagina got put in the back door instead. I finally understood what people love about penetrative sex, and it didn’t hurt at all. I’ve never had an orgasm just from penetration before until that night, when I had like three or four in a row without touching my clit at all. It’s not just the orgasm part; it’s just the feeling of anything at all pleasurable from penetration. It got even better the deeper my partner went (whereas in regular PIV, I tend to have less sensation the deeper it is).&lt;/p&gt;

The digestive issues have not improved (and actually have worsened). And I don’t think my boyfriend wants to do anal every single time we have sex (is that even healthy?). Why does anal sex feel so good for me compared to vaginal sex? Everything I’ve seen online says even the cis females who enjoy anal and find that it feels good still prefer vaginal sex.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;blockquote data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-blockquote/instances/cmf2y1b6v006n3b7awp4rky2i@published" class="slate-blockquote" data-word-count="319"&gt;
  &lt;div data-editable="text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The good news is, for some people, anal sex can definitely be a pleasurable alternative. The anus and rectum have different nerve endings and innervation patterns compared to the vagina, which can translate into entirely different sensations. The so-called “A-spot” (anterior fornix) and surrounding nerve-rich tissue can create intense stimulation and, for many, powerful orgasms. Pleasure here often comes down to anatomy, muscle relaxation, and pacing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The anal canal is surrounded by muscles that need to be relaxed, and its skin is thinner and more delicate, which means lubrication, patience, and gradual progression are absolutely necessary. This is where tools like anal dilators (such as &lt;a href="https://futuremethod.com/products/glass-anal-dilator-set"&gt;glass&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://futuremethod.com/products/silicone-anal-dilator-set"&gt;silicone&lt;/a&gt; sets, like the ones I developed for Future Method) can help train both body and mind. Starting small, pre-lubricating, and working up in size conditions the muscles and tissue to stretch comfortably. Many people also find that experimenting with different positions, depth, and thrusting styles during toy play helps them discover what feels good while maintaining control over the experience. I’m a huge advocate of personal exploration because it allows people to see what they like (and don’t like) without the pressure of having to perform for someone else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A common worry is the digestive system “getting in the way.” The reality is that with everyday anal play, the rectum is usually clear of stool. Good digestive health makes a huge difference, such as adequate dietary fiber, probiotics, and hydration to support regularity and reduce the likelihood of issues. If someone chooses to prepare ahead of time, I recommend douching safely; over-cleansing with plain water, harsh soaps, or even store-bought enemas can damage tissue and disrupt the microbiome. That’s why I developed an &lt;a href="https://futuremethod.com/products/anal-douche-kit"&gt;isotonic cleansing solution&lt;/a&gt; at Future Method, designed to be body-compatible, non-irritating, and effective without stripping natural defenses. I know people crave confidence when it comes to anal play, so why not have a body-safe solution to help you achieve that?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Here’s what Dr. Goldstein recommends: “For vaginal pain: a gynecologist trained in sexual pain disorders, for anal health concerns: a proctological surgeon, and for pelvic floor dysfunction or muscle-related pain: a pelvic floor physical therapist,” adding that “each of these specialists brings a different perspective, and ideally, they work together to ensure a holistic plan.”&lt;/p&gt;

His preferences will likely be a balance between how he feels about the act itself and how he feels about your pleasure, and he’s the only person who can say, with certainty, what his stance is.&lt;/p&gt;

So be prepared for some to shrug or mention that they’ve encountered squirters previously, for others to fetishize you, for still more to have LOTS of questions, and also for a few to immediately thank you for your time and permanently excuse themselves. If you’re happy to be glorified for something your body does by happenstance, go forth and enjoy, because you will find plenty of salivating supplicants. If you’re willing to give a personal Q&amp;amp;A session to satiate someone’s curiosity, again, great. If you’re not OK with either of those scenarios, always know that you get to have boundaries, and you get to decide how you’re willing to be treated in hook-ups and relationships. And you get to make those choices from date to date, depending on the context of the person you’re interacting with and how you’re feeling that day.&lt;/p&gt;

The place we’ve rented has a private hot tub, so my husband and I finally got to realize our fantasy of skinny dipping together. While we were in the hot tub, I rediscovered an old favorite of mine. When I was a kid, I used to swim competitively, so I spent a lot of time in the pool. When I was very young, I accidentally discovered that the pool jet against my clit felt amazing. When I got a little older, I connected the dots and realized I’d essentially been masturbating in public, so I stopped.&lt;/p&gt;

I did, and it was so incredibly hot, and my orgasm was crazy intense. Now, we’re wondering if there’s any toy that might simulate the sensation of a pool jet on my clit. We’ve played around with some different vibrators before, but none of them have been quite right. Any ideas?&lt;/p&gt;

When I first noticed our “slump,” he told me he was too busy and tired from work to have sex. After the first sexless year rolled by, he said he needed to lose weight to feel confident enough for sex. &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2019/02/husband-does-not-want-sex-advice.html"&gt;Since, we moved to a new city last year, and he has indeed lost weight and gotten a job that requires much less take-home work…&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;COVID cases are high in Texas, California, Oregon, Nevada, New Mexico and other states in the West and South Central part of the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s worth knowing that COVID tracking data is less reliable now &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/covid-cases-up-summer-why_l_68750aebe4b00af0c5f268a4" title="" target="_blank"&gt;because of COVID funding cuts&lt;/a&gt; by the Trump administration&lt;/strong&gt;, less testing and the discontinuation of certain tools researchers relied on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We are seeing cases increase here in Houston, and in Texas, and if we look at the data that is available from [the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention], it certainly seems like the South Central U.S. — Texas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Louisiana — are seeing some of the higher test positivity rates in the in the country,” said &lt;a href="https://www.houstonmethodist.org/faculty/scott-long/" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. S. Wesley Long&lt;/a&gt;, the medical director of diagnostic microbiology at Houston Methodist Hospital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://medicine.yale.edu/profile/scott-c-roberts/" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Scott Roberts&lt;/a&gt;, an infectious disease doctor at Yale Medicine in Connecticut, “the highest test positivity is in the Texas region ... with the second highest kind of broadly being the West Coast. So, the Washington, Oregon, California, Nevada areas, but that does extend through Colorado and then the Dakotas.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;COVID cases are rising throughout the country, but rates are lower in the Eastern U.S.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two new COVID variants, Stratus and Nimbus, are behind the summer increase in cases, said Roberts, but they are not any more severe than previous COVID strains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Simple lifestyle changes can help, and the NHS says people who smoke, are overweight and drink too much alcohol are more likely to snore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also say sleeping on your back can make you more likely to have the annoying habit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But it can be caused by sleep apnoea which is estimated to affect 15 million Britons according to the British Snoring and Sleep Apnoea Association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There are two distinct types of sleep apnoea, Central Sleep Apnoea (CSA) and Obstructive Sleep Apnoea (OSA), he explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;CSA is caused by the brain not sending proper signals to the muscles that control breathing during sleep whereas OSA is caused by the upper airways being obstructed, Mr Surda said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;More people are affected by obstructive sleep apnoea than central sleep apnoea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Similarly to regular snoring, sleep apnoea occurs when the muscles at the back of the throat relax excessively, causing the airway to become partially or fully blocked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Previously Dr Pavol Surda, a sleep-disordered breathing expert at London Bridge Hospital &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13644345/snoring-problem-increase-risk-heart-disease.html"&gt;told &lt;/a&gt;the Daily Mail it is treatable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said: 'If you suspect that you or a loved one may have sleep apnoea, seeking help from a specialist is crucial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Specialists can conduct a thorough evaluation, often involving a sleep study to monitor breathing patterns, oxygen levels, and other vital signs during sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Treatment options vary depending on the severity of the condition and may include lifestyle changes, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy, oral appliances, or in some cases, surgery.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES — It’s one of the most insidious diseases you’ve never heard of, but Chagas is here in California and 29 other states across the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It kills more people in Latin America than malaria each year, and researchers think roughly &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5154432/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="content-link external"&gt;300,000 people in the U.S.&lt;/a&gt; currently have it but are unaware.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s because the illness tends to lie dormant for years, only making itself known when its victim keels over via heart attack, stroke or death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chagas disease is caused by the parasite &lt;em&gt;Trypanosoma cruzi,&lt;/em&gt; which lives in a bloodsucking insect called the kissing bug. There are roughly a dozen species of kissing bugs in the U.S. and four in California known to carry the parasite. Research has shown that in some places, such as Los Angeles’ Griffith Park, about a third of all kissing bugs harbor the Chagas parasite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s why a team of epidemiologists, researchers and medical doctors are calling on the World Health Organization and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/9/24-1700_article" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="content-link external"&gt;to label the disease as endemic&lt;/a&gt;, meaning consistently present, in the U.S. They hope that will bring awareness, education, dialogue and potentially public health investment to a disease that has long carried a stigma, falsely associated with poor, rural migrants from bug-infected homes in far-off tropical nations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is a disease that has been neglected and has been impacting Latin Americans for many decades,” said Norman Beatty, a medical epidemiologist at the University of Florida and an expert on Chagas. “But it’s also here in the United States.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We had a kid from the Hollywood Hills who got it,” said Salvadore Hernandez, a cardiologist with Kaiser Permanente in Northern California. He said the patient had not traveled out of the country and probably got it in his leafy, affluent neighborhood, where kissing bugs are prevalent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The parasite has also been detected in local wildlife, including wood rats, skunks and mice in &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7906329/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="content-link external"&gt;Griffith Park&lt;/a&gt;, as well as bats, raccoons and black bears in other parts of the state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Kissing bugs are pretty equal opportunity when it comes to who they take a blood meal from,” said Sarah Hamer, an epidemiologist at Texas A&amp;amp;M University’s School of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, listing off a variety of animals, such as ocelots, bobcats, coyotes, birds, reptiles and amphibians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That means the reservoir for &lt;em&gt;T. cruzi &lt;/em&gt;is pretty large,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;California has the largest number of people in the U.S. infected with Chagas disease —  between 70,000 and 100,000. That’s mostly because the state is home to so many people from countries where the disease is endemic. But it’s also because the parasite and vector live here, meaning some of those cases could be home-grown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0013036" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="content-link external"&gt;small study&lt;/a&gt; by the state’s Department of Public Health, for instance, found that 31 of 40 human cases reported to the state between 2013 and 2023 — about 78% — were acquired in other countries. For the remaining cases, health officials couldn’t rule out local transmission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chagas is not a reportable disease in California, which means the state does not require physicians and health systems to report and investigate it, as it does with influenza, Lyme and malaria. However, it is reportable in Los Angeles and San Diego counties; Los Angeles was the first county in the state to mandate reporting of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Between 2019 and 2023, health officials confirmed about 18 cases of Chagas disease in L.A. County, “although many more cases likely go undiagnosed,” the department wrote in a statement. It said most of the identified cases were infected internationally, but some appear to be locally acquired.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gabriel Hamer, an entomologist at Texas A&amp;amp;M, said that confirmed human cases in the U.S. represent “just the tip of the iceberg” and that nobody really knows how many people actually have the disease. “There’s no standardized reporting system. There’s no active surveillance.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="userMessagingInset" class="user-messaging animate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people find out they have the disease only after trying to donate blood, said Hamer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Janeice Smith, a retired teacher in Florida, discovered she had it in 2022 after receiving a letter from her local donation center telling her she’d tested positive and should go see a physician.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith now runs &lt;a href="https://kissingbugalliance.org/janeices-story/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="content-link external"&gt;a nonprofit&lt;/a&gt; to increase awareness of Chagas, which she said she probably got in 1966 when her family went to Mexico for vacation. She had returned home with a swollen eye and high fever, and was hospitalized for several weeks. No one found out what caused her symptoms until almost six decades later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hamer said proteins in the kissing bugs’ saliva can cause acute reactions, such as swollen limbs, eyes and anaphylaxis, all unrelated to the disease-carrying parasite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it’s the longer-term or chronic effects that cause the most harm. And because the disease is not well known, and its symptoms are often indistinguishable from other forms of cardiac and organ damage, it’s likely many people are showing up to their doctors’ offices with heart arrhythmia, a swollen esophagus, seizures and stroke, without ever being screened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The disease is definitely underdiagnosed,” said Hernandez, the Kaiser cardiologist. “If we screened for it and caught it early, most patients could be cured. The problem is we don’t, and people end up dying or requiring terrifically expensive care,” including organ transplants and surgery.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;div class="pull-quote-embed embed-container u-border-light-gray u-border-b u-border-t u-tc mv-40 pt-10 pb-15"&gt;&lt;p class="pull-quote-content"&gt;The disease is definitely underdiagnosed. If we screened for it and caught it early, most patients could be cured. The problem is we don’t, and people end up dying or requiring terrifically expensive care,” including organ transplants and surgery.&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;— Salvadore Hernandez, a cardiologist in Northern California&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anti-parasitic medications can be used to stop disease progression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chagas is also prevalent in dogs who show similar clinical signs, heart failure or arrhythmias.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’ll see these acutely infected, usually young dogs that might be puppies, or dogs less than 1 or 2 years of age that are really adversely affected. And then we would have dogs that would come in older, and they might be in heart failure,” said Ashley Saunders, a Texas A&amp;amp;M veterinary cardiologist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said dogs often acquire the disease by eating the bugs, which give a much higher “dose” of the parasite than a few bug poops in a cut.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p id="userMessagingIn-story"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

"It starts to speak to other factors that might be environmental or nutritional or other things that may be at play that we don't fully understand."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;PSA testing is a key tool in early detection and contributes to early diagnosis and improved survival but may have led to overdiagnosis when it was used routinely, the paper suggests. However, attempting to limit overdiagnoses may now be contributing to the rising incidence of the advanced-stage prostate cancers, Kamal said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;All men age 45 and above should have a discussion with their doctors about the right time to be tested for prostate cancer, Kamal advised. A doctor might recommend no testing, but for many men, having some sort of testing regimen is the best path.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The ACS has suggested federal legislation to waive cost-sharing requirements such as deductibles and copayments for prostate cancer screening tests for men at high risk for the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Prostate cancer death rates were two times higher for Black men compared to any other racial or ethnic group, according to the report. Likewise, the report found Native American men had a 12% higher rate of death from the disease compared to White men, despite a 13% lower incidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"Oftentimes we might think of a one-size-fits-all approach to how we manage risk and how we have these conversations, but certainly if we know that certain populations based on their backgrounds may have higher mortality, it might change our threshold for the testing we do, the urgency by which we do it, and the frequency by which we do it," Kamal said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Prostate cancer is the most common cancer diagnosis among men in the U.S., accounting for 30% of male cancers in 2025, and is the second leading cancer death in men behind lung cancer, according to the ACS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"What's interesting is that for many patients the conversation around a PSA and the discussion of the result then highlights other components of someone's health history that may also be important," Kamal noted. "Men generally don't like coming to the doctor and so this gave a focal point to have a conversation about prostate health but also things beyond that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC eTIW sUzSN "&gt;&lt;em class=" "&gt;Raihan El-Naas, MD is a board-certified internal medicine physician and current endocrinology fellow at Weill Cornell Medical Center and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and a member of the ABC News Medical Unit.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>ABC News</author><pubDate>Tue, 02 Sep 2025 18:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMioAFBVV95cUxPNHo4ZHBxdTczeG1SaENWVWUtVHdkWnpKb1NGRExvdDB4YU0zeTdPUVpSWUhZNkF5Z3RBOGl4cFNHUC16aWhER0pLeFJMZDl1OHpqbFdKVjljbjVqbmlGdG9UWWpja1RqSUZ5elBndVNnWDJhcVBIR0JUaDdLWTNxUldObE9LM2gySklOTU9mWTF6by16dVQ5TnA4aFFfZnhr0gGmAUFVX3lxTE93T196SWtqTExOam9MM2RpRVhMTmhFYzFlZTZ5SlExemRPRlNaTndrRlNhRTREcWdZOHNHVjBMLU41ak1ienFtNXp5XzUxMVJabjhwU3VVdjRwQjNRQWtDLVM2STFmbkZOaXFJWGhWTnU3M2x2R3hlb2tnTDVod0p4eTdlLURJMFVfQzc0b0FnMHowcFpoRmFIa3Nzak5XUXZvRWY4SGc</guid></item><item><title>看起来干净的水可能充满了看不见的致命细菌- Earth.com</title><link>https://www.earth.com/news/water-that-looks-clean-may-be-full-of-invisible-and-deadly-bacteria/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page_content__AwOj6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hot cars turn sealed bottles of water into tiny laboratories. A bottle that looks clear can quietly change  inside, and what you cannot see still matters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Warmth and light do two things. They help microbes multiply after a single sip, and they also stress the plastic itself, allowing particles and additives to work their way into the water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beizhan Yan from Columbia University’s &lt;a href="https://lamont.columbia.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;has led key research on how plastic particles appear in bottled water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-heat-turns-bottles-into-incubators"&gt;Heat turns bottles into incubators&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once a bottle is opened, microbes hitch a ride from your mouth, your hands, or the air. A 2005 analysis reported that &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/some-bacteria-breathe-by-creating-electricity/"&gt;bacteria&lt;/a&gt; in room temperature bottled water can surge within 48 hours after a single sip.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heat speeds that up. In closed cars, interiors often rise well above the outside air, and at about 77°F (25°C), microbes can multiply quickly, including species associated with foodborne illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many single-use bottles are made of &lt;em&gt;polyethylene terephthalate&lt;/em&gt;. Sunlight and warmth cause this material to break down at the surface, allowing tiny fragments to move into the liquid..&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 2025 study that simulated in-vehicle heat and sunlight measured up to 10.03 parts per million of microplastics in bottled water after 28 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those particles came from the bottle walls during photothermal stress, not from outside contamination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-nanoplastics-revealed-in-bottled-water"&gt;Nanoplastics revealed in bottled water&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier surveys already showed how widespread the problem is. An international survey reported that 93 percent of bottled water contained plastic fragments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New tools peered even smaller. In 2024, a peer reviewed paper used laser based imaging to count about 240,000 particles per liter in popular brands, and most were nanoplastics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This opens a window where we can look into a world that was not exposed to us before,” said Beizhan Yan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What happens after you swallow them is now under the microscope. A 2025 report on autopsies found &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/tiny-plastic-particles-found-in-human-egg-and-sperm-fluids/"&gt;plastic particles&lt;/a&gt; lodged in human brain tissue, with higher levels than in the liver or kidneys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This work tracked particle types and sizes and suggested that nanoscale shards can cross biological barriers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results do not prove harm by themselves, but they demonstrate that particles can reach places where the body is most sensitive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-bacteria-rise-faster-in-water-bottles"&gt;Bacteria rise faster in water bottles&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chemical story often grabs headlines, but the biological risk can be immediate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same 2005 analysis found that bacterial counts in opened bottles at room temperature rose steeply within two days, while refrigeration slowed growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That pattern matches everyday experience. Closed &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/51-percent-of-the-world-relies-on-car-commutes-every-day/"&gt;cars&lt;/a&gt; heat up quickly, and warm liquid is a friendly environment for bacteria to multiply, even when the water originally started clean.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-this-means-for-daily-habits"&gt;What this means for daily habits&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no single number that tells you when an opened bottle becomes risky, since growth depends on temperature, time, and what entered the bottle in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The safest habit is simple: throw out a bottle that sat warm for hours, and refill a clean, reusable bottle with fresh, cold water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heat and light also matter for unopened bottles. Long exposures in a hot car may not make water smell or taste different, yet the bottle can still shed particles under stress, as shown in the in-vehicle study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No plastic is perfect. Harder plastics are less likely to scuff, but wear and heat still degrade them over time, and &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/how-ultraviolet-light-can-be-used-to-destroy-covid-19/"&gt;ultraviolet light&lt;/a&gt; adds stress that accelerates the process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want simple rules of thumb, keep water cold, avoid leaving bottles in cars, and replace scratched or old bottles. Stainless steel or glass containers remove the plastic variable, though they still need regular cleaning to keep microbes at bay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-plastic-water-bottles-and-false-claims"&gt;Plastic water bottles and false claims&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some people worry that heating or freezing plastic bottles releases dioxins, which are cancer-causing pollutants from combustion. That claim does not apply to water bottles, a point long clarified in a Johns Hopkins interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers are building better tools to count and identify the smallest particles in common beverages. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The laser based method that flagged &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/how-normal-plastic-turns-into-dangerous-micro-and-nanoplastics/"&gt;nanoplastics&lt;/a&gt; in bottled water is now being applied to tap water and even everyday activities like laundry, which release fibers into wastewater.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the microbe side, applied food safety research continues to test how temperature and time shape growth in opened drinks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That work supports a few steady habits, chill your water, clean your bottles, and skip any container that got warm in the sun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40652854/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Journal of Hazardous Materials&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 02 Sep 2025 17:40:16 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimwFBVV95cUxQNlJtbkd6XzdCSDVHQmxTell5Z3dRbTFHd3VqUGVjMC1nOGNBZ3pEZVlIcXpxUVNySFdOQURJRnNMdW5FVEpPTEQ3NkZfa3oyQXE3QndiaFZxRUhIOExhWkowUFZsYV9JMjdmNzhNUlRQXzREdUtCOW9xd3RtRjFwMC1jMjNORC1ScTZXU2g5QlNfMDZLRkthdGhNaw</guid></item><item><title>已发现高血压与肠道健康之间存在深层联系： 3件可以最大限度地减少RIS的事情-印度时报</title><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/a-deep-link-between-high-blood-pressure-and-gut-health-has-been-found-3-things-that-can-minimise-the-risk/articleshow/123661537.cms</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="0"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;For decades, high blood pressure was seen mainly as a problem of the heart and blood vessels. But recent research has uncovered an unexpected partner in this condition, the gut. Scientists have found that the trillions of microbes living inside the digestive tract, often called the gut microbiome, may play a role in raising or lowering blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A healthy gut produces beneficial compounds, regulates inflammation, and balances hormones. When this balance is disturbed, it may contribute to hypertension. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9863380/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Studies &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;have linked an altered gut microbiome to increased risks of high blood pressure. This discovery opens a new window into prevention and management, one that begins from inside the gut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why the gut matters in blood pressure&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The gut is more than a digestion factory. It communicates with the brain, influences immune responses, and even helps regulate blood vessel function. When gut bacteria break down dietary fibre, they produce short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). These compounds are known to relax blood vessels and reduce inflammation, both critical in keeping blood pressure stable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, an unhealthy gut, rich in harmful bacteria and poor in diversity, can increase compounds that trigger inflammation and constrict blood vessels, silently pushing pressure upwards. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This dual role makes the gut a key player in cardiovascular health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Rethinking fibre; it’s not about quantity alone&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most health advice stops at “eat more fibre,” but the truth lies in the kind of fibre. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9268622/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Research &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;shows that soluble fibres, found in oats, apples, flaxseeds, and legumes, feed good bacteria more effectively than some rough insoluble fibres. Soluble fibre gets fermented in the colon, leading to the production of SCFAs that directly support blood pressure regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s not about piling on bran flakes but rather about choosing fibres that nourish microbial diversity. Small swaps, such as replacing white rice with lentils or adding flaxseed to breakfast, can make a bigger difference than doubling the quantity of any fibre source.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Timing of meals influences microbial rhythm&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The gut microbiome doesn’t just care about what goes in, it also responds to when. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6533073/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Studies &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;highlight that irregular eating patterns can disrupt the circadian rhythm of gut bacteria. This imbalance is associated with higher inflammation and blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maintaining a consistent meal timing, even if meals are simple, supports microbial balance. Early dinners, for instance, give gut bacteria more time to complete their metabolic cycles overnight, lowering the strain on the heart and vessels. This perspective shifts the focus from “what to eat” to “when to eat,” a habit often overlooked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;keyword id="20222666" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="fermented-foods" source="keywords"&gt;Fermented foods&lt;/keyword&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;While probiotic capsules dominate conversations, naturally fermented foods like homemade curd, kanji, or pickles (except for some) offer a far richer spectrum of beneficial bacteria. A &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11500820/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;study &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;found that fermented dairy lowered blood pressure in hypertensive individuals by improving vascular elasticity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;These foods not only reintroduce diverse microbes into the gut but also deliver bioactive peptides that relax blood vessels. Adding a small bowl of curd daily, or sipping traditional ferments during meals, can create micro shifts that, over time, lower risks linked to hypertension.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Disclaimer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;: This article is for informational purposes only and does not replace medical advice.

   &lt;p&gt;BOWMAN, N.D. — Retta Jacobi stepped onto a metal platform that lifted her to an entrance on the side of a custom-designed semitrailer. Once inside, she lay down on a platform that technicians slid into an MRI machine. Jacobi hoped the scan would help pinpoint the source of the pain in her shoulders.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The mobile MRI unit visits Southwest Healthcare Services, the hospital in Bowman, North Dakota, each Wednesday. Without it, the community's 1,400 residents would have to drive 40 minutes to get to an MRI machine, an expensive piece of medical equipment the hospital couldn't afford on its own.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Southwest Healthcare Services and 21 other independent, rural North Dakota hospitals are part of the Rough Rider Network, which used its members' combined patient rolls to negotiate better prices for the mobile imaging truck.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-86668" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

Many are motivated by the chance to combine their patient rolls for &lt;a href="https://ruralhealthvalue.public-health.uiowa.edu/files/Intro_to_Rural_CINs.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;value-based care contracts&lt;/a&gt;, a growing reimbursement model in which insurers pay providers based on the quality of care they provide and the health outcomes of their patients.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Supporters of the networks are exploring whether funding from the $50 billion &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/rural-health-transformation-program-hospitals-medicaid-implementation-kansas/" target="_blank"&gt;Rural Health Transformation Program&lt;/a&gt; — part of President Donald Trump's recent tax and spending bill — can be used to help start or expand such organizations.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For independent, rural hospitals, the networks are an alternative to shutting down or reducing services, or to giving up local autonomy and joining a large hospital system.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Anything that can help our rural hospitals and add services is awesome," said Jacobi, who provides speech therapy to children in the local school district.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Closing, or courting a big buyer&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Since 2010, 153 rural hospitals in the U.S. have shuttered completely or stopped offering inpatient services, &lt;a href="https://www.shepscenter.unc.edu/programs-projects/rural-health/rural-hospital-closures/" target="_blank"&gt;according to&lt;/a&gt; the Sheps Center for Health Services Research at the University of North Carolina. A far larger number, 441, merged with or were acquired by hospital systems between 2011 and 2021. That's &lt;a href="https://strengthenhealthcare.org/new-report-finds-integration-with-a-hospital-system-can-protect-rural-hospitals-patient-access-to-care/" target="_blank"&gt;according to a report&lt;/a&gt; commissioned by the Coalition to Strengthen America's Healthcare, an advocacy group comprising hospitals and health associations.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The Rough Rider Network provides negotiating leverage to its members, which serve about two-thirds of rural North Dakotans, said Dennis Goebel, CEO of the Bowman hospital.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Health care vendors "probably wouldn't be talking to us if we're by ourselves," he said. "They're not looking for the little, tiny crumbs. They want a big contract, and they'll give you better pricing."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Some rural networks share specialists who aren't needed full time at any one hospital, according to &lt;a href="https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/2023/may/how-regional-partnerships-bolster-rural-hospitals" target="_blank"&gt;the Commonwealth Fund&lt;/a&gt;, a nonprofit focused on improving the health care system. Some networks also invest in broadband, housing, and other community development projects that can help people stay healthy and access care.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;A business to create new networks&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Hospitals can pool staffers for a network-wide employee health insurance plan, said Nathan White, CEO of Cibolo Health, a company that helps launch and manage networks in rural areas. He said they can also enter shared contracts for telehealth, prescription drug programs, and other services.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-86669" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;White said he started Cibolo Health after a leader from an independent, rural North Dakota hospital asked him about collaborating with similar facilities. The Rough Rider Network launched in late 2023 with assistance from the company and $3.5 million from the North Dakota Legislature.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Since then, Cibolo Health has helped start networks in Minnesota, Nebraska, Montana, and Ohio. Once a sixth one opens in September, Cibolo-affiliated networks will represent more than 120 hospitals, with service areas covering 4.7 million people, White said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The networks, which are nonprofits owned by the hospitals, pay an annual fee to Cibolo Health, a for-profit company, for management services. White said leaders from 10 other states are considering joining this model.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Similar networks have been around for more than 30 years but became more popular after the passage of the 2010 Affordable Care Act, &lt;a href="https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RRA370-1.html" target="_blank"&gt;according to a report&lt;/a&gt; by the Rand Corp., a research nonprofit.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Rural health care providers are increasingly interested in forming such networks, said Marnell Bradfield, executive director of the Community Care Alliance, a network of hospitals and independent primary care offices that launched in 2015 in rural western Colorado. About once a month, she said, she gets a call from health care leaders exploring similar networks and asking about her experience.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The Rand Corp. wrote in its 2020 paper that it didn't find any academic studies that examined whether these networks do what its supporters claim — save money and improve patient care.&lt;br&gt;"In theory, quality should improve with the alignment of health care organizations, but there is no evidence," the report said. The paper also said such networks could end up increasing prices, something that can occur with traditional mergers and acquisitions.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Bradfield and White said they have the evidence, at least for their organizations.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Community Care Alliance members have reduced their insurance costs while improving patient outcomes, such as reducing their need for inpatient and emergency care, Bradfield said.&lt;br&gt;White said data from a pilot program between Caret Health, a care coordination company, and SMP Health-St. Kateri, one of Rough Rider's hospitals, showed the program helped a significant number of patients catch up with preventive care.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-86672" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Reaching out to patients, bringing in business&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Gabby Wilkie, finance director at the St. Kateri hospital, in Rolla, N.D., near the Canadian border, said Caret Health staff called and texted patients who were behind on annual physicals, cancer screenings, vaccinations, and other visits. She said staffers explained to patients why this preventive care is important for their health before setting up a three-way call with St. Kateri staff to schedule an appointment. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;White said it took an average of 11 outreach attempts before patients came in for any visits.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"To be honest, we didn't have the resources to reach out," Wilkie said.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;She said St. Kateri would have spent an estimated $300,000 to do that kind of outreach for 1,000 patients. Meanwhile, she said, the hospital estimates it will earn more than $100,000 when that many patients come in for their preventive care. Cibolo Health and the Rough Rider Network both contribute to the cost of the Caret Health service, which is now rolling out to other network hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Goebel said joining a network to remain independent is also beneficial for the economy of rural areas, where hospitals are often major employers. He said health systems sometimes cut services and staff at rural hospitals they acquire.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Jacobi is taking medication and doing physical therapy after a doctor examined her MRI results. If that doesn't work, she may need to make a five-hour round trip to Bismarck to get an ultrasound-guided steroid shot.

With an aging population, preventing and managing these conditions is becoming a public health priority,” McCann, who was not involved in the research, explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research has also shown that the processes involved in these diseases begin decades before symptoms appear. Because of this, scientists are focusing on identifying any clues from middle age that could provide opportunities to stop disease progression in its tracks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent years, scientists have focused on the potential role of the so-called &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/gut-brain-connection" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;gut-brain axis&lt;/a&gt; in neurodegenerative diseases. In short, the gut-brain axis is two-way communication between the gut and the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The communication has many modalities, including:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;hormonal, for example through gut peptides&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;nervous, e.g. the vagus nerve&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;immune, e.g. cytokines.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;These messaging pathways and more, as the authors of the new study explain, facilitate “constant interactions between the brain, digestive, endocrine, metabolic systems and nutritional status.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The nervous system of the gut, known as the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7495222/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;enteric nervous system&lt;/a&gt;, is the second largest collection of neurons outside of the brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;At first glance, it is difficult to understand why the brain and gut are so intimately linked. However, when we remember that food is essential for our survival, and that we cannot find it without our brain, the connections begin to make sense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alongside conditions involving the gut-brain axis, scientists have also identified links between hormonal and metabolic conditions and an individual’s risk of developing a neurodegenerative condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, the authors of the recent study explain that more severe cases of diabetes and imbalances in thyroid hormones — both hypo- and hyperthyroidism — are associated with Parkinson’s disease. Similarly, &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/317462" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt; is a well-known risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;At the same time, some nutrient deficiencies seem to play a part, including &lt;hl-trusted-source source="PubMed Central" rationale="Highly respected database from the National Institutes of Health"&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23415143/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;vitamin D&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-trusted-source&gt;, which is often present in lower levels in those with Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s. Over the years, it has also become clear that some &lt;a href="https://gut.bmj.com/content/72/11/2103?ref=lavieensante.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;digestive disorders&lt;/a&gt; appear before the symptoms of Parkinson’s and are associated with &lt;hl-trusted-source source="PubMed Central" rationale="Highly respected database from the National Institutes of Health"&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37918457/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;increased dementia risk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-trusted-source&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;While these findings offer some insight, many questions remain.

This, the researchers suggest, may be due to “cumulative metabolic effects.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;By contrasy, a type 1 diabetes diagnosis increased the risk of Alzheimer’s to a similar extent across all three time windows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Parkinson’s, type 1 diabetes was most strongly associated when diagnosed 5 to 10 years before the onset of Parkinson’s, whereas type 2 diabetes had a similar risk across all three time windows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In general, when looking at all conditions together, the links with neurodegenerative conditions were strongest when diagnosed 10–15 years earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The authors wrote that “[t]hese findings underscore the importance of diagnosis timing in neurodegenerative risk modeling and suggest that both early-life exposures and recent comorbidities contribute to disease vulnerability.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p id="hl-incontent-video-ad" data-adbridg-ad-class="hl-incontent" class="css-pp6cpn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="div-gpt-ad-out-of-page"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study confirms associations between health conditions and the risk of developing Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s. It also adds extra depth to our understanding. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors hope that by drilling down into these links, doctors may be able to focus on treatments and potentially reduce or even prevent the onset of these challenging-to-manage neurodegenerative conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;We asked Perlmutter how the results might help reshape prevention strategies. He explained that it will put a “much greater emphasis on maintaining metabolic, endocrine, and gut health as a means of protecting the brain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Rather than waiting for symptoms to emerge, clinicians and individuals could use systemic health markers, such as thyroid status, blood sugar control, vitamin levels, and digestive health, as early warning signs of elevated risk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What’s clear from studies like this,” McCann also explained, “is that it’s not just genes that dictate our brain health — other factors such as nutrition, metabolism, and the gut-brain connection play a crucial role.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Combining these features could help us predict and spot conditions such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s earlier than ever before,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;As is often the case with scientific research, this recent study also leaves some unanswered questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, “It is not yet clear whether gut and metabolic disorders directly cause neurodegeneration or whether they reflect shared underlying processes such as mitochondrial dysfunction and chronic inflammation,” Perlmutter told &lt;em&gt;MNT&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These mechanisms are central to the shift of microglial cells to a pro-inflammatory state, which is an emerging mechanism in neurodegenerative conditions,” he noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Medical News Today</author><pubDate>Tue, 02 Sep 2025 17:10:59 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirAFBVV95cUxNQVc0SWZ6V2lNODZmbHg2YTRjOEN2RzRVYTU3LUNKWmsyZGdCUkxLWFh4TXQyRTE0Wll3emNUSGlyWEdDUFcwRUdvcTZmX0U4ckRReUdobUh3SnVyTTdDQjhJVGhDRk9uOUJtb04ybENQVDJfUGUwTXg3eV9PVVM5MW9pdDN4eXFMYXk2V1BJV2dSbVYwSF82ZDdqTWgtZUNOeExzR0JpRjZoX0Fv</guid></item><item><title>官员称， 2025年，该州首例西尼罗河病毒人感染病例发生在米德尔塞克斯县的女性身上--《波士顿环球报》</title><link>https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/09/02/metro/massachusetts-west-nile-virus-first-2025-case/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="body | gutter_16--desktop gutter_16--tablet paywalled_content

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A multinational collaboration of researchers report that psychiatric spousal resemblance across nine psychiatric disorders appears consistent and persists across birth cohorts for roughly 90 years in a sample of over 14 million.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                &lt;p class="w-100 my-4 d-print-none"&gt;
     
     
     &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7587637799"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
     
&lt;/p&gt;  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Previous small-scale marriage registry studies have reported spousal similarities for several disorders and related psychiatric traits. A larger, population-based comparison across cultures and generations was needed to assess how widespread the phenomenon extends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the study, "Spousal correlations for nine &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/psychiatric+disorders/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;psychiatric disorders&lt;/a&gt; are consistent across cultures and persistent over generations," &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-025-02298-z" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Nature Human Behaviour&lt;/i&gt;, researchers performed a large-scale analysis to quantify spousal correlations across nine psychiatric disorders and to test cultural and generational stability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cohorts included approximately five million spousal pairs in Taiwan, 571,534 pairs in Denmark, and published estimates from 707,263 pairs in Sweden, comprising 14.8 million individuals, with up to six million matched controls. Case counts across cohorts ranged from 1.4 million for &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/major+depressive+disorder/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;major depressive disorder&lt;/a&gt; to 31,195 for anorexia nervosa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across Taiwanese couples, spousal resemblance appeared positive for every disorder pair, and estimates largely aligned with Nordic registry patterns aside from anorexia nervosa, &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/obsessive+compulsive+disorder/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;obsessive compulsive disorder&lt;/a&gt;, and bipolar disorder, which diverged across regions.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;Generational patterns in Taiwan showed multiple substance use disorder combinations rising by birth cohort, while obsessive compulsive disorder matched within spouses declined. Sex-specific differences appeared limited, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder fluctuated without a study-defined trend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parent–offspring resemblance tracked these shifts, rising for major depressive disorder and substance use disorder and falling for obsessive compulsive disorder across birth cohorts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Family risk increased when both parents shared a diagnosis for schizophrenia, major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/substance+use+disorder/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;substance use disorder&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genetic covariance signals aligned with these observations, with spousal resemblance correlating with Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) derived heritability and genetic correlations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Findings indicate positive spousal resemblance across all nine psychiatric disorders in Taiwan, culturally consistent with Nordic estimates for most disorders and distinct for anorexia nervosa, obsessive compulsive disorder, and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/bipolar+disorder/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;bipolar disorder&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generational patterns in Taiwan persist across cohorts, aligning with elevated offspring risk when both parents have diagnoses and arguing for &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/genetic+studies/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;genetic studies&lt;/a&gt;, including GWAS, to account for non-random mating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While genetics and environmental factors are typically considered to be underlying psychiatric disorders, the discovery of assortative mating adds another layer to both the genetic and developmental upbringing environment roles in acquiring a disorder.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;During National Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month, we proudly stand alongside every heroic American mother, grandmother, sister, and daughter who is courageously battling ovarian cancer.  We solemnly remember the cherished loved ones whose lives were tragically cut short by this devastating disease.  Above all, we recommit to eradicating all forms of cancer, and to building a healthier, stronger, and more vigorous American future.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;My Administration remains determined to ensuring that future generations live free from all forms of cancer.  For this reason, I established the Make America Healthy Again commission, tasked with addressing the root causes of diseases like ovarian cancer.  Additionally, we have taken decisive action to ensure transparency in healthcare pricing, lower the cost of prescription drugs, expand access to telehealth, and give terminally ill patients the right to try experimental drugs that could save their lives—ensuring that women who are battling ovarian cancer have the vital support and resources they need to successfully battle and conquer their disease.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This month, our Nation unites in prayer and resolves to defeat ovarian cancer—and to bring hope, healing, and comfort to every patient and family suffering from it.  Together, with the incredible work of scientists, researchers, and medical professionals, we will forge a future free from the ravages of cancer, and we will make America healthier and greater than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;A dangerous, sometimes deadly, infection spread by kissing bugs is regularly spreading within America. In a recent paper, researchers are claiming that Chagas disease is endemic to parts of the southern U.S. and is probably here to stay.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scientists in Florida, Texas, and California made the case in a paper &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/9/24-1700_article"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; last month in the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases. Citing evidence from infected humans, animals, and kissing bugs, they argue that Chagas has established a persistent presence in the country, albeit at low levels. Correctly recognizing that Chagas is endemic, they say, will allow us to better combat the infectious disease, which can cause chronic heart problems if left untreated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The kissing bug disease&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/chagas/about/index.html"&gt;Chagas&lt;/a&gt; is caused by the parasite &lt;em&gt;Trypanosoma cruzi&lt;/em&gt;, and the infection is spread by various species of kissing bugs, or triatomines. As their nickname implies, kissing bugs feed by sucking blood from around a host’s mouth (or sometimes eyes). The bugs usually infect people via the poop they leave behind near a bite wound.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;People infected with the parasite can first experience an acute phase of flu-like illness, after which the infection enters a chronic phase if left untreated. Most people avoid any symptoms in either phase, but up to a third of people with chronic Chagas disease will eventually experience serious health problems, such as an enlarged heart and colon. People can also die from heart failure or sudden cardiac arrest as a result of the infection. It can take years and even decades for these chronic symptoms to appear.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;About 8 million people worldwide are thought to have Chagas, including 280,000 in the United States. Most of these U.S. cases were caught elsewhere, particularly in parts of Central and South America where &lt;em&gt;T. cruzi&lt;/em&gt; is locally circulating. But the researchers present evidence that the parasite has probably made a cozy home within the southern U.S. as well.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Why Chagas should be seen as endemic&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;For starters, there have likely been locally acquired (autochthonous) human cases of Chagas documented in at least eight states, including Texas, California, and Florida. These cases are typically found in people with no relevant travel history or other risk factor for having caught the parasite outside of the area.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure id="attachment_2000651958" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000651958" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-2000651958" src="https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2025/09/24-1700-F1.jpg" alt="24 1700 F1" srcset="https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2025/09/24-1700-F1.jpg 900w, https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2025/09/24-1700-F1-336x206.jpg 336w, https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2025/09/24-1700-F1-768x471.jpg 768w, https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2025/09/24-1700-F1-672x412.jpg 672w" sizes="(max-width: 639px) 100vw, (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 2rem), (max-width: 1258px) calc((100vw - 3.68rem) * 2 / 3), 800px"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000651958" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;A map showing where the Chagas parasite has been found in local human, animal, and kissing bug populations. © Beatty, et al/Emerging Infectious Diseases&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers additionally note that southern U.S. states are known to have several kissing bug species that can theoretically carry and transmit the &lt;em&gt;T. cruzi&lt;/em&gt; parasite, including species that will regularly invade human dwellings.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;And studies have detected the parasite circulating among local kissing bug populations. Just last July, for example, researchers &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/kissing-bugs-are-creeping-into-florida-homes-and-theyre-carrying-a-dangerous-parasite-2000627551"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; that a third of kissing bugs collected in Florida carried the parasite. The parasite has also been &lt;a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-animal-013120-043949"&gt;commonly found&lt;/a&gt; in local wildlife, captive animals, and pets (dogs in particular), providing a reservoir for it to survive in the environment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;All of these bits of data together point to a single conclusion. “&lt;em&gt;T. cruzi&lt;/em&gt; and the ecologic conditions that sustain its transmission cycles are naturally occurring throughout the southern half of the United States,” the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;A low-level but persistent threat&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The one silver lining is that Chagas is likely hypoendemic to the southern U.S., the researchers say, meaning it’s only present in low levels. But as things stand now, we’re largely fighting blind against it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chagas disease in people is not a nationally notifiable condition, so doctors in most places aren’t obligated to report cases to their health departments, the researchers point out. It is notifiable in some of the states where local cases have been found, but not all (in California, only two counties require notice).&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;While Chagas might not be as huge an issue in the U.S. as it is in other parts of the Americas, classifying it as endemic will allow scientists to better track its distribution and range, the researchers say. Improved awareness of the disease will also make it easier for infected people to get the timely care they need before their infection turns into something more serious and potentially life-threatening.&lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;There are regions where an atypically large number of people enjoy a much longer lifespan than elsewhere on the planet. In these so-called Blue Zones—such as Ogliastra in Italy, Ikaria in Greece, Okinawa in Japan, and Martinique—the population tends to eat healthy, stay physically active, engage with a community, and live with a sense of purpose. (Why are we surprised they live longer, again?).&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;An international team of researchers has investigated how these Blue Zone lifestyle principles apply in four Western Finland regions—Swedish-speaking Ostrobothnia, Finnish-speaking Ostrobothnia, Swedish-speaking Åland, and Finnish-speaking South Ostrobothnia. The new research highlights a potential new Blue Zone but also more broadly reveals that longevity in Nordic regions isn’t necessarily associated with the Blue Zone lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The potential coherence between longevity, health and lifestyle may vary in different cultural, political, social and economic contexts,” the researchers wrote in a &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/jare/5535904"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published last month in the Journal of Aging Research. “The present study aims to examine if adherence to Blue Zone lifestyle principles and good health is highest in the most longevous region.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Blue Zone principles don’t always apply&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;By analyzing survey data from the Gerontological Regional Database from 2021 and 2022, the researchers found that Swedish-speaking Ostrobothnia hits most of the Blue Zone checkmarks with its population’s long life expectancy, good health, and Blue Zone lifestyle. Interestingly, Åland does not meet all the Blue Zone lifestyle principles and yet is Finland’s most longevous region. It scored higher in environmental agreeableness and had the healthiest population among the regions studied.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On the other hand, South Ostrobothnia, along with Swedish-speaking Ostrobothnia, most closely followed the Blue Zone lifestyle, and yet had the poorest health and lowest life expectancy of the studied regions. Finnish-speaking Ostrobothnia demonstrated the fewest Blue Zone lifestyle principles.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The study doesn’t pinpoint clear reasons for the regional differences in how longevity, health, and lifestyle are connected. But it shows that Blue Zone principles don’t strictly define Finland’s most longevous region—though the country may still host a newly described Blue Zone in Swedish-speaking Ostrobothnia.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;However, “we require additional demographic studies to verify the extraordinary life expectancy in Ostrobothnia, especially among the Swedish-speaking community,” Sarah Åkerman, co-author of the study and principal investigator of Åbo Akademi University’s Blue Zones in the Nordics project, said in a university &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2025-09-potential-blue-zone-region-finland.html"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Long healthspan is the goal&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Åkerman and her colleagues also point out that longevity doesn’t necessarily mean good health or a healthy lifestyle. We’ve all heard about the friend-of-a-friend’s 98-year-old grandmother who’s been smoking 15 cigarettes a day for seven decades. My own grandmother is 94 years old, rarely leaves her armchair, and drinks a hefty glass of red wine with almost all of her meals (she claims her doctor prescribes it, but we’re obviously skeptical).&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;If you’re hoping for a long life, however, I think it’s safe to say that you shouldn’t bank on being like these grandmas. Plus, people have become increasingly interested in more than just long lives—the new holy grail now is long &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/news/2025/01/14/what-is-healthspan-and-how-can-you-maximize-yours"&gt;healthspans&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
              
                          &lt;/div&gt;
