But for many people, including palliative care patients like me, radiation therapy can provide another avenue to slow disease and reduce pain with fewer side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-subscribe-cta" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ZRJBIY76KVEQRHMZV6QQ73T4SI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Although it can also be a robust part of curative treatment for a range of cancers (including &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/prostate-cancer/treating/radiation-therapy.html" target="_blank"&gt;prostate&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/radiation-therapy-for-breast-cancer/about/pac-20384940" target="_blank"&gt;breast&lt;/a&gt; cancers), in my case, it quickly — and disappointingly — became clear that radiation wasn’t going to jolt my &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/06/16/terminal-cancer-diagnosis-palliative-care/" target="_blank"&gt;metastatic Ewing’s sarcoma&lt;/a&gt; into retirement (never the likeliest outcome). But it ameliorated some discomforts and with notably less wear and tear than the chemo alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="E6T5ZHEZKVG4RPFLBKOWA3EF6I" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;This piece is meant to shine some light on radiation treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="YXCZF362XBDWZFOF2HDDFC4CO4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;So far, I have had three 10-day courses of radiation zaps. We’ve treated a lung nodule, my upper arm bones, a bunch of mean-looking cells in the mediastinum area between my lungs, a lesion in my right pelvic bone and a nearby rump bump.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="IGSSL7SYGFHFFN774WIQSMCEKU" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="IGSSL7SYGFHFFN774WIQSMCEKU" data-testid="article-header"&gt;The drill&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="QS4I4X5XPZEFFLCW5VFAYWIBXY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;On treatment days, I zip into Sibley Memorial Hospital’s radiation oncology reception area, scan my blue plastic patient card, and chat with the women who schedule appointments and answer a stream of emails and calls while still taking time to make us feel welcome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="KOYNIMGYKBDYHBRUN4EQTKLWSU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Then it’s off to the locker room, where I grab one of those icky hospital gowns with the open backs, graciously augmented with a second shapeless garment to keep from flashing one’s butt at passersby. Along the way, I might stop to talk with other patients who share my time slot or with Freddy Mancilla, who restocks the hospital gowns and water bottles; he has worked at Sibley for 39 years, and his fellow staff members dote on him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="2RCHCYMTJNBHLEV6VWB6UUEFHI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;When I get into the radiation room, I recite my name and birth date and disrobe as required for the body parts in question. Then I lie down, and a team of two or three therapists makes sure I’m precisely positioned for the rays to get to the right place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="L3RW5OEIYNBFTKXAEVHZXCFFOY" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="L3RW5OEIYNBFTKXAEVHZXCFFOY" data-testid="article-header"&gt;Teamwork&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="NJMBQ42R5RG2RD5BX5ATJABQQU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;I confess to becoming a fan of this radiology department, admiring the employees’ technical skill, sensitivity and seamless teamwork. I have yet to see a patient treated rudely or to hear an argument among the staff. There is, however, a lot of good-natured teasing and laughing. Coordinating this complex ballet falls to Terelle Cook, Sibley’s chief radiation therapist manager.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="XHZZ65LPCRFXBLTGTX7ZFWJW5A" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“How do you build a team like ours?” Fung Mei Chiang, one of my regular therapists, responds when I ask. “Through a lot of mutual respect. As much as we love our patients, we also take care of each other.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="Y3KUWUWFEZA4DNW7GGBKILF57E" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Over the past few years, there has been new research about the &lt;a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/close-encounters/202312/how-daily-small-talk-can-improve-well-being" target="_blank"&gt;positive effects&lt;/a&gt; of micro-interactions — the casual chat with your supermarket checker or the gardening tip exchanged with a neighbor — on general well-being. For many patients, the small daily interactions with the therapists help ease what can be a disheartening experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="QQICXFI53VCBRJJF5YD2DBTGWM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;As the therapists push and prod my body, we usually banter. “We see people every day for weeks on end,” therapist Myla Bennette tells me, “and so we get to know a little bit about you guys, and you get to know a little bit about us.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="GHUR7LS6E5AEVIICLRXP27AOO4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;During my radiation weeks, I’ve had mini-conversations about films and restaurants, families and future plans, and about life on the front lines of health care. One day, I asked how they learned to handle patients’ bodies with a detached professionalism — while still treating us like humans — and how they learned to deal with the inevitable deaths of so many of the people they treat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="EXAMY5P22FD3LDZLPUAUEX47AM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;They cited extensive classroom training and clinical practice rotations, but life experience and empathy also play a role. Many of them came to the profession after caring for a loved one with a mortal illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="4Y4ZMURD5FC5FHAQCVKHFW7CVQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Once the therapists have me perfectly aligned for treatment, they leave me and head for the control desk outside. Lying on the bed of the radiation machine, with darting red and green beams above me and large mechanical eyes and grids humming and moving around me, I feel as though I’m in a 1950s sci-fi movie, slightly cheesy and cool at the same time. Make that cold. The machines get finicky at warmer temperatures; for most patients, a highlight of treatment is when they cover you with a nice warm blanket. Then you can concentrate on, or ignore, whatever soundtrack happens to be playing and stare at the photos of tulips on the ceiling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="RYSGNLVBAVHDHPKEFGYERAPF6E" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;My radiation treatment didn’t hurt, although you do have to lie very still. For the lung nodule, I had to suck on a tube that looked like a snorkel, then hold my breath for a bit longer than seemed comfortable. But, for the rest, I just had to maintain whatever awkward position would put the X-rays in line with the delinquent cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="MQHD5ECVAFFAHORJOP5X5UPDOQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Then it’s over. The therapists come back in and liberate me. We wish each other a good day. And it’s back to the real world. Until next time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Washington Post</author><pubDate>Sun, 06 Jul 2025 14:01:31 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilgFBVV95cUxOQmY4dUlwczhBSE8ybE1fUTRSWTNiZWdRMXNXNlJBMlZxcURwb0VYNUhCaGdybmhCNmVfMHhIcVd1Q284Rlpha0dSSkNtZ3d5d0NScDE5M1dfMHJMMGplR1VMNXc3SV9RT3lMNE5OUjJwRnJfVUN6cFJCcENIQWRzWXV4MFppV2lXQ3JVUzRMTGJVR1R0QUE</guid></item><item><title>在重新与老朋友在线联系之前，问问自己这些问题-《华盛顿邮报》 | Before you reconnect with an old friend online, ask yourself these questions - The Washington Post</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinAFBVV95cUxOV28xZUE1UzJSa19jc2JBMzJRckk4TjFxUnplLWVRcUlQUDZ6TXB3UWRCT1JpQVpFLWxNSVlRSW8yR1hEN3lfSGNYMkxhYy1IckFURUJReG82dHlQcjc2bGdwd0oyOUdqUjNpMUhzNlY3T1Vid25HN2lVMXpza0kzQlFXSDl3RnFzb1B0U3hyQ2hzUWZTTk1hYXhFQVc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="meteredContent grid-center"&gt;&lt;div class="teaser-content"&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="4ZBYKVAGEVGZPBM6ACHOPU4GFU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;I was scrolling mindlessly through Facebook when I saw it: A decade-old friend request had suddenly been accepted. My heart raced. This once-dear friend had ended our relationship years ago, and I had been deeply wounded. But now I wondered whether reconnecting was a good idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-subscribe-cta" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="SMAL7I3HWJEVLIHD2KO3QFT5I4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Research &lt;a href="https://news.ku.edu/news/article/2018/03/06/study-reveals-number-hours-it-takes-make-friend" target="_blank"&gt;has shown that it takes&lt;/a&gt; over 200 hours to make a close friend, and even longer as we get older. By contrast, reuniting with a former pal can be just a few keystrokes away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="LTHT2WBJEZFKTI5PU23UUSOCFQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But not so fast. A &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2024/04/240423155530.htm" target="_blank"&gt;2024 study&lt;/a&gt; found that reuniting with old friends is often just as tricky as creating new relationships and, sometimes, more so. That reassuring sense of familiarity can be a trap. After all, people change — old friends may not be who they once were; nor, for that matter, are we.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="54DK3BPYRJF5HCWU5BAE5HJGJQ" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="54DK3BPYRJF5HCWU5BAE5HJGJQ" data-testid="article-header"&gt;A chance to reflect&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="IIDPKO3PIRBM7PVD47G2HHHJMQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;While the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6441127/" target="_blank"&gt;physical and emotional benefits&lt;/a&gt; of enduring friendship have been well chronicled, reconnecting after a long period apart raises questions: Is the prospect of a new connection a chance to revive a lost friendship, or an opportunity to reflect on our values and priorities and what we want out of friendship today?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="CS4CSNTOGRHZJPFFYS2QEAT56Y" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Sometimes, for instance, we want to reconnect only to expunge a feeling of failure for having lost a friendship in the first place, which is misguided, says Naama Hofman, an assistant professor&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;of psychiatry at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai Medical Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="OZ45W67YIRC2ZGVFZDSIFCA464" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“Certain friendships symbolize a specific time of life. Letting go can help you understand where you stand now,” Hofman said. “The most important question to answer is not what went wrong when a connection was severed, but what can be gained by restoring it,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="NYMHIY47DJH27CSQGXDZQUNDPY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Friendships are not meant to be eternal, researchers say. They wax and wane as we pass through the seasons of our lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="BRWCRKDBYNHTLA3VI5RRWMUMUA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“As we go through life transitions, our values and priorities shift, and so do our friendships,” Hofman said. “Young adults might use friendship for information and to engage in the world, whereas later in life you might focus on people who really get you.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="3FCQSROADBG6ZCDGKIU36QHIEE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But while friend-shedding is inevitable, it also may be an opportunity. “Transitions can be a time where you rethink what kind of friendships you want,” she added. “Earlier in life, you might not have been able to form the kind of relationships you craved, but now maybe you can.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="X3OAZP3VPBDBHBIZ6FFA35MB3I" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="X3OAZP3VPBDBHBIZ6FFA35MB3I" data-testid="article-header"&gt;What to consider&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="EOXUW76DZNDW3DOY7SHXI62DH4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;So, what are the things you should keep in mind when reconnecting? How can you repair and move forward with a fractured friendship, while also remembering what led to the break in the first place?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="KV74M22FOBHUNNU6KSWCR5XSKM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;First, acknowledge the choice you have to make.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="MVORRJIBHZBZJIKW4QPAO3G6YI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“Even if they’ve apologized, it’s still okay to decide that now it doesn’t serve you to have that friend back,” said Claudia Diez, a clinical psychologist in Manhattan. There is always the danger that a friend you once fell out with might introduce confusion or insecurities into your life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="IJ237RNDKZA57MGRT35JYGAV7U" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;When an old friend holds a diminished or outdated view of you, reconnecting might not make sense. “The choice to not reconnect can even be empowering,” Diez said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="5T66NY6QLJCN5L64Y4AOQZ47WI" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="5T66NY6QLJCN5L64Y4AOQZ47WI" data-testid="article-header"&gt;Investigate this first&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="G3CIBLHOBVESREISMEAXPG22P4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;If you decide to reconnect, it’s important to acknowledge what led to a friendship falling away in the first place. Was it because of a situational conflict, an explicit action or a deeply embedded difference in values or character? That can be a good starting place to investigate why the split happened, regrets you both have, lessons you took away from the break and what you would like to do differently now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="LKAQROAVSVEFHKK62TZLL7HR7Y" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In other words, don’t just pick up where you left off without a thorough and conscious reckoning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="YPI56SGXF5E5BBIMNU7BJMRVNE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Here are some questions I ask my patients to consider:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="WAZ5K6NPC5D65DU5O26XHGZ5SE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Does your nervous system feel like it is on high alert with your old friend? &lt;/b&gt;A friendship that provokes this &lt;a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/what-happens-to-your-body-during-the-fight-or-flight-response" target="_blank"&gt;stress response&lt;/a&gt; is a red flag.

He was a very gifted student and got into an elite university but dropped out in the middle of his sophomore year after developing delusions that people were trying to poison him. He was hospitalized and later diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia. He has lived with us on and off since then and is a very different person from the son we once knew. He is often disrespectful and, over the years, sometimes stopped talking to us for a year or more at a time. Those periods were torturous — especially for me as his mother — because we had no way of knowing if he was dead or alive. He’s been back in touch recently, but it seems mostly to get our financial help to pay his rent and utilities. My husband worries we’re enabling him by continuing to help and feels like he’ll never grow up if we keep providing financial support. I worry that if we stop helping, he’ll cut off contact again or end up homeless.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="GJL2ECPY4RCUNAGJ7QOOT72RNQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Parents with adult children with mental illness suffer a unique and painful set of torments: the possible loss of contact with a child they love, fears about what the future holds for them, and the sorrow of witnessing a life that may never fulfill the promise it once seemed to carry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-subscribe-cta" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="5YBNI4HH6ZB6FKCHE2ZNHK4ZCI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Your husband’s desire to draw the line with financial support is entirely understandable. It’s incredibly difficult to continue to offer help to someone who isn’t contributing to their own well-being and is also treating you with disrespect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="PMFPTTAO6NH3XAH2XTMDTLUWIM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Yet the prescription for tough love assumes emotional and cognitive resources that your son, given his diagnosis, may not have access to. It can be easy for family, friends, even therapists to say, “Just cut him off” — imagining that will somehow jump-start maturity. But that advice often ignores the simple but painful truth that when someone is living with profound mental illness, there may not be a straightforward solution — only different trade-offs and adaptations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="WDIDT4ZEOJBMVLKFLTNXCWNZHU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;What if withdrawing support leads not to resilience but to another psychotic break, homelessness or suicide? These are outcomes that no parent easily recovers from — and ones that often haunt families for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="HFRAVZHRNZAMJNOID2QOII4RQ4" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="HFRAVZHRNZAMJNOID2QOII4RQ4" data-testid="article-header"&gt;Love and limits&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="VJH4EIZFSNDQDFFNZ3LHPFP35Y" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Many parents in your position fall into the trap of blaming themselves. They comb through their history, wondering what they could have done differently. But while no parent gets everything right, schizophrenia is a biologically based illness with strong genetic roots. It is extraordinarily unlikely that anything you did — or didn’t do — caused this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="EWBVIUOSRBEJRBC5E7YXBPJQEA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;That doesn’t mean you have to support him unconditionally. One possibility is to tie your financial support to constructive behaviors: for example, continuing support only if he meets weekly or biweekly with a therapist and checks in with a psychiatrist to monitor his medications. If he’s too disabled to work, perhaps your support can be contingent on his volunteering or participating in some structured, meaningful activity during the week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="TCM7UHUGLFFUJCUFEFDNGGGBNE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Because your son can sometimes be disrespectful, it’s important to practice love and limits. Love, because the challenges he faces are real and not of his choosing. Limits, because mental illness — especially when unmanaged — can sometimes lead to manipulation, aggression or rewriting of the past: “If you hadn’t done that, I’d be fine. It’s all your fault.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ROHTYIV6HVCP3P3EUF4IW3MHSI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;If you decide to continue helping him, do so without resentment. And if you choose to decline a request, do so without guilt-tripping or moralizing. This approach — clear, consistent and emotionally neutral — is often more effective over time than trying to persuade or plead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="BXI5IAWN2ZHNLMUKMLBJWRI4QM" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="BXI5IAWN2ZHNLMUKMLBJWRI4QM" data-testid="article-header"&gt;Get support from others&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="BWA4KBRL7NCCDJFVQXDOJWZ5KU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;It’s also critical that you and your husband not try to shoulder this responsibility alone. Having a child with severe mental illness can be incredibly isolating. Many parents have found the free “family-to-family” eight-week course offered through the &lt;a href="https://www.nami.org/" target="_blank"&gt;National Alliance on Mental Illness&lt;/a&gt; (NAMI) invaluable in getting support and information. Marital conflict is common in families navigating this terrain, but connecting with others in similar situations can reduce the loneliness, provide practical advice and give you a clearer sense of what may or may not be possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="XTLHBHXCVZEHFKJ3MYBO7EU4RE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Though schizophrenia is a chronic and often debilitating condition, some people do achieve stability — sometimes for long periods — when they receive consistent support, treatment and structure. The legal scholar Elyn Saks, for instance, was diagnosed with schizophrenia in early adulthood and went on to become a tenured law professor at the University of Southern California and a MacArthur fellow. In her memoir, “The Center Cannot Hold: My Journey Through Madness,” Saks reminds us that some people are able to build meaningful — even extraordinary — lives despite a severe diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="XMGQACXY3BA7LFCNGLOQUTOOUU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Still, not every story ends that way. Many individuals with schizophrenia continue to struggle despite love, structure and care. Your son’s path may not reflect the future you once imagined, but it may still include moments of connection, stability and dignity. And while your contact with him may sometimes feel one-sided, it may also be the only tether he has — and the only protection against something far worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="HCVHKBCGQRAGRA7LSM6TOX2X4U" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;You and your husband may never feel fully resolved in your choices, because there may not be a “right” one. But choosing to act with integrity, intention and love — in whatever form that takes — is its own form of wisdom. And in a situation shaped by ambiguity and loss, that may be the most any parent can ask of the other. Or of themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="4XLAEO6N4BFURPVVR4LZRTGM3M" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Joshua Coleman, PhD, is a clinical psychologist in the San Francisco Bay Area and senior fellow with the Council on Contemporary Families.

But the patient’s role on this new “patient-centered” team can be confusing.

We’ve been working together since early 2023, after the biopsy of a tiny lump in my upper left chest returned the unexpected diagnosis of Ewing’s sarcoma. In that time, we’ve developed a relationship of engagement, trust and candor that’s at the heart of my treatment and makes me an active participant in the process rather than just a care recipient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="JQWUWVPJSRBTNLPAKPDN7Z4DDU" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="JQWUWVPJSRBTNLPAKPDN7Z4DDU" data-testid="article-header"&gt;Get an advance directive&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="EI2JJSBIIVB7HALQIPYB7PV7JM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Next, if you don’t have an advance directive yet, claim your superpower now.

Given how rapidly cancer treatment is evolving, I try to read up on recent studies. It  helps me ask better questions and gives me a sense of available treatments and their success rates. I’ve also learned to never be embarrassed to ask questions, in person or through the electronic message portal. I’ve decided it’s better to feel a bit dopey than uninformed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="7B4ZGBHJ6ZHEJCL2MNUOD2RRWY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;And to make sure I’m accurately hearing what the docs are telling me, I take a sibling or a friend to appointments with me — either in person or via Zoom — to catch things I might have missed, and then help me to think through my choices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="6ZLOMSNLBBBHDPDZVW67TPO7TQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Giving me my best shot at living well for as long as possible requires a surprising number of doctors, nurses, technicians and support staff. In addition to Boudadi, so far, I have had a breast surgeon and a thoracic surgeon. And, since the metastasis to my lungs and a few bones last fall, I also have a radiation oncologist. When the system has a hiccup, nurse navigator Nadege Stevens steps in to save the day. Every time I get one of those surveys from the hospital to rate my care, I sing her praises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="DQ3T3BV5HFF6JBC3AM6RPORB7E" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="DQ3T3BV5HFF6JBC3AM6RPORB7E" data-testid="article-header"&gt;Tough conversation&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="AOFGT5S3PJCK7NIIZAB72RDKGM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Every three months or so, I get a new PET scan to see whether and how my cancer has progressed, and then I meet with Boudadi. Together, we figure out next steps — including additional tests — to keep me alive and in relatively decent shape for at least another few months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="DGBCOQ5SP5BTNG7VGMSPXYQVDI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;At this point, we’ve already shared a lot. In the beginning, Boudadi oversaw my chemotherapy treatment through a six-month odyssey of hospital stays and hairlessness. Good news: My hair quickly grew back. Bad news: So did the cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="FOCQMPDCIRAWHJL4GCWXC744ZM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;When the sarcoma returned and nibbled into my pectoral muscle, Boudadi recommended a &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/03/15/breast-surgery-prostheses-cancer-sarcoma/" target="_blank"&gt;modified radical mastectomy&lt;/a&gt;. I was shaken. But Boudadi gave it to me straight: “Letting this cancer grow will not only shorten your life but make your remaining days more painful. Even if you don’t live longer because of this operation, your quality of life, however long it is, will be better for it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="QQYSGEDNIBEFJN3FHYLF4Q3SIQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Last fall, when the mastectomy also failed to contain the cancer, we moved into trickier territory. There is no single second-line treatment — no one standard follow-up protocol beyond what we’ve already tried&lt;b&gt; — &lt;/b&gt;for &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8071040/" target="_blank"&gt;metastasized Ewing’s&lt;/a&gt;, just a variety of chemo cocktails, which have not been shown to significantly increase life expectancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="6NUN3XFE6RASZB6ARC5F4Z34BA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Many people opt to take every last chance to live a while longer; but I was reluctant to trade my overall decent health for the likelihood of being made very sick for the rest of my days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="PSXPLNFSJFHY3NHBTUBWI4NP5I" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;When I asked Boudadi whether I was properly interpreting the data and if it would be a mistake to reject further chemo, he acknowledged that I had accurately assessed the available information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="IFZYABGX45EDHJ3ZNS6ZXRXQ4Y" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“I know how you value quality of life,” he told me. “Perhaps if you were 15 we might push a little harder.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="IQKGD437FBFE3GIBHKPPDZW5KE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;It was difficult to hear, but it was also what I needed to know.

&lt;p&gt;For years, &lt;strong&gt;eggs&lt;/strong&gt; were considered a controversial food in the health community. Once blamed for raising &lt;strong&gt;cholesterol&lt;/strong&gt; levels, they were largely excluded from &lt;strong&gt;“clean” &lt;/strong&gt;diets, with many health experts recommending their reduction or elimination. However, recent scientific findings have turned this narrative on its head. The humble egg, often relegated to the sidelines of &lt;strong&gt;nutrition&lt;/strong&gt; debates, is now being recognized for its potential benefits, particularly when it comes to &lt;strong&gt;bone health&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-2"&gt;

    
    &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="1096651400" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
    
    
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;New Research Reveals Unexpected &lt;strong&gt;Benefits&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A study published in the journal&lt;a href="https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2024/fo/d3fo04248k/unauth" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt; &lt;em&gt;Food &amp;amp; Function&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has brought new insight into the relationship between &lt;strong&gt;egg consumption&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;overall health&lt;/strong&gt;. The research followed nearly &lt;strong&gt;19,000 adults &lt;/strong&gt;and found that those who consumed approximately &lt;strong&gt;1.5 eggs per da&lt;/strong&gt;y displayed significantly stronger bones compared to those who avoided eggs entirely. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Specifically, participants who ate eggs regularly showed a &lt;strong&gt;72% higher bone density&lt;/strong&gt; at the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/04/oops-these-human-fossils-fooled-scientists-for-decades-the-truth-is-wild/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="86049" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;femur &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;and an &lt;strong&gt;83% &lt;/strong&gt;higher bone density at the&lt;strong&gt; spine&lt;/strong&gt;. These findings challenge previous assumptions about the risks of eating eggs and highlight their role in promoting &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2024/10/rich-in-vitamin-d-this-autumn-food-is-excellent-for-immunity-and-bone-health/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="12091" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;bone health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, particularly in adults at risk of &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/02/florida-mans-hands-filled-with-cholesterol-after-eating-6-9-pounds-of-cheese-and-butter-for-months/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="78967" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;osteoporosis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;The study’s findings suggest that eggs may contribute more to one’s health than just providing high-quality &lt;strong&gt;protein&lt;/strong&gt;. The bone-supporting properties of eggs are a key factor, with the research demonstrating that regular consumption of this food could be beneficial to &lt;strong&gt;skeletal integrity&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Nutritional Components That Support &lt;strong&gt;Bone Health&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Eggs offer an impressive array of &lt;strong&gt;nutrients&lt;/strong&gt; that are particularly beneficial for bone health. Each egg contains key &lt;strong&gt;minerals&lt;/strong&gt; such as &lt;strong&gt;calcium&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;magnesium&lt;/strong&gt;, and&lt;strong&gt; phosphorus&lt;/strong&gt;, all of which are essential for building and maintaining strong bones. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Additionally, eggs are a good source of &lt;strong&gt;zinc&lt;/strong&gt;, which is known to aid in bone repair and support immune function. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2024/10/rich-in-vitamin-d-this-autumn-food-is-excellent-for-immunity-and-bone-health/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="12091" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Vitamin D&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, which helps improve calcium absorption, is also present in eggs, making them a valuable food for bone maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Perhaps less well-known, but equally important, is &lt;strong&gt;vitamin K1&lt;/strong&gt;, which plays a crucial role in activating &lt;strong&gt;osteoclasis&lt;/strong&gt;, a protein that is vital for bone strength. The presence of&lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2024/12/this-cheese-is-great-for-your-health-it-can-even-cleanse-the-liver/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="73694" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt; high-quality protein &lt;/a&gt;further complements these benefits, contributing to both bone and muscle maintenance. The combination of these nutrients in eggs provides a full spectrum of support for bone health, helping to explain the positive findings from the study.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Reassessing the &lt;strong&gt;Cholesterol&lt;/strong&gt; Debate&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For decades, the cholesterol content of eggs has been the subject of considerable concern. Many believed that the cholesterol found in egg yolks would contribute to elevated blood cholesterol levels, a significant risk factor for &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/01/silent-killers-in-your-home-these-everyday-plastics-linked-to-millions-of-deaths/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="75020" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. However, modern research has shown that the relationship between dietary cholesterol and blood cholesterol is not as straightforward as previously thought.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dr. Corinne Chicheportiche-Ayache, a noted &lt;strong&gt;nutrition expert&lt;/strong&gt;, explains that eating up to two eggs per day does not significantly raise cholesterol levels in healthy individuals. In fact, the cholesterol in eggs appears to have little effect on the body’s cholesterol levels, particularly when consumed as part of a balanced diet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;The egg yolk, often avoided due to its cholesterol content, contains &lt;strong&gt;antioxidants&lt;/strong&gt; and healthy fats, which are beneficial to the body. This new understanding is encouraging for those looking to include eggs in their daily diets without the fear of raising their cholesterol levels.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Practical Tips for Including &lt;strong&gt;Eggs&lt;/strong&gt; in Your Diet&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Eggs are an incredibly &lt;strong&gt;versatile food&lt;/strong&gt;, easily incorporated into a wide range of meals. Whether scrambled, poached, hard-boiled, or baked into a frittata, they can be enjoyed in numerous ways to suit various culinary preferences. They also pair well with fiber-rich foods such as &lt;strong&gt;vegetables&lt;/strong&gt;, legumes, and whole grains, which can enhance their health benefits. By adding eggs to your routine, you can enjoy a &lt;strong&gt;balanced diet&lt;/strong&gt; that supports both bone health and overall well-being.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nutritionists recommend that most individuals can safely consume one to two eggs per day as part of a healthy eating plan. This amount fits comfortably within daily nutritional guidelines and offers a host of health benefits without negatively affecting cholesterol. Whether as a quick breakfast or a satisfying snack, eggs are a simple and nutrient-dense food that can support your long-term health goals.&lt;/p&gt;

Still, the EPA has resisted calls for a ban, and Roundup formulas with the ingredient hit the shelves last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="33a4f7a2-eba1-49d7-a496-91d3ac9bbedc" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":3,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"‘We thought we’d got the numbers wrong’: how a pristine lake came to have the highest levels of ‘forever chemicals’ on record","elementId":"33a4f7a2-eba1-49d7-a496-91d3ac9bbedc","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/jul/03/holloman-lake-birds-wildlife-pfas-forever-chemicals-aoe"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":0,"display":0,"theme":0}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“From a human health perspective, this stuff is quite a bit nastier than glyphosate so we’re seeing a regrettable substitution, and the ineffective regulatory structure is allowing it,” said Nathan Donley, science director with the Center For Biological Diversity, which advocates for stricter pesticide regulations but was not involved in the new research. “Regrettable substitution” is a scientific term used to describe the replacement of a toxic substance in a consumer product with an ingredient that is also toxic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Diquat is also thought to be a neurotoxin, carcinogen and linked to Parkinson’s disease. An October &lt;a href="https://foe.org/resources/new-roundup-new-risks/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt; of EPA data by the Friends of the Earth non-profit found it is about 200 times more toxic than glyphosate in terms of chronic exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Bayer, which makes Roundup, faced nearly 175,000 lawsuits alleging that the product’s users were harmed by the product. Bayer, which bought Monsanto in 2018, reformulated Roundup after the International Agency for Research on Cancer classified glyphosate as a possible carcinogen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The new review of scientific literature in part focuses on the multiple ways in which diquat damages organs and gut bacteria, including by reducing the level of proteins that are key pieces of the gut lining. The weakening can allow toxins and pathogens to move from the stomach into the bloodstream, and trigger inflammation in the intestines and throughout the body. Meanwhile, diquat can inhibit the production of beneficial bacteria that maintain the gut lining.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Damage to the lining also inhibits the absorption of nutrients and energy metabolism, the authors said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The research further scrutinizes how the substance harms the kidneys, lungs and liver. Diquat “causes irreversible structural and functional damage to the kidneys” because it can destroy kidney cells’ membranes and interfere with cell signals. The effects on the liver are similar, and the ingredient causes the production of proteins that inflame the organ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Meanwhile, it seems to attack the lungs by triggering inflammation that damages the organ’s tissue. More broadly, the inflammation caused by diquat may cause multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, a scenario in which organ systems begin to fail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The authors note that many of the studies are on rodents and more research on low, long-term exposure is needed. Bayer did not immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Despite the risks amid a rise in diquat’s use, the EPA is not reviewing the chemical, and even non-profits that push for tighter pesticide regulations have largely focused their attention elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Donley said that was in part because US pesticide regulations are so weak that advocates are &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/feb/11/epa-reapprove-paraquat-herbicide-parkinsons" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;tied up with battles&lt;/a&gt; over ingredients like glyphosate, paraquat and chlorpyrifos – substances that are banned elsewhere but still widely used here. Diquat is “overshadowed” by those ingredients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Other countries have banned diquat, but in the US we’re still fighting the fights that Europe won 20 years ago,” Donley said. “It hasn’t gotten to the radar of most groups and that really says a lot about the sad and sorry state of pesticides in the US.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Some advocates have &lt;a href="https://theintercept.com/2021/06/30/epa-pesticides-exposure-opp/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;accused the EPA&lt;/a&gt; of being captured by industry, and Donley said US pesticide laws were so weak that it was difficult for the agency to ban ingredients, even if the will exists. For example, the agency banned chlorpyrifos in 2022, but a court overturned the decision after industry sued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Moreover, the EPA’s pesticides office seems to have a philosophy that states that toxic pesticides are a “necessary evil”, Donley said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“When you approach an issue from that lens there’s only so much you will do,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Sun, 06 Jul 2025 12:01:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikgFBVV95cUxOTDNnb3NaRUFqQ3o4eTFENGpnUzBTMzBDVW1jNUtzeHFfRVBQUGptQVltNDV2cXJPLTEyNHpfVU1Sa0FFUDNRMVVxT2pFRVRCZnh0SVBLaTM1M2QyX2xDMU1pVHN0MkxybWhmaHdLUVVfNnhrUmpacmp2ZnB1Q0VKUWJWeURMTzNDb0x3clptOG5xZw</guid></item><item><title>关于疫苗成分硫柳汞的4个须知事项- NPR | 4 things to know about the vaccine ingredient thimerosal - NPR</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirwFBVV95cUxNVFVNVWlNSmIxbVVZSGk0bmYyTHZGdDBlWDBTbGRDRU9qZ3dUSUJUNHBjN1d3QlhqOU5oT0RDdzh1VzNZeWdoLVI5V2VBSTFjNkxCcjI3Q2xLYUlaOXJ4RXVjQndjbzh0ZERiXzVONFlvYXZva2pQakZNVklsYVBwOGtVUGdqTFB4T0tJQjZxYjkyRkZVY0lMREJxV2UteGlVWUdlOTlyNE9OWnlyQnpj?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="storytext" class="storytext storylocation linkLocation"&gt;

                Though most flu vaccines don't include the preservative thimerosal, advisers to the CDC have recommended against using it.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;The federal government could soon recommend that people only receive flu shots made without an ingredient called thimerosal.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The preservative has been absent from the majority of flu vaccines for nearly two decades, but was on the agenda of a committee that advises the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on vaccine policy. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The June meeting &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/06/26/nx-s1-5438485/cdc-acip-rfk-thimerosal-vaccines" target="_blank"&gt;was the first since&lt;/a&gt; earlier in the month, when Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. sacked all 17 previous members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP, and installed his own slate of seven.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Thimerosal has been a target of groups that question vaccine safety. That's despite "a long record of safe and effective use" as a vaccine preservative, according to the Food and Drug Administration.&lt;/p&gt;   
   
   

   &lt;p&gt;In three separate votes, ACIP recommended that children, pregnant women and all adults receive single-dose flu immunizations with vaccines that &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/06/26/nx-s1-5438485/cdc-acip-rfk-thimerosal-vaccines" target="_blank"&gt;don't contain thimerosal&lt;/a&gt;. The next step would be a decision by Kennedy or the CDC on the recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's sort of like they turned this meeting into solving a problem that doesn't really exist anymore," says Dr. &lt;a href="https://gufaculty360.georgetown.edu/s/contact/00336000014TNITAA4/jesse-goodman" target="_blank"&gt;Jesse Goodman&lt;/a&gt;, a former chief scientist at FDA who is now at Georgetown University.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The lone committee member to vote against the recommendations was &lt;a href="https://geiselmed.dartmouth.edu/faculty/facultydb/view.php/?uid=8272" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Cody Meissner&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of pediatrics at Dartmouth College.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Of all the issues that ACIP needs to focus on, this is not a big issue," he said. "The risk from influenza is so much greater than the non-existent, as far as we know, risk from thimerosal."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;He added: "There is no scientific evidence that thimerosal has caused a problem."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But what is thimerosal and what would happen if it is effectively banned from flu shots? Here are four things to know.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;ol class="edTag"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;It's a preservative that contains mercury&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Thimerosal is a chemical compound that's about 50% mercury by weight, &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/safety-availability-biologics/thimerosal-and-vaccines#pres" target="_blank"&gt;according to the FDA&lt;/a&gt;, and has been used in trace amounts as a preservative in vaccines and medicines since the 1930s.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;The compound is used in vials containing multiple doses of the flu vaccine. Its job is to keep the vial from getting contaminated between patients and potentially getting someone sick, says Dr. &lt;a href="https://www.immunizationmanagers.org/staff-member/dr-michelle-fiscus/" target="_blank"&gt;Michelle Fiscus&lt;/a&gt;, chief clinical officer of the &lt;a href="https://www.immunizationmanagers.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Association of Immunization Managers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"If you're constantly going in and out of the vial to draw up a new dose, you run the risk of getting bacteria or fungus into that vial," says Fiscus. "And we don't want those vaccines to be contaminated."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;She says although most flu vaccines come in single-dose prefilled syringes today, the multi-use vials are cheaper and take up less space in refrigerators. So for some health centers, they're more practical.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"When we're coming into flu season, it's not uncommon to get all of your flu vaccine upfront at the beginning of the season. And sometimes storage in the refrigerator can be an issue," Fiscus says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Still, they're not common. According &lt;a href="https://archive.cdc.gov/www_cdc_gov/flu/prevent/vaxsupply.htm" target="_blank"&gt;to the CDC&lt;/a&gt;, 94% of flu shots in the 2024-25 season were thimerosal-free or thimerosal-reduced.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;ol class="edTag"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Thimerosal has been used infrequently since 2001&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In 1997, the FDA Modernization Act required the government to evaluate mercury in childhood vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But the heavy metal comes in different forms. Methylmercury is the compound found in seafood that doesn't break down easily and can be toxic. Ethylmercury, the form in thimerosal, has a different risk profile.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It didn't distinguish between that kind of mercury and ethylmercury, which is a form of mercury that's very quickly managed by the body and eliminated through the kidneys," says Fiscus. "And ethylmercury is where thimerosal is derived."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Thimerosal was removed from most childhood vaccines in 2001, even though there was no evidence showing it caused harm to vaccine recipients, Fiscus says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;ol class="edTag"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;It has a discredited link to autism &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Concerns that vaccines cause autism originated with a now-retracted 1998 study by Dr. Andrew Wakefield, which focused on the MMR vaccine against measles, mumps and rubella. Wakefield lost his medical license and &lt;em&gt;The BMJ,&lt;/em&gt; a prominent medical journal, called it an "elaborate fraud" in &lt;a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/342/bmj.c7452" target="_blank"&gt;a 2011 editorial&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Despite that, speculation about a link between vaccines and autism — once &lt;a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2025/01/rfk-jr-cites-flawed-paper-claiming-link-between-vaccines-and-autism-in-hhs-confirmation-hearing/" target="_blank"&gt;championed by Kennedy himself&lt;/a&gt; — continued and expanded to include thimerosal, even though a link to autism has been repeatedly disproven.&lt;strong&gt;  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.nationalacademies.org/news/2004/05/mmr-vaccine-and-thimerosal-containing-vaccines-are-not-associated-with-autism-iom-report-says" target="_blank"&gt;2004 report&lt;/a&gt; published by the National Academies of Sciences Engineering and Medicine reiterated that thimerosal wasn't associated with autism. Subsequent &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccine-safety/about/thimerosal.html" target="_blank"&gt;studies in 2006, 2007, 2009 and 2010&lt;/a&gt; showed thimerosal was not associated with autism or neurophysiological problems, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;What's more, Georgetown's Goodman points out that despite thimerosal's removal from most vaccines, autism rates have &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/06/26/nx-s1-5445270/autism-rates-have-soared-this-doctor-says-he-knows-part-of-the-reason-why" target="_blank"&gt;continued to rise over the last 20 years&lt;/a&gt;, "which certainly would not be consistent with having anything to do with childhood vaccines."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;ol class="edTag"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Most people won't notice if thimerosal is no longer recommended in shots&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Since most flu shots are administered with single-dose syringes, most people probably won't notice this fall and winter if the CDC decides to effectively ban thimerosal, Fiscus says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Still, a thimerosal ban could present some challenges because health centers begin ordering flu vaccines in February for the next flu season. It's possible manufacturers will have to swap them out.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Sanofi, which makes multidose vials of a vaccine called Fluzone as well as single-dose syringes, says only a "very small number" of its doses contain thimerosal. "We acknowledge the recommendation of the new ACIP. We now await the decision by the CDC on the path forward. We will have sufficient supply of Sanofi flu vaccine to support customer preference for this season."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Seqirus, the other company that makes multidose vials of flu vaccine containing thimerosal, said in a statement to NPR that they "represent a very small proportion" of its total vaccine supply. "We are committed to supporting our customers in fully transitioning to single-dose syringes and do not expect any impacts to our supply or shipment timing this season."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;The committee's process could be a sign of things to come&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Fiscus, from the Association of Immunization Managers, says the committee's decision to only recommend single-dose flu shots without thimerosal shows that it is willing to make a decision without following protocol and considering the scientific evidence.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Is this now going to be the standard?" she says. "That's very concerning if that's where this is heading."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Goodman also worries that these moves will ultimately undermine confidence in vaccines in the United States and abroad.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"One of my real concerns is that although the flu vaccines aren't perfect, they save lives. When they're given, they're still underutilized," he says. "If there's more difficulty in accessing them or affording them, at the end of the day, people would get hurt."&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In a delicious turn of events, scientists succeeded in taking the optics of olive oil to create the first-ever microlaser made entirely from edible materials. If commercialized, they could offer an easy and safe way to monitor food or medications from inside your body.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The technology, introduced earlier this month in the journal &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adom.202500497"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Advanced Optical Materials&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, exploits an interesting tendency for droplets of common cooking oils, which emit a photon of light when subjected to a certain amount of energy. Arrange multiple droplets in a room full of mirrors, and together they shine more brightly—like a concentrated beam of light. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The researchers tested more than a dozen different types of materials—sunflower oil, cooked butter, plain water, and more—to see which would generate the cleanest laser. And the winner was olive oil. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;One prominent component of olive oil is chlorophyll, the molecule most commonly known to make plants green. In this case, the chlorophyll molecules, trapped in the sticky surface of olive oils, generated photons in a chain reaction of sorts, transforming the droplet of olive oil into a laser. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The brightness of the chlorophyll changes in accordance with the size and density of the oil droplets, making the laser highly sensitive to environmental conditions, according to the study. For example, adding it to different dishes of food and observing changes in the  laser allowed the researchers to measure things such as sugar concentration or acidity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;What’s more, the researchers were able to encode data within the droplets akin to the lines of a barcode, into a peach compote. Surprisingly, the data—the specific date of April 26, 2017, which happens to be the first international Stop Food Waste Date—remained intact for over a year, demonstrating the microlaser’s potential to safely carry information, such as the identity of a manufacturer or an expiration date. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Since this is the first such study, there are many possibilities for developing various edible lasers and their applications, which could ultimately find their way to everyday use,” the study authors concluded.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

She’s also deaf and blind, with some functional vision in one eye and hearing with an aid in one ear. Hope was born with an extremely rare mitochondrial condition called MLS syndrome, of which there were only &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK7041/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;64 documented cases&lt;/a&gt; in the US as of 2018.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;MLS syndrome, for Hope, causes a potentially life-threatening heart condition called cardiomyopathy, which can make her heart pump blood less efficiently. In February 2024, she started sleeping about 17 hours a day, and her speech began regressing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;An echocardiogram revealed that Hope’s heart function had dropped about 14 percentage points, into potentially hazardous territory. She then started taking elamipretide, an investigational drug for mitochondrial conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Pretty soon, honestly, she had a lot more energy,” her mother, Caroline Filchak, said. Most importantly, her heart stabilized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="e01aec7a-275d-46b5-9f10-bdc646e3fde8" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-1tx6u99"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Ben and Caroline Filchak with their son, Thomas, and Caroline’s sister, Anna Bower, at an FDA advisory committee meeting&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Caroline Filchak&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Hope’s aunt, Anna Bower, said her niece’s “quality of life dramatically improved” and soon after, she was “running, dancing, and playing” like any other child her age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;First developed in 2004, elamipretide has a long history. Advocates for patients with Barth syndrome – another mitochondrial condition with about 150 known patients – asked Stealth BioTherapeutics to pick up the drug in 2014 and shepherd it through the regulatory process. Stealth submitted its first application to the FDA in 2019, and then it went through four different review divisions at the agency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In an October 2024 &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/guVE0UilHkY" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;meeting&lt;/a&gt; of the FDA’s cardiovascular and renal drugs advisory committee, patients and physicians spoke about the positive effects of the drug, and the advisers eventually voted 10-6 to recommend it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Patients and families saw the [advisory committee’s] endorsement as an encouraging sign because the FDA almost always follows its recommendation,” Bower said in June. “But last month, it didn’t.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The FDA rejected the application in May. Internal FDA reviewers &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/182553/download" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;noted&lt;/a&gt; that the drug had not met its endpoint in phase 2 trials of 12 study participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“We don’t feel like they looked at a totality of evidence where the patient’s voice was heard in the decision,” Caroline Filchak said, who added that it’s been difficult to measure the effectiveness of the drug because of how rare the disease is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The FDA did offer a new pathway to approval, Stealth said in a &lt;a href="https://stealthbt.com/stealth-biotherapeutics-announces-path-forward-despite-disappointing-delay-for-ultra-rare-barth-syndrome/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;. That process takes at least eight months, though it can also take years. Stealth laid off 30% of its staff after the rejection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Advocates such as Filchak are worried the company will not be able to continue pursuing approval.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“If [the FDA] drag their feet like they have throughout this entire process, Stealth is not going to be able to continue operations,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Under the new pathway, the medication is not available for infants. Stealth has &lt;a href="https://www.9news.com/article/news/health/colorado-parents-fda-drug-infant-barth-syndrome/73-89f43375-ddfa-4669-90a2-324a01b8f894" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; that 35 patients around the world are receiving the medication, and two-thirds of them are very sick infants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In a congressional hearing in late June, the Republican representative Earl L “Buddy” Carter of Georgia asked Robert F Kennedy Jr, the secretary of the US Department of &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/health" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt; and Human Services, about treatments for rare mitochondrial conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Carter mentioned two young constituents with these conditions, including Hope Filchak. The children “need your help in accessing life-saving medications”, Carter said, promising to follow up with Kennedy after the hearing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;For now, Hope has a three-month supply of the drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“For children like Hope, there are no other options,” Bower said. There are no FDA-approved medications like elamipretide, and there are no similar drugs in late-stage development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Caroline Filchak said that this administration “does have a stated commitment to accelerating therapies for rare diseases. And it seems like this recent decision by the FDA doesn’t align with that commitment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="994d4e4e-530a-4d65-85cd-842e7073d8ff" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-1tx6u99"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;FDA commissioner Marty Makary speaks during a news conference in Washington DC on 22 April.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: José Luis Magaña/AP&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Marty Makary, the FDA’s commissioner, recently announced plans to accelerate approval for select drugs and companies. He has also &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2835314" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;floated&lt;/a&gt; the use of machine learning, often called AI, to review applications quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;But there are already &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/patients/learn-about-drug-and-device-approvals/fast-track-breakthrough-therapy-accelerated-approval-priority-review" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;four ways&lt;/a&gt; for the FDA to expedite the review of new medications, and the approval speed is not the sticking point for drugs such as these, Filchak said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Elamipretide is an example of the difficulty of developing drugs for ultra-rare conditions – and for approving them based on clinical evidence, said Holly Fernandez Lynch, bioethicist at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“It’s not the poster child of FDA efficiency,” Fernandez Lynch said, noting the long time span and the four different review divisions at FDA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“But it’s also not the poster child of ‘Oh my God, we have a drug that works amazingly well, and FDA is standing in the way, and why won’t they just use their regulatory flexibility?’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The drug hasn’t been approved yet because it hasn’t met a pre-specified endpoint, Fernandez Lynch added: “If the evidence doesn’t support approval, if the systematic evidence collection doesn’t show benefit, then FDA really can’t approve it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The biotech company is now resubmitting data on knee strength improvement as part of its new application.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Of course, these patients have a need. Of course, they have an altered tolerance for risk and altered tolerance for uncertainty,” said Fernandez Lynch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“That’s the really devastating part of all of this. And it’s really heartbreaking, but it does not mean the FDA should grant approval to a product that hasn’t been demonstrated effective, because we really don’t know that it works.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Approving a medication without this evidence could lead to issues developing other drugs for the same conditions, Fernandez Lynch said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“People say, ‘Well, what’s the big deal? These patients have nothing. Just let them try it.’ I get that. If I was that mom, I would do the same thing, right? But the FDA has to make judgments for the population,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;For Caroline Filchak, who works for a petroleum delivery company, she plans to continue advocating for her daughter and other affected children – and has even gotten the whole family involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“You don’t, when you think about having a kid, think that you’re going to be doing this, but you do what you’ve got to do for your kids,” she said, noting that she and her husband, Ben, took their seven-year-old son, Thomas, to the October meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“We call him our baby advocate. Ever since that meeting, every night when he would say his prayers, he would pray that the FDA says ‘yes’.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Sun, 06 Jul 2025 11:01:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigwFBVV95cUxQckFzWDFsSW00UDVYWFpDZE10elc0TUtMQzhKMlNLZXctcnhJREpDVUJNa244WkhoVG1sSHdaYm1IcVNWcEdKTGpocENtQlZiY3RMZGVTal9MYmpuWU5OTlNGQWN1ZmJjY3JqQnlXZXFwdE9CLWJ0c0lwZW9jcHF0S0hVaw</guid></item><item><title>我们很多人都忘记了接种疫苗之前的生活有多糟糕。我有一个理论。-石板 | Lots of Us Forget How Bad Life Was Before Vaccines.

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="59" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcnumxcw007pusm9pcrku2ze@published"&gt;Polio? What polio? Uncle Lloyd doesn’t remember his sister Pat having polio. As for him, he’s walked with a cane all his life, and did he have polio? No one in his family says so. He took up sailing as a sport at Princeton—so what. He winks. See, here are the family pictures, he says. Everyone straight as string.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="70" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcnv5blh001u3b77zalhk1bh@published"&gt;Pat’s résumé doesn’t suggest a polio survivor. One of the first women hired by CBS Radio, &lt;a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/hitler-and-my-mother-in-law/22232925?ean=9781682196519&amp;amp;next=t&amp;amp;"&gt;Pat Lochridge&lt;/a&gt; was the only female journalist to cover both the Pacific and Atlantic theaters of World War II. She interviewed Hermann Göring twice, climbed to Hitler’s redoubt at Eagle’s Nest in snow up to her waist, was the first woman reporter to participate in a landing—at Iwo Jima—and &lt;a href="https://3quarksdaily.com/3quarksdaily/2022/08/mayor-of-berchtesgaden.html"&gt;was appointed mayor&lt;/a&gt; of postwar Berchtesgaden.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="97" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcnv5blh001v3b774ogktwgz@published"&gt;Looking at the family photos, I see three girls in laced-up shoes, wearing knee-high white socks, no one on crutches. But later I find a photo of Pat, my mother-in-law, as a 9- or 10-year-old standing at the front of a line of girls, her half-paralyzed face much in evidence. She, like her brother, a very successful Austin lawyer, must have contracted a mild form of the disease. I telephoned the next generation of Lloyds, and Pat’s nephew said no one talked about his father’s limp, and all he ever heard about his aunt was her conquests.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="101" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcnv5bli001w3b770u6uykyk@published"&gt;Pat herself admitted she’d had polio in interviews about her adventures during WWII. Later, I find a newspaper clipping about Pat’s stint as mayor of Berchtesgaden, about how “frail” Pat was—“a victim of polio when she was a child, for years she was unable to walk.”&lt;sup&gt; &lt;/sup&gt;A 1943 interview in the San Francisco Chronicle with the same reporter is titled “Handicaps, Threats Didn’t Stop Her: Patricia Lochridge Is a Correspondent.” This piece observes that 27-year-old Pat suffered “infantile paralysis in her childhood” and achieved a top spot in her profession despite the tenet that “no reporter is better than his legs.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="9" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcnv5bli001x3b7711s865z0@published"&gt;It’s her family that won’t affirm her having polio.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="164" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcnv5bli001y3b777evaqmzb@published"&gt;Sixty years earlier, during Texas’ pioneer days, any sign of weakness meant that the family and its wagon had to be left behind. Pat, a descendant of those pioneers, could have inherited the instinct to show no pain or impairment—or was it a more basic drive of preservation? Dogs are set upon by other dogs if they whimper. In the 1950s, the last time polio was a scourge in the U.S., families considered contracting the disease shameful. In order to catch it, you must have associated with the wrong people or gone “slumming.” The irony is that polio actually becomes dangerous when sanitation is good. People living in poorer neighborhoods develop antibodies, since you can gain immunity by ingesting the virus in small doses. But if you caught the disease and became disabled, wealthy or not, you were considered damaged and treated with less respect. Disabled family members &lt;a href="https://www.fdrlibrary.org/polio"&gt;were often put into asylums&lt;/a&gt; back then and left there for the rest of their lives.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="190" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcnv5bli001z3b779jxjlj5c@published"&gt;Pat shrewdly used the diagnosis to her advantage. In her 1995 interview for Nancy Sorel’s &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1559704934/?tag=slatmaga-20"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Women Who Wrote the War&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, she says “that the fact that she had come down with polio when young had cemented her friendship” with FDR. Pat’s “great personal friend,” as she refers to FDR, also worked hard to obscure his disability. He devised a method of “walking,” using a cane and the arm of his son or adviser for balance, and maneuvered his hips and swung his legs forward in a swaying motion. Overcompensating, he would sometimes make seven speeches a day on the campaign trail but requested that the press never photograph him walking, maneuvering, or being transferred from his car. The press took great pains to obey him. At the now-demolished Philadelphia Municipal Stadium in 1936, after he was nominated for a second term, his braces slipped as he was moved behind the speaker’s platform. He fell into the mud, and pages of his speech scattered. While his aides collected the papers and helped him to stand, Pat’s CBS colleague Robert Trout, who was providing on-the-spot radio reporting, said not a word.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="221" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcnv5blk00203b77mutbp089@published"&gt;Politically, FDR couldn’t be seen with a disability—only two of the 35,000 photographs in the Roosevelt Presidential Library at Hyde Park show him in a wheelchair—but it’s not as if nobody knew about it. How he coped became a powerful symbol of an individual’s persistence in managing with an impairment.&lt;sup&gt; &lt;/sup&gt;He was, in part, defined by how he dealt with his disability, admired and remembered for it. “Every time I hear your voice on the radio and read about your attitude toward physical handicaps … I am strengthened and my courage is renewed,” wrote &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1627797467/?tag=slatmaga-20"&gt;one of his constituents&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;sup&gt; &lt;/sup&gt;Roosevelt bought Georgia’s Warm Springs resort to relieve his symptoms and occasionally led therapy sessions himself, &lt;a href="https://greensboro.com/remembering-fdrs-holiday-ritual/article_708973d2-6e57-5a67-8e22-de1ea1a8b7ab.html"&gt;where patients called him&lt;/a&gt; “Uncle Rosey.” To support the polio clinic, he organized Birthday Balls all across the country, using his date of birth as an occasion to raise money to combat the disease, the first time philanthropy was open to everyone. Radio commentator Walter Winchell provided the catchy slogan: “Dance so that a child might walk.” Six thousand balls were held in 1934, and Roosevelt &lt;a href="https://books.google.be/books?id=9Cgg_vy7564C"&gt;raised over $1 million&lt;/a&gt;, nearly $20 million in today’s money, laying the groundwork for the March of Dimes, its mailbags soon full of the dimes that poured into the foundation’s office to help fund the vaccine. Eventually, FDR’s face appeared on the dime itself.&lt;/p&gt;

Her stepmother had insisted she wear special leg braces and shoes as a child and forced her to do physical therapy to strengthen her legs. This regimen did not endear her stepmother to Alice, and although Alice was able to walk without braces as an adult, perhaps their discord was why all mention of her polio was buried. Alice also apparently connected the humiliations of disability with social class, stating that she felt “like a tenement child … deformed with my legs.”&lt;/p&gt;

Early supporter Winchell almost stopped the program. He warned that Jonas Salk’s cure “may be a killer,” suggesting on TV, on the radio, and in the newspaper that the vaccine contained live virus. He could have been extra cautious with regard to the lives of children, but his words mirrored those of the anti-vaccine movement, popularized by the Daughters of the American Revolution, the American Legion, and other right-wing organizations, that persists today, having gained new steam during COVID-19 and now being cemented into the federal government by the second Trump administration. Only in this one instance &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/12/18/elvis-presley-polio-vaccine-confidence-448131"&gt;was Winchell right&lt;/a&gt;. A single batch was indeed &lt;a href="https://slate.com/technology/2021/02/cutter-incident-polio-vaccine-drive-history.html"&gt;not properly inactivated&lt;/a&gt;, and 79 children contracted polio— out of 1.8 million.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="132" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcnv5bll00233b778szvhqrk@published"&gt;Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the new secretary of Health and Human Services, was born in 1954, the year before the polio vaccine was government-approved. One of his uncles, President John Kennedy, signed the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/su6004a9.htm"&gt;Vaccination Assistance Act of 1962&lt;/a&gt; into law, expanding the use of the few childhood vaccines available at the time. “There is no longer any reason why American children should suffer from polio, diphtheria, whooping cough, or tetanus,” Kennedy told Congress. RFK Jr. spread much misinformation about vaccines prior to his appointment, and a lawyer who helped him build a list of federal officials to nominate for the department &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/13/health/aaron-siri-rfk-jr-vaccines.html"&gt;once petitioned&lt;/a&gt; the Food and Drug Administration to revoke approval of the polio vaccine. RFK Jr. has no medical training—which means that, unlike doctors, he’s never sworn to do no harm.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="170" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcnv5blm00243b77ib8drf50@published"&gt;Though the efficacy of the polio vaccine has been known for over 70 years, new HHS policy around testing may (&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/04/30/rfk-jr-vaccine-testing/"&gt;it’s not clear yet&lt;/a&gt;) require the older vaccine, or new variations on it that are now being developed, to be tested using placebo trials. This is an outcome that’s still far from coming to pass, but just imagine if it did happen. There would be children assigned to the placebo group exposed to the virus; 1 in 200 in a given group of infected children would be affected to the point of irreversible paralysis, and 5 to 10 percent of that smaller subset would die. Yes, some victims do recover from mild infections well enough to sing and perform, to take up the practice of law, to report during wartime, but some do actually die. Since 80 percent of those who contract polio are children under the age of 5, those in the trial won’t have any say about their participation, signed up by parents who most likely have been vaccinated themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  
  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="140" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcnv5bln00253b7727sej897@published"&gt;Out of the nearly 2 million children who received the vaccine in 1955, &lt;a href="https://sph.umich.edu/polio/#:~:text=In%20observed%20areas%20there%20were,where%20polio%20was%20already%20prevalent"&gt;only one died&lt;/a&gt;. Every corner of the U.S. had victims before the vaccine. Even my tiny grade school of 100 children in 1950s Nebraska had two polio victims, one of them known as “Skippy” for his gait with braces, and both dragged themselves around while the rest of us screamed and chased each other on the playground. Persuading teenagers, those near immortals, to get vaccinated was the biggest challenge. To sway them, Elvis Presley &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/celebrities-who-have-had-polio-2022-8#polio-was-once-one-of-the-most-feared-diseases-in-the-us-1"&gt;was given his shot live&lt;/a&gt; on Ed Sullivan’s TV program. Parents of the boomer generation rushed to get the oral vaccine for themselves and their children. The boomers, having schoolmates or friends with the disease, vaccinated their own children. Few of the next generation have seen the disease for themselves or felt its threat.&lt;/p&gt;

They will also be susceptible to post-polio syndrome, which affects &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/post-polio-syndrome/#:~:text=Who's%20affected,to%20as%20high%20as%2080%25"&gt;15 to 80 percent&lt;/a&gt; of older adults who, years after the initial bout, have to suffer the disease all over again. Joni Mitchell, who didn’t have a choice whether to take the vaccine because it didn’t exist when she was exposed, contracted polio at age 9. &lt;a href="https://www.insider.com/celebrities-who-have-had-polio-2022-8"&gt;She writes&lt;/a&gt;: “If [polio] eats the muscles of the heart, it kills you; if it eats the muscles that control the flexing of your lungs, you end up in an iron lung; if it eats the muscle of your leg, it withers.” She began to sing and write songs while in the hospital for polio in her spine. Mitchell has had post-polio syndrome for the past 30 years. That’s a long time to suffer for a decision somebody else made for you.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="147" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcnv5bln00273b77fft7dr11@published"&gt;These days, celebrities who’ve had polio don’t hide their ordeal. Like Mitchell, Mia Farrow has long been involved in polio campaigns around the world, having &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/celebrities-who-have-had-polio-2022-8#polio-was-once-one-of-the-most-feared-diseases-in-the-us-1"&gt;endured being in an iron lung&lt;/a&gt; for eight months and had all her belongings burned. Director Francis Ford Coppola was stricken at the age of 9: “There were gurneys piled up three and four high in the hallways because there were so many more kids than there were beds in the hospital. … I remember the kids in the iron lungs who you could see their faces on mirrors, and they were all crying for their parents. They didn’t understand why they were suddenly in these steel cabinets.” Violinist Itzhak Perlman has always worn leg braces and crutches that &lt;a href="https://www.newsweek.com/2022/09/16/itzhak-perlman-polio-vaccine-music-violin-1736948.html"&gt;force him to perform seated&lt;/a&gt;. “I never wanted people to say, ‘Well, you know, for somebody who can’t walk, he plays very well.’ ”&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="150" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcnv5blo00283b773hrmyb4q@published"&gt;There is yet another hidden affliction that polio survivors suffer, which is emotional. In an &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/magazine/2020/05/04/my-mothers-childhood-bout-with-polio-paralyzed-more-than-her-body-ive-spent-much-my-life-trying-understand-that-paralysis/"&gt;essay in the Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;, Elizabeth Evitts Dickinson writes about her polio-stricken mother who, as a child, spent a year in the hospital with the disease. She recovered so well she danced the ballet and became a poster child for the March of Dimes. Her mother told a reporter that she was determined “to live her life so that no one would notice she’d ever been sick,” perfectly reflecting Pat’s practice. “But she never really fully recovered,” writes her daughter, as “polio paralyzed more than her body.” Dickinson believed that the early experience of isolation and abandonment—her parents were allowed to visit only on Sundays—severely affected her psyche. Her mother rarely hugged her, or held hands, or kissed her, a state of affairs that my husband remembers only too well with regard to his mother.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="154" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcnv5blo00293b77g5lg25nu@published"&gt;Like FDR, Pat excelled in the outside world, and perhaps, like him, as a result of her disability. She prioritized strength over truth and fabricated her wellness. Her parents wanted to put her and her brother’s strengths ahead of their disabilities, until they could decide for themselves what to tell people. The irony was that she was driven to report the truth of what she saw as a reporter, but her family felt obliged to cover up the truth of her body. Never did she talk about having polio in the 19 years I knew her as my mother-in-law. Was she hospitalized as a young child, torn from her family, and mocked when she returned to school for her half-frozen face? Did she have post-polio syndrome in old age? She did not complain. When families minimize the effects of polio, it makes it harder for the rest of us to fight off the &lt;span class="slate-paragraph--tombstone"&gt;anti-vaxxers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

in which he noted that autistic girls are usually “very good at masking” so it’s “not always obvious” that they have it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there are certain signs that seem to crop up more frequently, in his experience, when a girl has autism. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the signs?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Being rule-bound and struggling with change&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;While girls with autism “often like to fit in and don’t make a big fuss”, Mc Donagh noted that they might struggle when routines change, or “get very upset when other children don’t play in the way that they’d like to do”. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Having difficulties with processing sensory information&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some autistic children can be very sensitive to noise, textures and even temperature – all known as sensory information. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mc Donagh explained there are “many ways that we see this” in girls, but shared a few examples such as: not tolerating loud and sudden sounds, and struggling to focus and concentrate in a busy environment (like a classroom).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added “they may be very fussy in particular about the types of clothes that they wear because of how they feel, or they may be poorly coordinated and quite resistant to engaging in sports”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Intense interests&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Autistic people can have intense interests that they like to spend a lot of time doing or thinking about, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.autism.org.uk/advice-and-guidance/topics/about-autism/focused-and-dedicated-interests" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="National Autistic Society." data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="6866601ce4b0d0f8dcccafda" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.autism.org.uk/advice-and-guidance/topics/about-autism/focused-and-dedicated-interests" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="4"&gt;National Autistic Society.&lt;/a&gt;

For most of us, that means gulping down chai, skipping breakfast, or diving headfirst into stress before we’ve even made the bed. But what if these seemingly harmless habits were quietly taking a toll on one of the most important—and underappreciated—organs in your body: the liver?&lt;br&gt;Yes, your liver. That quiet, behind-the-scenes organ that filters out toxins, metabolizes fats and sugars, breaks down alcohol and medications, and basically keeps your body running like a well-oiled machine. Unlike your heart or brain, your liver rarely complains—until it’s already overworked, sluggish, or inflamed. And by then? The damage could already be underway.&lt;br&gt;Let’s break down how your a.m. routine might be sneakily sabotaging your liver—and what you can do about it, without overhauling your life or spending a fortune on detox teas.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Sun, 06 Jul 2025 04:42:38 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijgJBVV95cUxOaFdEelJFbHFKMDlmTFlYOHVLWDZHbkxWN3hnaHZHQWxxRVBqSTItMUdjQWoxYXV0M0V2NFY4MXEya251Z0IzYzEybE40Q1h2b0dZTVlvaFZhQlB6QXZsYkZvQmJicG91Y2NmWjlmb0d5eENVQk5iYllvU3MzUmZKYk84MXFBZDJuNkVoNnFmUlFHLThjU3luaXQxMUVoc21GWWkxN1d4bFI1MXJveWlXQk1yeHNTd0E0RnRQQlZHaHJiVkJlZnBsMVQxT1FrUUl5UFhGZnRfNmRidHk0WU14OGVSNTZZUHhyalRzV0g4OVVKM1Fic3o0VUxvZXNFOTA3aldIQm5JTEF2UGNoV3c</guid></item><item><title>通过医生的30秒测试检查您是否显示出早期痴呆的迹象- Surrey Live | Check if you are showing signs of early dementia with doctor's 30-second test - Surrey Live</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihAFBVV95cUxPaHpwT21SSmZhSUdpWWdfM3p4bF9pdG9OWVRjRGd3bzNNeS1wWEMtY0dMNjh2TXJTYVBqMS05TVZ0ZjJicWNZNVVDSVFDUG1SRGRfMW9SVDRDRFlXWmlUZFBFeWVyUkFVdUd6eGE0Uk41UDYxMzQ2YnVORjJpcHYxU0I4Yng?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body" itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p&gt;People could pick up on subtle signs that they might be struggling with &lt;a data-content-type="section-topic" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/all-about/dementia" rel="Follow" target="_self"&gt;dementia&lt;/a&gt; if they cannot pass a certain test.

He claimed that some neurologists suggest this method is "even more accurate than memory tests".&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The medic went on to list some factors that may contribute towards developing dementia as we age. He mentioned that sugar might "shrink the brain" with specific issues in the hippocampus, responsible for memory. Chronic stress might also increase the risk of cognitive problems, like dementia.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="mod-video" data-mod="video" data-placeholder="data-placeholder" data-player-type="youtube"&gt;

While dementia is more commonly associated with older age, it can affect younger people too, in rare cases. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/about-dementia/types-dementia/young-onset-dementia#:~:text=What%20is%20young%2Donset%20dementia,time%20of%20diagnosis%20and%20after." rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;According to the Alzheimer's Society&lt;/a&gt;, in the early stages of dementia, a person’s symptoms are often relatively mild and not always easy to notice. Dementia is caused by a wide range of different diseases, but there are important differences in how dementia affects younger people. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Young-onset dementia is more likely to be inherited via genetics. The Society also reports that younger people with dementia are less likely to have memory loss as one of their first symptoms, compared with older people.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class="in-article-image" data-mod="image" data-orientation="landscape" data-tmdatatrack="inline-widget" data-tmdatatrack-articleid="31986939" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt; For example, they could mainly have problems with language, vision&lt;span&gt;, or behaviour. Issues might also be related to movement, balance, and coordination. &lt;a href="https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;For more information, go to the Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt; Society website.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;What are the stages of dementia?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dementia usually advances through three primary stages: early, middle, and late. These stages serve as a general framework, and the rate of progression can differ greatly among people.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;Early stage (mild):&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;This stage may involve subtle changes in memory, thinking, and behaviour that can be easily explained away or attributed to other factors. Some signs may include:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Difficulty finding the right words.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Occasional memory lapses, like forgetting appointments.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Misplacing items.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Challenges with complex tasks.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;Middle stage (moderate):&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;Symptoms become more noticeable and impact daily life. Individuals may experience:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Increased confusion and disorientation.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Difficulty with familiar tasks like dressing or bathing.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Changes in personality and mood.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Wandering.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Difficulty recognising loved ones.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Increased reliance on others for care.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;Late stage (severe):&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;In this final stage, individuals experience significant cognitive and physical decline. Symptoms include:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Loss of speech.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Inability to understand language.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Complete dependence on others for care.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Reduced awareness of surroundings.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Loss of physical abilities.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Not everyone shows the same symptoms or moves through the stages at an equal pace. Grasping the stages can assist in preparing for care and support requirements at each phase. Although these are broad stages, some people may advance through them faster than others. The length of each stage can differ greatly from one person to another.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Surrey Live</author><pubDate>Sun, 06 Jul 2025 04:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihAFBVV95cUxPaHpwT21SSmZhSUdpWWdfM3p4bF9pdG9OWVRjRGd3bzNNeS1wWEMtY0dMNjh2TXJTYVBqMS05TVZ0ZjJicWNZNVVDSVFDUG1SRGRfMW9SVDRDRFlXWmlUZFBFeWVyUkFVdUd6eGE0Uk41UDYxMzQ2YnVORjJpcHYxU0I4Yng</guid></item><item><title>比咖啡更好的饮料……研究发现，早晨喝咖啡可能会导致失明--《每日邮报》 | The drink that's better than coffee... after study finds your morning cup could cause blindness - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipwFBVV95cUxOTjJtbnNRWVdCaFRZMExqazBiSVo5d1BwVDBRdVhIcUl0OUpfanJIczltd3FfaklRVGhfdm5ndXBpY2NZampaaGhlSS0xSnJiWjktcGhOZjBQOGxmT3I2alctYzJuVU1aOE9KdWRIWmdvQnV1a1NMZFVHSHZHOXE2RVhSNkNKUWlDbEV6dVNzbk45dVFydGY3T3BkV2ZqUERFVTlMQjY4QdIBrAFBVV95cUxNWmowamdIak5MV2dnYjNfQjdrb25FZUhRR0wtVUJ2V0Z3QXJrY2FQWml2NUFDSEg2ejluazNZWnY0SVhnZjYxUlBLM01yVTU2R2RDOTVrYzBvOHRjejBjY29laXg2Qmx3RVFhRmVZOXdqWm5jcXNRU2R1Z3ZLS2pxMFNQaUVqMWN4ck1iNkQzclM1emxhS3RVYXdKbzVCNFdfeFJpMWFaZm1Gbmp1?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If you can't get through the day without a dose of caffeine but are afraid of the harmful health effects of coffee, matcha may be your answer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Matcha is finely ground powder made from green tea leaves that is whisked together with hot water and packed with antioxidants, making it a powerhouse drink. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The market for the tea has grown as more people flock to health food stores to stock up on the green liquid gold. By some estimates, in the US, matcha sales have reached more than $10billion over the past 25 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Globally, the matcha market is estimated to be valued at $4.3billion, and the ever-increasing demand is putting a strain on the world's supply. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Along with its many benefits, it lacks the dangers of coffee, which was tied to vision problems in a recent study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In research published last month, Chinese scientists said they found a &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14850803/doctors-warning-drinking-coffee-linked-blindness.html"&gt;link between instant coffee and age-related macular degeneration&lt;/a&gt; (AMD) - an eye disease that causes blurry or distorted central vision. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Results showed people with a preference for instant coffee were up to seven times more likely to develop the disorder than drinkers of other types. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers believe the link could be due to the way instant coffee is prepared, which releases a chemical called acrylamide that may enter the bloodstream and damage the retina.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Conversely, studies have linked matcha to lowering blood pressure and inflammation, and improving alertness and concentration. Antioxidants in the powder have also been linked to reduction in risk of chronic conditions, cancer and age-related diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The market for matcha is booming, as more and more people flock to health food and organic stores to stock up on the green liquid gold&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If switching to matcha, you can enjoy all its benefits without giving up your need for caffeine. According to Harvard Health, in one 8oz cup, matcha contains 38 to 89mg of caffeine, compared to 100 to 120mg in coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While the content may be lower, that energy boost is more stable and longer-lasting than coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When drinking coffee, energy levels experience a quick surge, but, as fast as they're boosted, they come crashing down suddenly just a few hours later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;With matcha, people still experience increased energy, but the heightened level is maintained over a longer period of time, providing steady energy for hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And rather than experiencing a sudden crash, levels gradually decline over several hours. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Matcha also contains theanine, which is believed to have a superior effect on cognitive function than caffeine alone, and the combination contributes to improved attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Theanine also serves to release the amount of caffeine in the body at a slower rate, preventing the typical caffeine crash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In a 2024 study, 99 people, including 64 with self-reported cognitive decline and 35 with mild cognitive impairment, were randomly assigned to receive either matcha or a placebo. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Results showed matcha consumption was associated with improved social cognitive function - a criterion for diagnosing dementia - specifically the perception of emotions from facial expressions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And in a separate 2020 study, female matcha drinkers saw an improvement in cognitive function. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Matcha is finely ground powder made from green tea leaves that is whisked together with hot water&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another benefit of matcha compared to coffee: no coffee breath or stained teeth. It can actually improve oral health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to Tea Makers of London, superpowered antioxidants found in matcha fight bacteria that grow in your mouth and cause damage. It reduces plaque-buildup and relieves symptoms of gum disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Matcha can also be a supplement for weight loss. Unlike over-processed sports drinks and metabolism boosters, matcha has natural ingredients that improve metabolism and increase energy levels, putting you into fat burning levels safely. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It won't raise blood pressure or cortisol, and is a great pre-workout drink.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Finally, a good cup of matcha is much easier and less expensive to make than coffee. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Matcha requires almost no equipment and can be made by simply whisking the powder in hot water or milk, compared to at-home coffee makers and espresso machines that can cost hundreds to thousands of dollars. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Traditionally, one major obstacle in fighting cancer is overcoming the tumor’s ability to suppress the body's immune response. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, researchers at &lt;a href="https://med.stanford.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Stanford University&lt;/a&gt; have created an innovative treatment capable of turning immunologically inactive tumors into targets the immune system can attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="a_novel_approach_to_immunotherapy"&gt;A Novel Approach to Immunotherapy&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Current &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/groundbreaking-vaccine-successfully-treats-skin-and-pancreatic-cancer/"&gt;cancer treatments&lt;/a&gt; often involve injecting immune-activating substances directly into tumors. However, not all cancers are easily reachable. To overcome this challenge, the Stanford team combined two crucial elements into a single synthetic molecule, PIP-CpG. One part of the molecule, PIP, identifies and binds specifically to integrins—proteins commonly found on cancer cells. The other part, CpG, acts as an immunostimulant by activating Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Idit Sagiv-Barfi (RIGHT) and Ronald Levy (LEFT) pioneered a potential cancer therapy by injecting two immune-boosting agents directly into solid tumors.

By directly targeting tumor sites, this treatment ensures that the immune-stimulating drug accumulates precisely where it’s needed most.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="effective_tumor_targeting_and_immune_activation"&gt;Effective Tumor Targeting and Immune Activation&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="5" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team tested this therapy in mice suffering from aggressive &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/lifechanging-discovery-reduces-breast-cancer-recurrence/"&gt;breast cancer&lt;/a&gt;. After receiving just three doses, six out of nine mice survived significantly longer than untreated mice. Even more promisingly, three of these mice appeared completely cured, showing no tumor recurrence over several months. Impressively, a single dose was sufficient for complete tumor elimination in half of the tested mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="6" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jennifer Cochran, PhD, Shriram Chair of the Department of Bioengineering at Stanford, was enthusiastic about these remarkable results. "We essentially cured some animals with just a few injections," she said. "It was pretty astonishing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="7" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;When researchers examined the treated tumors, they observed a drastic transformation. Previously dominated by cells suppressing immune activity, the tumors became filled with activated immune cells, including CD8+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, and B cells. This shift mirrors the results usually seen only with direct tumor injections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="overcoming_limitations_of_previous_therapies"&gt;Overcoming Limitations of Previous Therapies&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="8" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;While injecting immune-stimulating substances directly into tumors has shown promise, it presents significant limitations. Not all &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/ai-breakthrough-detects-brain-tumors-the-size-of-a-pinhead-with-97-accuracy/"&gt;tumors&lt;/a&gt; are easily accessible, and injections typically fail to affect distant tumors effectively. This severely limits the therapy’s usefulness for cancers that spread or recur.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="9" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the past, systemic administration (delivery through the bloodstream) of TLR9 agonists alone has had limited success due to poor tumor targeting. CpG, the immunostimulant component of the new molecule, recognizes specific DNA sequences typical in bacteria and viruses. Although CpG activates strong immune responses, previous attempts to deliver it through systemic methods failed to adequately concentrate the substance at tumor sites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Schematic showing PIP-AF680 localizing to a tumor after intravenous (IV) injection by binding tumor-associated integrin receptors.

Compared to standard treatments using only CpG, mice treated with PIP-CpG showed improved survival rates and more effective tumor reduction, even in challenging cancers like pancreatic tumors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="4" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="transforming_the_tumor_microenvironment"&gt;Transforming the Tumor Microenvironment&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="11" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;An essential aspect of cancer progression involves the tumor’s environment, which often prevents the &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/new-smart-immune-cells-continuously-hunt-and-kill-cancer-cells/"&gt;immune system&lt;/a&gt; from recognizing and attacking cancer cells. This environment typically contains cells like myeloid-derived suppressor cells, which block immune responses and promote tumor growth. The Stanford team discovered that their targeted treatment dramatically altered this environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="12" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ronald Levy, MD, a senior author and professor at Stanford’s School of Medicine, highlighted the significance of this finding. "The sculpting of the tumor microenvironment by this intravenously administered molecule was identical to injecting immune-stimulating agents directly into the tumor," he explained.

This approach holds promise for treating various cancers, potentially including those currently considered hard-to-reach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="5" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="potential_for_versatile_cancer_treatment"&gt;Potential for Versatile Cancer Treatment&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="14" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most compelling aspects of this study is the versatility of the targeting molecule, PIP. Developed by Cochran’s team, PIP binds efficiently to integrins present in various cancers, making it widely applicable. Caitlyn Miller, a graduate student and lead author, emphasized, "PIP is a really versatile tumor-targeting agent because it can localize to so many &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/innovations/revolutionary-new-cancer-treatment-destroys-tumors-in-less-than-6-days/"&gt;different types of tumors&lt;/a&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="15" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike larger antibody-based treatments, the smaller peptide-based molecules offer benefits like rapid clearance from the bloodstream, easier penetration into tumors, and simpler manufacturing processes. The Stanford team has previously used similar approaches to deliver chemotherapy drugs and imaging agents directly to tumors, demonstrating the reliability and flexibility of the technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="4" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;PIP-CpG transforms the immune landscape of 4T1 tumors. 4T1 cells were implanted subcutaneously in one side of the abdomen of BALB/c mice.

The team included senior scientists Jennifer Cochran, Carolyn Bertozzi, PhD, Ronald Levy, and lead researchers Caitlyn Miller and Idit Sagiv-Barfi, PhD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="17" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Building upon earlier studies, researchers are optimistic about the treatment's potential. A prior study by Levy and Sagiv-Barfi using direct tumor injections showed that CpG combinations could eliminate local tumors and distant metastases, even preventing future tumor growth. These results led to ongoing clinical trials for &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/crispr-gene-editing-breakthrough-eliminates-50-of-head-neck-tumors/"&gt;certain lymphomas&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="18" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;"After more than 10 years of work on PIP, it is rewarding to experience this convergence of expertise," Cochran said, highlighting the decade-long collaborative effort. This groundwork sets the stage for future trials in humans, though further research will be necessary to ensure safety and efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="5" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;PIP-CpG elicits a T-cell-mediated tumor-specific immune response including 4T1 tumor implantation and treatment.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Fish—especially fatty fish like salmon, tuna, mackerel and sardines—are rich in omega-3 fatty acids. These healthy fats have anti-inflammatory properties and can benefit your microbiome by reducing inflammation in the digestive tract. Certain types of fish, such as salmon, also contain vitamin D, an essential nutrient that may influence the type of bacteria in the intestines, as well as protect intestinal lining from inflammation and injury.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="https://foodsensitivitydietitian.com/about" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Kristen White, RDN, CLT&lt;/a&gt;, owner of Food Sensitivity Dietitian, says that fish is also generally easier to digest than red meat, which may be beneficial if you experience &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8072214/sneaky-signs-of-unhealthy-gut-according-to-gastroenterologist/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;digestive issues&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Chicken and turkey are excellent sources of lean proteins. They contain amino acids such as glutamine and tryptophan, known to support a healthy microbiome. For example, tryptophan is metabolized by intestinal bacteria that may help make the intestinal lining strong and durable and reduce inflammation, says , &lt;a href="https://www.binghamton.edu/decker/health-wellness-studies/profile.html?id=lina" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Lina Begdache, Ph.D., RDN&lt;/a&gt;, a dietitian and assistant professor of Health and Wellness Studies at Binghamton University, State University of New York.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; In addition, poultry contains B vitamins that play a role in the production of butyrate, which also supports a healthy intestinal barrier.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Beans are a good source of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/287742/10-amazing-health-benefits-of-eating-more-fiber/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;fiber&lt;/a&gt;, an important nutrient that helps promote regular digestion and increase healthy bacteria in the GI tract. One cup of canned black beans provides about 17 grams of this important nutrient and 15 grams of protein.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Beans are an excellent source of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/291159/what-are-prebiotics/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;prebiotics&lt;/a&gt;, a nutrient that helps gut bacteria flourish, and research shows that eating more beans improves the growth of good bacteria in the GI tract.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Check out all of our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipes/18236/ingredients/beans/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;healthy bean recipes&lt;/a&gt; for inspiration.&lt;strong&gt;  &lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Research reveals that dietary protein may influence the makeup of the microbiome in the gastrointestinal tract, as well as how it functions.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The theory is that not all dietary proteins get digested, and as undigested protein arrives in the colon, some bacteria may use the amino acids (building blocks of proteins) as an energy source, producing byproducts called metabolites.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; These metabolites may then play a role in metabolism and our immune system.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Are you going for plant- or animal-based protein? That makes a difference in this discussion. Animal proteins are complete proteins, meaning they provide all the essential amino acids in proportions needed for health, says White. These amino acids are crucial for a range of bodily functions, including tissue repair and immune system support.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Animal proteins are generally well-tolerated and easily digested by most people. [Animal proteins] can be particularly beneficial for individuals with digestive issues or sensitivities, as they are less likely to cause gastrointestinal discomfort than some plant-based proteins,” White explains. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Although animal proteins are complete, some plant-based and vegetarian proteins, like tofu and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8016443/proteins-you-should-eat-every-week/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;quinoa&lt;/a&gt;, are also complete proteins. You can still get all of the amino acids you need if eating primarily plant-based proteins, like beans and nuts, but it’s important to eat a wide variety of options to meet your needs. Animal proteins are easy to digest for most people, although many plant-based proteins provide other benefits, such as fiber and healthy fats. Eating a wide variety of protein options is recommended to provide a range of nutrients. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-considerations-when-choosing-protein"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Considerations When Choosing Protein  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Change up your proteins: Eat a variety of animal- and plant-based proteins for balanced nutrition. Along with the animal proteins on this list, check out these &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/plant-based-foods-with-more-protein-than-an-egg-8424134" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;plant-based foods that have more protein than an egg&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Think about cooking methods: “How these proteins are prepared can significantly impact their effects on gut health,” says White. Both White and Begdache recommend cooking methods such as grilling, baking, poaching and steaming to retain more nutrients and support heart and overall health.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go for natural proteins over supplements: &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8032853/what-does-protein-powder-do/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Protein powders&lt;/a&gt; and shakes have their place, and they can help you meet your protein needs. However, there’s a benefit to choosing food when you can, including a wider array of nutrients. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While protein may play a key role in gut health, Begdache advises not to consume protein foods in large amounts without sources of fiber-rich carbohydrates, like fruits, vegetables, whole grains or legumes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A high-protein, low-fiber diet may change the gut microbiome by altering the types of metabolites produced by intestinal bacteria.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “The healthy microbes that live in the GI tract feed on undigested complex carbohydrates like fiber,” Begdache explains. “High-protein foods, [generally] tend to lack these complex fibers; therefore, their presence in the gut may change the composition of the gut microbiota into a less health-favorable one,” she says. Conversely, a high-fiber diet that includes complex carbohydrate foods may help protect the gut microbiome and reduce inflammation.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-sc-block-adslot-inline"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Begdache also indicates that protein digestion in the stomach differs from one person to another. “People with low stomach acid or pancreatic problems may not digest proteins effectively. Consequently, the more undigested proteins enter the colon, the less advantageous these proteins are,” she adds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"&lt;b&gt;I'm older than the ladies in my friend group, and started talking to them about it.&lt;/b&gt; I post about it on social media and have told my nieces (who are in their 20s) about it. The only thing I knew about perimenopause was that my mom got really mad about everything, and she was depressed for a long time. Literally, nothing else. &lt;b&gt;I’m trying to be the perimenopause fairy and spread the word so people aren’t shocked when it starts.&lt;/b&gt;"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;— &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Alternative_Sky_3736/" target="_blank"&gt;Alternative_Sky_3736&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

A simple twist on walking, first tested in Japan, may be the missing ingredient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This “Japanese walking” exercise methodology, called interval walking training (&lt;a href="https://cdnsciencepub.com/doi/10.1139/apnm-2023-0595" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;IWT&lt;/a&gt;), swaps steady strolling for bursts of brisk movement, then recovery‑paced steps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cardiometabolic researcher &lt;a href="https://researchprofiles.ku.dk/en/persons/kristian-karstoft" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Kristian Karstoft&lt;/a&gt; of the University of Copenhagen’s &lt;a href="https://healthyaging.ku.dk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Center for Healthy Aging&lt;/a&gt; has spent more than a decade tracking its effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-pace-changes-matter"&gt;Why pace changes matter&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most walkers cruise at one comfortable speed and never raise their heart rate high enough to stimulate deeper adaptations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Switching between fast and slow bouts nudges the body to use oxygen more efficiently, a trait measured by &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17605959/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;VO2peak&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That oxygen boost drives down resting blood pressure and encourages muscles to burn more sugar for fuel. It also keeps a session feeling manageable because the recovery intervals prevent the distress that can accompany continuous hard effort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regular shifts in speed even appear to sharpen insulin action, regulating blood sugar swings that set the stage for diabetes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists call that improvement better &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/glycemic-control" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;glycemic control&lt;/a&gt;, a term describing how tightly the body keeps glucose within a healthy range.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-japanese-walking-works"&gt;How “Japanese walking” works&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Japanese physiologists outline a straightforward walking recipe, alternating three minutes at roughly seventy percent of personal maximum effort with three minutes around forty percent. Completing five of these cycles takes about half an hour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Additionally, interval walking training is a great way to meet the recommended 150 minutes a week of moderate‑intensity aerobic activity,” noted &lt;a href="https://www.massgeneral.org/doctors/23054/sarah-eby" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Sarah F. Eby&lt;/a&gt;, the sports medicine specialist at Mass &lt;a href="https://www.massgeneral.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;General Brigham&lt;/a&gt; and assistant professor at &lt;a href="https://connects.catalyst.harvard.edu/Profiles/display/Person/211149" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Harvard Medical School&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That schedule, performed on at least five days each week, fits neatly into current public‑health advice to accumulate one hundred fifty minutes of moderate exercise. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A simple watch or phone app can cue the switches, though early Japanese volunteers used a waist‑worn beeper nicknamed &lt;a href="https://www.pubcompare.ai/product/VyniCZIBPBHhf-iFORRd/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;JD Mate&lt;/a&gt;. Supportive shoes and a safe sidewalk are the only other requirements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-proof-in-older-adults"&gt;Proof in older adults&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a seminal five‑month experiment involving &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25539937/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;adults averaging sixty‑three years old&lt;/a&gt;, IWT raised VO2peak ten percent and drove &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/high-blood-pressure/understanding-blood-pressure-readings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;systolic pressure&lt;/a&gt; down nine millimeters of mercury compared with either continuous walking or no exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Knee strength climbed as much as seventeen percent, a critical buffer against falls. Body mass index dipped and fasting glucose improved within weeks, suggesting metabolic changes arrive quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What surprised the investigators most was adherence. Ninety‑five percent of more than eight hundred participants kept the habit for the full study window.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who logged at least four sessions a week enjoyed the biggest gains, reinforcing the idea that consistency outranks intensity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pattern held over nearly two years, although adherence slipped for volunteers starting with higher waistlines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-benefits-of-iwt-japanese-walking"&gt;Benefits of IWT Japanese walking&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Danish trial later pitted IWT against energy‑matched continuous &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/dog-walking-improves-mobility-and-prevents-falls-in-older-adults/"&gt;walking&lt;/a&gt; in adults living with type 2 diabetes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only the interval group shrank abdominal fat and cut twenty‑four‑hour glucose fluctuations, despite similar caloric burn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Compared to energy‑expenditure and time‑duration matched continuous walking training, IWT is superior for improving physical fitness, body composition, and glycemic control in individuals with type 2 diabetes,” stated Karstoft. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Follow‑up mechanistic work pointed toward enhanced glucose effectiveness, meaning muscles absorbed sugar without extra insulin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-safety-and-sticking-with-it"&gt;Safety and sticking with it&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because walking remains fully aerobic, lactate rarely spikes and the risk of cardiac complications stays low. No serious adverse events surfaced across dozens of trials, even among recent joint‑replacement patients cleared by their surgeons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Digital prompts can help sustain motivation once novelty fades. Yet data from a Danish smartphone roll‑out show that unsupervised users averaged only nine minutes of fast &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/upright-walking-may-have-sparked-human-creativity-and-music/"&gt;walking&lt;/a&gt; per week after a year, underscoring the value of social or clinical follow‑up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coaching, group strolls, or gamified leaderboards may lift engagement, particularly for people carrying extra weight. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers are testing whether regular phone calls paired with step‑count feedback can duplicate laboratory adherence in the real world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-getting-started-today"&gt;Getting started today&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consult your clinician if you have chronic conditions, then pick a flat route and set a timer for thirty minutes. Begin with one minute brisk, one minute relaxed for fifteen cycles, or even shorter bursts until comfort builds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Studies specifically looking at the benefits of interval &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/walking-can-counteract-the-health-risks-of-sitting/"&gt;walking training&lt;/a&gt; have found improved physical fitness, muscle strength, and glycemic control,” said Eby. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She advises ramping up gradually so each brisk interval still allows a short phrase before breath runs out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Track sessions on a calendar; seeing streaks grow is strangely satisfying. Celebrate milestones such as a lower belt notch or an easier climb up the porch steps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A final word for anyone who thinks walking is too gentle to matter, remember that pace, not mileage, drives adaptation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Japanese approach proves that swapping a few calm blocks for a confident stride can steer health markers in the right direction long before you break into a jog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://cdnsciencepub.com/doi/10.1139/apnm-2023-0595" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Applied Physiology, Nutrition, and Metabolism&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Sat, 05 Jul 2025 21:12:22 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirgFBVV95cUxQNE1uNDQ2T1pKSVFSRlIwb2FsZWtySWlCLWlGNGNSTmotOXFld2ZFNzRPdHg0MEtzaVlQUW43X0xycXVTdTN3MHFvbWdVZEU5Z0lEaGxZNTdkazBTWUY4U3lKWXpFMUJkVXhya2RkdmxEVmpYOFlzckdYSlFDVExJLWFNUnJOSkNCNm9XbVByVkw3S2VSQm82Q09hcEp2cHM2Qkpqeklxa2U0aTgtV3c</guid></item><item><title>自2000年美国宣布根除麻疹以来，麻疹病例达到最高水平-今日美国 | Measles cases hit highest level since it was declared eradicated in the U.S. in 2000 - USA Today</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiowFBVV95cUxQR05BT0hDUzBHQTZ1dFJpSXlWLTBlX25DLXhUbG0tbF9aWmZPTXV2a3hUTUpjei1PYU1UQWRIUjRXTE9Tc3NOSURtd0xYMW85LUMxRF9pc0Z5QmNzRHF3WmFyc05XWFNlZi1HLVFKQ1J6ODJ0Zmd4SDhHYndGOVprYU54aTU2LW9QenY3NmZhd0RpWEhzVnF6cjBGWWIydmdwX1BN?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gnt_ar_b"&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;This year's measles outbreak is the worst since the disease was declared eliminated in 2000.

			&lt;p&gt;Stores of glucose in the brain could play a much more significant role in the pathological degeneration of neurons than scientists realized, opening the way to new treatments for conditions like  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="166540" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer's is a tauopathy; a condition characterized by harmful build-ups of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tau_protein"&gt;tau proteins&lt;/a&gt; inside neurons. It's not clear, however, if these build-ups are a cause or a consequence of the disease. &lt;span&gt;A new study now adds important detail by revealing significant interactions between tau and glucose in its stored form of glycogen.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Led by a team from the Buck Institute for Research on Aging in the US, the research sheds new light on the functions of glycogen in the brain. Before now, it's only been regarded as an energy backup for &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-discover-unexpected-link-between-diet-and-lung-cancer-risk"&gt;the liver and the muscles&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This new study challenges that view, and it does so with striking implications," &lt;a href="https://www.buckinstitute.org/news/neurons-burn-sugar-differently-the-discovery-could-save-the-brain/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; molecular biologist Pankaj Kapahi, from the Buck Institute. "Stored glycogen doesn't just sit there in the brain, it is involved in pathology."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/insulin-isnt-just-made-by-the-pancreas-heres-another-location-few-know-about?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;Insulin Isn't Just Made by The Pancreas. Here's Another Location Few Know About.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Building on links previously found between &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/hmg/ddu024"&gt;glycogen and neurodegeneration&lt;/a&gt;, the researchers spotted evidence of excessive glycogen levels both in tauopathy models created in fruit flies (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drosophila_melanogaster"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) and in the brain cells of people with Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further analysis revealed a key mechanism at play: tau proteins interrupt the normal breakdown and use of glycogen in the brain, adding to the dangerous build-up of both tau and glycogen, as well as lowering protective neuron defense barriers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_166553" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-166553" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/BrainScans-1.jpg" alt="Brain scans" class="wp-image-166553 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/BrainScans-1.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/BrainScans-1-554x415.jpg 554w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/BrainScans-1-600x450.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-166553" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers looked at the effects of a build-up of tau proteins and glycogen in fruit fly brains. Above are normal brains; below, brains with tauopathy show increased vacuole size, marked by arrows. (Bar et al., &lt;em&gt;Nature Metabolism&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crucial to this interaction is the activity of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycogen_phosphorylase"&gt;glycogen phosphorylase&lt;/a&gt; or GlyP, the main enzyme tasked with turning glycogen into a fuel the body can use. When the researchers boosted GlyP production in fruit flies, glycogen stores were utilized once more, helping to fight back against cell damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"By increasing GlyP activity, the brain cells could better detoxify harmful reactive oxygen species, thereby reducing damage and even extending the lifespan of tauopathy model flies," &lt;a href="https://www.buckinstitute.org/news/neurons-burn-sugar-differently-the-discovery-could-save-the-brain/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;Buck Institute &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;biologist Sudipta Bar.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team wondered if a restricted diet – already associated with &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S0047-6374(01)00226-3"&gt;better brain health&lt;/a&gt; – would help. When fruit flies affected by tauopathy were put on a low-protein diet, they lived longer and showed reduced brain damage, suggesting that the metabolic shift prompted by dieting can help boost GlyP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's a notable set of findings, not least because it suggests a way that glycogen and tau aggregation could be tackled in the brain. The researchers also developed a drug based around the 8-Br-cAMP molecule to mimic the effects of dietary restriction, which had similar effects on flies in experiments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work might even tie into research involving GLP-1 receptor agonists such as Ozempic, designed to manage  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="166540" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; and reduce weight loss, but also now showing promise for &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/weight-loss-drugs-like-ozempic-may-guard-against-dementia-research-finds"&gt;protecting against dementia&lt;/a&gt;. That might be because these drugs interact with one of glycogen's pathways, the researchers suggest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"By discovering how neurons manage sugar, we may have unearthed a novel therapeutic strategy: one that targets the cell's inner chemistry to fight age-related decline," &lt;a href="https://www.buckinstitute.org/news/neurons-burn-sugar-differently-the-discovery-could-save-the-brain/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Kapahi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As we continue to age as a society, findings like these offer hope that better understanding – and perhaps rebalancing – our brain's hidden sugar code could unlock powerful tools for combating dementia."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s42255-025-01314-w"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Metabolism&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;span class="js-subbuzz__title-text"&gt;"I was tired all the time no matter how much I slept. I'd wake up feeling like I hadn't slept at all, would doze off literally everywhere, and I needed three-hour naps after work. I'd skip workouts (I love lifting weights) and would wake up with cotton mouth, headaches, and chest pains every day for 10 years. Turns out I had the worst sleep apnea my doctor — with 27 years of practice — had ever seen. I was waking up over FIVE HUNDRED times a night. She practically threw a CPAP machine at my face right then and there."&lt;/span&gt;
    
  &lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;"It's almost a year later. I lift weights five or six days a week, and have more energy than anyone I know. I've lost 35 pounds, and I sleep so soundly that I can place a marble on my chest and wake up with it in the same spot in the morning. Blood pressure and LDL cholesterol dropped, and I never have headaches or chest pains anymore. All these years, I kept thinking I was lazy, but I was just exhausted to hell."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1kyv1pj/comment/mv0hqq8/" target="_blank"&gt;u/TesticularPsychosis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Small health wins can add up, which is why it's a good practice to &lt;a href="https://www.healthdigest.com/823679/nutrient-dense-foods-you-should-add-to-your-diet/" target="_blank"&gt;add nutrient-dense foods to your diet&lt;/a&gt;. The more nutritional value a food has, the more benefits it can offer you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Fortunately, there's no shortage of versatile, functional foods to discover. And one that checks a lot of health boxes is passion fruit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;If you're new to passion fruit, you might be surprised at its compact size. But don't worry: It delivers plenty of health value. According to the &lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/2709248/nutrients" target="_blank"&gt;U.S. Department of Agriculture&lt;/a&gt;, the fragrant, sweet-sour, seedy pulp of just one average-sized passion fruit (about 18 grams) clocks in at 1.87 grams of fiber and 5.22 milligrams of magnesium — all for under 18 calories. In addition to those nutrients, passion fruit is filled with vitamins and compounds that give it antioxidant properties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;What do these nutritional elements mean? Essentially, this tropical fruit may be able to help you control your blood sugar, reduce your risk of cardiovascular disease, and boost your sleep quality.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;

                    &lt;span class="gallery-image-credit"&gt;Andreypopov/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;/div&gt;
				            &lt;div class="columns-holder "&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Let's look at the relationship between eating passion fruit and managing your blood sugar. Passion fruit falls low on the glycemic index (GI), as shown in a &lt;a href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Glycemic-index-and-glycemic-load-of-tropical-fruits-Passos-Sampaio/5cdbf7d22c55f3f079a252574a678a5fdcc14c6e" target="_blank"&gt;2015 study&lt;/a&gt; in Food Science and Technology. This means that it's not likely to cause a sudden sugar surge after consumption. On the contrary, your blood sugar numbers should stabilize after eating low-GI foods like passion fruit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;If you're relying on foods to manage your blood sugars, but you crave sweets, passion fruit may be useful as part of a &lt;a href="https://www.healthdigest.com/416386/what-is-the-glycemic-index/" target="_blank"&gt;low-GI diet&lt;/a&gt;. Yes, the fruit has sugar, but its &lt;a href="https://www.healthdigest.com/1075718/unexpected-health-benefits-of-naturally-occurring-sugars/" target="_blank"&gt;naturally occurring sugars can have blood sugar benefits&lt;/a&gt; because of its fiber content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Can't find fresh passion fruit? The fruit's juice may also give you blood sugar management advantages, despite its low fiber content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;For example, findings from a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10899059/#bib18" target="_blank"&gt;2024 study&lt;/a&gt; from Current Research in Physiology showed that when subjects drank passion fruit juice, their post-meal blood sugar levels significantly dropped compared to subjects who drank a placebo beverage. Subjects also saw an improvement in their ability to focus on certain tasks, which might give you another reason to try passion fruit juice alone or in a tropical passion fruit juice smoothie. The aforementioned study also reported a dip in the systolic blood pressure readings of subjects who consumed passion fruit juice, offering a window into the potential heart-friendliness of passion fruit and its natural byproducts.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;div class="news-article"&gt;

				            &lt;div class="columns-holder "&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;What makes passion fruit good for your heart? In its raw form, passion fruit contains fiber, and fiber can be useful in lowering cholesterol and blood pressure. However, even passion fruit juice may possess cardioprotective capabilities because of its antioxidants. A &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6722928/" target="_blank"&gt;2019 article&lt;/a&gt; from Biomolecules recommended using antioxidants to benefit the heart and vascular system without the need for drugs. The article concluded that consuming antioxidants could be a valid therapy for treating cardiovascular conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Even if you juice your passion fruit, you won't lose antioxidants in the finished product, as determined in a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0963996918300206" target="_blank"&gt;2018 study&lt;/a&gt; that was outlined in Food Research International. The experiment demonstrated that passion fruit juice had antioxidant stability, bioavailability, and functionality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Passion fruit may provide another benefit as well: improved sleep. As mentioned, passion fruit contains sizable amounts of magnesium. And magnesium may make it easier to fall asleep as well as allow you to sleep longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;You can't depend on the magnesium in passion fruit to solve all your snoozing issues, though. In an interview with the &lt;a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/does-magnesium-help-you-sleep" target="_blank"&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;, Dr. Naoki Umeda, an integrative medicine specialist, said that the studies around taking magnesium to support sleep aren't conclusive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;However, Dr. Umeda admits that "some people have found it helps them", so he's not opposed to the practice since magnesium "may help regulate neurotransmitters that are directly related to sleep." And that's a good excuse to try this tiny but mighty fruit.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;

    
&lt;/article&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A piece of chewed birch bark tar gum unearthed in western Sweden has unlocked a window into ancient life, revealing the oldest known human DNA in the region. First excavated in the early 1990s from the &lt;strong&gt;Huseby Klev&lt;/strong&gt; site, this 10,000-year-old artifact was originally thought to be just another example of Stone Age tool-making material. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-2"&gt;

    
    &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="1096651400" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
    
    
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;But decades later, new DNA sequencing techniques have confirmed that this humble piece of prehistoric gum once passed through the mouths of three individuals — &lt;strong&gt;two women and one man&lt;/strong&gt; — providing genetic insights that were previously impossible to obtain.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A Rare Genetic Snapshot From Ancient Scandinavia&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the early Mesolithic period, &lt;strong&gt;birch bark tar&lt;/strong&gt; was widely used by hunter-gatherer societies across Europe as an adhesive in tool production. But its secondary role as a chewing gum may have been just as common. Researchers now believe ancient people chewed the bark either during downtime or while working, leaving behind invaluable traces of their DNA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Human remains from this era in Scandinavia are exceedingly rare, and those that have been found usually contain poorly preserved genetic material. According to the &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-019-0399-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;study published in Communications Biology&lt;/a&gt;, scientists at Stockholm University were finally able to unlock DNA hidden in the bark thanks to modern advancements. As researcher &lt;strong&gt;Anders Götherström&lt;/strong&gt; explained, “Much of our history is visible in the DNA we carry with us, so we try to look for DNA wherever we believe we can find it.”&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Tracing Ancient Migrations through DNA&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When scientists analyzed the preserved chewed material, they discovered strong links between the three individuals and ancient populations from &lt;strong&gt;Ice Age Europe&lt;/strong&gt;. Interestingly, the tools found at the Huseby Klev site appear to have originated in Russia, offering dual evidence of prehistoric movement into Scandinavia from both the &lt;strong&gt;East European Plain&lt;/strong&gt; and Southern Europe.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These findings align with previous hypotheses about dual migration routes into the region. As &lt;strong&gt;Natalija Kashuba&lt;/strong&gt; of the Museum of Cultural History in Oslo put it, researchers were “really impressed that archaeologists took care during the excavations and preserved such fragile material.” She described the breakthrough as “almost forensic research,” as scientists sequenced DNA from “mastic lumps” that had been discarded 10,000 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Unlocking Ancient Lifestyles From Chewing Bark&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Beyond migration patterns, this ancient gum has the potential to uncover intimate aspects of prehistoric life — including diet, health, and social structure. According to &lt;strong&gt;Per Persson&lt;/strong&gt;, also from the Museum of Cultural History in Oslo, “&lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/05/traces-unknown-human-tibetan-dna/" data-type="post" data-id="91243"&gt;DNA &lt;/a&gt;from these ancient chewing gums have an enormous potential not only for tracing the origin and movement of peoples long time ago, but also for providing insights in their social relations, diseases, and food.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Although birch bark tar chewing might not seem unusual given its documented use as glue, its role in preserving genetic history is now beyond question. The two casts of the bark, which clearly show distinct &lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2024/07/komodo-dragons-iron-teeth-new-discovery/" data-type="post" data-id="7030"&gt;teeth &lt;/a&gt;marks, reveal a brief but intimate moment frozen in time — one that offers modern science a rare glimpse into the people who once inhabited early Scandinavia.&lt;/p&gt;

                                    &lt;p&gt;The menopause years aren’t just hot flashes and irregular periods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet, Tiffini Sarver, 44, of Lincoln Square, said growing up these were the only two menopause symptoms she’d heard about from school health classes and watching her mom’s “really bad” experience with hot flashes. The air conditioner was always on, Sarver remembered. Otherwise, she said, no one ever discussed it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sarver expected menopause to be one event ending when the periods stopped after a few years of hot flashes and menstrual cycle changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in her late 30s, she started having seasonal allergies that got progressively worse. Anxiety and memory issues followed. Sarver said her doctor confirmed her suspicions of menopause-related brain fog and allergies: “It blew my mind but made sense.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across the U.S., Sarver is one of 75 million women in one of the three stages of menopause: perimenopause, menopause or postmenopause, with 6,000 women reaching the menopause milestone daily, according to the nonprofit Let’s Talk Menopause. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Women’s health experts attribute commonly held myths and misconceptions to the stigma of menopause, research gaps from inadequate funding and undervaluing women’s health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s not one menopause syndrome, or collection of symptoms, that every single person gets, that’s a myth,” said Dr. Monica Christmas, associate medical director of the The Menopause Society and director of the Menopause Program at the University of Chicago. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 80% of people get hot flashes, she said. Even then, symptoms can vary in frequency and intensity, if experienced at all. Some women are more sensitive to hormonal fluctuations and grapple with debilitating hourly recurrences; others may experience less bothersome flashes twice a week, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="Enhancement" data-align-floatleft&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sarver, a finance and billing specialist, has never had a hot flash. She expressed surprise that symptoms could be so varied. While data is limited, emerging research supports that lower estrogen levels occurring around menopause can make sinonasal symptoms, such as allergies, worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What’s behind menopause misinformation?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lack of health care provider training, social media and inadequate research are core reasons for menopause misinformation, according to professor Pauline Maki, director of the Center for Health, Awareness and Research on Menopause (CHARM) at the University of Illinois Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maki attributed the training shortfall to the legacy of the 1990s Women’s Health Initiative study, which linked hormone therapy to breast cancer and heart disease. In turn, she said, medical schools stopped teaching about menopause and developing a pipeline of knowledgeable providers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seeking answers, she said women often go online. Maki warned, though, most social media accounts are influencers not recognized as medical experts in the field of menopause medicine: “That doesn’t align with the practice of evidence-based medicine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Globally, menopause research is an underfunded and underprioritized area of public health, Maki and other experts agreed. Doctors only receive on average two hours of perimenopause and menopause education, one study reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In March, actress Halle Berry joined Maki in Chicago to promote menopause awareness through public education and policy. At the event, hosted by the University of Illinois Chicago, Berry shared the story of her doctor misdiagnosing her perimenopause symptoms of pain from vaginal dryness as herpes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The experience spurred the actress to be an on-the-ground advocate for greater menopause research funding, quality of care and health care access for women navigating midlife — and the changes that come with it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="Enhancement" data-align-center&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The menopause conversation remains stigmatized. “Periods are a taboo topic,” Christmas said, while Maki noted women are especially reluctant to discuss sexual symptoms with doctors, who frequently cannot answer their questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Illinois Senate Majority Leader Kimberly A. Lightford and Lt. Gov. Juliana Stratton are aiming to change that through policy: They backed state Senate Joint Resolution 25, which both chambers recently adopted, designating October 12-18 as Menopause Awareness Week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Myths unraveled&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, there’s much to unpack about the menopause years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perimenopause is the transitional phase that women’s health experts say can start up to 10 years before natural menopause, which happens after a year without a period, typically around age 51.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hormone fluctuations that begin during this transition can cause a constellation of symptoms including night sweats, sleep disruptions, heart palpitations and anxiety. Despite most every woman experiencing menopause if she reaches midlife, there’s frequent misconceptions surrounding what to expect — and when.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here, leading health experts and women at different life stages weigh in on common menopause myths and share their personal journeys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Myth: Hot flashes, or night sweats, disappear after a couple years&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hot flashes affect some groups of women more than others. Research shows Black women experience symptoms on average 10 years compared to 6.5 years for white women and Latin women 8.9 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Diane Campbell, 62, of Western Springs, the first signs of perimenopause — brain fog, anxiety and mood swings — appeared at age 39. During her 50s, the “serious” hot flashes started — and continued postmenopause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Campbell, a retired high school guidance and college counselor, recalled going to doctors, describing her angry feelings, sleeplessness and night sweats, and being told to take antidepressants: “And I wasn’t depressed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Six doctors later, she found a gynecologist who understood her concerns and experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In January, Campbell began a hormone replacement therapy regimen of twice-weekly estrogen patches and vaginal cream for libido, chronic urinary tract infections and vaginal dryness — all symptoms that can continue beyond menopause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Valentine’s Day, she awoke to a gift: sleeping through the night without night sweats. The itchy skin and spiral thinking, also gone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My quality of life has improved significantly. I feel like I’ve got my life back — and didn’t even feel like pieces were missing until I got on hormones,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Myth: You can’t get pregnant during perimenopause&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Traci Kurtzer, a gynecologist and nationally recognized menopause expert, said women can still get pregnant during the perimenopause transition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She emphasized that until officially menopausal, pregnancy is always possible. Even with low fertility rates, there’s a chance a released egg can be fertilized, she said. She acknowledged being surprised by “how many people still don’t realize that there is still a pregnancy risk in our 40s, and potentially early 50s.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Myth: Hormone replacement therapy is the only option to ease menopausal symptoms&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Paula Neale, of Edgewater, entered perimenopause in her late 40s, life became an emotional roller coaster. She cried, got upset more easily and communication with her then-husband became strained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I just didn’t seem to be myself,” said Neale, a commercial lease manager at Northwestern University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By her early 50s, she’d hit menopause and gained 20 pounds. She’d never before had to diet or exercise, and this new body frustrated her. In postmenopause, the hot flashes and night sweats emerged, and she repeatedly asked for hormone replacement therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But doctors said she was “too old.” Since January, Neale, now 66, has found support at the Northwestern Medicine Center for Sexual Medicine and Menopause clinic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, she takes a daily non-hormonal prescribed pill, Veozah, to ease hot flashes and night sweats. She’s embraced her doctor’s words: “There is no reason for any woman to have to suffer menopause symptoms.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="Enhancement" data-align-center&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Myth: If you have the BRCA gene mutation, hormones are off limits&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Someone with a BRCA gene mutation has an increased lifetime risk for breast and other cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That doesn’t automatically make them off limits for using hormones,” Kurtzer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She stressed the importance of people having individualized discussions with their doctors that include a risk assessment and review of prior medical treatments and potential benefits of hormone therapy to overall health. She attributed the myth to fear and misinformation of the connection between breast cancer and hormone therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Myth: Menopause doesn’t start until 50s&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The normal range of menopause is between the ages of 45 and 55, but it can happen earlier. Before the age of 45 is called early menopause, before age 40, premature menopause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Early menopause is about 5% of the population, and premature menopause, depending on the source, is about 1% to 3% of the population,” Christmas said. It can be induced by surgery, radiation, chemotherapy or occur naturally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lot of younger women under 40 don’t realize some of the symptoms they’re having could signal early menopause, Kurtzer said. “They’re often dismissed by their physicians and being told, ‘Oh, you’re too young for this to happen to you,’” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

But now there is a surprising rapidly growing market for it: middle aged women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson still puts in his protein shake to “put on size,” Ivanka Trump revealed earlier this year she takes a dose with her morning smoothie. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From fitness influencers on TikTok to health experts, the chalky powder is now being touted for a range of benefits for &lt;a href="/topic/women"&gt;women&lt;/a&gt;.

Creatine may also offer benefits tied to hormonal fluctuations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Creatine can help ease fatigue during your period by supporting stable energy levels,” Rupar continued, “especially when you’re feeling more tired.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oestrogen and progesterone, &lt;a href="/topic/hormones"&gt;hormones&lt;/a&gt; that regulate the menstrual cycle, influence how the body produces and uses creatine, he explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“During the menstrual cycle, creatine levels can change, and supplements may help keep energy and muscle function more stable, especially when oestrogen is low,” Rupar said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 hmmOgn sc-482ou5-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="4" class="sc-482ou5-0 fcVRZz"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/07/02/13/57/AdobeStock_499615526.jpeg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/07/02/13/57/AdobeStock_499615526.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/07/02/13/57/AdobeStock_499615526.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Creatine may help women support muscle strength, brain function, and energy levels" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-482ou5-1 kJMYuf" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-23363"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 bpFomM hgzWpY"&gt;Creatine may help women support muscle strength, brain function, and energy levels&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 CXMrn"&gt;

have breached the fluids that surround eggs and travel with sperm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team led by Dr. Emilio Gómez‑Sánchez of Next Fertility Murcia in Spain scanned &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/follicular-fluid" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;follicular fluid&lt;/a&gt; from 29 women and seminal fluid from 22 men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The experts found microplastics in 69 percent of the women and 55 percent of the men they studied. According to Dr. Gómez‑Sánchez, the team was surprised to find that the particles were so widespread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-plastics-in-human-reproductive-fluids"&gt;Plastics in human reproductive fluids&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study detected polymers such as &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/polytetrafluoroethylene" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;polytetrafluoroethylene&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://adrecoplastics.co.uk/polypropylene-uses/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;polypropylene&lt;/a&gt;, materials better known for slick frying pans and food packaging. Seeing them next to human eggs turns a theoretical hazard into a measurable one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back in 2021, Italian obstetricians spotted twelve plastic fragments in every placenta they examined, confirming that particles smaller than five millimeters can cross the &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33395930/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;maternal‑fetal boundary&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly sized particles have been uncovered deep in &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35364151/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;lung tissue&lt;/a&gt; removed during surgery, proving that inhalation is a realistic delivery route for &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/simple-way-to-remove-microplastics-from-tap-water-home-faucet/"&gt;plastic&lt;/a&gt; dust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers in the Netherlands have even measured plastic mass circulating in human blood samples, an &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35367073/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;observation&lt;/a&gt; that explains how fragments migrate to distant tissues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-plastics-enter-the-human-body"&gt;How plastics enter the human body&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people take in &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/microplastics-in-human-brains-may-affect-mental-health/"&gt;plastic&lt;/a&gt; flecks by eating, drinking, or breathing, because everyday products shed invisible dust whenever they are heated, abraded, or exposed to sunlight. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once swallowed or inhaled, particles small enough can slip through the gut wall or the thin air‑blood membrane in the lungs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Animal studies suggest that fragments under one micrometer can enter cells directly, whereas larger shards get trapped in tissue and spark local irritation. Either way, they bypass the body’s usual waste filters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Laboratory work on mice shows that digestive uptake rises when &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/airborne-microplastics-where-they-come-from-and-where-they-go/"&gt;microplastics&lt;/a&gt; hitchhike on fats, a detail that matters for fertility research because reproductive hormones ride on similar lipid highways. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The overlap raises worry that plastics may act as endocrine mimics or carriers for other chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Gómez‑Sánchez’s team avoided laboratory contamination by collecting every human sample in glass vials and verifying the absence of background plastic. This means the polymers they found were genuine residents, not stray lab dust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-plastic-harms-fertility"&gt;Plastic harms fertility&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mice exposed to polystyrene fragments shed sperm with damaged DNA and sluggish movement, effects traced to &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31896473/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;oxidative stress&lt;/a&gt; that overwhelms antioxidant defenses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Separate &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36948006/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;work&lt;/a&gt; on rodent Leydig cells shows shriveled mitochondria after nanoplastic exposure, which throttles testosterone production and shrinks litter sizes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reviews published in 2024 concluded that microplastics can disrupt the &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38750730/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;hypothalamic‑pituitary‑gonadal axis&lt;/a&gt;, leading to hormonal imbalances and faulty egg maturation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because human oocytes develop over months, chronic exposure could matter more than a short spike. That makes the repeated detection of PTFE in both eggs and sperm especially noteworthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-plastic-levels-in-eggs-and-sperm"&gt;Plastic levels in eggs and sperm&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the current data set, PTFE appeared in 31 percent of sampled egg fluid and 41 percent of semen. PP ranked second among women and &lt;a href="https://www.chemicalsafetyfacts.org/chemicals/polystyrene/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;polystyrene&lt;/a&gt; second among men, with &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/polyethylene-terephthalate" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;polyethylene terephthalate&lt;/a&gt; also present but in smaller numbers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Annual plastic output has climbed from under two million tons in 1950 to about 460 million in 2019, a 230‑fold jump documented by the &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36969097/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Minderoo‑Monaco Commission on Plastics and Human Health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each uptick in production increases litter, weathering, and fragment release, tightening the feedback loop between plastics and people. Reproductive cells, delicate by design, stand on the front line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gómez‑Sánchez reported that most reproductive samples contained only one or two plastic particles, amounts considered low compared with overall debris in the fluids. Yet fertility specialists note that even trace metals can derail embryo development, so particle counts alone may not predict risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-human-fertility-research-must-include-plastics"&gt;Human fertility research must include plastics&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They should be considered an additional argument in favor of avoiding the generalized use of plastics in our daily lives,” said Professor Carlos Calhaz‑Jorge of the University of Lisbon. He also noted that further research is needed to prove causation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team will now study hundreds of patients and link particle loads to embryo quality during &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/22457-ivf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;in vitro fertilization cycles&lt;/a&gt;. Those correlations could supply the first direct human evidence beyond laboratory rodents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They plan lifestyle questionnaires to test whether habits such as heavy bottled‑water use or microwaving food in plastic correlate with higher particle counts. The approach could convert abstract exposure theory into personal advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Microplastics are just one variable in a complex equation,” said Dr. Gómez‑Sánchez. He urges moderation of plastic use rather than alarm. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-simple-habits-to-lower-exposure"&gt;Simple habits to lower exposure&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Switching from plastic bottles to glass or stainless steel lowers ingestion because heat and time no longer leach particles from container walls. Replacing scratched nonstick pans can cut PTFE flakes in the diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers advise skipping plastic cutting boards and using ceramic or bamboo instead, because knife action liberates shavings that cling to food. Letting take‑out cool before transferring it from polystyrene boxes also helps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Air purifiers with HEPA filters capture airborne fibers shed by synthetic textiles, a step especially useful for nurseries. Regular vacuuming with a sealed system keeps particles from resuspending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These tweaks are not foolproof, yet they come with side benefits like removing chemical additives that ride on plastic dust. They buy time while science sorts out the clinical stakes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-efforts-to-cut-human-plastics-pollution"&gt;Efforts to cut human plastics pollution&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public‑health researchers argue that personal choices alone cannot outrun a supply chain making more than a billion pounds of new plastic every day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Negotiators at the United Nations are hammering out a global treaty that could cap production and streamline recycling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bc.edu/bc-web/schools/morrissey/departments/biology/people/faculty-directory/Phil-Landrigan.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Dr. Philip Landrigan&lt;/a&gt; of Boston College calls the treaty a once‑in‑a‑generation chance to protect human health, because curbing output remains the only sure way to slow microplastic fallout. He points to the emerging fertility data as evidence that time is short.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether lawmakers act or not, the science of sub‑visible plastic is moving fast thanks to sharper imaging tools and nanomechanical sensors. Studies that once took months now finish in days, filling the literature with fresh clues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every new dataset sharpens the same picture: plastics weather into dust, the dust goes everywhere, and living tissue keeps no closed doors. Eggs and sperm, it turns out, are no exception.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the journal &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/humrep#google_vignette" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Human Reproduction&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Sat, 05 Jul 2025 15:32:12 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijwFBVV95cUxQSWRTV19pTUZhQ3lMYWpNOFBpRUMxeUF1clV3eU1fbTRQTkw5VERGRjBtaTJ0enVSZHVINlNtVU82OG1OdzVqQjcxNzQzSFRQN2xfRi14MHRxSHNNUzJUcnF0NS1kNjV1U2V2VjhZczZ1QjM3R3RJLUlDMDlvZV9wSW5yUGpqOXE2UHI3enQ1dw</guid></item></channel></rss>
