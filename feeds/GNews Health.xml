Last year, 14 people in New York City were &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.health.ny.gov/press/releases/2025/2025-02-27_measles.htm" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;diagnosed with the illness&lt;/a&gt;, with an additional case elsewhere in New York State.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;But an unfolding outbreak of the disease in West Texas and New Mexico has cast a spotlight on measles, which is highly contagious and can prove deadly and is sometimes heralded by a rash. That outbreak has emerged at the same time that Robert F. Kennedy Jr., an anti-vaccine activist who &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/04/health/texas-measles-outbreak-kennedy.html" title=""&gt;advocates unconventional treatments&lt;/a&gt;, has become President Trump’s secretary of health and human services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;With measles so much in the news, residents of New York and New Jersey might be feeling concerned. Here’s what to know about the cases in the region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;h2 class="css-13o6u42 eoo0vm40" id="link-1d3d1d2b"&gt;Should I be concerned about the local cases?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Neither of the two patients in New York State, both of whom live in New York City, had been vaccinated against measles — one was an infant and too young to be immunized — and the cases are not related, according to the city’s health department. The first case was reported in January, and the second in February. Both patients have recovered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;In New Jersey, all three people with confirmed cases of measles this year were not vaccinated against the virus. A person from Bergen County who had traveled internationally was the first of the three patients to be diagnosed, on Feb. 14, according to the state’s health department. Two people who had been in close contact with the first patient were diagnosed nearly a week later and were quarantined to minimize the chances of spreading the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-1336jj"&gt;&lt;div class="css-121kum4"&gt;&lt;p class="css-171quhb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-asuuk5"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-7axq9l" data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true" class="css-1b5b8u1"&gt;&lt;path fill="currentColor" fill-rule="evenodd" d="M2.5 12a9.5 9.5 0 1 1 19 0 9.5 9.5 0 0 1-19 0Zm8.5 1.75v-7.5h2v7.5h-2Zm0 2v2h2v-2h-2Z" clip-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;div data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript-message" class="css-6yo1no"&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;We are having trouble retrieving the article content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dv1kvn" id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

Seven were unvaccinated. The vaccination status of the other three people is unknown. Six of the cases were in adults and the rest were in children younger than 17.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;On Tuesday, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced that they were sending a team to Texas to help local public health officials respond to the outbreak, which began in late January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Measles – one of the most infectious diseases in the world – is a respiratory virus that can survive in the air for up to two hours. Up to nine out of 10 people who are susceptible will get the virus if exposed, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The measles, mumps and rubella vaccine is safe and highly effective at preventing infection and severe cases. The first shot is recommended for children aged 12-15 months, and the second for those aged four to six.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“We don’t want to see New Mexicans getting sick or dying from measles,” said Dr Chad Smelser, the deputy state epidemiologist. “The measles-mumps-rubella vaccine is the best protection against this serious disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The crisis in Texas comes as the US Department of &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/health" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt; and Human Services (HHS) transitions under the leadership of Robert F Kennedy Jr, a well-known vaccine skeptic. Kennedy has long promoted the discredited theory linking childhood vaccinations to autism. One of his first actions in office was to postpone a public meeting on immunization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Kennedy raised alarm among pediatricians, vaccine experts and lawmakers after publishing an opinion piece that&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/04/rfk-jr-vitamins-measles-outbreak" data-link-name="in body link"&gt; focused on vitamin A and nutrition&lt;/a&gt; as treatments for measles and did not endorse vaccines. In response to the Texas measles outbreak, Kennedy wrote for Fox News about the benefits of “good nutrition” and vitamin A, but did not explicitly recommend highly effective vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class=" dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-10" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;skip past newsletter promotion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="EmailSignup-skip-link-10" tabindex="0" aria-label="after newsletter promotion" role="note" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;after newsletter promotion&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;According to the CDC, measles is fatal for one to two out of every 1,000 infected children. The virus also weakens the immune system over time and leaves those affected more vulnerable to future infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;In the US, about one in five unvaccinated people will require hospitalization from measles, according to &lt;a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/2025/what-to-know-about-measles-and-vaccines" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health&lt;/a&gt;.

All had experienced the problem for more than two years and other treatments, such as smell training and corticosteroids, had failed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;In a study aiming to find new ways to resolve the issue, surgeons tried a technique called functional septorhinoplasty (fSRP), which is typically used to correct any deviation of the nasal septum, increasing the size of nasal passageways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;This boosts airflow into the olfactory region, at the roof of the nasal cavity, which controls smell. Doctors said the surgery enabled an increased amount of odorants – chemical compounds that have a smell – to reach the roof of the nose, where sense of smell is located.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;They believe that increasing the delivery of odorants to this area “kickstarts” smell recovery in patients who have &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/dec/24/do-me-a-flavour-adjusting-to-life-without-a-sense-of-smell-after-covid" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;lost their sense of smell to long Covid&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Prof Peter Andrews, a senior consultant surgeon in rhinology and facial plastic surgery who led the research, said surgery increased the airway by about 30%, so airflow also increased by about 30%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“This study has shown impressive results – if we apply the principle of increasing the nasal or olfactory airway, we’re getting a reactivation of the sense of smell and then an improvement of the sense of smell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“With long Covid anosmia you’ve got patients, fundamentally, who can’t smell or smell very poorly, so we need to somehow wake them up. And this operation sort of does that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“It sort of wakes up the olfactory mucosa and then it builds on it through the increased nasal airway – hitting that area, more odorants hitting that area – and we’re getting this impressive recovery in the majority of the patients. All patients we operated on improved.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;In the trial, 12 patients had fSRP and a control group of 13 patients continued with smell training – sniffing the same scents repeatedly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;All patients who had fSRP reported an improved sense of smell compared with none of the patients in the sniff test group, where 40% actually reported a worsening sense of smell. The results were published in the journal Facial Plastic Surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;One of the patients, Penelope Newman, 27, from south London, said her taste and smell had “almost returned to normal” after the operation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“Before I had the surgery on my nose, I had begun to accept that I would probably never be able to smell or taste things the way I used to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“Since the surgery, I have begun to enjoy food and smells the same way I used to. I can now cook and eat garlic and onions and people can cook for me too. I can go out to eat with my friends and family.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Fri, 07 Mar 2025 00:01:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMixwFBVV95cUxQZnBvQ0FPa3BtTjBvOGw2bl9Wc1ZzS0U2YkdYckYyaXVDbW9HdWpCdFdnODVoZ0NFY3ZBZUhQUnJiZ1Q5dDZIYmU3MzU4Qy0weTFBUll0a29sMXEwY1lvVGRpTzhsLXAycHRTQ1ZUWE9xSk14bHJBVm1hZGRvREdNVFgyODIwSlY3UDhEMWVnVWJ3SWcza1FJb0Z5VWRYMTZod3JsMjJjaE5adGdyNkt6TkJjTndxVVhkV0tidHRtZ1ByU1dMbVc0</guid></item><item><title>Unvaccinated New Mexico Resident Dies of Suspected Measles - The New York Times</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie0FVX3lxTE95cFNTV0dlLTJNbHZiQ1lyT0txZjUyZmtkUnVYYXcwM2ZBMXpIaERuY3lFbm5GUzZ6TzNmeTBaQi1FOXVOT1VaRHdySmpTaE04cGdqVU5FSFpDYzRBaGg5TDhRRkI2X1BxUnRKQjNHREtRdkdqWE1BbVBJOA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-0"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;An unvaccinated person who died in New Mexico has tested positive for measles, state health officials said on Thursday, possibly the second such fatality in a growing outbreak that began in West Texas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The officials have not yet confirmed that measles was the cause of death, and said the person did not seek medical treatment before dying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The announcement came a little over a week after a &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/26/us/texas-measles-outbreak-death.html" title=""&gt;child died&lt;/a&gt; of measles in Gaines County, Texas, the first such death in the United States in 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Ten cases of measles, six adults and four children, have been reported in Lea County, N.M., which borders Gaines County, the epicenter of the West Texas outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;This outbreak has been a trial by fire of the new secretary of health and human services, Robert F.

Kennedy Jr. pledged that they would talk to “front-line doctors and see what is working on the ground” and learn about therapeutics “ignored” by the agency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;There is a highly effective vaccine that prevents measles but no specific antiviral to treat it. Kennedy has previously pushed the use of vitamin A, and in an interview with Fox News this week, he endorsed an unconventional treatment regimen for measles including a steroid, an antibiotic and cod liver oil, which is rich in vitamin A.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In the interview, which was posted in full on Fox Nation, Kennedy praised two West Texas doctors who he said were using this remedy on their patients and had seen “almost miraculous and instantaneous recovery.” He said these doctors had “treated most of the patients” in the current outbreak, which has now reached 159 reported cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;One of the doctors Kennedy is apparently taking cues from has troubled history. He was disciplined by the Texas Medical Board in 2003 for “unusual use of risk-filled medications.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Kennedy said HHS would do a clinical trial on the steroid budesonide, the antibiotic clarithromycin and cod liver oil therapies and said “we recommend to local physicians that they consider vitamin A and their protocols. He also suggested that vitamin A may work “as a prophylaxis,” although doctors say it does not prevent measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;However, Kennedy &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/robert-f-kennedy-jr-measles-outbreak-call-action-all-us" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:says measles vaccination;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;says measles vaccination&lt;/a&gt;, which can prevent most cases, is a personal choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“At this point, we are recommending that people in those [undervaccinated] communities get vaccines. We understand a lot of them will not, and we’re going to try to make sure that they’re taken care of through the best therapeutic interventions that we can provide them or recommend for them,” Kennedy said in the Fox interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;Doctor was disciplined over treatments&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;One of the doctors Kennedy praised, Dr. Richard Bartlett, has a history of using unconventional treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Bartlett faced &lt;a href="https://profile.tmb.state.tx.us/BoardActions.aspx?5c10c894-afcc-4791-8e3c-e81b0b7998ff" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:disciplinary action;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;disciplinary action&lt;/a&gt; from the Texas Medical Board more than two decades ago for “unusual” prescribing of antibiotics and steroids in five patients, including two children. None of the patients had measles; they came in with a variety of complaints including diabetes, back and neck pain, sinus pressure, inflamed tonsils and other cold symptoms, obesity and uncontrollable hunger, according to the medical board’s investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;After reviewing the patients’ medical records, the board found that Bartlett misdiagnosed their symptoms and mismanaged their care, ordering unnecessary tests and treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In a 2003 order, the board cited Bartlett for inappropriately using medications such as powerful IV antibiotics and “multi-day doses” of long-acting steroids “without any documentation in the records of the weighing of risk versus benefits of this care.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Bartlett did not respond to CNN’s request for comment on the medical board’s disciplinary action, or on the basis of his use of steroids and antibiotics for the treatment of measles in West Texas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The board’s final order stated that the “respondent maintains that he treated the patients appropriately, with no adverse outcomes, considering that he was providing care to a relatively underserved area with limited resources and medical support.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Bartlett was cleared to return to practice without supervision in 2005 after adhering to the board’s requests, such as completing additional medical education and having another doctor chosen by the medical board monitor him for at least a year. He also indicated that he would modify his practice accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;During the pandemic, Bartlett said he treated Covid-19 patients with what he called his &lt;a href="https://www.newswest9.com/article/news/local/local-doctor-believes-he-has-found-silver-bullet-for-covid-19/513-8cd065d2-dbb5-4814-9cdd-5bb0dae77703" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:silver bullet;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;silver bullet&lt;/a&gt;: an experimental combination of budesonide, which is a steroid; the antibiotic clarithromycin; and aspirin. Bartlett often talked about the treatment on podcasts and in interviews, including some widely shared on social media. An independent fact-checking group &lt;a href="https://science.feedback.org/review/no-evidence-budesonide-clarithromycin-aspirin-combination-silver-bullet-treatment-covid-contrary-texas-doctors-claim/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:found that his claims;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;found that his claims&lt;/a&gt; about the therapy were unsupported by scientific evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Both measles and Covid are caused by viruses. Antibiotics, which kill bacteria, are powerless against viral infections. Medical experts say antibiotics can sometimes be helpful if a viral infection causes a secondary bacterial infection, such as an ear infection or pneumonia. But they’re not appropriate or helpful in every case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Steroids have been tried in people with measles who develop a very rare complication that leads to brain swelling, but using them in milder cases may be harmful because they dampen the body’s immune response just when it is needed to fight the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;A virus ‘that doesn’t really discriminate’&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;There is no specific treatment for measles. In severe cases, doctors may offer treatments such as supplemental oxygen and fluids to help patients get through the worst of their illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Dr. Lara Johnson, Covenant Health’s chief medical officer, said its Lubbock, Texas, hospital has treated more than 20 patients and that hospital physicians have followed recommended treatment protocol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/hcp/clinical-overview/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:CDC;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt; recommends two doses of physician-administered vitamin A in cases of severe measles, such as people who are hospitalized. Infectious disease experts also recommend vitamin A in these cases, but they note that the vitamin is most useful in impoverished countries where children are significantly malnourished.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The HHS secretary said the people in West Texas who were getting sick, including a school-age child who died last week, may have had malnutrition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“It’s very, very difficult … for measles to kill a healthy person,” Kennedy said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;However, the &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:state health department;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;state health department&lt;/a&gt; reported that the child who died had no underlying conditions, and local doctors disagree with the secretary’s assessment of the population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Our children are actually very well nourished. [That’s] another concerning comment, because I think it makes people have a false sense of, ‘Well, my kid is well nourished, so they’re not going to get this,’” said Dr. Leslie Motheral, a pediatrician in Lubbock, where the outbreak is growing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Whether you have underlying medical problems or you are healthy, measles can be detrimental. It’s the kind of virus that doesn’t really discriminate.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Kennedy claimed in the Fox interview to have seen “studies that show [vitamin A] is good for prophylaxis,” but medical experts say it has no use for measles prevention. High doses can even be toxic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“There’s not evidence that vitamin A has any preventative benefits,” said Dr. Peter Hotez, co-director of the Center for Vaccine Development at Texas Children’s Hospital. “The worry is that it’s being weaponized by the health and wellness industry.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The only way to prevent measles is to get the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, according to experts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Kennedy is “talking about treatment for children with or anyone with measles, treatment of people with measles that can be prevented by vaccines,” said Dr. William Moss, a pediatrician and infectious disease expert at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. “Vaccines actually prevent people from getting measles, so you don’t need to treat them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;Vaccines prevent measles, vitamin A doesn’t&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Kennedy’s soft sell of the measles vaccine amid an outbreak has stunned public health experts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Two doses of the vaccine are 97% effective at preventing measles. Immunity from the shot is long-lasting, too. When the vaccine is used by enough people within a community, measles has nowhere to spread. It can be eliminated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Experts say Kennedy’s emphasis on treatments has muddled the message.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://x.com/DrGiroir/status/1896353987093246011" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:post on X;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;post on X&lt;/a&gt;, Admiral Dr. Brett Giroir, a pediatrician and former US assistant secretary for health during the first Trump administration, thanked Kennedy for “emphasizing the critical importance” of the measles vaccine. “But please do not rely on #VitaminA to save your child in the US - helps in Africa where there is a deficiency-not here. I have both treated and buried children with measles,” he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In Kennedy’s interview on Fox, the HHS secretary was also eager to talk about vaccine injuries and risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“The CDC, in the past, has not done a good job at quantifying the risk of vaccines,” Kennedy said. “We are going to do that now so that people can make a real, informed choice about what’s best for them, for their families and their communities.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Experts said that hearing this from the nation’s top public health official was distressing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“He didn’t talk about the effectiveness and safety of the MMR vaccines, then pivoted to vitamin A and talking about how it was sanitation improvements that are bringing down measles rates in the US, and all this other kind of nonsense, and you just don’t do that kind of stuff in the middle of an epidemic,” Hotez said. “It was really disheartening to see that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Others echoed that sentiment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“If it were someone on the sidelines kind of calling this out, I guess it would be less surprising, but to have the secretary of Health and Human Services, who is really responsible for the public’s health to tout this misguided treatment regimen for measles and downplay the role of vaccines and preventing measles,” Moss said. “It’s mind-blowing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;HHS said it would review a detailed list of CNN’s questions about Kennedy’s statements in the interview posted on Fox Nation but did not respond with answers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;Understanding infectious disease&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Kennedy made other misstatements in the Fox interview that downplayed infectious diseases and their effects, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;He suggested that bird flu has long been a threat, saying it has “been around for 100 years,” although H5N1 was identified in 1996 in China. It’s not clear whether Kennedy was referring to other flu types that could be carried by birds, a natural reservoir for the viruses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Kennedy further said that about 70 people are known to have gotten sick with bird flu, and “almost all of them were involved in culling operations.” In fact, more dairy workers have caught the virus than people involved in the culling or depopulating of birds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;He said the bird flu strain that originally spread in cattle during the ongoing outbreak, B3.13, “is not very dangerous to humans” because people who have caught it have not been very sick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Dr. Michael Osterholm, who directs the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, says that statement demonstrates that Kennedy doesn’t understand the threat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Unfortunately, we don’t have the luxury of not being afraid of these viruses,” Osterholm said. “We have to take all of them very seriously as a potential cause of the next influenza pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“As long as they’re circulating as they are, that just gives each one of these viruses unlimited shots at the genetic roulette table,” he added. The more people they infect, in other words, the more chances they have to change and become more efficient human pathogens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Kennedy maintained his message that he would tackle chronic disease and “get the really bad stuff out of the food as quickly as possible.” He questioned why the US had the “highest death rate on the planet” from Covid: Was it the infection itself or actually underlying disease in the population at large?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Was it really Covid that was there killing them? Or was it that they were so sick that they were hanging off the cliff and Covid just came and stomped on their fingernails?” he asked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“If you are healthy, it’s almost impossible for you to be killed by an infectious disease,” Kennedy said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Experts say this typical of Kennedy’s communication: He starts with a kernel of truth, but his conclusions on an issue are often incorrect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Kennedy is right that people with underlying health conditions are more likely to get sicker when they get an infectious disease. But it’s not true that people who are in good health are impervious to viruses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“He’s saying some truth, right? He’s saying things that are wrong, but there’s some truth to it,” said Carlos del Rio, an infectious disease expert and distinguished professor of medicine at Emory University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Measles is an infection that can make even healthy children very sick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“I really want to plead to mothers to vaccinate their kids,” del Rio said. “That is a highly effective strategy. In this country, in 2025, we should not see measles.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CNN’s Amanda Sealy, Meg Tirrell and Nadia Kounang contributed to this report.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at &lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com/account/register?source=external-feeds_iluminar&amp;amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo&amp;amp;registration_email_campaign=https://www.cnn.com/newsletters" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:CNN.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;CNN.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Thu, 06 Mar 2025 23:45:56 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikgFBVV95cUxNM0VIbnpDMmVGTnV4UzZLdnBBaGdVMWJlWlNGQ1hQaEJlMXdUYmFLcmc3d3Q1a2FSYVdtM3JuZGZzLUJiZV9QQ1podEZnc3lRa2dLcGw5N2F1aWdySE1RakVPRE43MkdhaGdxRXRaNllCQjU5ZnA1TWV3M1Z4QWlOMjEtNFlvcFdVZ2FKbWZIaEdjZw</guid></item><item><title>1st case of measles detected in Florida - ABC News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihAFBVV95cUxPMzlUUm9lRWRYa0NORTRLVFZUb0lTSFlGZWM0WHpjVlNTeVVIbENRRmNacnJVRmFSTm9jaTNRWUdxSldpU2tJVVBYRkpLQlF2U1FuQ0JqWExBWGFsdEQzV3JiZXdmWXlLLS05ZDlnZDFMZVAwRzhwRERtV08wZTRXVlJzMWU?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="xvlfx ZRifP TKoO eaKKC EcdEg bOdfO qXhdi NFNeu UyHES " data-testid="prism-article-body"&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao MvWXB TjIXL aGjvy ebVHC "&gt;Florida reported its first case of measles so far this year in a high schooler at Palmetto Senior High School.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The state's surgeon general, Dr. Joseph Ladapo, sent a letter to parents at the school on Tuesday, notifying them of the case -- but the Florida Department of Health official stopping short of advocating typical guidelines for school exposures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="oLzSq QrHMO fnRUo pvsTF EhJPu vPlOC zNYgW OsTsW RMeqy daRVX ISNQ sKyCY eRftA acPPc MENS nFwaT MCnQE mEeeY SmBjI xegrY rPLsU iulOd NIuqO zzscu lzDCc aHUBM IEgzD OjMNy eQqcx SVqKB GQmdz jaoD VWDdR ONJdw vrZxD OnRTz gbbfF roDbV GPGwb oMlSS gfNzt oJhud eXZcf zhVlX "&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="InlineImage GpQCA lZur asrEW " data-testid="prism-inline-image"&gt;&lt;figure class="kzIjN GNmeK pYrtp dSqFO " data-testid="prism-figure"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="nMMea bNYiy Mjgpa dGwha DDmxa jgKNG RGHCC aBIU PriDW lZur " data-testid="prism-caption"&gt;&lt;p class="HXPPJ barbu yKsXL IzgMt VcHIt uhSzI YGNMU cRAsZ xqMcl QtRul "&gt;&lt;span class="hsDdd OOSI GpQCA lZur VlFaz " data-testid="prism-truncate"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="gtOSm FbbUW tUtYa vOCwz EQwFq yCufu eEak Qmvg nyTIa SRXVc vzLa jgBfc WXDas CiUCW kqbG zrdEG txGfn ygKVe BbezD UOtxr CVfpq xijV soGRS XgdC sEIlf daWqJ "&gt;Measles virus particle, illustration.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="qinlA IpWvx oqZz tylGM lyWxS nWcVF UhTug PPcLh "&gt;&lt;span class="gtOSm FbbUW tUtYa vOCwz EQwFq yCufu eEak Qmvg nyTIa SRXVc vzLa jgBfc WXDas CiUCW kqbG zrdEG txGfn ygKVe BbezD UOtxr CVfpq xijV soGRS XgdC sEIlf daWqJ YNujN JGtjI aZFDu rkKLh "&gt;STOCK PHOTO/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;After a measles case is detected at a school, common public health recommendations are that unvaccinated children stay at home for up to 21 days, the period of time someone could get infected and spread the virus further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Ladapo's letter to parents noted the recommendations, but referred the decision of whether unvaccinated kids should stay at home to parents, saying, "Due to the high immunity rate in the school, as well as the burden on families and educational cost of healthy children missing school, DOH is deferring to parents or guardians to make decisions about school attendance."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;He also noted that the recommendation may change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The Miami-Dade School District is prepared to provide remote learning to kids whose parents choose to keep them home, the letter said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Serving as Florida's top health official, Ladapo has previously espoused views that contradict standard public health guidance.

&lt;p&gt;There’s nothing better than watching a slab of fresh butter soften and sizzle as you circle it around the skillet. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If just the thought of it makes you jump with ghee, you butter beware — that innocent little rectangle could be melting your chances at longevity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2831265?utm_campaign=articlePDF&amp;amp;utm_medium=articlePDFlink&amp;amp;utm_source=articlePDF&amp;amp;utm_content=jamainternmed.2025.0205" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine linked greater consumption of butter to increased mortality rates, while &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/05/15/health/plant-based-diets-best-for-lowering-disease-cancer-risk-study/"&gt;plant-based&lt;/a&gt; oils offer protective benefits. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Replacing butter with plant-based oils can slash your risk of early death by a whopping 17%, a new study shows. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;motortion – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers analyzed the data of over 200,000 adults and found that replacing &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/03/03/lifestyle/parenting-experts-warn-against-using-butter-to-lull-restless-babies-to-sleep/"&gt;butter&lt;/a&gt; with plant-based oils can slash your risk of premature death by a whopping 17%.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several studies have demonstrated that replacing butter with plant-based oils can yield health benefits, particularly when it comes to &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/02/28/health/heart-disease-could-be-prevented-with-this-one-simple-test/"&gt;cardiovascular health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


	





&lt;p&gt;Stephanie Schiff, a registered dietitian nutritionist at Northwell Health’s &lt;a href="https://huntington.northwell.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Huntington Hospital&lt;/a&gt;, told The Post why butter is so “bad” for you. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Butter has been shown to raise LDL (low-density lipoprotein) cholesterol in the body, which can clog your arteries and increase your risk of &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/02/26/health/your-takeout-containers-could-cause-congestive-heart-failure/"&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt;,” Schiff said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Butter also contains saturated fats, she explained, which are typically solid at room temperature and found in products like butter, coconut oil, lard, cheese and cream.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In contrast, plant-based oils such as olive and &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/07/11/health/5-swaps-for-butter-that-can-improve-cholesterol-lower-disease-risks/"&gt;avocado oil&lt;/a&gt; are rich in monounsaturated fats, which have been linked to a reduced risk of heart disease, as well as anti-inflammatory &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/25/health/fish-oil-supplement-can-add-this-many-years-to-your-life/"&gt;omega-3 fatty acids&lt;/a&gt; — that’s why Schiff uses them “almost exclusively.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Plant-based oils are rich in monounsaturated fats, which have been linked to a reduced risk of heart disease. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;tycoon101 – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;





&lt;p&gt;“I use olive oil in salad dressing, for sautéing foods and sometimes in baking,” she said. “It’s high in &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/06/17/health/6-antioxidant-rich-superfoods-can-help-you-live-longer-dietitian/"&gt;plant phenols&lt;/a&gt; — compounds that work as antioxidants and may help prevent cell damage and reduce the risk of chronic diseases.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She added that avocado oil is also a good source of antioxidants, has a neutral taste and can withstand higher cooking temperatures than olive oil.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Stick with unrefined olive and unrefined avocado oil,” she advised. ”They’re healthier because they retain more nutrients — vitamins, minerals and antioxidants — than processed and refined oils.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;“Stick with unrefined olive and unrefined avocado oil,” one nutritionist advised. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Dušan Zidar – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As for &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/01/31/health/are-seed-oils-really-that-bad-for-you-dietitians-explain-the-risk/"&gt;seed oils&lt;/a&gt;, like cottonseed oil, grapeseed oil and soybean oil, Schiff knows they get a bad rap and have become quite the hot topic on social media.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The problem with seed oils is the high ratio of omega-6 oils to omega-3 oils,” she explained. “A healthy balance of omega-6s to omega-3s (about four-to-one) can help &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/02/06/health/a-handful-of-this-snack-can-boost-mood-and-reduce-cancer-risk/"&gt;reduce inflammation&lt;/a&gt; in the body. High levels of omega-6s versus omega-3s can increase inflammation.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The problem is that “we tend to get a lot of our seed oil from &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/08/26/lifestyle/ultraprocessed-foods-are-everywhere-how-bad-are-they/"&gt;ultra-processed foods&lt;/a&gt;, and the oils in those foods are often highly refined and processed themselves,” which is why she suggests getting seed oils that are cold-pressed if you want to cook with them. &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;

		
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;






&lt;p&gt;She believes these oils can still be part of a healthy diet when consumed in moderation and balanced with omega-3 fatty acids. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And if you absolutely can’t live without butter, opt for the &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/02/13/health/im-a-cancer-survivor-here-are-the-everyday-supplies-ive-cut-from-my-kitchen/"&gt;grass-fed&lt;/a&gt; kind, as it has lower amounts of saturated fats and more healthy fats, as well as more vitamin K2 — which helps boost heart health. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I don’t like to demonize any food, but I’d recommend grass-fed, pasture-raised butter over conventional butter if you really want to have butter,” Schiff said. “And eat less of it. Lean more towards olive and avocado oil, use unrefined seed oils and avoid ultra-processed foods.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Finally, don’t forget that “you don’t need to be perfect,” she said, especially since “everyone’s body is different in how it processes fats.”&lt;/p&gt;

Unlike previous BCIs, which lasted only a few days, this AI-enhanced device worked reliably for seven months. The AI model adapts to natural shifts in brain activity, maintaining accuracy over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After training with a virtual arm, the participant successfully grasped, moved, and manipulated real-world objects. The technology represents a major step toward restoring movement for people with paralysis. Researchers are now refining the system for smoother operation and testing its use in home settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Long-Term Stability:&lt;/strong&gt; The AI-enhanced BCI functioned for seven months, far longer than previous versions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adaptive Learning:&lt;/strong&gt; The system adjusts to daily shifts in brain activity, maintaining accuracy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Real-World Use:&lt;/strong&gt; The participant controlled a robotic arm to pick up objects and use a water dispenser.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;UCSF&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Researchers at UC San Francisco have enabled a man who is paralyzed to control a robotic arm through a device that relays signals from his brain to a computer.  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was able to grasp, move and drop objects just by imagining himself performing the actions.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The device, known as a brain-computer interface (BCI), worked for a record 7 months without needing to be adjusted. Until now, such devices have only worked for a day or two.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108079"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/ai-robotic-hand-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/ai-robotic-hand-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/ai-robotic-hand-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/ai-robotic-hand-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/ai-robotic-hand-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/ai-robotic-hand-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/ai-robotic-hand-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/ai-robotic-hand-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a man and a robotic hand." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/ai-robotic-hand-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/ai-robotic-hand-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/ai-robotic-hand-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/ai-robotic-hand-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/ai-robotic-hand-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/ai-robotic-hand-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/ai-robotic-hand-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Ganguly is now refining the AI models to make the robotic arm move faster and more smoothly, and planning to test the BCI in a home environment.   Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The BCI relies on an AI model that can adjust to the small changes that take place in the brain as a person repeats a movement – or in this case, an imagined movement – and learns to do it in a more refined way.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This blending of learning between humans and AI is the next phase for these brain-computer interfaces,” said neurologist, Karunesh Ganguly, MD, PhD, a professor of neurology and a member of the UCSF Weill Institute for Neurosciences. “It’s what we need to achieve sophisticated, lifelike function.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, which was funded by the National Institutes of Health, appears March 6 in &lt;em&gt;Cell&lt;/em&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key was the discovery of how activity shifts in the brain day to day as a study participant repeatedly imagined making specific movements. Once the AI was programmed to account for those shifts, it worked for months at a time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Location, location, location &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ganguly studied how patterns of brain activity in animals represent specific movements and saw that these representations changed day-to-day as the animal learned. He suspected the same thing was happening in humans, and that was why their BCIs so quickly lost the ability to recognize these patterns.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ganguly and neurology researcher Nikhilesh Natraj, PhD, worked with a study participant who had been paralyzed by a stroke years earlier. He could not speak or move. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He had tiny sensors implanted on the surface of his brain that could pick up brain activity when he imagined moving.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To see whether his brain patterns changed over time, Ganguly asked the participant to imagine moving different parts of his body, like his hands, feet or head. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although he couldn’t actually move, the participant’s brain could still produce the signals for a movement when he imagined himself doing it. The BCI recorded the brain’s representations of these movements through the sensors on his brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ganguly’s team found that the shape of representations in the brain stayed the same, but their locations shifted slightly from day to day.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From virtual to reality &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ganguly then asked the participant to imagine himself making simple movements with his fingers, hands or thumbs over the course of two weeks, while the sensors recorded his brain activity to train the AI. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, the participant tried to control a robotic arm and hand. But the movements still weren’t very precise.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, Ganguly had the participant practice on a virtual robot arm that gave him feedback on the accuracy of his visualizations. Eventually, he got the virtual arm to do what he wanted it to do.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the participant began practicing with the real robot arm, it only took a few practice sessions for him to transfer his skills to the real world.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He could make the robotic arm pick up blocks, turn them and move them to new locations. He was even able to open a cabinet, take out a cup and hold it up to a water dispenser.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Months later, the participant was still able to control the robotic arm after a 15-minute “tune-up” to adjust for how his movement representations had drifted since he had begun using the device.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ganguly is now refining the AI models to make the robotic arm move faster and more smoothly, and planning to test the BCI in a home environment.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For people with paralysis, the ability to feed themselves or get a drink of water would be life changing.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ganguly thinks this is within reach.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m very confident that we’ve learned how to build the system now, and that we can make this work,” he said.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Authors:&lt;/strong&gt; Other authors of this study include Sarah Seko and Adelyn Tu-Chan of UCSF and Reza Abiri of the University of Rhode Island. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding:&lt;/strong&gt; This work was supported by National Institutes of Health (1 DP2 HD087955) and the UCSF Weill Institute for Neurosciences.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this AI and robotics research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#65170a070c0b4b0804170e1625100616034b000110" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Robin Marks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://ucsf.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;UCSF&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Robin Marks – UCSF&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2025.02.001" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Sampling representational plasticity of simple imagined movements across days enables long-term neuroprosthetic control&lt;/a&gt;” by Karunesh Ganguly et al. &lt;em&gt;Cell&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sampling representational plasticity of simple imagined movements across days enables long-term neuroprosthetic control&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The nervous system needs to balance the stability of neural representations with plasticity. It is unclear what the representational stability of simple well-rehearsed actions is, particularly in humans, and their adaptability to new contexts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using an electrocorticography brain-computer interface (BCI) in tetraplegic participants, we found that the low-dimensional manifold and relative representational distances for a repertoire of simple imagined movements were remarkably stable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The manifold’s absolute location, however, demonstrated constrained day-to-day drift. Strikingly, neural statistics, especially variance, could be flexibly regulated to increase representational distances during BCI control without somatotopic changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discernability strengthened with practice and was BCI-specific, demonstrating contextual specificity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sampling representational plasticity and drift across days subsequently uncovered a meta-representational structure with generalizable decision boundaries for the repertoire; this allowed long-term neuroprosthetic control of a robotic arm and hand for reaching and grasping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our study offers insights into mesoscale representational statistics that also enable long-term complex neuroprosthetic control.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Thu, 06 Mar 2025 21:55:33 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMib0FVX3lxTE0yOXBTR09fTHo5Zm10c2F6SVFQSDlYNHBMTVpiQXNjcVp6RmZGZUFsQWNtUzZtNVM5YldnUVJpaVluUnJzTGViWmdEN19NckhFNTZ1R0N5cDF0RmNienB4Qm1PQ3JxVDFxRGQxdzlKMA</guid></item><item><title>The Real-Life Diet of a Harvard and MIT Scientist Who Says the Right Diet Can Make You Smarter - GQ</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZEFVX3lxTE1iUjdCY09BVTRtTng0VV9NYWU4U3lkd1Y2cko4ZFA4RWt3LTIxMHZadWZJWDQ5RnFJeElSLUZBYVVjVm1ILWdJZG0yQ2pOQTFDM2FTNk56dHBsTDI3M2RXeF9LLVo?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="body__inner-container"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, Omega-6 fatty acids, which are present in nuts and seeds and &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7596305/"&gt;are essential for brain development&lt;/a&gt; and health, must be consumed in balance with Omega-3s to support overall well-being.

Omega-3 fatty acids, antioxidants, and vitamins found in foods like fatty fish, berries, and leafy greens aid in boosting brain function, enhancing memory, and staving off cognitive deterioration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;I’m afraid to ask… but what’s the deal with coffee?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Foods that enhance focus, &lt;a href="https://www.gq.com/story/coffee-obsession"&gt;such as those with caffeine and L-theanine&lt;/a&gt;—which are present in coffee and green tea—enhance alertness and attention by influencing neurotransmitter dynamics. I usually only drink coffee once or twice a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;This is terrible, but not unexpected, news. What’s the alternative?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Opting for green tea as an alternative to coffee is generally a good idea. Green tea is rich in caffeine, known to boost alertness and concentration, and also contains &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/theanine#:~:text=Oral%20supplementation%20with%2050%E2%80%93200,serotonin%2C%20dopamine%20and%20other%20neurotransmitters."&gt;L-theanine, which supports a state of calm alertness&lt;/a&gt;, possibly enhancing focus while reducing feelings of anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;What else do you avoid in your diet?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I minimize sugar intake—although I do enjoy a piece of chocolate a couple of times a week—and I only eat red meat once or twice a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;Do…I need to do that too?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To support brain health, it's advisable to limit intake of processed and high-sugar foods (like sugary beverages, candy, cupcakes—all things we stuff ourselves with as children and habituate as comfort foods!), as they can impair cognitive function and memory. Consumption of alcohol and red meats has also been &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7071474/"&gt;linked to negative impacts on brain health&lt;/a&gt;. Foods high in saturated and trans fats should also be minimized, as they can lead to decreased brain health over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;Does &lt;em&gt;when&lt;/em&gt; you eat make a difference in all of this?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's a profound link between your dietary habits and your brain's health. The science is really just in its infancy for this—and there appears to be a “no one-case fits all”—so people need to experiment to find what works best for them. Having said this, patterns are emerging. Consuming meals at regular, consistent times helps regulate the body's internal clock, stabilizing blood sugar levels and ensuring a steady supply of energy to the brain, which is crucial for maintaining cognitive functions and focus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;So, where does intermittent fasting come into play?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intermittent fasting, which involves cycling between periods of eating and fasting, has been shown to benefit brain health. This practice may enhance brain function by reducing oxidative stress, improving brain cell growth, and decreasing the risk of neurodegenerative diseases. However, the optimal intervals for eating can vary depending on individual health conditions, lifestyle, and dietary needs. Generally, fasting for 14 or more hours a day is recommended (so, for example, finish dinner by 6 p.m. and have breakfast at 8 a.m.), but it's important to consult with a healthcare professional to determine the best eating schedule for your specific health goals and needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;Any other secrets we need to know about how to hack our diets to get smarter?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve been experimenting with adaptogens—which are natural substances that typically come from an herb, root, or mushroom. I’ve been exploring lion’s mane, chaga, reishi, and maca for their potential benefits for enhancing resilience to stress and supporting overall well-being. Incorporating these adaptogens into my routine has been part of my journey to optimize mental clarity, energy levels, and overall health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>GQ</author><pubDate>Thu, 06 Mar 2025 21:53:43 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiZEFVX3lxTE1iUjdCY09BVTRtTng0VV9NYWU4U3lkd1Y2cko4ZFA4RWt3LTIxMHZadWZJWDQ5RnFJeElSLUZBYVVjVm1ILWdJZG0yQ2pOQTFDM2FTNk56dHBsTDI3M2RXeF9LLVo</guid></item><item><title>Second death reported in growing measles outbreak - The Washington Post</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiwFBVV95cUxOY1lRQWNtOU9zcnpsRWpiaXZ4Z0xQdXFtNW1iTzlqVFljb3NnbTVLc0FpbGQzWGozajRMenRCTEdLelFUZ0ROT0hRbGxRS3FOeDZoZmpZNERLdDN1dUVRVzU4cVNZdElwR0V6THREQWZNeTgtUXB6Rkl0MnRzN0VWclFBbzRUeEN3NTdB?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="meteredContent grid-center"&gt;&lt;div class="teaser-content"&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="L73LRL7EZZHY7HNNLDR6WTT5UI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;An unvaccinated New Mexico adult who tested positive for measles has died, the second death in a growing measles outbreak centered along the West Texas-New Mexico border, officials said Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="6P67KWGWOBADFL4AITF2AILPYE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The individual did not seek medical care before death, New Mexico health department officials said.

&lt;p&gt;The resurgence of avian flu at two animal slaughter markets in Queens has renewed urgent calls to shut down New York City’s densely packed wet markets.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest outbreaks come just weeks after a temporary closure in February, when an undercover investigation by &lt;a href="https://nyclass.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;NYCLASS&lt;/a&gt; and Council Member Robert Holden revealed squalid conditions at live animal markets in Queens and Brooklyn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DGYXSW_JoV9/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;amp;igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA%3D%3D" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;span&gt;disturbing footage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; was captured after the markets were temporarily closed for five days in February due to a previous avian flu outbreak.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="emp-d4473" class="emp-ad-article-leaderboard"&gt;
                &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I see a lot of sickly looking birds. They’re stuffed into cages and are literally on top of each other,” remarked Holden, who represents the District 30 neighborhoods of &lt;a href="https://qns.com/neighborhoods/ridgewood/"&gt;Ridgewood&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://qns.com/neighborhoods/maspeth/"&gt;Maspeth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://qns.com/neighborhoods/middle-village/"&gt;Middle Village&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://qns.com/neighborhoods/glendale/"&gt;Glendale,&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://qns.com/neighborhoods/elmhurst/"&gt;Elmhurst&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://qns.com/neighborhoods/rego-park/"&gt;Rego Park&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="s2nPlayer k-J2ZCYteD" data-type="float"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure id="attachment_512999" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-512999" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-512999" src="https://qns.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_2941.jpeg?w=361" alt="" srcset="https://qns.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_2941.jpeg 828w, https://qns.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_2941.jpeg?resize=361,700 361w, https://qns.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_2941.jpeg?resize=768,1491 768w, https://qns.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_2941.jpeg?resize=618,1200 618w, https://qns.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_2941.jpeg?resize=791,1536 791w, https://qns.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_2941.jpeg?resize=198,384 198w, https://qns.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_2941.jpeg?resize=464,900 464w, https://qns.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_2941.jpeg?resize=824,1600 824w, https://qns.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_2941.jpeg?resize=26,50 26w" sizes="(max-width: 361px) 100vw, 361px"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-512999" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;span class="image-caption"&gt;Birds were showing dripping blood in the harrowing footage. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="image-credit"&gt;via Instagram @nyclass&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The outbreaks have sparked further alarm among animal rights activists, public health officials, and concerned citizens, who argue that such markets are unsafe to operate amid a bird flu crisis. Advocates have called for immediate and indefinite closure of these markets until proper control measures are in place to address both animal welfare and public health concerns.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="emp-ed36b" class="amp-action"&gt;    
                        &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;NYCLASS Executive Director Edita Birnkrant has been vocal in her criticism of the state’s response, accusing Gov. Kathy Hochul of failing to take adequate action. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Birnkrant emphasized that these latest outbreaks should serve as a clear indication that operating these markets during a bird flu outbreak is reckless and puts public health at risk. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;She called on Governor Hochul to shut down the markets indefinitely, pointing out that allowing them to remain open amidst the ongoing crisis contributes to the spread of avian flu and other infectious diseases.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;One of the major concerns raised by advocates is the lack of transparency regarding which markets were affected by the avian flu outbreaks. &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Health officials have not disclosed which specific slaughter markets had confirmed cases, leaving the public in the dark about potential exposure. Without this information, consumers are left uncertain whether the poultry they purchase could be infected.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_512998" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-512998" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-512998" src="https://qns.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_2942.jpeg?w=363" alt="" srcset="https://qns.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_2942.jpeg 828w, https://qns.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_2942.jpeg?resize=363,700 363w, https://qns.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_2942.jpeg?resize=768,1482 768w, https://qns.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_2942.jpeg?resize=622,1200 622w, https://qns.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_2942.jpeg?resize=796,1536 796w, https://qns.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_2942.jpeg?resize=199,384 199w, https://qns.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_2942.jpeg?resize=466,900 466w, https://qns.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_2942.jpeg?resize=26,50 26w" sizes="(max-width: 363px) 100vw, 363px"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-512998" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;span class="image-caption"&gt;Birds with open wounds were still stuffed in overcrowded cages in this wet market. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="image-credit"&gt;via Instagram @nyclass&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Birnkrant argued that this lack of accountability is unacceptable and amounts to malpractice on the part of health agencies and government officials.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In addition to the avian flu outbreaks, NYCLASS has documented troubling conditions at live markets in Queens and Brooklyn. The organization has reported overcrowded cages containing sick and injured birds, many showing signs of infection, including necrotic wounds. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Often overcrowded and unsanitary, these markets have long been a source of concern for animal rights groups. Birds at these markets are typically kept in appalling conditions, leading to a variety of health issues, including infections and injuries. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Advocates argue that these markets not only endanger the animals but also create an environment where zoonotic diseases, like avian flu, can easily spread.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The situation is further compounded by reports of hazardous conditions on public streets near the markets. NYCLASS captured footage of an open dumpster dripping with blood and filled with bags of rotting chickens, many of which were torn open with feathers scattered about. The lack of sanitation and safety protocols for both the animals and the public is a major point of concern. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;People shopping at these markets are exposed to close contact with sick animals without any personal protective equipment (PPE) or safety measures. According to experts, this creates an ideal environment for the transmission of infectious diseases, including avian flu.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Veterinarians and public health experts have also weighed in on the risks posed by these markets. Dr. Crystal Heath, a veterinarian, pointed out that live markets, which allow for direct interaction between the public and stressed animals, are breeding grounds for disease. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;With thousands of people coming into close contact with sick or stressed animals, the conditions are ripe for an influenza virus to jump to humans. The close quarters, lack of sanitation, and high-stress levels among the animals significantly increase the likelihood of disease transmission.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_512991" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-512991" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-512991" src="https://qns.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2197691041.jpg?w=700" alt="" srcset="https://qns.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2197691041.jpg 1024w, https://qns.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2197691041.jpg?resize=700,468 700w, https://qns.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2197691041.jpg?resize=768,514 768w, https://qns.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2197691041.jpg?resize=384,257 384w, https://qns.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2197691041.jpg?resize=900,602 900w, https://qns.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2197691041.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-512991" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;span class="image-caption"&gt;Markets were temporarily shut down in New York in February due to bird flu. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="image-credit"&gt;Photo by Lokman Vural Elibol /Anadolu via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Additionally, Dr. Heath noted that such environments increase the risk of avian flu reassorting with the seasonal flu, potentially creating a virus with pandemic potential.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The health risks extend beyond avian flu, as animals in these markets are often exposed to various bacterial infections, respiratory diseases, and other health issues due to overcrowded and unsanitary conditions. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Animal rights organizations like Woodstock Farm Sanctuary have also expressed concern, sharing their experiences with animals rescued from these markets. The sanctuary has taken in numerous animals directly sourced from New York City’s live markets. Upon examination, many of them have shown signs of infections, neglect, and untreated health issues. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Some of the animals rescued were so severely compromised that they passed away shortly after their rescue. The conditions these animals endure, both in the markets and in transport, are a major concern for organizations advocating for animal welfare.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Furthermore, concerns have been raised about the lack of testing and oversight on factory farms, where many of the birds sold in these markets are sourced. Critics have pointed out that &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://agriculture.ny.gov/news/new-york-state-announces-further-proactive-measures-prevent-avian-influenza-live-bird-markets#:~:text=New%20York%20State%20Agriculture%20Commissioner,York's%20poultry%20as%20well%20as" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;span&gt;testing a small sample of birds&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; from massive factory farms and declaring them free of avian influenza is insufficient and irresponsible. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The overcrowded conditions at these farms not only contribute to the spread of avian flu but also result in a host of other health problems for the birds. Animal rights activists argue that the lack of proper regulation and oversight at both factory farms and live slaughter markets is contributing to the ongoing crisis and putting both animal and public health in jeopardy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In light of the continuing outbreaks and the evidence of hazardous conditions, calls for the permanent closure of these markets have grown louder. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;John Di Leonardo, President of &lt;a href="https://www.humanelongisland.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Humane Long Island&lt;/a&gt;, warns that failure to take immediate action could lead to the spread of diseases with far-reaching consequences for public health. Just as COVID-19 originated in live markets, avian flu presents a much greater risk, with the potential for devastating consequences if the virus were to mutate or spread further.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;However, there are currently no human cases of avian flu, and the threat to the public is still low.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Following continued proactive surveillance of NYC’s live bird markets, Department inspectors detected HPAI in two live bird markets in Queens. Results were later confirmed by the National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL),” the Department of Agriculture and Market stated.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Both markets immediately closed and completed depopulation, cleaning, and disinfection and will now remain closed for a period of five days. They will be allowed to reopen following an additional inspection. In order to protect impacted businesses and farms, the Department releases county-level information regarding HPAI detections and not the names of the businesses.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Animal welfare groups, health professionals, and concerned citizens continue to urge Gov. Hochul and city officials to act swiftly to close these markets and implement stricter regulations to ensure the safety of both the animals and the public. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Researchers compared young and old rats fed a diet with 60% of calories from fat and found that only the older rats showed cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While metabolic and gut health changes took months to appear, memory deficits emerged quickly in the aged brains. The findings suggest that diet-related brain inflammation is not solely driven by obesity but occurs rapidly with unhealthy eating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Just three days of a high-fat diet caused memory impairment in older rats.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Brain inflammation occurred before metabolic and gut health changes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Young rats on the same diet did not experience cognitive decline.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Ohio State University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Just a few days of eating a diet high in saturated fat could be enough to cause memory problems and related brain inflammation in older adults, a new study in rats suggests.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers fed separate groups of young and old rats the high-fat diet for three days or for three months to compare how quickly changes happen in the brain versus the rest of the body when eating an unhealthy diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108071"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/fast-food-dementia-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/fast-food-dementia-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/fast-food-dementia-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/fast-food-dementia-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/fast-food-dementia-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/fast-food-dementia-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/fast-food-dementia-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/fast-food-dementia-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows two brains and fast food." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/fast-food-dementia-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/fast-food-dementia-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/fast-food-dementia-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/fast-food-dementia-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/fast-food-dementia-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/fast-food-dementia-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/fast-food-dementia-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Young rats’ memory and behavior and brain tissue remained unaffected by the fatty food. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;As expected based on previous diabetes and obesity research, eating fatty foods for three months led to metabolic problems, gut inflammation and dramatic shifts in gut bacteria in all rats compared to those that ate normal chow, while just three days of high fat caused no major metabolic or gut changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it came to changes in the brain, however, researchers found that only older rats – whether they were on the high-fat diet for three months or only three days – performed poorly on memory tests and showed negative inflammatory changes in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results dispel the idea that diet-related inflammation in the aging brain is driven by obesity, said senior study author Ruth Barrientos, an investigator in the Institute for Behavioral Medicine Research at The Ohio State University. Most research on the effects of fatty and processed foods on the brain has focused on obesity, yet the impact of unhealthy eating, independent of obesity, remains largely unexplored.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Unhealthy diets and obesity are linked, but they are not inseparable. We’re really looking for the effects of the diet directly on the brain. And we showed that within three days, long before obesity sets in, tremendous neuroinflammatory shifts are occurring,” said Barrientos, also an associate professor of psychiatry and behavioral health and neuroscience in Ohio State’s College of Medicine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Changes in the body in all animals are happening more slowly and aren’t actually necessary to cause the memory impairments and changes in the brain. We never would have known that brain inflammation is the primary cause of high-fat diet-induced memory impairments without comparing the two timelines.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was published recently in the journal &lt;em&gt;Immunity &amp;amp; Ageing&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Years of research in Barrientos’ lab has suggested that aging brings on long-term “priming” of the brain’s inflammatory profile coupled with a loss of brain-cell reserve to bounce back, and that an unhealthy diet can make matters worse for the brain in older adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fat constitutes 60% of calories in the high-fat diet used in the study, which could equate to a range of common fast-food options: For example, nutrition data shows that fat makes up about 60% of calories in a McDonald’s double smoky BLT quarter pounder with cheese or a Burger King double whopper with cheese.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the animals were on high-fat diets for three days or three months, researchers ran tests assessing two types of memory problems common in older people with dementia that are based in separate regions of the brain: contextual memory mediated by the hippocampus (the primary memory center of the brain), and cued-fear memory that originates in the amygdala (the fear and danger center of the brain).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compared to control animals eating chow and young rats on the high-fat diet, aged rats showed behaviors indicating both types of memory were impaired after only three days of fatty food – and the behaviors persisted as they continued on the high-fat diet for three months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers also saw changes in levels of a range of proteins called cytokines in the brains of aged rats after three days of fatty food, which signaled a dysregulated inflammatory response. Three months after being on the high-fat diet, some of the cytokine levels had shifted but remained dysregulated, and the cognitive problems persisted in behavior tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A departure from baseline inflammatory markers is a negative response and has been shown to impair learning and memory functions,” Barrientos said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compared to rats eating normal chow, young and old animals gained more weight and showed signs of metabolic dysfunction – poor insulin and blood sugar control, inflammatory proteins in fat (adipose) tissue, and gut microbiome alterations – after three months on the high-fat diet. Young rats’ memory and behavior and brain tissue remained unaffected by the fatty food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These diets lead to obesity-related changes in both young and old animals, yet young animals appear more resilient to the high-fat diet’s effects on memory. We think it is likely due to their ability to activate compensatory anti-inflammatory responses, which the aged animals lack,” Barrientos said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Also, with glucose, insulin and adipose inflammation all increased in both young and old animals, there’s no way to distinguish what is causing memory impairment in only old animals if you look only at what’s happening in the body. It’s what is happening in the brain that’s important for the memory response.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;This work was supported by grants from the National Institute on Aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Co-authors include Michael Butler, Stephanie Muscat, Brigitte González Olmo, Sabrina Mackey-Alfonso, Nashali Massa, Bryan Alvarez, Jade Blackwell, Menaz Bettes and James DeMarsh of Ohio State; and Maria Elisa Caetano-Silva, Akriti Shrestha, Robert McCusker and Jacob Allen of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this diet and memory research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#3556545951425059591b040004755a46401b505140" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Emily Caldwell&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://osu.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Ohio State University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Emily Caldwell – Ohio State University&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12979-024-00496-3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Obesity-associated memory impairment and neuroinflammation precede widespread peripheral perturbations in aged rats&lt;/a&gt;” by Ruth Barrientos et al. &lt;em&gt;Immunity &amp;amp; Aging&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Obesity-associated memory impairment and neuroinflammation precede widespread peripheral perturbations in aged rats&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obesity and metabolic syndrome are major public health concerns linked to cognitive decline with aging. Prior work from our lab has demonstrated that short-term high fat diet (HFD) rapidly impairs memory function via a neuroinflammatory mechanism. However, the degree to which these rapid inflammatory changes are unique to the brain is unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, deviations in gut microbiome composition have been associated with obesity and cognitive impairment, but how diet and aging interact to impact the gut microbiome, or how rapidly these changes occur, is less clear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thus, our study investigated the impact of HFD after two distinct consumption durations: 3 months (to model diet-induced obesity) or 3 days (to detect the rapid changes occurring with HFD) on memory function, anxiety-like behavior, central and peripheral inflammation, and gut microbiome profile in young and aged rats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our data indicated that both short-term and long-term HFD consumption impaired memory function and increased anxiety-like behavior in aged, but not young adult, rats. These behavioral changes were accompanied by pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine dysregulation in the hippocampus and amygdala of aged HFD-fed rats at both time points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, changes to fasting glucose, insulin, and inflammation in peripheral tissues such as the distal colon and visceral adipose tissue were increased in young and aged rats only after long-term, but not short-term, HFD consumption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, while subtle HFD-induced changes to the gut microbiome did occur rapidly, robust age-specific effects were only present following long-term HFD consumption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, these data suggest that HFD-evoked neuroinflammation, memory impairment, and anxiety-like behavior in aging develop quicker than, and separately from the peripheral hallmarks of diet-induced obesity.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Thu, 06 Mar 2025 21:20:02 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMib0FVX3lxTFBFWDhIVFFqSWJPQWlla2FKLTBHOFAzR1hHaHp2cnFCVzU1Z1d2MVN6bGxCZUJIZkpaRWZhZENkdENTcTZlcmdGVXc4RGZ6b2xFcUFtTjNucndKVDR0WlJPMnNGY3FPcld5M1hQN0xhOA</guid></item><item><title>Switching butter for some plant-based oils significantly reduces risk of death, new study finds - CNN</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikgFBVV95cUxPQnk1RTFEenItU0dMeERud3RSLXNiOGs3S0d4LWtRX3BaTndQUl9ZREdPMzAyN0J0OUNuX0JMd1RQeU80S3hZNlppWVBucUhFbDJEQTAtNkN0VWVXeG5rU3JlLWxJMVVqbWJrX3hDNXpHNzA5eHEybnkyeURpYVpGUzJDWHZLX2tlY29rTmlRdjE5Z9IBiAFBVV95cUxNNG9OYWdLNGhJeG9oY1Btd1BpRlpQa2owZWpZOFhwSEFieHRxM0liMko3Wk5FVzRTcWdvWmZBYzR3eFlKQ3JzVURSQ254WFhDSFFnWVBFMVZ6eFZKQ0h6WndnbncwWkxmU01rOFkzbU9tYlZ2SkVQc2FEdkhHY3lhVFU3OVpjSnVI?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;

            Swapping your daily butter intake for certain plant-based oils may help reduce your risk of death, a new study finds.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhjev90004356m0egwvwuv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            These findings challenge the growing social media trend that attacks seed oils in favor of butter, ghee and animal fats.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhjeva0005356m42wka6r9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Seed oils are one of the most unhealthy ingredients we have in foods,” said US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in an &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/robertfkennedyjr/reel/DBkBhZPRH6d/?hl=en" target="_blank"&gt;Instagram video&lt;/a&gt; in 2024, who continues to promote the slogan “Making Frying Oil Tallow Again.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Many other influencers have supported similar claims, including Dr. Paul Saladino, who promotes an animal-based diet and has amassed 2.6 million Instagram followers.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhjeva0007356mp20ixo40@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Butter is a health food with amazing nutrients,” he said &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/paulsaladinomd/reel/Cr6QPD9PWn_/?hl=en" target="_blank"&gt;in a post&lt;/a&gt;, adding that butter is good for the gut, brain, cardiovascular health, and overall health and vitality.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            The evidence doesn’t support that view, according to study coauthor Walter Willett, professor of epidemiology and nutrition at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in Boston.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhjeva0009356m4x5tats5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “For some reason that is not clear to me, a myth has been floating around the internet that butter is a healthy fat, but there is no good evidence to support this,” said Willett, who has authored over 2,000 articles and numerous books and has spent 40 years studying the impact of diet on the development of major diseases, via email.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Willett and his team’s latest research revealed that higher butter consumption was associated with a 15% higher risk of mortality, whereas higher intake of plant-based oils — including soybean, canola and olive oil — was linked to a 16% reduction in total mortality, according to the study published Thursday in the journal &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jamainternmed.2025.0205" target="_blank"&gt;JAMA Internal Medicine&lt;/a&gt;.

            In addition, substituting just 10 grams (0.35 ounces) of butter with these plant-based oils daily was associated with a 17% lower risk of both total mortality and cancer-related deaths.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “Seventeen percent is quite a big change, especially when you look at the public health perspective,” said Dr. Yu Zhang, study coauthor and researcher at the Channing Division of Network Medicine at Brigham and Women’s Hospital. “Imagine how many deaths we can reduce in the general population.”&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;

            The study analyzed 33 years of dietary data from more than 221,000 participants in the Nurses’ Health Study (NHS), Nurses’ Health Study II (NHS II) and Health Professionals Follow-up Study.

            Participants self-reported their dietary habits every four years, allowing researchers to track changes over time and calculate long-term intake averages. Researchers adjusted their findings to account for variables such as age, body mass index (BMI), smoking status, total calorie intake, as well as other dietary patterns using the &lt;a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/public-health-nutrition/article/evaluating-adherence-to-recommended-diets-in-adults-the-alternate-healthy-eating-index/1163D3C29653628A1209EB88AE166BF1" target="_blank"&gt;Alternative Healthy Eating Index&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Butter intake included any amount used in cooking and baking, as well as any extra butter spread on food. Plant-based oil consumption was estimated based on the type of oil used in frying, sautéing, baking or making salad dressings.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhkqmq000m356mbqoxvqnp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Marion Nestle, Paulette Goddard Professor of Nutrition, Food Studies and Public Health Emerita at New York University, noted the new study is correlational and shows association, not causation.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhkqmq000n356mg3fy4i7p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Even so, it’s consistent with decades of evidence linking saturated fat to health risks and demonstrating quite substantial health benefits of substituting plant oils (including seed oils) for animal fats,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhkqmq000o356m6d545vqm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Seed oils are derived from plant seeds, whereas plant-based oils are extracted from a variety of different plant parts. All oils examined in the study fall under the seed oil category, except for olive oil.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhkqmq000p356mq8b1stpm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Olive oil, canola oil, and soybean oil were each more consistently associated with benefit: a lower risk of dying,” said cardiologist Dr. Dariush Mozaffarian, director of the Food is Medicine Institute at the Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy at Tufts University. “These findings add to a large body of scientific literature on the health benefits of these plant oils, whose positive effects have been demonstrated in both large observational studies and dozens of randomized trials.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhkpcl000i356mkz8st1d4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            While the study indicates that some plant oils lead to better health outcomes, Zhang clarified that this doesn’t mean butter should be eliminated altogether.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhleio000w356m8u6hel68@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We are not suggesting that people should avoid butter entirely, but we are recommending that even a small reduction in butter in replacement for plant-based oils in a daily diet could lead to very substantial, long-term health benefits,” Zhang said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhleio000x356m3aaqlpde@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The choice to use butter may depend on available options for the consumer, Willett said. If given the choice between butter and a partially hydrogenated plant oil rich in trans fats, he said, butter might be a better option.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhleio000z356mzaex96bf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Despite the &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/food-additives-petitions/final-determination-regarding-partially-hydrogenated-oils-removing-trans-fat#:~:text=Final%20Determination%20Regarding%20Partially%20Hydrogenated%20Oils%20(Removing%20Trans%20Fat),-Share&amp;amp;text=In%202015%2C%20FDA%20released%20its,levels%20in%20other%20edible%20oils." target="_blank"&gt;2015 ban&lt;/a&gt; on trans fats passed by the US Food and Drug Administration, manufacturers can still use up to a half of gram of trans fat per serving. That can add up fast in a daily diet, &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-cholesterol/in-depth/trans-fat/art-20046114#:~:text=Products%20made%20before%20the%20FDA,amount%20is%20below%200.5%20grams." target="_blank"&gt;according to the Mayo Clinic.&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhleio0010356mcfr8z6l5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            However, if the decision is between butter and beef tallow — which has been promoted by Kennedy as a healthier substitute for seed oils — canola, soybean and olive oils are the superior choice, Willett said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhleio0011356mo6ehh0v8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Although beef tallow was not examined in this study, on the basis of its composition we would expect it to be no better than butter,” Willett said, pointing to a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5081717/?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank"&gt;previous analysis&lt;/a&gt; he authored that found fat from red meat, which is mostly composed of beef fat, was marginally worse than dairy fat in regards to mortality or cardiovascular disease.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhleio0012356m3cne1pjf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Butter is very high in saturated fat, approximately 2/3 of the fat, and it contains almost none of the beneficial, essential polysaturated fats,” Willett said in an email.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhleio0013356m48apf9rn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Our findings don’t mean that we should never consume butter, but it is best to use it just when its specific flavor is important, not as a primary source of fat,” he added. “For me, this is the several times a year that I have lobster … butter is absolutely essential!”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhlde3000u356m2zy31gqz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If you’re looking to make the switch to plant oils or debating which ones to use, it’s all about finding a balance to include some of the essential nutrients your body needs.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhm0wn001a356m7175xqrq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Olive, canola and soybean oils had the most beneficial impact on health outcomes in the study, according to Zhang, which comes from their high levels of anti-inflammatory omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3s maintain the body’s cells, provide energy, maintain immune defense and reduce inflammation when it’s at optimal levels (like most things, too much omega-3 &lt;a href="https://news.oregonstate.edu/news/excess-omega-3-fatty-acids-could-lead-negative-health-effects" target="_blank"&gt;may be harmful&lt;/a&gt;).
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhm0wn001b356m9h2fmamr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Other seed oils such as corn, peanut, safflower and sunflower contain higher levels of omega-6 fatty acids, which are also necessary to maintain good health.&lt;br&gt;Omega-6 molecules stimulate hair and skin growth, regulate metabolism, support bone health, and in some cases, may even have &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/04/health/fish-oil-heart-wellness/index.html"&gt;anti-inflammatory&lt;/a&gt; properties.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xix6es00053b6mvx4hnm61@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            However, omega-6s can also be converted into molecules such as &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3081099/#:~:text=Prostaglandins%20play%20a%20key%20role,cardinal%20signs%20of%20acute%20inflammation." target="_blank"&gt;prostaglandins&lt;/a&gt; that signal the initiation of inflammation — not a bad thing when your body is trying to quickly repel an invader or tumor, but devastating if left smoldering for long periods without resolution.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhm0wn001d356mrajvtkds@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Americans have an overabundance of omega-6s in their bodies due to their use in ultraprocessed foods and eating at fast food establishments. One omega 6, &lt;a href="https://www.mountsinai.org/health-library/supplement/omega-6-fatty-acids" target="_blank"&gt;linoleic acid&lt;/a&gt;, is the &lt;a href="https://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic/other-nutrients/essential-fatty-acids#reference78" target="_blank"&gt;most common omega-6&lt;/a&gt; in the US food supply.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhm0wn001c356mrl6nbie5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We need both omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids; soybean and canola oil have both,” Willett said. “Corn and sunflower oil have very little omega-3 fatty content; these can be part of a mix of different oils, but should not be relied upon as a sole source of plant oil.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhm0wn001e356m8op9xti9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            No matter which oils you’re using in your diet, it’s best to use them sparingly, Nestle said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhm0wn001f356ma260ua5p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I’m always for varying food intake to the extent possible and that goes for oils, as well,” she said.  “All oils, no matter which, provide about 120 calories per tablespoon so are best used in the proverbial moderation.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While drooling is a little known symptom of MND it is typically not the first sign of the condition.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other symptoms include stiff or weak hands as well as muscles twitches. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the NHS six people are diagnosed with MND every day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Around 5,000 adults in the UK have MND and people have about a one in 300 risk of developing the condition over the course of their life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It mainly affects people in there 60s and 70s, but it can affect adults of all ages. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Life expectancy for about half of those with the condition is just two to five years from the onset of symptoms. How quickly symptoms get worse varies between patients, it can happen in as little as seven months or years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Muscle twitches and a weak grip are among the early signs of the condition, along with weakness in the leg or ankle, slurred speech and weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors warn that you should see your GP if you have difficulty holding or gripping objects a feeling of weakness in your legs and twitches or muscle cramps that keep happening, if they do not go away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Rugby League legend Rob Burrow was diagnosed with MND in 2019, before passing away last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;His first symptom was slurred speech, which hit while he was attending an awards show. Friends just thought he was drunk slurring his words but tests revealed the devastating news.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There is currently no cure for MND but doctors can provide treatments to help reduce the impact it has on a person's life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Medics can also provide drugs that minimise the symptoms like drooling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, inevitably patients will start to experience problems moving and may need a wheelchair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As MND progresses patients can eventually need a ventilator, a machine to help them breathe, as well technology to help them communicate.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Thu, 06 Mar 2025 20:00:46 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilgFBVV95cUxNTUZZNF9oVHNYZzJuaDI3eGd0Zy1xMjAwUWt3QU5tQkhTM01NR2R5T3BTanBhdDBJX3ZsUGtxYWtfU3Vpd2o1Wm0zR00xNVZVcWd2dXJHSzIyRlVhYi1TMmtTUVZ5d25pV2tNSklza2lod2JWRFUyVWVDVHFsUEtoRjNqdFNZTVg2aTRhelV4SVhTWnZETUHSAZsBQVVfeXFMT1h1aFBGQS05aGgyakJwNTU4aDZtdjlSRGtLUTU3Z182Zk0tdkdTUnJfal9ESGNiT0l0Wm9iWmIxdmRYWDByRTl0N0k1aklLMEVyNHJxTjdKTzUzbjNzeVBhVGZOM3YwZTJDVlVvZHltSV8tNHRIbkNVMWQ5WmU1V0w5Ykt5M2VRR1duU2MxemlJLWZxTDJsdm1xREk</guid></item><item><title>Why eating farmed fish may be safer than eating fish caught in the wild - Earth.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMioAFBVV95cUxQRmJYZERZWnpoZjMxeHhILTRqc0FHWmhDalNKLTVETlQ3LUYta2FiU2VBVWRWLXA0ZVE4RFppaUVuRGR1eVl3YnVwOVNmb0ZnbVphdGk1OUdIYUZPZzNuQ0I1Yjlna3NzTE0zbmQ0eUw1UjkzMHdFT0VRZi1XS0lHZFpqTVI0OUUyYWdjNmFIVHRYemdudVM3LVRWa2w2TWhI?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page_content__AwOj6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Farmed fish are often viewed with suspicion, while wild-caught varieties are more likely to be perceived as healthy and pure. Seafood shoppers everywhere debate the differences and weigh their options carefully.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A fresh scientific review points to an unexpected conclusion. Various pollutants can accumulate in fish, and wild-caught individuals appear to experience greater exposure to these. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This perspective is shared by &lt;a href="https://orcid.org/0009-0001-6007-8622" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Dr. Isabel  Casanova-Martínez&lt;/a&gt;, a scientist who works under the auspices of several Spanish research institutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people recognize that &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/heavy-metal-blood-test/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;heavy metals&lt;/a&gt; pose a threat for food safety. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These substances include elements like &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/elevated-mercury-levels-discovered-in-dolphins/"&gt;mercury&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://periodic-table.rsc.org/element/33/arsenic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;arsenic&lt;/a&gt;, lead and others that can build up in tissue (bioaccumulate) over time. Certain types can be risky to humans if present in large amounts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers found that wild-caught fish carried an average mercury concentration of 0.06 micrograms per gram, while farmed fish had about half that, at 0.038 micrograms per gram. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also found arsenic levels of 3.26 micrograms per gram in wild fish, compared with 1.23 micrograms per gram in farmed varieties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ddt-and-other-pollutants"&gt;DDT and other pollutants&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lesser-known concern is &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/ingredients-used-pesticide-products/ddt-brief-history-and-status" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;DDT&lt;/a&gt;, which was once a widely used pesticide. Even though it was banned in many places years ago, traces can still linger. These residues can find their way into aquatic environments and accumulate in fish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The review indicates around 196.48 nanograms per gram of DDT in wild-caught samples, whereas farmed fish had about 44.64 nanograms per gram. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings suggest differences in how &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/eating-small-fish-whole-reduces-cancer-risk-in-women/"&gt;fish&lt;/a&gt; come into contact with old pesticide deposits, possibly due to habitat or feeding patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-some-fish-fare-better"&gt;Why some fish fare better&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fish produced through aquaculture may face stricter oversight in terms of feed and water conditions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Organizations like the &lt;a href="https://www.fao.org/publications/fao-flagship-publications/the-state-of-world-fisheries-and-aquaculture/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Food and Agriculture Organization&lt;/a&gt; note that this method continues to expand faster than other food sectors. Many producers track feeds and test water more regularly than ever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heavy metals can be introduced through industrial pollution, runoff, or other sources in natural waters. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Filtered tanks or closely monitored pens could mean fewer contaminants find their way into farmed species, although no method removes the risks entirely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-real-world-risks-and-caution"&gt;Real-world risks and caution&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/mercury-and-health" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; has identified mercury as being among the top chemicals of concern for public health, especially for expectant mothers and small children. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;High concentrations have been &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/mercury/health-effects-exposures-mercury"&gt;tied&lt;/a&gt; to neurological issues and developmental problems in infants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Safe daily or weekly seafood intake is still possible, but guidelines vary depending on a person’s overall health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts often urge pregnant women to be particularly careful about the consumption of large, predatory fish as they are known to harbor elevated mercury levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-balancing-nutrition-and-contaminants"&gt;Balancing nutrition and contaminants&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eating fish brings many benefits. It offers protein, omega-3 fatty acids, and important minerals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.fishwatch.gov" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;NOAA Fisheries&lt;/a&gt; underscores that fish are a valuable food, but also acknowledges that consumers should stay informed about possible contaminants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some nutrients, like &lt;a href="https://www.lenntech.com/periodic/elements/se.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;selenium&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Zinc-HealthProfessional/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;zinc&lt;/a&gt;, vary based on the fish’s environment and diet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Farmed diets often include formulated feeds that are designed to control final nutrient profiles. Wild species gain nutrients from ecosystems that are less predictable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-leading-author-s-viewpoint"&gt;Leading author’s viewpoint&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Rather than pitting wild fishing against aquaculture, our review demonstrates that both sectors can coexist and help meet the world’s seafood needs safely,” concluded Dr. Casanova-Martínez, lead author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Still, ongoing research and improvements in feed and environmental monitoring are essential for safeguarding public health.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These observations reflect the broader consensus that both systems are vital for feeding populations. Each approach has benefits and drawbacks that require further attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-regulation-matters"&gt;Why regulation matters&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regulatory bodies set maximum allowed &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/nearly-100-million-americans-exposed-to-contaminated-drinking-water/"&gt;contaminant levels&lt;/a&gt; to keep consumers safe. Many fish samples in both categories fall within established safety margins. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Continuous oversight helps the public gain confidence in what ends up on their plates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Authorities also caution special populations. Small children and pregnant individuals may need more careful advice about portion sizes, fish types, and heavy meal frequency. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public health agencies need to adjust recommendations when new evidence emerges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-s-next-for-consumers"&gt;What’s next for consumers&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aquaculture often employs best practices to reduce pollutants, yet wild-caught products remain popular for taste and tradition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People can choose a balanced approach, selecting a mix of fish sources and staying updated on guidelines for safer consumption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional studies on feed technology and water filtration are ongoing. Research may reveal improved methods to cut contaminants and maintain fish quality in coming years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Concerns about &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/heavy-metal-pollution-threatens-marine-life-and-human-health/"&gt;heavy metals&lt;/a&gt; and legacy pesticides should not overshadow the nutritional value of fish. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, consumers should be making informed choices by identifying reputable suppliers and following health advisories to ensure they reduce the intake of unwanted substances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Individuals looking for more detail can consult government websites or speak with healthcare providers for tailored advice. Monitoring official recommendations about fish intake can also safer meal planning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0956713525000891" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Food Control&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 06 Mar 2025 20:00:21 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMioAFBVV95cUxQRmJYZERZWnpoZjMxeHhILTRqc0FHWmhDalNKLTVETlQ3LUYta2FiU2VBVWRWLXA0ZVE4RFppaUVuRGR1eVl3YnVwOVNmb0ZnbVphdGk1OUdIYUZPZzNuQ0I1Yjlna3NzTE0zbmQ0eUw1UjkzMHdFT0VRZi1XS0lHZFpqTVI0OUUyYWdjNmFIVHRYemdudVM3LVRWa2w2TWhI</guid></item><item><title>Trump says 'male circumcision in Mozambique' is a 'scam.'

                South African boys from a rural area are briefed by an health worker from Doctors Without Borders before undergoing medical circumcision as a form of HIV prevention. The U.S. has supported male circumcision programs in countries with high rates of HIV. In his address to Congress this week, President Donald Trump listed aid programs that he considers an "appalling waste" and included "$10 million for male circumcision in Mozambique."

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;In his joint address to Congress on Tuesday, President Trump &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/03/04/g-s1-50488/trump-congress-joint-address-fact-check" target="_blank"&gt;took a jab at a number of foreign aid programs&lt;/a&gt;. "Just listen to some of the appalling waste," he said and then rattled off a list of examples, including: "$10 million for male circumcision in Mozambique."&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;He's referring to one country but USAID — the United States Agency for International Development — has funded male circumcision programs in a number of countries in southern and eastern Africa through the U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) program.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Public health experts and HIV prevention advocates agree that &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/teams/global-hiv-hepatitis-and-stis-programmes/hiv/prevention/voluntary-medical-male-circumcision" target="_blank"&gt;voluntary medical male circumcisions&lt;/a&gt; — a procedure where a medical provider removes the foreskin of a penis from a volunteer patient — are a highly effective prevention for HIV. The procedure has been shown to significantly reduce the risk of HIV transmission from women to men and is a cost-effective HIV prevention intervention in countries with high infection rates.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The procedure is recommended for males after the onset of puberty, when they are more likely to be sexually active, and differs from ceremonial circumcisions which are typically done by a non-medical provider in a non-medical setting. "The benefits of the procedure are for both [the patient] and their future partners, and ultimately, in a big way, for the community and country to reduce the spread of HIV," says &lt;a href="https://med.nyu.edu/faculty/anna-bershteyn" target="_blank"&gt;Anna Bershteyn&lt;/a&gt;, an associate professor of population health at the Grossman School of Medicine at New York University.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A local anesthetic is used in the procedure.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;A 60% prevention benefit&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Voluntary medical male circumcision became a gold standard for HIV prevention in the early 2000s, after three groundbreaking research studies from the National Institutes of Health and the French National Agency for Research on AIDS revealed that African countries with higher rates of male circumcision had &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789241595988" target="_blank"&gt;lower rates of HIV infections&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"If a man is circumcised, it will reduce his chance of acquiring HIV by 60%," says &lt;a href="https://www.unaids.org/en/aboutunaids/unaidsleadership/bios/mary-mahy" target="_blank"&gt;Mary Mahy&lt;/a&gt;, the director for Data for Impact at the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Scientists still don't know for sure how removal of foreskin reduces risk of HIV infection, but research suggests that male foreskin has a larger number of a certain type of cells that HIV grabs onto. Bershteyn says there's evidence that when the foreskin is removed during circumcision, the skin on the penis changes and the number of HIV-vulnerable cells on the skin's surface is reduced.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"But aside from understanding the how, we have incredibly strong evidence from multiple randomized trials that, whatever the mechanisms, this procedure greatly reduces the risk of HIV infection," says Bershteyn.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In 2007, on the heels of these research findings, the World Health Organization and the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS began recommending voluntary medical male circumcisions in countries with high HIV prevalence and low rates of circumcision. Shortly after, PEPFAR, which is mainly overseen by USAID, stepped up its efforts to &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3663585/" target="_blank"&gt;support male circumcision programs&lt;/a&gt; around the world, including in Mozambique.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Over the last 18 years, governments around eastern and southern Africa, where there are high risks amongst men having vaginal sex, began to work with PEPFAR, the Global Fund and community groups and advocates to begin to scale up access to circumcision," says &lt;a href="https://avac.org/mitchell-warren/" target="_blank"&gt;Mitchell Warren&lt;/a&gt;, executive director of AVAC, an HIV prevention non-profit organization.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Warren notes that PEPFAR and other groups didn't focus on circumcising men everywhere but instead used data-driven approaches to target specific regions that have high rates of HIV and low rates of circumcisions — including Mozambique. Since 2007, PEPFAR has supported &lt;a href="https://www.state.gov/results-and-impact-pepfar" target="_blank"&gt;32.5 million voluntary medical male circumcisions&lt;/a&gt; in men and boys.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In Mozambique, the Mozambican Ministry of Health developed a national male circumcision strategy in 2009, with the support of PEPFAR. According to &lt;a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.11.20.24317610v1" target="_blank"&gt;research from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;, between 2010-2023, more than 2.5 million voluntary medical male circumcisions were performed in the country, with 41% in boys younger than 15. And among those who received circumcisions, less than 2% became infected with HIV. This research has yet to be peer-reviewed.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And unlike other prevention tools like oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and condoms, because the procedure only has to be done once, male circumcisions are &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/02-10-2023-voluntary-medical-male-circumcision-shown-to-be-highly-cost-effective--highlighting-the-need-to-intensify-scale-up-and-sustainability" target="_blank"&gt;cost effective as HIV prevention&lt;/a&gt;. "The investment made in voluntary male medical circumcision actually pays for itself relatively quickly," says Bershteyn, and can "lighten the burden on governments and on donor agencies that are trying to prevent HIV deaths," since protected individuals don't require costly and lifelong treatments.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Warren says male circumcisions are "one of the best [HIV] prevention investments we have."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;NPR reached out to the State Department for comment on Trump's remarks but did not receive a response in time for publication.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bec Roldan is an independent science journalist based in Brooklyn, N.Y.

&lt;p&gt;Further, detailed examination of the participants' immune responses showed not only systemic response, but responses in distant mucus membranes. In the blood, two types of antibodies (IgA and IgG) increased by several fold after vaccination compared with the placebo group. The group with the largest responses was the one that received the high dose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A test that acts as a surrogate for neutralizing antibody responses to norovirus indicated that the antibodies spurred by the vaccine could block the virus. Additional tests found that cellular immune responses were also activated and that the systemic responses result in protection in places far from the intestines—namely the mouth and nose. Saliva tests and nasal swabs found significant jumps in secreted IgA against norovirus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Immune responses were strongest in the first two months after vaccination and diminished over time, but some persisted for nearly seven months. When the scientists looked at differences between the two age groups (55–65 and 65–80), they didn't see significant differences, suggesting the vaccine was equally effective in the older group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, the scientists at Vaxart concluded that the vaccine "has the potential to inhibit infection, viral shedding, and transmission."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Overall, VXA-G1.1-NN administration in older adults led to robust and durable immunogenicity detected both in circulation and multiple mucosal sites, an exciting outcome considering that diminished cellular and mucosal immunity are typical in older populations," they wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Not so good news&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The outlook isn't entirely rosy, though—there is some bad news. While immune responses rose in statistically significant measures during this small early-stage trial, it's unclear if that equates to real-life protection. And there's some good reason to be wary. In 2023, Vaxart &lt;a href="https://vaxart.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Vaxart-Monovalent-Norovirus-Challenge-Study-Data-Review.pdf"&gt;released results of a challenge study&lt;/a&gt;, in which 141 brave souls (76 vaccinated and 65 given a placebo) were deliberately exposed to norovirus to see if the vaccine was protective. The results were weak: 53 placebo-group members (81.5 percent) became infected with norovirus, as determined by a PCR test looking for genetic evidence of the virus in their stool—and so did 76 vaccinated people (60 percent). That worked out to the vaccine offering only &lt;a href="https://investors.vaxart.com/news-releases/news-release-details/vaxart-announces-topline-data-phase-2-challenge-study-its"&gt;a 29 percent lower relative risk of getting infected&lt;/a&gt;. Looking at whether infected people developed symptoms of acute gastroenteritis, the vaccine had a protective efficacy of about 21 percent: 34 vaccinated people (48 percent) versus 37 placebo-group members (57 percent) developed symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;

The rise of mail-order pharmacies has also contributed to the decline of retail stores. While these factors are part of the story, as a prescribing physician for more than 30 years, I’ve also seen a deterioration in the ability of pharmacists to think and communicate — keys to helping any business thrive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ef38" data-selectable-paragraph=""&gt;More than ever, pharmacists create or escalate problems, rather than helping solve them. I’ve seen it. My patients see it. This behavior of pharmacists is a neglected factor contributing to failing pharmacies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/health-wellness/how-stimulant-epidemic-messes-with-all-of-us"&gt;I'm A Neuroscientist: This Is How The Stimulant Epidemic Messes With All Of Us&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="d8c0" data-selectable-paragraph=""&gt;Perplexingly, this decline in pharmacist performance has occurred simultaneously with an increase in the rigor of pharmacist training. Pharmacists spend&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6418852/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank"&gt; more years&lt;/a&gt; in the educational system, with greater emphasis on patient interactions, than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="5f7d" data-selectable-paragraph=""&gt;Most pharmacists are hardworking, caring individuals who conduct their jobs adequately much of the time. Rising rates of poorer performance by pharmacists derive from broader social trends. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="5f7d" data-selectable-paragraph=""&gt;We’re all flooded with too much information and pressure to respond quickly. Our lives are more hectic. Looking at what is occurring in pharmacies gives us a glimpse at how we are changing our whole world, and not necessarily for the better. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Years of scrolling on our phones have shortened our attention spans, made us less patient, and increased our propensity to respond quickly but without adequate consideration of context, nuance, and consequences.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="media media--type-image media--view-mode-default"&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" src="/sites/default/files/image_blog/2025-01/pharmacies-world-fraying.png" alt="Pharmacies Are Failing And Our World Is Fraying" title="Pharmacies Are Failing And Our World Is Fraying" class="img-fluid" typeof="foaf:Image"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-credit field--type-string field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;Yuri A / Shutterstock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="player-wrapper-outer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;My practice isn’t perfect, either&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p id="4c38" data-selectable-paragraph=""&gt;I’m aware that I may sound like the codger lamenting how things were in the old days. Much of my evidence about pharmacist behavior is anecdotal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="4c38" data-selectable-paragraph=""&gt;I haven’t increased the number of patients I treat or prescriptions I write, but the amount of time I waste each month sorting out problems with pharmacies has increased substantially in the last decade. More problems arise, and they take longer to resolve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="b5bc" data-selectable-paragraph=""&gt;The challenges are not all the fault of pharmacists. I occasionally make errors in entering prescriptions into my electronic system. Perhaps I’ve become less intelligent, less articulate, or less patient over the years. But feedback from other realms of my life doesn’t support those conjectures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="809c" data-selectable-paragraph=""&gt;I am friends and neighbors with several smart, conscientious, and empathetic pharmacists. I’m not claiming that all pharmacists are failing all of the time. But in an era where the field proclaims that we are moving towards “precision” medicine and “individualized” medicine, pharmacists are failing too often with mainstream, everyday dispensing requests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="b481" data-selectable-paragraph=""&gt;I understand that pharmacists are overworked. I get it that in addition to corporate pressures, they face increasingly intrusive government regulations. These are major contributors to any pharmacist’s workplace stress. I don’t want to blame the victims. However, an increasing tendency for pharmacists to &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/2022353276/why-you-need-think-about-your-words-you-say-them"&gt;respond before thinking&lt;/a&gt; has compounded the problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;An anecdote, not an antidote&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p id="1b34" data-selectable-paragraph=""&gt;My patient Sara’s ADHD was well controlled with three 18 mg pills of an extended-release form of Ritalin each morning. She takes two upon waking and the third pill about three hours later, before noon. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="1b34" data-selectable-paragraph=""&gt;If she takes all 54 mg first thing in the morning she feels unmedicated and less functional by the end of her day. The three 18 mg pill regimen has been much easier for her to manage than two separate prescriptions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="1b34" data-selectable-paragraph=""&gt;When she tried to juggle taking a 36 mg pill first, and an 18 mg pill later, she had too many days with either unfilled prescriptions or misplaced pill bottles. Simple things like that trip up many individuals with ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="5167" data-selectable-paragraph=""&gt;Her life was on track…. until her most recent attempt at filling her prescription. I entered the instructions into the electronic prescribing software. For clarity, and to prevent the insurance company from forcing Sara to take a single 54 mg pill, I amended these directions so they read:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="b3fb" data-selectable-paragraph=""&gt;“Take 3 pills every morning. Two pills early a.m., and one pill late a.m..” In addition, the system required that I check boxes that denote that for a 30-day supply, Sarah will receive 90 pills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="7211" data-selectable-paragraph=""&gt;After months of this prescription working smoothly, the pharmacy abruptly objected. Their fax demanded: “Six pills a day?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="6ad3" data-selectable-paragraph=""&gt;I faxed back that nothing in those two separate sentences, or the box marked “three pills a day,” indicated six pills a day. I received faxes back about “inconsistent instructions.” The pharmacy sent me more than six faxes before they were willing to fill the prescription.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="bf24" data-selectable-paragraph=""&gt;This was not a case of deciphering illegible handwriting. Or translating obscure Latin abbreviations. When I shared the story, some people suspected that the pharmacy response was so inane that it must have been written by AI, not a real human. Perhaps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="9504" data-selectable-paragraph=""&gt;But the system is broken if it took six back-and-forths before fixing a non-existent problem. Maybe it was generated by a bot, but the pharmacy’s reaction aligned so closely with many other incidents. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="9504" data-selectable-paragraph=""&gt;These are cases in which a pharmacist responded quickly, and without thinking, to a prescription that seemed slightly out of the ordinary, and then had trouble comprehending and reframing their initial impulsive reaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="9504" data-selectable-paragraph=""&gt; Numerous times pharmacists have claimed that there were “discrepancies” between what my electronic prescribing system printed in different sections of a prescription when all of the entries conveyed the same information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/self/woman-charged-extra-after-crying-during-doctors-visit"&gt;Woman Says She Was Charged Extra For 'Emotional Intervention' After Crying During A Recent Doctor's Visit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Electronic prescribing to the rescue&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p id="b2d0" data-selectable-paragraph=""&gt;Most states now mandate that prescriptions be sent in electronically, rather than as hand-written hard copies.&lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/20786190.2016.1254932" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank"&gt; Illegible handwriting&lt;/a&gt; no longer leads to filling a prescription with the wrong medication, or wrong dose. Upwards of 10% of hand-written prescriptions were not decipherable, and pharmacists tended to make more mistakes than doctors or nurses in reading them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ab4e" data-selectable-paragraph=""&gt;Ironically, I had at least two instances, years ago, of pharmacists calling to verify whether I had prescribed because my handwriting was so neat and legible. In this era of electronic prescriptions, I don’t have to worry about such calls anymore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ec32" data-selectable-paragraph=""&gt;Electronic prescribing was&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2995649/#:~:text=This%20study%20reviewed%202914%20electronic,a%20hospital%20admission%20or%20death." rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank"&gt; supposed to eliminate problems&lt;/a&gt; with poor handwriting and decrease errors in filling prescriptions. However, some studies found that the type of&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2667276623001464" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank"&gt; errors only shifted&lt;/a&gt;, rather than decreased, with the switch to electronic prescriptions. It was too easy for prescribers to click the wrong button, or select the wrong item when clicking on a list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="16f8" data-selectable-paragraph=""&gt;Many electronic prescribing systems are poorly designed, with cluttered and conflicting screens, and redundancies that don’t ensure quality control. Potential error warnings are delivered so frequently, and for such trivial and nonsensical reasons, that they are customarily ignored by many prescribers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="5797" data-selectable-paragraph=""&gt;I’ve read automated warnings that were incorrect about:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="bdaa" data-selectable-paragraph=""&gt;drug-drug interactions&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li id="2281" data-selectable-paragraph=""&gt;the mechanism of action&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li id="74fd" data-selectable-paragraph=""&gt;the&lt;a href="https://medium.com/wise-well/professionals-shouldnt-provide-medication-misinformation-373e64b5e5ef" rel="noopener nofollow"&gt; duration of action&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li id="4cab" data-selectable-paragraph=""&gt;how long a patient should take a medication&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li id="5a63" data-selectable-paragraph=""&gt;effective doses&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p id="b0cc" data-selectable-paragraph=""&gt;One recent, unnecessary alert informed me:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="4a78" data-selectable-paragraph=""&gt;“This is above the accepted daily dose range for this drug (400.0 mg/day) but near or below the accepted maximum daily dose of 450.0 mg/day. Please evaluate this dose for appropriateness.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fb23" data-selectable-paragraph=""&gt;Pharmacists who are exposed to such nonsense all day long incorporate misinformation into their understanding of medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="3b1a" data-selectable-paragraph=""&gt;And why are we still using faxes in the medical world? Having loose paper fluttering about the office is both an environmental waste and an opportunity for privacy violations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="3b1a" data-selectable-paragraph=""&gt;Many fax systems convert the faxes to emails anyway, so what is being saved or protected? Medicine needs to move beyond the&lt;a href="https://images.app.goo.gl/oxcdQeqgBPG8kbq38" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank"&gt; &lt;em&gt;Dragnet&lt;/em&gt; days&lt;/a&gt; of Sgt. Joe Friday asking for “Just the fax, ma’am.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;One more computer problem&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p id="af96" data-selectable-paragraph=""&gt;For almost a decade, Walgreens pill bottle labels incorrectly stated “no refills” about 20% of the time when there were actual refills on the original prescription. But their computers contained accurate records of those potential refills. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="af96" data-selectable-paragraph=""&gt;The erroneous information on the labels &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/things-you-dont-realize-do-because-high-functioning-anxiety"&gt;created untold anxiety&lt;/a&gt; and inefficiency, as worried patients contacted their pharmacy to find out whether they had refills or not, doctors had to field calls to rewrite prescriptions that were still in the system, and pharmacists had to deal with aggravated patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ba3d" data-selectable-paragraph=""&gt;This problem was pervasive enough that it was not a simple data entry problem, it was a software problem. I understand that a coding bug that causes an intermittent problem is harder to detect and correct than an error that completely shuts down the system. But this error cost pharmacies time and goodwill and should have been solved much more quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="5cb1" data-selectable-paragraph=""&gt;This failure to fix a problem reinforces the public’s perception that the corporate forces running modern medicine simply don’t care about people. They don’t care about the people they are serving or those they employ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="e321" data-selectable-paragraph=""&gt;Another example of this is that many big chain pharmacies appear as if they are intergalactic pharmacist training centers. As soon as a pharmacist grows comfortable with their computer system and familiar with the customers, they get transferred away to another location. The pharmacists are treated as indistinguishable cogs in a machine, rather than as a part of a human community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="4728" data-selectable-paragraph=""&gt;More than half of pharmacists currently endorse that they are&lt;a href="https://www.industrypharmacist.org/resources/2d739c86cc7a4e0cabcaca7825773d9f.pdf" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank"&gt; experiencing burnout&lt;/a&gt;. Excessive workload and paperwork top the list of &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/signs-burned-out-according-psychologist"&gt;contributors to this burnout&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="media media--type-image media--view-mode-default"&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" src="/sites/default/files/image_blog/2025-01/pharmcists-failing-world-fraying.png" alt="Pharmacies Are Failing And Our World Is Fraying" title="Pharmacies Are Failing And Our World Is Fraying" class="img-fluid" typeof="foaf:Image"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-credit field--type-string field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;Kite_rin / Shutterstock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="4728" data-selectable-paragraph=""&gt;Pharmacists are leaving the field in record numbers. There were more than&lt;a href="https://www.aacp.org/sites/default/files/2023-10/pharmacy-demand-report-10172023.pdf" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank"&gt; 60,000 job postings&lt;/a&gt; for pharmacists in 2023, and many remained unfilled, despite signing bonuses of tens of thousands of dollars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="c717" data-selectable-paragraph=""&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.appliedpolicy.com/the-u-s-pharmacist-shortage/#:~:text=Of%20the%20approximately%20323%2C500%20pharmacists,3%20billion%20prescription%20each%20year." rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;Understaffed pharmacies&lt;/a&gt; leave more work for those who remain on the job, and longer waits for customers. The prevalence of frustration with corporate control over our current medical system was recently demonstrated by the&lt;a href="https://people.com/luigi-mangione-sympathy-hampering-investigation-law-enforcement-expert-exclusive-8759018" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank"&gt; outpouring of sympathy&lt;/a&gt; extended towards the assassin of the CEO of a major managed care conglomerate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Government makes it worse&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p id="5107" data-selectable-paragraph=""&gt;In addition to corporate pressure, pharmacists face increasing government regulation. The thousands of needless deaths from the opioid crisis provoked federal agencies to more tightly regulate the dispensing of controlled substances. As a result, prescriptions for&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/overdose-prevention/about/understanding-the-opioid-overdose-epidemic.html#:~:text=From%202021%2D2022%3A1&amp;amp;text=The%20rate%20of%20overdose%20deaths%20involving%20heroin%20decreased%2036%25.,prescription%20opioids%20decreased%20approximately%2012%25." rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank"&gt; opioid pain medications&lt;/a&gt; have decreased as have deaths from opioid overdoses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="c0c9" data-selectable-paragraph=""&gt;However, some individuals who were using prescription opioids responsibly have been cut off from the medications that enabled them to function and reduce intense suffering. Other downsides of the new regulations are that pharmacies and doctors have been burdened with new paperwork and threats of legal liability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="c524" data-selectable-paragraph=""&gt;Magnifying the problem, some pharmacies have employed draconian measures extending far beyond the federal regulations. They seem more concerned about the potential for reprimands than about providing a service to their patients. They’re practicing cover-themselves pharmacy rather than patient care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/self/victim-medical-gaslighting"&gt;I Was A Victim Of Medical Gaslighting — 'You Don't Look Sick'&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;A patient stuck in the morass&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p id="0942" data-selectable-paragraph=""&gt;For seven years before I first started working with Ferris, and for the 11 years he has been my patient, he has been using the same medications to deal with symptoms from his lupus, degenerated spinal column, ADHD, and occasional panic attacks. He never refilled his controlled substance prescriptions early, had shown no signs of medication misuse, and had no problematic or dangerous side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="b47a" data-selectable-paragraph=""&gt;Recently, a panic attack sent Ferris to the ER. Hours later, the pharmacist refused to refill his prescription for the anti-anxiety medication he takes for emergencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="cbe7" data-selectable-paragraph=""&gt;I called and spoke with the pharmacist, and then the chief pharmacist managing the store. I reviewed with her Ferris’ diagnoses, symptomatic responses, stability of his dosing regimen, and his awareness of the potential for side effects and drug interactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="89d5" data-selectable-paragraph=""&gt;She said that she wasn’t comfortable filling his prescriptions. She said it was because of the DEA scrutiny regarding individuals taking multiple controlled medications. I reminded her that I had just explained the medical justification for each agent and that her notes about our conversation would satisfy all DEA requirements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="131b" data-selectable-paragraph=""&gt;She insisted that the DEA required that she have all of Ferris’ office notes and that she wouldn’t fill the prescription without them. She didn’t question, or cite as problematic, any aspect of his care. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="131b" data-selectable-paragraph=""&gt;She claimed that even a signed and written note from me summarizing what we had just discussed would not suffice. No chart, no prescription refill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="88c0" data-selectable-paragraph=""&gt;After more than two decades of using this pharmacy, Ferris, with back pain and limited mobility, trudged three-quarters of a mile down the street to a Walgreens pharmacy. He had never filled prescriptions there, and the pharmacist was completely unfamiliar with him. Yet after a simple check of the state database of his history of filling controlled substance prescriptions, the pharmacist filled all of Ferris’ prescriptions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="1f7a" data-selectable-paragraph=""&gt;No DEA rule precluded him from doing so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="8c91" data-selectable-paragraph=""&gt;I don’t know what motivated the first pharmacist’s reluctance. I’m pretty sure she wasn’t a bot. However, she was unwilling to engage with the facts of the situation, either regarding the patient’s health or what government regulations stipulated. It appeared that she made an impulsive decision and was unable to stop and think about her position.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Our brains on computers&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p id="f3bb" data-selectable-paragraph=""&gt;In 2011, author&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6418852/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank"&gt; Nicholas Carr’s book&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;The Shallows: What the Internet Is Doing to Our Brains&lt;/em&gt; summarized the neuroscience showing that internet immersion results in shorter attention spans. But more importantly, he explored how computers rewire our brains so that we respond more quickly, crave emotionally laden information, and reduce our ability to think deeply about topics. Our ability to understand context and nuance diminishes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="acac" data-selectable-paragraph=""&gt;As we think less deeply, we also diminish &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/things-easy-youre-empathetic-very-challenging-normal-people"&gt;our ability to empathize&lt;/a&gt;. Multiple factors are at play in shaping all of our behaviors. The busy workdays and excessive paperwork facing pharmacists interfere with their very ability to do their jobs. But I think I am detecting larger, more pervasive trends in local drugstores that reflect greater social patterns. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="7bf0" data-selectable-paragraph=""&gt;The influence of the internet may provide us with more facts, more entertainment, and more stuff, but it is also contributing to us being less patient, more superficial, less informed, and less considerate. It makes us more easily manipulated by corporations, the media, and political parties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="607f" data-selectable-paragraph=""&gt;How do we remedy this?

	&lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/robert-f-kennedy-jr/" id="auto-tag_robert-f-kennedy-jr" data-tag="robert-f-kennedy-jr"&gt;Robert F. Kennedy Jr.&lt;/a&gt; is a vaccine conspiracy theorist with no real medical experience — which is why thousands of doctors and &lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/nobel-prize-winners-urge-senators-reject-rfk-jr-hhs-1235198466/"&gt;dozens of Nobel Prize winners&lt;/a&gt; opposed his confirmation to run the Department of Health and Human Services, and why countless others have been concerned about his ability to lead the nation through an infectious disease outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	Well, &lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/measles/" id="auto-tag_measles" data-tag="measles"&gt;measles&lt;/a&gt; has been spreading through West Texas since late January, and, sure enough, &lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/rfk-jr/" id="auto-tag_rfk-jr" data-tag="rfk-jr"&gt;RFK Jr.&lt;/a&gt; hasn’t appeared up to the task.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	Kennedy addressed the measles outbreak during President Donald Trump’s first Cabinet meeting late last month. He &lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/rfk-jr-measles-outbreak-texas-vaccines-1235281134/"&gt;largely brushed off&lt;/a&gt; the severity of the outbreak — claiming, falsely, that it’s “not unusual” — despite it resulting in the first measles death in the United States in a decade. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	A few days later, Kennedy was exploring nature in California. “Afternoon mountaineering above Coachella Valley,” he captioned &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/rfkjr/posts/afternoon-mountaineering-above-coachella-valley/1033006362196705/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;a Facebook post&lt;/a&gt; featuring a few shots of him smiling atop some rocks.

	&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	Politico &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/03/05/rfk-measles-scrutiny-00214952" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; on Thursday that the post caused alarm throughout HHS, where officials are working around the clock to contain the disease that has already infected &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;over 150 people&lt;/a&gt;. “It’s a serious role, he’s just a couple of weeks in and measles is not a common occurrence, and it should be all hands on deck,” a former Trump official who has spoken to current health officials told the outlet. “When you’re taking a selfie out at Coachella, it’s pretty clear that you’re checked out.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	The reason measles outbreaks are not common — despite what Kennedy said during the Cabinet meeting last week — is the efficacy of the vaccine. The disease has made something of a comeback in the past 20 years amid a rise in vaccine hesitancy, which Kennedy has long been fueling.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	It isn’t surprising that he’s pushing alternative medicine rather than vaccination as the outbreak spreads. Kennedy touted the MMR vaccine and said Americans need to make a “personal choice” about whether to get it in &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/robert-f-kennedy-jr-measles-outbreak-call-action-all-us" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;an op-ed&lt;/a&gt; for Fox News on Sunday, but he also praised the effects of vitamin A, writing that it can “dramatically reduce measles mortality.” Experts have pushed back. “Vitamin A is not a substitute for vaccination,” Dr. Megan Ranney, dean of the Yale School of Public Health, recently &lt;a href="https://amp.cnn.com/cnn/2025/03/05/health/measles-rfk-vitamin-a-misinformation" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;told CNN&lt;/a&gt;, with Dr. Amesh Adalja of the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security adding that Kennedy is taking information about vitamin A from scientific studies “out of context.”

	&lt;/p&gt;






&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) &lt;a href="https://www.warren.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/as-measles-epidemic-spreads-warren-demands-rfk-jr-explain-irresponsible-and-reckless-efforts-to-undermine-vaccines-at-health-agency" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;wrote a letter&lt;/a&gt; to Kennedy the following day. “In your March 2nd op-ed responding to the Texas measles outbreak, which has already killed one unvaccinated child, you failed to include a strong call for vaccinations. Instead, you claimed that ‘good nutrition remains a best defense against most chronic and infectious diseases.’ Do you believe good nutrition is a better defense against measles than the MMR vaccine? Will you change course and tell American parents to vaccinate their children to protect against measles, yes or no?”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	Kennedy &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/video/6369595673112" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;went on Fox News&lt;/a&gt; to discuss the outbreak on Tuesday. He did promote vaccination, but also touted how the HHS has “delivered vitamin A,” while also citing the steroid budesonide, the antibiotic clarithromycin, and cod liver oil as treatments. Dr. Ashish K. Jha, a former professor at the Harvard School of Public Health who served as President Joe Biden’s Covid-19 response coordinator, &lt;a href="https://x.com/ashishkjha/status/1897051550717026648" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;wrote on X&lt;/a&gt; that the appearance was “beyond absurd.”

&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	“No, steroids don’t treat measles,” he continued. “No Cod Liver Oil doesn’t treat measles. Vitamin A helps in poor countries where kids have vitamin deficiency. Managing measles is about prevention (vaccines), not quack treatments.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	Unfortunately for the people in West Texas contending with the disease — and for the rest of America — quack treatments are what’s in order as long as Kennedy is leading the nation’s health services.&lt;/p&gt;

The 10-3-2-1-0 is a presleep routine that helps you relax and signals both your body and mind that it's time to wind down. Here is everything you need to know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-small c-shortcodeImage-pullRight"&gt;&lt;a rel href="https://www.cnet.com/health-tips/" target="_blank" class="c-shortcodeImage_imageContainer"&gt;   &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;10 hours before bed: no more caffeine&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caffeine is the most commonly consumed &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4400203/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;psychoactive substance&lt;/a&gt; in the world. Caffeine consumption should ideally end 10 hours before bed since it can disrupt your sleep-wake cycle when consumed closer to bedtime. The half-life of a single dose of caffeine is about &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4400203/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;three to seven hours&lt;/a&gt;, so your body takes a minimum of 10 hours to eliminate caffeine from your bloodstream. This is a good general rule, but 10 hours may be too rigid for some as sensitivity to caffeine varies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Along with coffee, caffeine may also be present in other &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/sleep/3-drinks-you-should-avoid-before-bed/" target="_self"&gt;drinks&lt;/a&gt;, such as sports drinks, soda, energy drinks, some teas and chocolate. Certain &lt;a href="https://www.columbiadoctors.org/news/count-down-not-sheep-good-nights-sleep" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;medications&lt;/a&gt; may also contain caffeine. You must read the labels of medications or &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/sleep/4-reasons-your-nightly-drink-is-causing-bad-sleep-and-what-to-do-about-it/" target="_self"&gt;drinks&lt;/a&gt; you're consuming, to avoid caffeine consumption around your bedtime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;3 hours before bed: no more food or alcohol &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although consumption of alcohol before bed may seem to be relaxing, it is a common &lt;a href="https://www.sleepfoundation.org/nutrition" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;disruptor&lt;/a&gt; of sleep. It leads to decreased sleep quality and causes frequent overnight awakenings, which ultimately makes you feel tired throughout the next day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It may also be beneficial to avoid consuming certain &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/sleep/the-foods-you-eat-can-help-you-sleep-catch-more-zzzs-with-these-7-yummy-snacks/" target="_self"&gt;foods&lt;/a&gt; three hours before bed, since they can lead to &lt;a href="https://www.sleepfoundation.org/nutrition" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;heartburn (acid reflux)&lt;/a&gt; and disrupt sleep. A few such foods include fried, spicy and high-fat foods. You may also want to avoid foods high in &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1559827619870476" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;added sugars&lt;/a&gt; such as candies, cookies and desserts, since they can also lead to poor sleep quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;2 hours before bed: no more work&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may want to &lt;a href="https://www.columbiadoctors.org/news/count-down-not-sheep-good-nights-sleep" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;end&lt;/a&gt; all work-related activities two hours before bed to ensure you get good quality sleep. Relaxing your mind will help you prepare for sleep. You can &lt;a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/sleep-hygiene" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;practice&lt;/a&gt; meditation, muscle relaxation and journaling to calm your mind after work. This helps to create a buffer time zone between your work and sleep time, allowing your brain to slow down and promoting a better quality of sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;1 hour before bed: no more screens &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's suggested to avoid using smartphones, televisions, computers, tablets or other devices at least one hour before bed &lt;em&gt;in&lt;/em&gt; your actual bed. Blue light before bed is not generally recommended, it is not as &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-023-01791-7" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;disruptive as we once thought&lt;/a&gt;. Sleep experts still urge you to avoid using screens in your bed before trying to go to sleep. If your bed is the one place you scroll on your phone or watch TV the most, the body will associate your bed as a place to be awake; making it harder to fall asleep at night.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Hit snooze 0 times in the morning&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hitting the snooze button may disrupt your sleep cycle, making you feel &lt;a href="https://www.columbiadoctors.org/news/count-down-not-sheep-good-nights-sleep" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;more tired&lt;/a&gt;. It's often better to get up with one alarm. The sleep between the alarms is often fragmented and low quality, which may &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9804954/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;decrease&lt;/a&gt; your overall alertness and motivation throughout the day. Along with making you tired, snoozing alarms can also make you late for your daily activities. Additionally, getting up with the first alarm, even if it feels difficult initially, can help reinforce a consistent sleep-wake pattern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Other sleep hygiene tips&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Oscar Wong/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few common tips that will help to maintain your sleep hygiene and ensure good &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/sleep/stop-sabotaging-your-sleep-quality-by-dropping-these-7-common-habits/" target="_self"&gt;quality &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/sleep/busting-7-popular-sleep-myths-and-the-real-tricks-to-get-better-rest/" target="_self"&gt;sleep&lt;/a&gt; every night include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keep electronics out of the bedroom: &lt;/strong&gt;Keeping electronics out of your bedroom will ensure you are not getting exposed to blue light from them, which can disrupt your sleep-wake cycle.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Create a routine: &lt;/strong&gt;Creating a sleep routine prepares your body and mind for sleep. It signals to your body that it is time to sleep, ensuring timely and good-quality sleep.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avoid late-night exercise: &lt;/strong&gt;Although exercise is good for your health, doing it one to two hours before bed can disrupt your sleep. Rigorous exercise close to your bedtime &lt;a href="https://www.sleepfoundation.org/physical-activity/exercise-and-sleep" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;can&lt;/a&gt; increase your heart rate, adrenaline levels and body temperature, thereby making it difficult for you to fall asleep. Try gentle stretching or &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/sleep/hack-your-sleep-routine-with-these-9-simple-yoga-poses/" target="_self"&gt;yoga poses&lt;/a&gt;, instead. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keep mid-day naps to 30 or shorter: &lt;/strong&gt;Keeping your naps to 15 to 20 minutes or shorter can keep you &lt;a href="https://www.sleepfoundation.org/how-sleep-works/myths-and-facts-about-sleep" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;energetic&lt;/a&gt; throughout the day. However, longer naps can interfere with your normal sleep time and make you feel lethargic and disoriented.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make your bedroom dark: &lt;/strong&gt;Making your &lt;a href="https://www.sleepfoundation.org/how-sleep-works/myths-and-facts-about-sleep" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;bedroom dark&lt;/a&gt; ensures high-quality sleep. Even low light can increase your risk of nighttime awakenings and disrupt your sleep cycle.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don't watch TV or scroll on your phone in bed:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/doomscrolling-on-my-phone-ruins-my-quality-sleep/" target="_self"&gt;Scrolling&lt;/a&gt; your phone or watching TV in bed can associate your bed as a place to be awake. Try to only use your bed for sleep.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wind your mind down before bed:&lt;/strong&gt; Winding your mind before bed ensures your mind is calm and your body is preparing to fall asleep. This, in turn, ensures you get high-quality sleep and do not experience any awakenings.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Try this bedtime routine tonight &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Yrabota/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Better sleep means a better quality of life along with better mood, improved productivity and reduced stress. Instead of tossing and turning in your bed, try the 10-3-2-1-0 sleep routine. Although getting used to any routine is difficult, focus on gradual, sustainable changes rather than a perfect routine to reduce stress and anxiety about sleep. Hopefully, this advice will help you unwind and make falling asleep and getting good quality sleep easier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>CNET</author><pubDate>Thu, 06 Mar 2025 17:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirAFBVV95cUxNZWdjaUNjaW5GbUh5S0xUTWZCbzZ0eW11UnF3NE1yTm5RODVWb3NwcmY2TVd3OTFOZmNHdzA1Um5waUJvbG5iUlAwazRHLXhqZXgtQW1KRFVNUUVGaW5NOWVYNXBGb29KYmo0ZnQ0MUpWb2xzaHBqVjFYS0ozVExuUkdUZlBZVmMxbVU5dzUzaDFrZE5rUXRIeWpIa2daeU9tOXpUaTZ4SkpZZUNx</guid></item><item><title>Urgent recall of cat food 'infected with bird flu' - pet owners could be at risk of deadly disease - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMingFBVV95cUxQNkhiX1hjSWpaUjBlRmFYRlFrY0o4SXlzVnczdTlJaTlLS19zR1VWS0thRk5mdHVtek04WTdnQ01nYllaMmhnQWotcjZYeTVKVFAxN2RlWWlFbFd2T1VCell5MkE4elUwYlF0THc0TmNwLTJRYUtvQXFYbDF2VGNael9RTzNpOUZNanZNNi1PWEY1WFRVeGdjSmg2MEFPQdIBowFBVV95cUxQZC0xci1vOEVzdDBVaEUzNmkwTUh3NFBKRU4ySVl4RXR5aVlCTXZrVzNhUU1hMTNuNFhCWnRlc0RUa1Rib280RWxBbk5NWmxKaEg1X1dONUxWMHE3Y0NMc0RSSWxTWXQ3VGZET2VDNkRlSHcwVThWdFdJeEQzZ1o5Y2dxOHdfSUFCY1Z1dGRkZERsU3YzNHpaUHJWSzkwc0w1M1dB?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A trendy brand of raw cat food has been urgently recalled amid fears it's contaminated with bird &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/flu/index.html" id="mol-a84630c0-fa98-11ef-b82d-0745da11c8bf" class=""&gt;flu&lt;/a&gt; and could put pet owners at risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;US-based pet food brand, Wild Coast Raw, issued the &lt;a target="_self" href="/yourmoney/product-recalls/index.html" id="mol-a84a2860-fa98-11ef-b82d-0745da11c8bf" class=""&gt;recall&lt;/a&gt; of its frozen Boneless Free Range Chicken Formula following the death of a pet and tests of the food came back positive for the &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/bird-flu/index.html" id="mol-276e8a60-fa9d-11ef-b263-d10e88c452cd"&gt;avian influenza&lt;/a&gt; virus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While no human cases have been reported, there are fears pet owners who handled the food, and then touched their eyes, nose or mouth, could be at risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Officials from the US Food and Drug Administration have urged people who handled suspect batches of the pet food to watch for potential bird flu symptoms.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'People who handled contaminated products should watch for symptoms of bird flu, including eye redness or irritation (conjunctivitis), cough, sore throat, sneezing, runny/stuffy nose, muscle/body aches, headaches, fatigue, fever, trouble breathing, seizures, rash, diarrhoea, nausea, and/or vomiting,' a notice from the agency reads. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'People exhibiting these signs after having contact with this product should contact their healthcare provider and local health department.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Owners who have already fed the food to their pets have also been warned to look out for the symptoms in their cats. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Wild Coast founder Tyler Duncan said they issued the recall following the death of a pet that was recently fed their product ‘out of an abundance of caution’.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;At least 99 domestic cats have been infected with bird flu since late 2022, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;US-based pet food brand, Wild Coast Raw, has issued a recall of its cat food due to possible contamination with Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘The safety of our products and that of our customers’ beloved pets is always our top priority.

Here’s everything you need to know about the virus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;Texas requires public and private school students to receive two doses of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine. Parents can apply for an exemption for “reasons of conscience,” including “a religious or personal belief that goes against getting immunized.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;Measles is one of the most contagious viruses in the world and spreads mostly among unvaccinated people. For a community to be protected, enough residents must be vaccinated to provide “herd immunity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;For measles, that means 95% of people must be vaccinated for the community to be protected, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;Officials from the Dallas County Health and Human Services urged parents to check children’s immunization records and schedule vaccination if they have not yet received them, according to a &lt;a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1t3hHqEqmcX22_2Dt8Pc7psYBwjbS00C3/view" rel="" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1t3hHqEqmcX22_2Dt8Pc7psYBwjbS00C3/view"&gt;notice sent Thursday.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;On Thursday morning, Schott &lt;a href="https://x.com/landonschott/status/1897679129006207122" target="_self" rel="" title="https://x.com/landonschott/status/1897679129006207122"&gt;posted to X&lt;/a&gt;, formerly Twitter: “Don’t let spiritually unhealthy people tell you how to be healthy!” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;Later in the day, Schott &lt;a href="https://x.com/malachiobrien/status/1897731218856431707" rel="" title="https://x.com/malachiobrien/status/1897731218856431707"&gt;reposted a tweet from another account&lt;/a&gt; praising Mercy Culture Prep’s low vaccination rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;“Why is it important?

Kennedy Jr.] is showing us the truth about many vaccines.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;Kennedy, secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, has been criticized for falsely stating vaccines can cause autism.

&lt;p&gt;FORT WORTH, Texas — A Fort Worth pastor is celebrating his school's distinction as &lt;a href="/article/news/health/measles-texas-vaccine-vaccination-rates-schools-dfw-fort-worth-dallas/287-1c321c7d-d1ff-4326-ae9b-eec5c9100699" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;the least-vaccinated school&lt;/a&gt; in Texas.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mercy Culture pastor Landon Schott, whose Mercy Culture Preparatory Academy has a measles vaccination rate of 14.29%, &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DG1I-g-xAPx/?igsh=MTJtaTdsemV1b2Nwcg%253D%253D" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;posted a video on Instagram&lt;/a&gt; congratulating Mercy Culture Prep families "that embrace freedom of health."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"They're not allowing the government or science projects to affect how you live and lead your life," Schott said. "I know the entire world was shut down with insanity and people were fired from their jobs for forced vaccinations, and freedom is something we take seriously."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schott was posting the video in front of balloons and as he posed with a t-shirt that declared Mercy Culture Prep as the least-vaccinated school in the state.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mercy Culture Prep's vaccination rate -- which is required to be reported to the Texas Department of Health and Human Services -- drew attention last week amid heightened awareness over a measles outbreak in West Texas.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WFAA's previous reporting showed that Mercy Culture Prep had the lowest MMR vaccination rate in Texas, at 14.29%, among kindergartners in the 2023-2024 school year. The MMR vaccine protects against measles, mumps and rubella.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next-lowest number for MMR vaccination rate in North Texas was 38.10% at Collin County Cornerstone Christian Academy.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most North Texas schools and districts have vaccination rates above 75%, and numerous vaccination rates are in the upper 90% range. About 62 North Texas schools had a 100% vaccination rate among kindergartners in the 2023-2024 school year.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"So shoutout to MC Prep for being the least vaccinated school in Texas," Schott said in his video. "We'll take it. Or as Mercy Culture says, we celebrate it. We'll put it on the board."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the measles outbreak was mostly limited to West Texas – there was one case confirmed in an adult in North Texas (Rockwall County) – public health officials and doctors warned that vaccination is the best defense against spreading the rare virus.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measles is "probably the most infectious contagious disease on the planet," said Dr. Suzanne Whitworth, division chief of pediatric infectious diseases at Cook Children's in Fort Worth&lt;a href="/article/news/health/answers-to-your-questions-and-general-guidelines-on-measles-outbreak-in-texas/287-48e4c451-22e5-403b-b810-bfda235c3d03" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt; previously told WFAA.&lt;/a&gt; "We know that about 40% of kids under the age of five who get measles are gonna wind up in the hospital, and nobody wants that."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;A Pennsylvania infant brought measles back from travel. &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/measles/measles-cases-reported-philadelphia-area-and-texas-traveler" target="_blank"&gt;CIDRAP&lt;/a&gt;. The family was on the China Airlines shuttle bus from JFK Airport to North Philadelphia late the night of 2-25, at True North Pediatrics in Plymouth Meeting, PA from 11:15 am to 2:15 pm on the 26th, and at CHOP Emergency Department in King of Prussia, PA between 1 and 3pm&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A King County, WA infant with measles was at the Apple Store in Bellevue Square, the Seattle Children's Hospital emergency department, Allegro Pediatrics in Bothell, and Northwest Asthma and Allergy Center in Redmond on about Feb. 20.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An Austin Texas infant also brought home measles from abroad, but the whole family was vaccinated and are isolating at home, no spread is expected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Texas outbreak has grown to 159, with 22 hospitalized.  Florida has entered the chat also, with Palmetto High School in Miami reporting a case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wild Coast Raw has recalled their Boneless Free Range Chicken raw cat food, after it was linked to more illnesses in Washington cats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mystery illness in DR Congo is being tested for both pathogens and possible organo-phosphate poisoning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Uganda Ebola outbreak may not be entirely over.  A 4 year old child died, and it turns out his mother and sister had died earlier, untested and undiagnosed, their bodies were already buried.&lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/ebola/two-fatal-probable-cases-reported-ugandas-ebola-sudan-outbreak" target="_blank"&gt;This may imply spread not being caught.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A naturally occurring molecule identified by Stanford Medicine researchers appears similar to semaglutide—also known as Ozempic—in suppressing appetite and reducing body weight. Notably, testing in animals also showed that it worked without some of the drug's side effects, such as nausea, constipation and significant loss of muscle mass.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;The newly discovered molecule, BRP, acts through a separate but similar metabolic pathway and activates different neurons in the brain—seemingly offering a more targeted approach to body weight reduction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The receptors targeted by semaglutide are found in the brain but also in the gut, pancreas and other tissues," said assistant professor of pathology Katrin Svensson, Ph.D.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"That's why Ozempic has widespread effects, including slowing the movement of food through the digestive tract and lowering blood sugar levels. In contrast, BRP appears to act specifically in the hypothalamus, which controls appetite and metabolism."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Svensson has co-founded a company to launch clinical trials of the molecule in humans in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Svensson is the senior author of the &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08683-y" target="_blank"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt;, which was published in &lt;i&gt;Nature&lt;/i&gt;. Senior research scientist Laetitia Coassolo, Ph.D., is the lead author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study would not have been possible without the use of &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/artificial+intelligence/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;artificial intelligence&lt;/a&gt; to weed through dozens of proteins in a class called prohormones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prohormones are biologically inert molecules that become active when they are cleaved by other proteins into smaller pieces called peptides; some of these peptides then function as hormones to regulate complex biological outcomes, including &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/energy+metabolism/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;energy metabolism&lt;/a&gt;, in the brain and other organs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each prohormone can be divided in a variety of ways to create a plethora of functional peptide progeny. But with traditional methods of protein isolation, it's difficult to pick peptide hormones (which are relatively rare) out of the biological soup of the much more numerous natural byproducts of protein degradation and processing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers focused on the prohormone convertase 1/3 (also known as PCSK1/3), which separates prohormones at specific amino acid sequences and is known to be involved in human obesity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the peptide products is glucagon-like peptide 1, or GLP-1, which regulates appetite and blood sugar levels; semaglutide works by mimicking the effect of GLP-1 in the body. The team turned to artificial intelligence to help them identify other peptides involved in energy metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;h2&gt;Peptide Predictor&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of manually isolating proteins and peptides from tissues and using techniques like &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/mass+spectrometry/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;mass spectrometry&lt;/a&gt; to identify hundreds of thousands of peptides, the researchers designed a computer algorithm they named "Peptide Predictor" to identify typical prohormone convertase cleavage sites in all 20,000 human protein-coding genes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They then focused on genes that encode proteins that are secreted outside the cell—a key characteristic of hormones—and that have four or more possible cleavage sites. Doing so narrowed down the search to 373 prohormones, a manageable number to screen for their biological effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The algorithm was absolutely key to our findings," Svensson said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peptide Predictor predicted that prohormone convertase 1/3 would generate 2,683 unique peptides from the 373 proteins. Coassolo and Svensson focused on sequences likely to be biologically active in the brain. They screened 100 peptides, including GLP-1, for their ability to activate lab-grown neuronal cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As expected, the GLP-1 peptide had a robust effect on the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/neuronal+cells/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;neuronal cells&lt;/a&gt;, increasing their activity threefold over control cells. But a small peptide made up of just 12 amino acids bumped up the cells' activity 10-fold over controls. The researchers named this peptide BRP based on its parent prohormone, BPM/retinoic acid inducible neural specific 2, or BRINP2 (BRINP2-related-peptide).&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;p&gt;When the researchers tested the effect of BRP on lean mice and minipigs (which more closely mirror human metabolism and eating patterns than mice do), they found that an intramuscular injection of BRP prior to feeding reduced food intake over the next hour by up to 50% in both animal models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obese mice treated with daily injections of BRP for 14 days lost an average of 3 grams—due almost entirely to fat loss—while control animals gained about 3 grams over the same period. The mice also demonstrated improved glucose and insulin tolerance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Behavioral studies of the mice and pigs found no differences in the treated animals' movements, water intake, anxiety-like behavior or fecal production. And further studies of physiological and brain activity showed that BRP activates metabolic and neuronal pathways separate from those activated by GLP-1 or semaglutide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers hope to identify the cell-surface receptors that bind BRP and to further dissect the pathways of its action. They are also investigating how to help the peptide's effects last longer in the body to allow a more convenient dosing schedule if the peptide proves to be effective in regulating human body weight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The lack of effective drugs to treat obesity in humans has been a problem for decades," Svensson said. "Nothing we've tested before has compared to semaglutide's ability to decrease appetite and body weight. We are very eager to learn if it is safe and effective in humans."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers from the University of California, Berkeley; the University of Minnesota; and the University of British Columbia contributed to the work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Svensson and Coassolo are inventors on patents regarding BRP &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/peptides/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;peptides&lt;/a&gt; for metabolic disorders. Svensson is a co-founder of Merrifield Therapeutics.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cracking the window open in vehicles can also help to 'improve airflow and reduce airborne virus concentration'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, Dr Detwiler recommends keeping your hands away from your face as your eyes, nose, and mouth are direct entry points for pathogens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Moving through TSA security&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The TSA security checkpoints are one of the dirtiest areas in an airport, Dr Detwiler warns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He says: 'Much like old days when public pay phones were the most handled (and contaminated) surfaces, today those plastic security bins harbor more respiratory viruses than public toilets.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To prevent the spread of germs, he recommends using hand sanitizer immediately after touching the security bins, conveyor belts, or fingerprint scanners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He also advises carrying a paper boarding pass or use mobile check-in to avoid using touch screen monitors, which harbor germs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And if you want to take your safety protocols up a notch, Dr Detwiler adds: 'You could consider wearing disposable gloves, but remember to remove them safely and sanitize afterward.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group floatRHS"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Darin Detwiler previously served as a public health expert for the FDA specializing in foodborne illnesses&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Navigating the terminal&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;With thousands of travelers from all over the world passing through each day, Dr Detwiler says terminals are high-risk areas for airborne illnesses like measles, flu, and RSV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For this reason, the health expert says wearing a facemask is a good idea, despite being out of the Covid pandemic era. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He recommends KN95 and N95 masks, as both are rated to filter out at least 95 percent of particles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And if you don't feel comfortable wearing it all the time, Dr Detwiler says it is essential to where masks in crowded areas if you want to maximize your safety,&lt;span&gt; 'particularly at security, near gate seating, and in restrooms'.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Other tips he offers to avoid germs is to maintain distance &lt;/span&gt;from anyone visibly ill (especially in boarding lines), to use your phone instead of self-check-in kiosks and shared touchscreens and to stay hydrated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Elaborating on his last tip, he explains: 'Dry air suppresses your immune system, making you more susceptible to infection, so it's best to keep a drink with you at all times.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Safely enjoying airport lounges &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Detwiler says premium airport lounges may offer a quieter atmosphere, but they're not immune to contamination, 'especially when it comes to shared food stations and high-touch surfaces'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For this reason, he advises avoiding self-serve buffets and opting for&lt;span&gt; packaged or made-to-order meals instead.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He also recommends disinfecting tables and seating areas before eating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another area of airport lounges he says is riddled with germs is the washroom and shower facilities, so he always uses a napkin or paper towel to open bathroom doors and touch faucets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Boarding the flight and being on the plane&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Once you step onto a plane, you're in close quarters with hundreds of people for hours. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While Dr Detwiler says High-Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) filters used on planes remove 99.9 percent of airborne particles such as dust, bacteria, and viruses, the biggest risk is proximity to other passengers - especially if you're sitting close to someone coughing or sneezing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The former FDA employee who is also an ardent traveler, says when he flies he always picks a window seat as &lt;span&gt;you'll have fewer encounters with passing passengers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He then always keeps his air vent open and directed slightly downward to 'create an airflow barrier'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And before taking his seat, he uses sanitizing wipes to clean high touch areas, including the tray table, armrests, seatbelt buckle, and touchscreen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One of Dr Detwiler's biggest no-nos while flying is using the seatback pockets, because he says they are rarely disinfected and may harbor bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Arrival and post-flight precautions&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Think you're safe once you've landed? Think again, says Dr Detwiler.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He reveals that the baggage claim area, customs, and ground transportation all present new risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Plus, he highlights that 'exhaustion can make you more vulnerable as you are less alert and it is easy to let your guard down'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To keep your health in check, he says the first step is sanitizing your hands after collecting your luggage, as your 'bag has been tossed around and handled by multiple people, moving along on conveyor belts, trolleys, and cargo holds'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He then says it is best to keep your mask on in customs and baggage claim as these areas are still crowded with travelers from all over the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;On returning home or arriving at a hotel, the final step is to shower and change into clean clothes as soon as possible - especially after long-haul flights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Thu, 06 Mar 2025 14:33:05 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>North Texas pastor celebrates school's lowest vaccination rate in the state: 'We'll take it' - WFAA.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimgJBVV95cUxPcFh3bThxVkREbE8xUkxTc1FqbWtvbGhPTGl2dTRWeUtsZGh1bFJweHVXNHhWUUNoM1RVcHEyRllnS0ViYlpxQ0NsNnF2Q0F1T1gyQU15c0t4bEdLazB5TXpjVjExZ0p2V2ktRWF6Zm1vY2xWd2RiUlF0UktzMF9jUFlXc0xFeHoteXpIOVRwZ1ZycVlaU3JpN2toTHM5T1ZJYzg2NklaU0w1TFVrZW81OElvY0tSenpVVS1zSXNYeVRiMHJBM0kwam04aEV3RFdaQnlJZ29aUnlhLWFHTVphSDdwRV9nSy1DSktCeEo0Z1FXbFVFM1ZjME9aT2FENXJmaFVLRkw1dldXMGtHdlV5Q2w1Qk9nYlZFY0E?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="article__summary"&gt;Mercy Culture pastor Landon Schott, whose Mercy Culture Preparatory Academy has a measles vaccination rate of 14.29%, posted a video on Instagram.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FORT WORTH, Texas — A Fort Worth pastor is celebrating his school's distinction as &lt;a href="/article/news/health/measles-texas-vaccine-vaccination-rates-schools-dfw-fort-worth-dallas/287-1c321c7d-d1ff-4326-ae9b-eec5c9100699" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;the least-vaccinated school&lt;/a&gt; in Texas.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mercy Culture pastor Landon Schott, whose Mercy Culture Preparatory Academy has a measles vaccination rate of 14.29%, &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DG1I-g-xAPx/?igsh=MTJtaTdsemV1b2Nwcg%253D%253D" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;posted a video on Instagram&lt;/a&gt; congratulating Mercy Culture Prep families "that embrace freedom of health."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"They're not allowing the government or science projects to affect how you live and lead your life," Schott said. "I know the entire world was shut down with insanity and people were fired from their jobs for forced vaccinations, and freedom is something we take seriously."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schott was posting the video in front of balloons and as he posed with a t-shirt that declared Mercy Culture Prep as the least-vaccinated school in the state.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mercy Culture Prep's vaccination rate -- which is required to be reported to the Texas Department of Health and Human Services -- drew attention last week amid heightened awareness over a measles outbreak in West Texas.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WFAA's previous reporting showed that Mercy Culture Prep had the lowest MMR vaccination rate in Texas, at 14.29%, among kindergartners in the 2023-2024 school year. The MMR vaccine protects against measles, mumps and rubella.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next-lowest number for MMR vaccination rate in North Texas was 38.10% at Collin County Cornerstone Christian Academy.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most North Texas schools and districts have vaccination rates above 75%, and numerous vaccination rates are in the upper 90% range. About 62 North Texas schools had a 100% vaccination rate among kindergartners in the 2023-2024 school year.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"So shoutout to MC Prep for being the least vaccinated school in Texas," Schott said in his video. "We'll take it. Or as Mercy Culture says, we celebrate it. We'll put it on the board."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the measles outbreak was mostly limited to West Texas – there was one case confirmed in an adult in North Texas (Rockwall County) – public health officials and doctors warned that vaccination is the best defense against spreading the rare virus.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measles is "probably the most infectious contagious disease on the planet," said Dr. Suzanne Whitworth, division chief of pediatric infectious diseases at Cook Children's in Fort Worth&lt;a href="/article/news/health/answers-to-your-questions-and-general-guidelines-on-measles-outbreak-in-texas/287-48e4c451-22e5-403b-b810-bfda235c3d03" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt; previously told WFAA.&lt;/a&gt; "We know that about 40% of kids under the age of five who get measles are gonna wind up in the hospital, and nobody wants that."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dietary habits of patients were assessed at the time of their diagnosis and disability progression was tracked for up to 15 years. While greater benefits were observed in those who regularly ate fish since their diagnosis, patients who increased their fish intake in the years after being diagnosed also saw reductions in the risk of disability progression over those who continued to eat little to no fish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings suggest “diet, particularly fish consumption, as a modifiable factor that could complement existing therapeutic strategies for MS,” the study’s researchers wrote in “&lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="https://jnnp.bmj.com/content/early/2025/02/04/jnnp-2024-335200"&gt;Impact of fish consumption on disability progression in multiple sclerosis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;,” which was published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery and Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In MS, the immune system launches damaging attacks on the &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/myelin-sheath/"&gt;myelin sheath&lt;/a&gt; that protects nerve cells, causing &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/symptoms-of-multiple-sclerosis/"&gt;symptoms&lt;/a&gt;. As damage accumulates over time, patients see worsening symptoms that cause disability levels to increase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/treatments-that-modify-the-disease-course/"&gt;disease-modifying therapies&lt;/a&gt; can slow the progression of disability, they cannot completely prevent it, so additional measures are needed to improve a person’s long-term outlook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Growing evidence touts the benefits of a &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/expert-voices/2021/12/15/expert-voices-diet-nutrition-supplements-multiple-sclerosis/"&gt;healthy diet&lt;/a&gt; in slowing disease progression. For example, &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/news-posts/2022/10/17/mediterranean-diet-associated-lower-disability-risk-study/"&gt;a Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt;, rich in fish and other healthy foods like vegetables, is linked to less disability, with older patients also reporting &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/news-posts/2024/04/09/mediterranean-diet-benefits-older-ms-patients-study/"&gt;better quality of life&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Eat more fish&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers at the Karolinska Institute in Sweden drew on data from 2,719 patients in a &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ane.12425"&gt;Swedish MS registry&lt;/a&gt; to explore whether eating more fish could slow disability progression. The registry included patients diagnosed between 2005 and 2015 who responded at enrollment to a questionnaire about environmental exposures and lifestyle habits. The patients were followed for up to 15 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The amount of fish they consumed had no impact on their disability levels, as assessed with the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), at the time of enrollment. However, those who reported eating fish weekly had a significantly lower risk of confirmed disability progression throughout the follow-up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specifically, eating lean fish each week such as cod, haddock, and whiting was linked to a 16% lower risk of confirmed disability worsening compared with seldom eating lean fish. Eating oily fish —  herring, mackerel, tuna, salmon, and trout — each week was linked to a 19% lower risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Confirmed disability worsening was defined as an increase in the EDSS score confirmed in a follow-up medical visit at least six months later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A fish intake frequency score that captured the broader pattern of lean and oily fish also showed that patients with the highest fish intake had a 34% lower risk of confirmed disability worsening than those who never or rarely ate fish. They also had a 45% lower risk of reaching an EDSS score of 3 (moderate disability) and a 43% lower risk of reaching an EDSS score of 4 (significant disability).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Increasing fish consumption after an MS diagnosis&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2021, 1,719 patients completed a follow-up questionnaire. Based on their answers, the researchers found that 288 patients increased their fish consumption after being diagnosed and 124 decreased their fish intake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The benefits of eating fish were greater among those who continued to eat fish regularly. But increasing fish intake could still have benefits in confirmed disability progression over the long term. For example, those who increased their consumption from the lowest scores of 2-3 to the highest scores of 5-6 in the five years after their diagnosis had a 20% lower risk of disability progression than those who continued with low fish consumption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The effects were similar after weighing other factors that may influence disability progression, including physical activity, weight, smoking, alcohol intake, and sun exposure. They also remained similar when adjusted for &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/vitamin-d-ms-multiple-sclerosis/"&gt;vitamin D&lt;/a&gt; levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our findings suggest that higher fish consumption is associated with a reduced risk of disability progression in MS, likely due to the anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties of nutrients found in fish,” wrote the researchers, who said more studies are needed to validate the results and “investigate the underlying biological mechanisms.” Future studies could also help determine if adding more lean and oily fish to the diet should become part of MS treatment plans.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An outbreak of tuberculosis, or TB – a lung disease that is often accompanied by a hacking cough – began in January 2024 in Kansas City, Kansas, and two nearby counties and &lt;a href="https://www.kdhe.ks.gov/2242/Tuberculosis-Outbreaks"&gt;continues as of early March 2025&lt;/a&gt;. To date, 147 people have been reportedly diagnosed with TB in the outbreak, with 67 becoming ill. The remaining 80 people diagnosed with TB in Kansas contracted the illness but showed no symptoms, which is called a latent infection.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;TB is the leading infectious cause of death around the world, outpaced only by &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/tuberculosis"&gt;COVID-19 during the first three years of the pandemic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Conversation asked microbiologists &lt;a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=zEgCkh0AAAAJ&amp;amp;hl=en"&gt;Karen Dobos&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7ZdujPQAAAAJ&amp;amp;hl=en"&gt;Marcela Henao-Tamayo&lt;/a&gt;, both from Colorado State University, to explain why this ancient disease seems to be making a comeback.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What’s the history of TB?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&lt;/em&gt; is the organism that causes the disease &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/tb/index.html"&gt;tuberculosis&lt;/a&gt; in humans. The disease has been infecting humans for thousands of years. Researchers found evidence of the disease &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0003426"&gt;9,000 years ago&lt;/a&gt; in the excavated remains of people who lived in the Eastern Mediterranean region during that time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reports of TB date back to around 410-400 B.C.E., when the physician Hippocrates termed the disease phthisis, an archaic word that means a progressive “wasting away,” due to the way &lt;a href="https://jmvh.org/article/history-of-tuberculosis-part-1-phthisis-consumption-and-the-white-plague/"&gt;people with the disease become emaciated&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TB was also known as consumption for the same reason. Similarly, it was called the white plague or white death – due to anemia from the disease, with people appearing pallid or chalky – leading to near-certain death. Untreated active TB, meaning cases that are symptomatic, is highly lethal. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About half of all people with untreated active TB &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/teams/global-tuberculosis-programme/tb-reports/global-tuberculosis-report-2022/tb-disease-burden/2-2-tb-mortality"&gt;die from the disease&lt;/a&gt;, whereas treatment &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/teams/global-tuberculosis-programme/tb-reports/global-tuberculosis-report-2024/tb-diagnosis-and-treatment/2-3-tb-treatment--coverage-and-outcomes#"&gt;reduces the death rate to 12%&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the more colorful phrases describing TB is “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.318.7199.1705"&gt;the king’s evil&lt;/a&gt;.” This is a form of TB that also causes neck swelling and lesions, a condition called scrofula. During the Middle Ages, people believed that the &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/28/3/AC-2803_article"&gt;touch of a king&lt;/a&gt; could cure a person from this form of TB through miraculous intervention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="align-center zoomable"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://images.theconversation.com/files/652994/original/file-20250304-56-w7lq80.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=1000&amp;amp;fit=clip"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;figcaption&gt;
              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;TB infections, which are typically found in the lungs, have risen since the COVID-19 pandemic.&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;a class="source" href="https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/illustration/lungs-affected-by-miliary-tuberculosis-royalty-free-illustration/1786411740?phrase=tuberculosis&amp;amp;adppopup=true"&gt;Kateryna Kon/Science Photo Library via Getty Images&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, TB was most ominously called the “robber of youth” due to its historical propensity to &lt;a href="https://doi-ds.org/doilink/11.2021-59178487/JMVH%20Vol%2022%20No%202"&gt;afflict people 15 to 30 years old&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1865, Jean Antoine Villemin, an army physician in Paris, demonstrated that TB could be transmitted from infected animals to healthy ones through inoculation. Before these studies, the cause of TB was &lt;a href="https://jmvh.org/article/history-of-tuberculosis-part-1-phthisis-consumption-and-the-white-plague/"&gt;presumed to be primarily constitutional&lt;/a&gt;, by either an inherent predisposition or from unhealthy or immoral lifestyles. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The microorganism causing TB was ultimately &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00000222.htm#"&gt;discovered in 1882&lt;/a&gt; by the German physician Robert Koch. Koch announced his findings on March 24, 1882, a day globally recognized as &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/campaigns/world-tb-day"&gt;World TB Day&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;How does TB spread?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tuberculosis is spread by small infectious droplets in the air. A TB patient may emit these droplets by coughing, singing and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1164/rccm.202110-2378OC"&gt;potentially from regular breathing that occurs during sleep or resting&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One form of TB can be spread through &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2021.02.091"&gt;unpasteurized dairy products&lt;/a&gt;. While rare, there have been reports of TB &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/72/wr/pdfs/mm725253-H.pdf"&gt;transmission through bone graphs&lt;/a&gt;, in which healthy, donated bone material is used to replace damaged bones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="align-right zoomable"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://images.theconversation.com/files/652866/original/file-20250304-56-tcty3a.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=1000&amp;amp;fit=clip"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;figcaption&gt;
              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;Close-up view of an infection by &lt;em&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;a class="source" href="https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/illustration/secondary-tuberculosis-infection-royalty-free-illustration/1042128494?phrase=tuberculosis&amp;amp;searchscope=image,film&amp;amp;adppopup=true"&gt;Kateryna Kon/Science Photo Library via Getty Images&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The origin of the TB outbreak in Kansas remains unknown as of early March 2025. The outbreak has disproportionately affected those in low-income communities, and two people have died from it.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Importantly, a patient with untreated TB &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/tuberculosis"&gt;can infect 10 to 15 others&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Could the COVID-19 pandemic be a factor?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The COVID-19 pandemic has played a &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/teams/global-tuberculosis-programme/tb-reports/global-tuberculosis-report-2022/covid-19-and-tb?utm_source=chatgpt.com"&gt;pivotal role in the resurgence of TB&lt;/a&gt;. Cases &lt;a href="https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/global-tuberculosis-report-2024/global-tb-report-2024_factsheet.pdf?"&gt;increased globally by 4.6% from 2020 to 2023&lt;/a&gt;, reversing decades of steady declines in the disease. In the U.S. alone, TB cases rose by &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/tb-surveillance-report-2023/summary/index.html"&gt;more than 15% from 2022 to 2023&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During mandatory shutdowns, people were &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMp2118145"&gt;less able to access health care centers&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2022.891711"&gt;early diagnosis of TB&lt;/a&gt; or to fill prescriptions for treatment, perhaps due to the fear of contracting COVID-19 while visiting a medical care facility. COVID-19-related disruptions in care &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/teams/global-tuberculosis-programme/tb-reports/global-tuberculosis-report-2024"&gt;resulted in nearly 700,000 excess deaths from TB&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Access to health care may not be the only factor behind this uptick. Medical supply shortages and delays in shipment may have also played a role. For example, the U.S. experienced &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/tb/php/dear-colleague-letters/2023-tb-drug-shortages.html"&gt;shortages of one of the primary TB drugs&lt;/a&gt; between 2021 and 2023. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="align-center zoomable"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://images.theconversation.com/files/652995/original/file-20250304-56-6124ni.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=1000&amp;amp;fit=clip"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;figcaption&gt;
              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;As illustrated by this 1963 photo, TB is often detected by an X-ray of the chest.&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;a class="source" href="https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/here-a-physician-and-nurse-examine-a-tuberculosis-positive-news-photo/579371112?adppopup=true"&gt;Smith Collection/Gado/Archive Photos via Getty Images&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What are the main treatments?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Multidrug treatment is currently the only way to cure TB and stop its spread.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prior to the late 1930s, when the first antibiotic for TB treatment was developed, TB treatments included bloodletting and consumption of cod liver oil. The most popular treatment involved isolated sanatoriums in high-altitude areas such as the Adirondacks and the Rocky Mountains, where the cold, dry air was &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.2307/4574446"&gt;believed to be a cure&lt;/a&gt;. Scholars at the time suggested that the potential for cure was due to these environments being more &lt;a href="https://digitalrepository.unm.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=&amp;amp;httpsredir=1&amp;amp;article=1017&amp;amp;context=unm_bulletin"&gt;invigorating for the body and providing more restful sleep&lt;/a&gt;. There is no evidence to support these beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Streptomycin was the first antibiotic treatment to become available for TB, in the 1940s. However, the microorganism quickly became drug resistant. A second antibiotic, called isoniazid, was developed as a first-line treatment &lt;a href="https://doi-ds.org/doilink/11.2021-98726273/JMVH"&gt;against TB in the 1950s&lt;/a&gt;. Again, the microorganism became drug resistant. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two- and four-drug combinations are now used to treat both latent infections and active disease. Treatment of active TB requires at least six months of uninterrupted therapy. Disruptions in treatment result in further spread of TB and the emergence of multidrug resistant TB, which requires additional drugs and more than &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/teams/global-tuberculosis-programme/tb-reports/global-tuberculosis-report-2024/tb-diagnosis-and-treatment"&gt;nine months of treatment&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All TB drugs are toxic; the quality of life for TB patients &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.5588/ijtld.22.0514"&gt;deteriorates during treatment&lt;/a&gt; and remains so throughout their lives. Finding cases and treating TB illness early, before symptoms begin, is important because it not only reduces the spread of disease but also greatly reduces drug toxicity. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What should people be aware of?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People should be aware that TB is still a public health problem across the globe. Education on the transmission, treatment and need for active work to eradicate TB is the best defense. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons why education and awareness about TB are so important is that a person with latent TB may be unknowingly harboring the microorganism for years. In the absence of symptoms, these people are unlikely to seek care and will &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S2213-2600(24)00028-6"&gt;not be diagnosed and treated&lt;/a&gt; unless identified as part of an outbreak, as was the case for more than half of the patients in Kansas.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

Researchers followed 11,745 adults over 14.5 years and found that those who used NSAIDs long-term had a 12% reduced dementia risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, short- and intermediate-term NSAID use did not provide the same benefit, nor was the total cumulative dose linked to risk reduction. These findings suggest that sustained anti-inflammatory effects may play a role in protecting against dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Long-Term NSAID Use:&lt;/strong&gt; Associated with a 12% lower risk of dementia.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Short-Term Use:&lt;/strong&gt; No significant protective effect was observed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anti-Inflammatory Role:&lt;/strong&gt; Findings support inflammation’s role in dementia progression.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Wiley&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Past research has suggested that inflammation may contribute to the development and progression of dementia and that non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) medications may help protect against dementia due to their anti-inflammatory effects. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108060"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/nsaids-dementia-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/nsaids-dementia-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/nsaids-dementia-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/nsaids-dementia-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/nsaids-dementia-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/nsaids-dementia-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/nsaids-dementia-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/nsaids-dementia-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain and pills." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/nsaids-dementia-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/nsaids-dementia-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/nsaids-dementia-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/nsaids-dementia-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/nsaids-dementia-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/nsaids-dementia-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/nsaids-dementia-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Long-term NSAID use was associated with a 12% reduced risk of developing dementia.

Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new large prospective study published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of the American Geriatrics Society&lt;/em&gt; provides additional evidence, showing that long-term NSAID use is linked to a decreased risk of developing dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the population-based study of 11,745 adults with an average follow-up of 14.5 years, 9,520 participants had used NSAIDs at any given time, and 2,091 participants developed dementia. Long-term NSAID use was associated with a 12% reduced risk of developing dementia. Short- and intermediate-term use did not provide benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, the cumulative dose of NSAIDs was not associated with decreased dementia risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings suggest that prolonged, rather than intensive, use of anti-inflammatory medications may help protect against dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our study provides evidence on possible preventive effects of anti-inflammatory medication against the dementia process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There is a need for more studies to further consolidate this evidence and possibly develop preventive strategies,” said corresponding author M. Arfan Ikram, MSc, MD, PhD, of Erasmus MC University Medical Center Rotterdam, in the Netherlands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this neuropharmacology and dementia research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#7c12190b0f0e1313113c0b15101905521f1311" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Sara Henning-Stout&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://wiley.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Wiley&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Sara Henning-Stout – Wiley&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;The findings will appear in &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Journal of the American Geriatrics Society&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Ashley Robinson, from Dacorum in Hertfordshire, initially contacted his family doctor last May after passing blood in his stools. Pictured with wife Jasmin &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;But the 35-year-old chef said he was repeatedly told it 'wasn't serious' and should pass 'in a week or so'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now, Mr Robinson is urging others not to be put off seeking help for potential signs of colon cancer, amid an explosion in cases of the disease in young people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Recalling how the initial signs of his cancer were dismissed he said: ' I thought it was stress related, because it had come on rapidly while we were getting stuff ready for the wedding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We were planning on a "princess wedding" but we were working very, very hard for it and I was working a minimum of 60 hours per week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It got really bad and I passed the most insane amount of blood so I phoned my GP and they told me to go to A&amp;amp;E straight away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'When I saw the doctor I mentioned to him that my great nan had died of colon cancer but he said there was no chance and that I was too young.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The wedding was so consuming and I was being told by every health professional that I definitely didn't have cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'They were saying "you're fine, don't worry, go and get married" so I took their word for it.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But, after experiencing rapid &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/weight_loss/index.html" id="mol-cbbd1ec0-fa88-11ef-a0ed-7d508a30f2b9" class=""&gt;weight loss&lt;/a&gt; following his wedding, Mr Robinson was still worried.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;It was only after he suddenly passed 'an insane' amount of blood a month later in June that he rushed to A&amp;amp;E&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Bowel cancer can cause you to have blood in your poo, a change in bowel habit, a lump inside your bowel which can cause an obstructions. Some people also suffer with weight loss a s a result of these symptoms&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He claims to have repeatedly tried to get another GP appointment for his symptoms but was unsuccessful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Instead, it was only after his wife Jasmin, 27, 'stormed in' to the surgery demanding he be seen that his GP relented and referred him for a colonoscopy.   &lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'That's when they found a tumour the size of an orange in my colon,' Mr Robinson said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I was dreading getting the results back. I was told I had stage four colon cancer, which had spread to my liver. It was the worst news possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It absolutely crushed my wife. Aside from it happening to her, it was the worst possible news I ever could have had.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He immediately started immunotherapy, a treatment where medics use drugs to help the body's immune system identify and attack cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mr Robinson said his medics were shocked when they found this had shrunk the tumour by 90 per cent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Even my oncologist was stunned, she was over the moon,' he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Scans revealed he had a tumour the size of an orange in his colon and he was diagnosed with stage four cancer — the most serious kind that means it's spread elsewhere in the body&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, he added: 'But if they'd found it in May then they might have been able to give me a treatment before it had spread to my liver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Looking back on his battle to get a diagnosis he said it was 'frustrating' to know more could have been done. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I was 34 at the time so I know when something's not right, you know your own body,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'When I rang the GP, I thought they would have made more of a thing of it but it just seemed like they didn't want to know.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A spokesperson for Hertfordshire and West Essex Integrated Care Board, who oversee NHS GP services in the area, said: 'People are often the best judge of what's "normal" for their bodies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'&lt;a target="_self" href="/news/nhs/index.html" id="mol-da6cf280-fa77-11ef-b956-698b44c9d439"&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt; advice is always to encourage anyone with worrying symptoms to seek advice and to ask again if they are still worried.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'If patients are concerned or unhappy about the care they receive from their GP practice, we encourage them to first of all contact their practice's patient services team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'If they feel that the practice hasn't resolved their concerns, they can then get in touch with the integrated care board's patient experience team who will discuss the options open to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ve heard of “mommy makeovers” — but now the menopause makeover is the latest trend shaking up the wellness industry.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dr. &lt;a href="https://www.drsmita.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Smita Ramanadham&lt;/a&gt; told The Post that her plastic surgery practice in New Jersey, once bustling with young women looking to bounce back after having children, is now seeing a fresh wave of middle-aged patients eager to address the aesthetic woes tied to “the change of life.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“My only regret is not doing it sooner so that I can enjoy it longer,” said Jennie Rodriquez, one of Ramanadham’s patients.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-block-columns is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-1 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Jennie Rodriquez after going under the knife. &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The menopause effect&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most women begin the menopausal transition between the ages of 45 and 55, a process that may last several years, a period known as perimenopause. You officially reach menopause when you haven’t had a period for 12 months.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Symptoms like hot flashes, night sweats and mood swings are typically associated with the transition, but menopause can also cause many bodily changes that affect your appearance.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ramanadham said one of the most common complaints she hears from patients is weight gain due to hormonal fluctuations that change how fat is distributed in the body, particularly in the midsection.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“A lot of patients say they haven’t really changed their lifestyles in terms of diet or exercise, but it’s harder for that weight to come off compared to what worked for them in the past,” she said. “That leaves them feeling sort of frustrated.” &lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;Ramanadham is also seeing more menopausal women seek out breast reductions after their busts grow larger during the transition, causing a wide range of problems. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“There’s back pain, but it also starts to interfere with their lifestyles, especially if they’re more active, like runners,” she said. “A lot of patients say they have to double up on sports bras or that they can’t find a bra that fits.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-pullquote"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; “I saved for an entire year to do this … I knew [it] was going to make me feel better and give me the confidence I needed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Jennie Rodriquez&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;





&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Jennie’s journey&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When a total hysterectomy sent Rodriquez into menopause at just 38, she immediately noticed a change in her weight distribution.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“For basically my whole life, I’ve been a smaller person,” she said. After having children, Rodriquez noted that she gained some weight, but a GLP-1 medication helped her shed 50 pounds in three months. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I got down to what was the perfect size for me,” she said. “Then I got the hysterectomy, and I gained all the weight back and couldn’t lose it again on my own. Even when I went back to the medication, it didn’t work like it had before.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Dr. Smita Ramanadham offers cosmetic surgeries and noninvasive treatments, like Botox. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Dr. Smita Ramanadham &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Suddenly, Rodriquez found herself out of breath doing normal activities, like going for a walk, and struggled to fit into her clothes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She was especially self-conscious about her stomach and knew she wanted a tummy tuck with liposuction to address her concerns — two procedures that Ramanadham said are staples of the menopause makeover.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To afford the procedure, Rodriquez had to take on a second job. “I saved for an entire year to do this,” she said. “But it was something that I knew was going to make me feel better and give me the confidence I needed.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-block-columns is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-2 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex"&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Jennie Rodriquez before a tummy tuck and liposuction. &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Jennie Rodriquez after undergoing the procedures. &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Reversing wrinkles,  under-eye bags,  saggy necks and droopy noses&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Menopause can also wreak havoc on your skin. “Collagen declines in our early 20s and 30s, but there’s more of that rapid decline in the perimenopausal period,” Ramanadham said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Studies show women can lose up to 30% of collagen in the first five years after menopause, causing a loss of skin elasticity and firmness.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We also lose water concentration, so our skin gets very dry as well,” Ramanadham noted. These changes often result in fine lines, wrinkles and sagging skin, particularly around the eyes and neck.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-pullquote"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suddenly, the nose that wasn’t droopy before becomes droopy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Dr. Smita Ramanadham&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For the eyes, a significant drop in estrogen during menopause weakens the muscles on the upper lids, creating a hooded effect that can make you look tired and older. The withdrawal of estrogen also causes eye puffiness, where fat under the eyes moves forward, forming bags.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ramanadham said surgical options like upper and lower eyelid lifts and brow lifts are common. For those wanting a less invasive approach, dermal fillers, Botox and platelet-rich plasma injections can promote collagen production, helping with under-eye bags, wrinkles and dark circles.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Menopause can cause a significant drop in collagen, leading to wrinkles and sagging skin. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Alessandro Grandini – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;





&lt;p&gt;As for the neck, a neck lift is the go-to solution for correcting sagging.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We remove the excess skin, address some of the underlying changes that happen, like with the muscles, and reposition the soft tissue and remaining skin,” Ramanadham said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For those wanting to avoid going under the knife, Botox, microneedling and radio frequency skin tightening can also help. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“None of these nonsurgical options are going to address the actual changes that occur structurally, but they can help soften the appearance,” Ramanadham said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The drop in estrogen can even cause noticeable sagging in the soft tissues of the nose.  “Suddenly, the nose that wasn’t droopy before becomes droopy,” Ramanadham said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-pullquote"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There was a lot of stigma around plastic surgery. Now I think we view it more as a part of overall wellness and improving our self-confidence.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Dr. Smita Ramanadham&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For this, a traditional rhinoplasty, or nose job, can correct the sagging snout. But if you want to avoid surgery, a liquid rhinoplasty using dermal fillers can smooth out bumps, add volume or correct asymmetry.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;When to consider surgical solutions&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The menopause transition typically lasts around seven years. While it’s a personal choice when to pursue cosmetic procedures, Ramanadham advises patients to wait until the changes in their body have stabilized.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“For example, if you’ve gained weight and you’re actively trying to lose it, we don’t want to operate on a moving target,” she said. “I always tell my patients to get to a stable, happy baseline weight that they can maintain long term first.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Still, if you’re unhappy with your appearance, starting a conversation with a board-certified plastic surgeon is a good place to begin. “They can tell you if you’re a good candidate and if surgery can provide the goals that you’re looking for.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Dr. Smita Ramanadham is a double board-certified plastic surgeon in New Jersey &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Dr. Smita Ramanadham&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Shifting perceptions &lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Every woman goes through “the change” — so why is the menopause makeover trending today?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ramanadham believes social media has played a large role in raising awareness about the cosmetic options available and reducing the stigma around them. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“In the past, there was still a lot of stigma around plastic surgery,” she said. “Now I think we view it more as a part of overall wellness and improving our self-confidence.” &lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/div&gt;

		
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;People are also living longer and want their outward appearance to reflect the youthful energy they feel on the inside. Ramanadham has patients in their 70s who, despite initial doubts, find that age isn’t necessarily a barrier to surgery.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;“We of course make sure all of your doctors are on board and you’re safe for surgery, but if you’re active and this will make you a better version of yourself, then let’s do it,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For Rodriquez, now 43, the decision to get cosmetic surgery was a personal one that she has no regrets about — even if it took two or three weeks post-op before she could climb the stairs to her bedroom.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We only have one life, and you should enjoy it to the fullest, ” she said. “Whether it’s something as major as surgery or as simple as Botox, anything that helps you feel better about yourself and stand a little taller at the end of the day is all that really matters.”&lt;/p&gt;

The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm4829a1.htm"&gt;most common causes&lt;/a&gt; were infectious diseases — pneumonia, diphtheria, dysentery, measles, and other illnesses ran rampant through households, and children were especially at risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Cities, in particular, were “cauldrons of infection,” Samuel Preston, a demographer and co-author of the book &lt;em&gt;Fatal Years: Child Mortality in Late Nineteenth-Century America&lt;/em&gt;, told me. But around the country, communicable diseases were “rites of passage of childhood, some of them far worse than others, but all of them causing serious morbidity, and a lot of them causing death,” said Howard Markel, a historian of medicine who has studied epidemics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Today, by contrast, less than 1 percent of children die before the age of 5, and &lt;a href="/health/402025/texas-measles-outbreak-cases-mmr-vaccination"&gt;until recently&lt;/a&gt;, once-common childhood diseases like measles were essentially unheard of in the US. What changed?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Better sanitation and understanding of germ theory are part of the story, but one key factor that’s transformed American childhood over the past century is the widespread adoption of vaccines. Today, children in the US are &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/imz-schedules/child-adolescent-age.html"&gt;routinely vaccinated&lt;/a&gt; against measles, mumps, rubella, diphtheria, polio, some types of pneumonia and meningitis, and more. Other vaccines, including for &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/current-vis/typhoid.html"&gt;typhoid&lt;/a&gt;, are in use around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;This public health victory has saved hundreds of millions of lives and prevented billions of cases of disease. On a list of “the 10 greatest hits of medicine,” Markel said, at least nine would be vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;That message has been getting lost lately, thanks to a &lt;a href="/policy-and-politics/2022/10/6/23389145/covid-19-anti-vaccine-legislation"&gt;rise&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="/technology/2023/9/16/23875579/facebook-meta-vaccine-covid-19-misinformation-study"&gt;anti-vaccine&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="/2023/6/22/23768539/rogan-rfk-hotez-debate-vaccine-deniers-better"&gt;sentiment&lt;/a&gt; around the US and the world, exemplified most recently by the &lt;a href="/politics/399801/w"&gt;confirmation of Robert F. Kennedy Jr&lt;/a&gt;. one of the country’s most prominent vaccine skeptics, as the secretary of Health and Human Services. Just weeks into Kennedy’s tenure, a &lt;a href="/health/401130/texas-new-mexico-measles-rfk-hhs-response"&gt;measles outbreak&lt;/a&gt; has sickened more than 100 people and killed an unvaccinated child in Texas, the first death from measles in the US in &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyderx4v8go"&gt;nearly a decade&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;In this time of &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7341a3.htm"&gt;falling vaccination rates&lt;/a&gt; and rising risks of preventable disease, I wanted to flash back to the long period of human history before vaccines were available. Childhood in the centuries before vaccination was marked by illness, yes, but also by grief and loss in a way that we tend to forget now that disease outbreaks are more of a rarity. Understanding that can teach us about the consequences, for families and society, of the choices we make today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="when-sickness-and-death-were-the-norm" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;When sickness and death were the norm&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;In the years before vaccines, the prevalence of illness meant untimely death touched nearly every family. “Most parents as late as 1900 could expect to lose at least one child to disease,” Steven Mintz, a history professor at UT Austin who has studied childhood, told me in an email. That meant most children could expect to lose at least one sibling — sometimes more, given the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm4847a1.htm"&gt;large families&lt;/a&gt; of the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;James Marten, a historian who has studied childhood, recalls a gravestone with three names on it in his family’s local cemetery: “They were my grandfather’s sisters and brothers that all died within a week or two of each other,” he told me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;There’s a misconception that larger family size and the near-inevitability of childhood disease made the loss of a child less devastating for those who survived. In fact, “parents suffered extraordinary grief” when children died, Mintz said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;After the death of her son Willie from typhoid fever in 1862, for example, &lt;a href="https://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/teachers/historyonline/usdeath1.cfm"&gt;Mary Todd Lincoln wrote&lt;/a&gt; in a letter, “My question to myself is, ‘can life be endured?’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Nor were children spared this grief. They might join in mourning — a &lt;a href="https://www.thefrickpittsburgh.org/Story-Memory-and-Mourning-Death-in-the-Gilded-Age#:~:text=The%20recommended%20length%20of%20time,the%20service%2C%20were%20also%20common."&gt;late-19th century photograph&lt;/a&gt; of heir Helen Frick as a young girl shows her wearing a locket containing a picture of her dead sister. They might also encounter constant reminders of their loss in the form of a new brother or sister with the deceased sibling’s name — a &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00277738.2018.1536186"&gt;common practice in a time of high infant mortality&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Though sickness struck people from all walks of life, poor children and children of color faced additional risks. New sanitation infrastructure like sewers, that limited the spread of disease, were installed in wealthy, white neighborhoods first, leaving poorer families vulnerable, said Nancy Tomes, a history professor at Stony Brook University who has studied the history of disease. &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/08/30/us/native-american-boarding-schools.html"&gt;Hundreds of thousands of Native American children&lt;/a&gt;, meanwhile, were sent to boarding schools, often by force, where poor sanitation led to &lt;a href="https://exhibits.library.gsu.edu/health-is-a-human-right/displacement/american-indian-boarding-schools/"&gt;frequent disease outbreaks&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/indian-boarding-schools-deaths-investigation-82645234fe9d7ce689e8375a51d7e161"&gt;a staggering number of deaths&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Death and serious illness are staples of literature for and about children in the 19th century, often inspired by real-life loss. The illness and death of Beth, from complications of scarlet fever contracted from a baby, in Louisa May Alcott’s &lt;em&gt;Little Women&lt;/em&gt; mirror Alcott’s own sister’s death in 1858, writes &lt;a href="https://magazine.hms.harvard.edu/articles/fever-dreams"&gt;pediatrician Perri Klass&lt;/a&gt;. Laura Ingalls Wilder’s older sister Mary went blind in 1879 (when Laura was 12 and Mary was 14), likely from meningoencephalitis, an episode that shows up in Wilder’s book &lt;em&gt;By the Shores of Silver Lake&lt;/em&gt;: “the fever had settled in Mary’s eyes, and Mary was blind.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;While many infectious diseases disproportionately affected children, adults died too, and in the 19th century, as many as half of all children could expect to lose a parent by the age of 21, Mintz said. “The psychological toll was enormous.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;There was also an economic and practical toll. Widowed mothers and their children, unable to support themselves, often had to enter almshouses or poorhouses in the 19th century, Tomes said. If a mother died, the father might send the children to live with relatives, or to an orphanage, which were “packed in this time,” Tomes said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;For those who got sick, meanwhile, the experience of disease itself could be painful and terrifying. Diphtheria, for example, causes a thick membrane to form at the back of the throat, making it very difficult to breathe. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The disease was called “the strangling angel,” Mintz said. If children made it through the first phase, they might die six weeks later of heart failure, Markel said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Even the survivors of infectious diseases could face lifelong effects. Polio, for example, could lead to paralysis, and some children spent weeks, months, or even years &lt;a href="https://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/objects-and-stories/medicine/iron-lung"&gt;encased in an iron lung&lt;/a&gt; to help them breathe. (One of the last users of an iron lung, Paul Alexander, &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/03/13/1238251518/iron-lung-polio-paul-alexander"&gt;died last year&lt;/a&gt; after over 70 years with the device.) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Devastating though they could be, endemic diseases like measles became expected in the years before widespread vaccination: “it was a fact of childhood life that you were going to get sick with one of these,” Markel said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Polio, which arrived in the US &lt;a href="https://historyofvaccines.org/history/polio/timeline"&gt;in the late 19th century&lt;/a&gt; and led to more isolated, unpredictable outbreaks, caused more fear, Markel said. Parents kept children out of school, swimming pools, and movie theaters. “It very much shapes your daily life and what you do entirely once people learn about these things,” Merle Eisenberg, a history professor at Oklahoma State University who studies pandemics, told me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The polio vaccine, &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/spotlight/history-of-vaccination/history-of-polio-vaccination"&gt;introduced in 1955&lt;/a&gt;, put an end to those fears. Today, it’s one of a series of vaccinations that, together, allow most children in wealthy countries to grow up free from the infectious diseases that sickened and killed so many of their forebears. “We take it for granted the opportunities and the possibilities that children now have,” Eisenberg said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;These diseases aren’t gone, however. In higher-poverty countries where vaccine distribution is more of a challenge, preventable diseases still claim children’s lives, Rashida Ferrand, an epidemiologist at the London School of Hygiene and Tropic Medicine, told me.

The experiment involved mice born to live fast and die young, bred with a rodent version of progeria, a condition that causes premature aging. Left alone, the animals grow gray and frail and then die about seven months later, compared to a lifespan of about two years for typical lab mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="GRFZJJCM6ZB3DFJ2CKHJZOBMYI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But the Salk scientists had a plan to change the aging animals’ fate. They injected them with a virus carrying four genes that can reshape DNA and, in effect, make every cell in the rodents’ bodies young again. The scientists could even control the genes from outside the mice, turning them on and off to manage the safety and potency of the genetic changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="K7BQEM6OFJA63IWBLGWABETVM4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The experiment worked: The animals lived 30 percent longer afterward, a marked improvement, if not quite a normal mouse lifespan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="LXADPNXNC5EYFM74XT2YR7HODE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;And, with that, the longevity gold rush entered a new era. Tech titans and venture capitalists started throwing billions of dollars at labs exploring the technique, called cellular reprogramming. Experiments began on other mice, as well as worms and monkeys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body grid-body grid-center" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="57WCQ4FOYRFNLBO7GFBBAL53HI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Cellular reprogramming is now hailed by its supporters as&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;the most promising scientific approach to improving human healthspans and lifespans. Proponents claim it has the potential to reshape how — and whether — we grow old. And later this year,&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;a biotech company called Life Biosciences expects to file an application with the Food and Drug Administration to get approval for the first human trial of a version of the technique, according to Sharon Rosenzweig-Lipson, the company’s chief scientific officer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="B7L6IMPREVFGDI4XMF2THF3V7I" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But there have been serious side effects during some of the animal experiments,&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;including gruesome tumors and even deaths. Some researchers worry the science is moving too fast, and basic questions about cellular reprogramming’s safety and effects for people and society still need to be addressed. What are the long-term health consequences? Who will benefit most: wealthy donors or anyone who’s aging or chronically ill? How much will it cost? And how far are humans willing to go for the possibility of more life?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="JDN5CA44ZVF3NCV5AQCPBW54FQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“Honestly,” said Lucy Xu, a postdoctoral research fellow at Harvard Medical School who’s studied reprogramming in mice, “those questions keep me awake at night.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wpds-c-iLVUUd wpds-c-iLVUUd-heMhiJ-isCenteredLayout-true" data-qa="article-header" data-contentid="PJKIQTOE6RE7PCZDATLLHLIJKU" data-apitype="header" level="2" id="PJKIQTOE6RE7PCZDATLLHLIJKU"&gt;Reversing aging in our cells&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="E6CTY6R3ZVBJRDBWTAYCLSVFJI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;If you’ve never heard of cellular reprogramming, you’re hardly alone. A relatively new field, it began with the jaw-dropping 2006 revelation that just four genes could return even the oldest, most decrepit cell to a state resembling youth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="M7OP5JB46BDNFGKTKZYIOHYCOU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Those genes and their effects were discovered by the Japanese scientist, Shinya Yamanaka, who won the &lt;a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/2012/yamanaka/facts/" target="_blank"&gt;Nobel Prize&lt;/a&gt; in 2012 for his work and had the genes named after him.

If you’ve ever wondered how the cells in your heart know to be heart cells and not skin, bowel or some other cells, you can thank your epigenome. It’s what gives every cell its identity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="D76UMGCTLZHSDEZE42RILGR35Q" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Our DNA starts out alike in almost every cell. But almost immediately, tiny clumps of molecules known as methyl groups start attaching themselves like mollusks to the outside of various genes, with different configurations in different cells. Depending on the number and patterns of these molecules, the genes beneath will be able to receive biochemical signals telling them to turn on, or they won’t.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="3CW3KDYEC5DNTK5NVVD4OGJKOM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;This process, called methylation, is probably the most important part of our epigenome. Methylation continues throughout our lives and reflects those lives, for better and worse. Smoking strongly influences methylation patterns. So does exercise, although in almost opposite fashion. Ditto for stress, nutrition, parenting, illness, air pollution and many other choices and conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="LWGSR5AE6JGQLNHCHEBKWCKHKU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Through methylation, our epigenome functions, in effect, as our bodies’ diary, with the tiny molecular doodles on our DNA recording what we’ve been doing with ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="IOXBKLEO5FE4HGWAK2SQ3W6CZM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But nothing affects methylation as much as aging. The patterns of methylation during infancy are distinctly different than during childhood, adulthood and old age. Many longevity researchers believe these changes in methylation don’t just record our aging process, they drive it, meaning our evolving epigenome may be responsible for aging itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h3 class="wpds-c-iLVUUd wpds-c-iLVUUd-heMhiJ-isCenteredLayout-true" data-qa="article-header" data-contentid="6NMF72GWBJGXFJ4NPYHTN56L5Q" data-apitype="header" level="2" id="6NMF72GWBJGXFJ4NPYHTN56L5Q"&gt;Rapidly growing monster tumors&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="I7ZOWOB6QFCJ7N3SDEYLISNAPQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In petri dishes, cellular reprogramming works just as expected. Add the Yamanaka factors to skin cells from a wrinkled centenarian — &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22056670/" target="_blank"&gt;as scientists have done&lt;/a&gt; — and many of the cells will shed their methyl marks and turn back into newborn cells, or what scientists call pluripotent stem cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="XYPTMB434BBXNBZCC5OHMZ7R2A" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;With no cellular memory of having been skin, these cells can become almost any type of cell, with the right coaxing. Pluripotent stem cells from donated human cells are routinely used today for tissue engineering and other medical and research purposes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="EFI3X4XR7JEBPBFN6HQKEJ2ZL4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But the process isn’t efficient or benign. In a dish containing millions of elderly cells, many will become youthful stem cells after exposure to Yamanaka factors. But many others won’t, for reasons that remain mysterious. Some resist the process. Some die. And some, almost invariably, transform into huge, rapidly dividing growths known as teratomas or monster tumors. These develop when a stem cell doesn’t know what to become and turns into the wrong kind of cell. With a teratoma, teeth cells can wind up growing in a pelvis or bone cells in an eyeball. Although rarely malignant, teratomas often swell to massive sizes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body grid-body grid-center" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="2JNOMZ7NGRDHTFIGQSW2VOGGWY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Researchers can eliminate teratomas in petri dishes easily enough. But in living creatures, the growths create real-life horror films. When Spanish researchers activated Yamanaka factors in healthy mice for an &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature12586" target="_blank"&gt;early cellular reprogramming experiment&lt;/a&gt;, many of the animals died within weeks, sprouting teratomas and other cancerous tumors all over their bodies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="MCSWM4ZBKNDMRCFP6V645GNL5M" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“You’ll always have teratomas” during cellular reprogramming, said Paul Knoepfler, a professor at the University of California at Davis, who studies epigenetics, stem cells and cancer. “It’s part of the process.

In April 2023, the company &lt;a href="https://www.lifebiosciences.com/life-biosciences-presents-groundbreaking-data-at-arvo-demonstrating-restoration-of-visual-function-in-nonhuman-primates/" target="_blank"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; at an ophthalmology conference that they had successfully used this version of partial cellular reprogramming in the eyes of monkeys with a type of optic nerve strokes. The company said the experiment restored aspects of the monkeys’ lost vision and altered some of the nerve cells’ epigenomes — meaning the cells resembled those of younger animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="Y7PWFX3GDRB5DCHPTMIEHZASQU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;It was the first time partial reprogramming had been attempted in primates.

Optic nerve strokes are relatively uncommon in people, typically affecting about 6,000 adults a year, but can be debilitating. The loss of vision in the affected eye is sudden, often total and usually irreversible, although some eyes improve on their own. There is no treatment. (In a statement to The Post, the FDA declined to comment on any interactions with Life Biosciences.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="JW6FUZ2TARG77F63PVZVTRNYPY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;If the FDA approves its application, the company will repeat the methods from the mouse and monkey experiments, Rosenzweig-Lipson said. Scientists will inject volunteers’ eyes with Yamanaka factors that can be turned off or on with the antibiotic doxycycline, Rosenzweig-Lipson said. The hope is that the cells in people’s damaged optic nerves will grow more youthful at an epigenetic level, and their vision will improve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="CVSSMME3KVD4TNGKHU4XYCY724" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The company thinks its partial reprogramming won’t result in tumors, since its protocol omits the most carcinogenic of the Yamanaka factors, Rosenzweig-Lipson said.

And in the adult animals, their kidneys and skin were biologically “younger,” according to tests of their epigenomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="QX5H2XBD6RFRLK33C2N3XTRHAU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;None of the animals lived longer than normal, which was the main point of the experiment.

(A company spokesperson for Altos&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;declined to comment about the current status of its research or the possibility of human experiments in the future.) They’ll focus on specific diseases related to aging, such as diabetes, arthritis, optic nerve stroke, glaucoma, dementia and others, not aging itself, since aging isn’t a disease, according to the FDA, and drugs and other therapies can’t be approved to treat it, although once approved, &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/03/15/rapamycin-longevity-drug/" target="_blank"&gt;drugs&lt;/a&gt; can be used off-label.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="K3WMXOYP6VEJJPF7XHTAFI3AB4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;It’s unclear, though, whether treating damaged eyes or sore knees will satisfy wealthy funders who’ve been pouring billions into the hunt for longer lifespans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="G7SZWUSWNRD5FHHXTENR7M72T4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;At the same time, some researchers worry safety concerns remain insurmountable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="GGKGUJQVLVA5TOKGBDH22VDTWM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“I don’t believe there can be reprogramming,” even partial reprogramming, in living people without serious side effects, said Charles Brenner, a diabetes and cancer researcher at City of Hope research center in Duarte, California, and frequent critic of reprogramming studies. “Reprogrammed cells divide rapidly.

                    &lt;p&gt;People put a lot of thought into getting a tattoo – the design they desire, the location they prefer and the message their body art will send to others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most don’t think about the impact their tattoo might have on their long-term health, but perhaps they should, a new study suggests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tattoos appear to increase a person’s risk of skin cancer between 33% and 62%, according to a new Danish study in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12889-025-21413-3"&gt;BMC Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Results also indicate there's increased cancer risk from larger tattoos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tattoos larger than the palm of a hand more than double a person’s risk of skin cancer and nearly triple their risk of &lt;a href="https://www.healthday.com/a-to-z-health/cancer/lymphoma-know-your-treatment-options"&gt;lymphoma&lt;/a&gt;, or cancer of the lymph nodes, researchers found.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When tattoo ink is injected into the skin, ink particles can migrate to and accumulate inside the lymph nodes, researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We can see that ink particles accumulate in the lymph nodes, and we suspect that the body perceives them as foreign substances,” researcher &lt;a href="https://portal.findresearcher.sdu.dk/en/persons/hfrederiksen"&gt;Henrik Frederiksen&lt;/a&gt;, a clinical professor at the University of Southern Denmark, said in a news release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This may mean that the immune system is constantly trying to respond to the ink, and we do not yet know whether this persistent strain could weaken the function of the lymph nodes or have other health consequences,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About 32% of Americans have a tattoo, and 22% have more than one, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/08/15/32-of-americans-have-a-tattoo-including-22-who-have-more-than-one/"&gt;2023 poll&lt;/a&gt; conducted by the Pew Research Center.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this study, researchers analyzed data from an ongoing study of Danish twins. They compared nearly 2,400 randomly selected twins born between 1960 and 1996, as well as 316 twins where one twin had been diagnosed with cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The unique aspect of our approach is that we can compare twin pairs where one has cancer, but they otherwise share many genetic and environmental factors,” senior researcher &lt;a href="https://portal.findresearcher.sdu.dk/en/persons/jacob-hjelmborg"&gt;Jacob von Bornemann Hjelmborg&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of biostatistics at the University of Southern Denmark, said in a news release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By comparing tattoo patterns alongside cancer diagnoses, researchers found that people with tattoos have a higher occurrence of both skin cancer and lymphoma.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The analysis showed that tattoos larger than the palm of a hand increased skin cancer risk by nearly 2.4-fold, and lymphoma by 2.8-fold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This rate accounts for a person’s age, when they got their tattoo, and how long they’d been followed in the study.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This suggests that the bigger the tattoo and the longer it has been there, the more ink accumulates in the lymph nodes,” lead researcher &lt;a href="https://portal.findresearcher.sdu.dk/en/persons/sbclemmensen"&gt;Signe Bedsted Clemmensen&lt;/a&gt;, an assistant professor of biostatistics at the University of Southern Denmark, said in a news release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Previous research has suggested that certain pigments in tattoo ink might be less healthy than others, but this study found no clear link between cancer and specific ink colors, researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We know from other studies that ink can contain potentially harmful substances, and for example, red ink more often causes allergic reactions. This is an area we would like to explore further,” Clemmensen said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Researchers next plan to focus on how ink particles affect the lymph nodes, and whether certain types of lymphoma have a stronger link to tattoos than others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We want to gain a better understanding of the biological mechanisms — what happens in the lymph nodes when they are exposed to ink particles over decades? This can help us assess whether there is a real health risk and what we might do to reduce it,” Clemmensen concluded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Advancements in &lt;strong&gt;3D bioprinting&lt;/strong&gt; have taken a bold new step: a team of researchers from &lt;strong&gt;China, Japan, and the United States&lt;/strong&gt; has successfully &lt;strong&gt;3D-printed&lt;/strong&gt; a fully functional &lt;strong&gt;penis&lt;/strong&gt; and implanted it into &lt;strong&gt;rabbits and pigs&lt;/strong&gt;, with promising results. This cutting-edge breakthrough in regenerative medicine could transform treatments for penile malformations, erectile dysfunction, and other sexual disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-2"&gt;

    
    &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="1096651400" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
    
    
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Engineering a Functional Organ with 3D Bioprinting&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research was led by scientists at the &lt;strong&gt;South China University of Technology&lt;/strong&gt; in Guangzhou, China. The study represents a collaborative effort between international researchers working in bioengineering, regenerative medicine, and tissue printing. This advancement builds on decades of research into the bio-printing of soft tissues for functional organ regeneration.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;3D printing in medicine has already enabled the creation of customized prosthetics and the &lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/01/human-body-replace-itself-every-7-years/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="77687" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;repair of human tissues&lt;/a&gt;. However, replicating an entire, complex organ like the penis marks a scientific milestone. The research team used an &lt;strong&gt;advanced bioprinting technique&lt;/strong&gt; to construct a penile model using hydrogel, a material that mimics human tissue and supports cell growth and function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;The printed model contained key components of a real penis, including the corpora cavernosa, corpus spongiosum, and tunica albuginea, all crucial for achieving erection and sexual function. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;tunica albuginea&lt;/strong&gt;, in particular, plays a vital role in sustaining an erection, and the scientists successfully engineered a synthetic version of this tissue called &lt;strong&gt;artificial tunica albuginea (ATA)&lt;/strong&gt;, composed of polyvinyl alcohol, which mimics the natural tissue’s elasticity and structure.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Overcoming the Biggest Challenge: Blood Flow&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The major hurdle in printing a &lt;strong&gt;functional penis&lt;/strong&gt; was recreating its vascular system, which enables rapid blood inflow and erection. Without proper blood circulation, the implant would be useless. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;To solve this, the scientists incorporated endothelial cells, the cells lining blood vessels, to form a network of functional blood vessels.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This vascularized tissue allowed the implant to receive adequate blood supply, leading to a functional erection. According to the study, “the erection of the penis returned to normal after suturing the ATA at the injured part, and the long-term prognosis was satisfactory.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This suggests that synthetic tissue can effectively &lt;strong&gt;replace natural penile function&lt;/strong&gt; and could be applied to human treatments in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Successful Animal Trials: Erections and Reproduction&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To test their innovation, the researchers implanted the 3D-printed penile structures into B&lt;strong&gt;ama miniature pigs&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;rabbits&lt;/strong&gt; suffering from penile malformations. The results showed that the animals not only regained erectile function but were observed &lt;strong&gt;mating&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;reproducing&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This success suggests that bio-printed organs could soon offer real solutions for human patients. Specifically, this technology could help treat conditions such as Peyronie’s disease, which affects five percent of men between &lt;strong&gt;40 and 70&lt;/strong&gt; and leads to painful, curved erections due to scar tissue buildup.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;3D Bioprinting: A Booming Frontier in Medicine&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The field of 3D bioprinting is advancing rapidly, with emerging technologies like &lt;strong&gt;xolography&lt;/strong&gt;, a light-based 3D printing method that enables the fabrication of living cellular structures. Scientists are now exploring ways to print entire organs such as kidneys, muscles, and blood vessels, potentially transforming transplant medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;The artificial tunica albuginea also holds broader medical potential, as its biomimetic design could be adapted to repair other load-bearing tissues, including blood vessels, intestines, corneas, bladders, tendons, and myocardium (heart tissue).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The Future of Bioengineered Sexual Health&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This breakthrough in 3D printing opens doors to a future where personalized, bioengineered implants could restore lost or impaired functions in millions of patients. But with such advancements come ethical and regulatory challenges, as well as the need for more research to guarantee safety and effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study, published in &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41551-025-01367-y" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Nature Biomedical Engineering&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, signals that the future of regenerative medicine is closer than ever. If human trials prove successful, &lt;strong&gt;3D-printed organs&lt;/strong&gt; could soon redefine the way we treat congenital disorders, traumatic injuries, and sexual dysfunctions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;For now, the success in rabbits and pigs is a thrilling glimpse into what could become a medical revolution.&lt;/p&gt;

A recent study published in &lt;em&gt;The Journal of Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt; provides answers, revealing that repeated exposure to emotional events leads to the formation of exceptionally stable memory patterns in the brain. This process, initiated by the amygdala during the first encounter with the event, explains why emotional memories can be so powerful and long-lasting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emotional events tend to stick in our minds more vividly than everyday occurrences. This is generally a helpful ability, allowing us to learn from experiences that carry emotional weight. However, this strong emotional memory system can sometimes become problematic, particularly in conditions like posttraumatic stress disorder, where intrusive and distressing memories can be a hallmark of the disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While scientists have learned a great deal about how we remember emotional events that happen just once, much less is understood about how our brains process and remember emotional events that we experience repeatedly. This is a significant gap in our knowledge because, in real life, many emotional experiences, whether positive or negative, tend to recur. To address this, researchers aimed to explore the brain mechanisms responsible for remembering repeated emotional events. They were particularly interested in testing two competing ideas about how repetition strengthens memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One idea suggests that each time we experience an event, it is encoded slightly differently in the brain due to changes in context or other factors, creating multiple pathways to access the memory. The other idea proposes that repetition reinforces the original memory trace, making it stronger each time it is reactivated. Previous studies focusing on neutral, non-emotional events have leaned towards the reinforcement idea, but it was unknown if this principle also applied to emotional memories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Most research so far examined memory for emotional events that were encountered just once and the brain mechanisms associated with the repeated exposure to the same emotional events were largely unknown,” explained study author &lt;a href="https://www.psy.uni-hamburg.de/en/arbeitsbereiche/kognitionspsychologie/personen/schwabe-lars.html"&gt;Lars Schwabe&lt;/a&gt;, the Head of Cognitive Psychology at the University of Hamburg. “We wanted to investigate whether the repeated exposure to an emotional event is linked to more robust/similar neural representations or to more variable/specific representations and which mechanisms would drive the robust vs. variable representations.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To conduct their investigation, the research team recruited 103 healthy adults. These volunteers underwent brain scanning using magnetic resonance imaging while participating in a memory task. During the scan, participants viewed a series of images across three consecutive sessions. In each session, they were shown the exact same set of 30 emotionally negative images and 30 emotionally neutral images. The images, depicting a range of scenes, were selected from established image databases and online sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers made sure that the negative and neutral images were comparable in terms of visual complexity and whether they featured people or animals. Within each session, the images were presented in a random order. Each image was displayed for three seconds, followed by a brief pause. Participants were instructed to pay close attention and try to memorize the images, as they were informed that their memory would be tested shortly after.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To ensure participants remained focused during the task, they were asked to press a button each time a fixation cross appeared on the screen. Immediately after the brain scanning session, participants completed a memory test outside of the scanner. They were given 15 minutes to verbally recall as many of the images as possible, describing them in detail. These verbal accounts were audio-recorded and subsequently evaluated by three independent raters who judged whether each recalled image was clearly identifiable from the participant’s description. The raters showed a very high level of agreement in their evaluations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To validate that the images truly differed in emotional content, the participants, on a separate day, rated each image for how negative or positive and how emotionally arousing they found it. As expected, the negative images were rated as significantly more negative and emotionally arousing than the neutral images. The brain scan data collected during the image viewing task was then analyzed to examine both the overall level of brain activity and the patterns of activity in different brain regions known to be involved in emotion and memory, such as the amygdala, the hippocampus, and the neocortex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results of the study confirmed that participants remembered significantly more of the emotionally negative images compared to the neutral images, demonstrating the well-known emotional memory advantage. Analysis of the brain scans revealed that the amygdala and the anterior hippocampus showed greater activity when participants initially viewed negative images that they later remembered, compared to neutral images.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, this heightened activity in these emotional memory regions for negative images diminished with repeated viewings. In contrast, for neutral images, activity in these areas remained relatively stable across repetitions. When examining the neocortex, the outer layer of the brain, researchers observed a distinct pattern. Brain regions in the front of the neocortex, including the inferior frontal gyrus and anterior temporal cortex, displayed an initial surge in activity for emotional memories, mirroring the amygdala and anterior hippocampus. This activity also decreased as the images were repeated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conversely, brain regions located in the back of the neocortex, such as the posterior temporal and parietal cortices, exhibited increasing activity over repetitions for neutral memories, but to a lesser extent for emotional memories. Beyond overall activity levels, the researchers investigated the stability of brain activity patterns. They discovered that for negative images that were successfully remembered, the patterns of brain activity in specific neocortical regions became more consistent across repetitions. These regions included parts of the prefrontal cortex, posterior parietal cortex, and posterior superior temporal sulcus. This indicates that the brain was essentially reinstating a similar pattern of activity each time a negative image was presented.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further analysis indicated that this pattern stability in prefrontal cortex, superior parietal lobule, and posterior superior temporal sulcus was specifically linked to remembering individual emotional images, rather than just emotional images in general.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, the researchers found that the initial activity of the amygdala when participants first saw a negative image played a key role in this process. A stronger initial amygdala response was associated with more stable brain activity patterns in the superior parietal lobule over repetitions, which in turn contributed to improved memory for those emotional images. This suggests that the amygdala’s initial emotional reaction triggers a mechanism that strengthens memory by enhancing the consistency of brain representations over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The repeated exposure to emotional, compared to emotionally neutral, events leads to more robust and stable neocortical representations and this increase in pattern robustness is driven by the initial response of the brain’s major emotional processing center, the amygdala,” Schwabe told PsyPost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2406-23.2025" target="_blank"&gt;Memory boost for recurring emotional events is driven by initial amygdala response promoting stable neocortical patterns across repetitions&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Valentina Krenz, Arjen Alink, Benno Roozendaal, Tobias Sommer, and Lars Schwabe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Thu, 06 Mar 2025 11:12:24 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMioAFBVV95cUxPZGJXempOWmRmUFlNcmNJTEI3Ti0yNkVqYjcwTHVXUTdaQVdJY3NBSmhEa2QxQk9BRHExRjE0cThQRVlVUFo2RXJYQlZYQ1BDVTNpS05uZFZRQndvNU1KekoyVUlPWlBPLTM3V0pETzBfTmJhbzdMdjBlNVMtU3lIczlURVlrOVNiVG92Zkl3ZFlHbGw4dkR2eFE5ZTM1Mlg3</guid></item><item><title>How to slow aging, boost longevity: 4 takeaways from recent research - Medical News Today</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipAFBVV95cUxOR0U2V0tjYXMwSjNNUTlMa2VyZVJ4ZU1KamcyYk53MlRVRlMzTkprTXJZZ2U1X0UtOEFIdkJSSzF1SE1TV19tY05fQ213SWQxcUQxRTBDWk8zcjg0dlhtV2RYLVZxNUZwRWtXcmgwb3g1bHJhVm9tRkJnUWhtUS1la25NUnJrbE1UNDlrZkNOWFpDV2JGWDV4TFpLU251djZ2M2lhbw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-12va8w7"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;figure class="css-yhe8zq"&gt;&lt;span class="css-rwmw5v"&gt;&lt;span class="css-mjp0j9"&gt;&lt;picture class="css-16pk1is"&gt;&lt;source srcset="https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/03/news-roundup-20240217-1296x728-header-1024x575.jpg 750w" media="(min-width: 1190px)"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source srcset="https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/03/news-roundup-20240217-1296x728-header-1024x575.jpg 750w" media="(min-width: 990px)"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source srcset="https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/03/news-roundup-20240217-1296x728-header-1024x575.jpg 879w" media="(min-width: 768px)"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img src="https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/03/news-roundup-20240217-1296x728-header-1024x575.jpg" alt="illustration of three smartphone screens showing recent coverage from MNT" class="css-1jytyml"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;hl-share-overlay class="css-1mqo1cs"&gt;&lt;a class="css-90fpmc icon-hl-pinterest css-by55vd" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" data-event="Any Page|Image Pinterest Click|Icon Clicked" data-element-event="OPEN|CONTENTBLOCK|Any Page|Article Body|BUTTON|Image Widget Pinterest Click|" href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.medicalnewstoday.com%2Farticles%2Fdo-diet-and-exercise-hold-the-keys-to-longer-healthier-lives&amp;amp;media=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.post.rvohealth.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F3%2F2025%2F03%2Fnews-roundup-20240217-1296x728-header-1024x575.jpg&amp;amp;description=How%20to%20slow%20aging%2C%20boost%20longevity%3A%204%20takeaways%20from%20recent%20research" title="Share on Pinterest" data-pin-custom="true" data-share-url="https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/03/news-roundup-20240217-1296x728-header-1024x575.jpg"&gt;&lt;span class="css-z1zfa"&gt;Share on Pinterest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-share-overlay&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;figcaption class="css-13b3g0x"&gt;What does the latest research have to say about the impact of diet and exercise on aging and longevity?

adds to the evidence regarding the importance of diet to aging processes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research, which was conducted by a team of researchers from institutions in Finland and Switzerland, found that young adults who followed diets high in processed foods and sugary beverages — including processed red meat and soda — and low in fruit and veg content appeared to experience &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/unhealthy-diet-may-speed-up-biological-aging-even-young-adults" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;faster biological aging&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study involved 826 adults aged 21–25, and it looked at their dietary patterns, as well as the individuals’ rates of &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3174260/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;DNA methylation&lt;/a&gt; — a process linked with aging at cellular level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In brief, the findings suggested that “diets emphasizing higher consumption of fruits and vegetables and lower intakes of meat, fast food, and sugar-sweetened beverages were associated with slower biological aging.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;While this link may not come as a surprise, it further stresses the importance of our dietary choices — even early in life — when it comes to preserving our health and youth for longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.jyu.fi/en/people/suvi-ravi" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Suvi Ravi, PhD&lt;/a&gt;, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Jyväskylä in Finland, and one of the study authors, also noted that the findings were not unexpected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ravi also hypothesized that switching to healthier foods might help reverse some of the biological aging to which diets high in processed ingredients contribute.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There is also evidence to support my thoughts,” she pointed out, noting that “some &lt;hl-trusted-source source="Wiley" rationale="Peer reviewed journal"&gt;&lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/acel.13439" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;interventional studies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-trusted-source&gt;

from any cause&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; in older adults.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;That may be because exercise can boost strength and thus reduce frailty and the risk of incidents such as falls as we age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking to &lt;em&gt;MNT&lt;/em&gt; about the conclusions outlined in this review, &lt;a href="https://www.pacificneuroscienceinstitute.org/people/ryan-glatt/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Ryan Glatt, MS, CPT, NBC-HWC&lt;/a&gt;, senior brain health coach and director of the FitBrain Program at Pacific Neuroscience Institute in Santa Monica, CA, who was not involved in this analysis, pointed out that:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Exercise provides systemic benefits, including a reduction in all-cause mortality, fall prevention, and cognitive and mental health improvements.

Those who took omega-3 and vitamin D supplements regularly over three years appeared to have a slower rate of biological aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants who both took these supplements and undertook regular exercise saw an even greater benefit. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;First author &lt;a href="https://www.dynage.uzh.ch/en/team/directors/hbischoff.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Heike A.

Could supplementing NAD precursors halt this process, what is the optimal dose for different age groups and health conditions?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, she noted, while they may not completely reverse NAD depletion, supplements could help mitigate its impact on aging processes:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Strategies [to counteract NAD depletion] may include consuming foods rich in NAD+ precursors like dairy products, &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/323661" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;fish&lt;/a&gt;, poultry, [and] &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/green-leafy-vegetables" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;green vegetables&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parulekar also emphasized the importance of physical activity, noting that “daily exercise can also help stimulate mitochondrial biogenesis and increase energy demand.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In summary, this and other recent studies only add to the existing proof that lifestyle choices have a profound impact on both life span and health span.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Medical News Today</author><pubDate>Thu, 06 Mar 2025 11:08:51 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipAFBVV95cUxOR0U2V0tjYXMwSjNNUTlMa2VyZVJ4ZU1KamcyYk53MlRVRlMzTkprTXJZZ2U1X0UtOEFIdkJSSzF1SE1TV19tY05fQ213SWQxcUQxRTBDWk8zcjg0dlhtV2RYLVZxNUZwRWtXcmgwb3g1bHJhVm9tRkJnUWhtUS1la25NUnJrbE1UNDlrZkNOWFpDV2JGWDV4TFpLU251djZ2M2lhbw</guid></item><item><title>Tinnitus Seems to Be Somehow Connected to a Crucial Bodily Function - ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinAFBVV95cUxOWDJmcWJqWnlzU3lGbTg3aGowYTFfa0Y1ZmZPVzc5aGdrcUg0YkNqTjkwcFRrblN5S1NTSG04b1ZybU1hOEFEYjljdklvRVh4VVZjemZTLXdSUmViVWFNY3hLZXNvSTd4akVxdnFGT1VUb3JuV1dpQjhyMjV6Z2ZDLVBwLS1sOTJkajRFMGlhXzNkU3JvR2M5djFtMnk?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Around &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(13)60142-7/fulltext"&gt;15 percent of the world's population&lt;/a&gt; suffers from tinnitus, a condition which causes someone to hear a sound (such as ringing or buzzing) without any external source. It's often associated with &lt;a href="https://rnid.org.uk/information-and-support/tinnitus/tinnitus-causes/"&gt;hearing loss&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only can the condition be annoying for sufferers, it can also have a serious effect on mental health, often causing &lt;a href="https://www.tinnitus.org.uk/tinnitus-and-stress"&gt;stress&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30909841/"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;. This is especially the case for patients suffering from tinnitus over months or years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's currently &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00802/full"&gt;no cure for tinnitus&lt;/a&gt;. So finding a way to better manage or treat it could help many millions of people worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And one area of research that may help us better understand tinnitus is sleep. There are many reasons for this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, tinnitus is a phantom percept. This is when our brain activity makes us see, hear or smell things that aren't there. Most people only experience phantom perceptions &lt;a href="https://www.sleepfoundation.org/dreams"&gt;when they're asleep&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But for people with tinnitus, they hear phantom sounds while they're awake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 youtube-iframe relative"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kgIrfiyK4x8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second reason is because tinnitus &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26373470/"&gt;alters brain activity&lt;/a&gt;, with certain areas of the brain (such as those involved in hearing) potentially being more active than they should be. This may also explain how phantom percepts happen. When we sleep, activity in these same brain areas also changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/braincomms/article/4/3/fcac089/6563428?login=false"&gt;recent research review&lt;/a&gt; has identified a couple of brain mechanisms that underlie both tinnitus and sleep. Better understanding these mechanisms – and the way the two are connected – could one day help us find ways of managing and treating tinnitus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_105568" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-105568" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/09/WomanAsleepOnBed-642x260.jpg" alt="Woman Asleep On Bed" class="wp-image-105568 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/09/WomanAsleepOnBed-642x260.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/09/WomanAsleepOnBed-768x311.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/09/WomanAsleepOnBed-600x243.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/09/WomanAsleepOnBed.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-105568" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Some of the same brain mechanisms underlie both sleep and tinnitus. (Catherine Delahaye/Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Sleep and tinnitus&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we fall asleep, our body experiences multiple stages of sleep. One of the most important stages of sleep is &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22811426/"&gt;slow-wave sleep&lt;/a&gt; (also known as deep sleep), which is thought to be the most restful stage of sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During slow-wave sleep, brain activity moves in distinctive "waves" through the different areas of the brain, activating large areas together (such as those involved with memory and processing sounds) before moving on to others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's thought that slow-wave sleep allows the brain's neurons (specialized brain cells which send and receive information) to recover from daily wear and tear, while also helping sleep make us feel rested. It's also thought to be important for our &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30923474/"&gt;memory&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not every area of the brain experiences the same amount of slow-wave activity. It's &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15184907/"&gt;most pronounced&lt;/a&gt; in areas we use most while awake, such as those important for &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature10009"&gt;motor function&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3524543/"&gt;sight&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But sometimes, certain brain areas can be overactive during slow-wave sleep. This is what happens in sleep disorders such as &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5806559"&gt;sleep walking&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A similar thing may happen in people with tinnitus. We think that hyperactive brain regions might stay awake in the otherwise sleeping brain. This would explain why many people with tinnitus experience &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8373941/"&gt;disturbed sleep&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0929664620301066"&gt;night terrors&lt;/a&gt; more often than people who don't have tinnitus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_127397" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-127397" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/05/ManSleepsOnBluePillow-642x260.jpg" alt="man sleeps on blue pillow" class="wp-image-127397 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/05/ManSleepsOnBluePillow-642x260.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/05/ManSleepsOnBluePillow-768x311.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/05/ManSleepsOnBluePillow-600x243.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/05/ManSleepsOnBluePillow.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-127397" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Sleep and tinnitus appear to have an important connection. (Juanmonino/Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tinnitus patients also spend more time in &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24005841/"&gt;light sleep&lt;/a&gt;. Simply put, we believe that tinnitus keeps the brain from producing the slow-wave activity needed to have a deep sleep, resulting in light and interrupted sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But even though tinnitus patients have &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24005841/"&gt;less deep sleep on average&lt;/a&gt; than people without tinnitus, the research we looked at in our review suggests that some deep sleep is hardly affected by tinnitus. This may be because the brain activity that happens during the deepest sleep actually suppresses tinnitus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a couple of ways the brain may be able to suppress tinnitus during deep sleep. The first has to do with the brain's neurons. After a long period of wakefulness neurons in the brain are thought to switch into slow-wave activity mode to recover. The more neurons in this mode together, the stronger the drive is for the rest of the brain to join.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know that the drive for sleep can get strong enough that neurons in the brain will eventually go into slow-wave activity mode. And since this especially applies to brain regions overactive during wakefulness, we think that tinnitus might be suppressed as a result of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slow-wave activity has also been shown to interfere with the &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30356042/"&gt;communication between brain areas&lt;/a&gt;. During deepest sleep, when slow-wave activity is strongest, this may keep hyperactive regions from disturbing other brain areas and from interrupting sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This would explain why people with tinnitus can still enter deep sleep, and why tinnitus may be suppressed during that time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sleep is also important for strengthening our memory, by helping to drive &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11343661/"&gt;changes in connections&lt;/a&gt; between neurons in the brain. We believe that changes in brain connectivity during sleep are contributing to what makes tinnitus last for a long time after an initial trigger (such as hearing loss).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Treating tinnitus&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We already know that intensity of tinnitus can change throughout a given day. Investigating how tinnitus changes during sleep could give us a direct handle on what the brain does to cause fluctuations in tinnitus intensity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also means that we may be able to manipulate sleep to improve the wellbeing of patients – and possibly develop new treatments for tinnitus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, sleep disruptions can be reduced and slow-wave activity can be boosted through &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33984745/"&gt;sleep restriction paradigms&lt;/a&gt;, where patients are told to only go to bed when they're actually tired. Boosting the intensity of sleep could help us better see the effect sleep has on tinnitus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we suspect that deep sleep is the most likely to affect tinnitus, there are many other stages of sleep that happen (such as rapid eye movement, or REM sleep) – each with unique patterns of brain activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In future research, both the sleep stage and tinnitus activity in the brain could be tracked at the same time by recording brain activity. This may help to find out more about the link between tinnitus and sleep and understand how tinnitus may be alleviated by natural brain activity. &lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/182711/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" loading="lazy"&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;U .S. taxpayers spent an estimated $6 billion researching, developing, and implementing new blockbuster weight-loss drugs, according to new data shared with &lt;em&gt;The Lever&lt;/em&gt;.

The highly contagious norovirus is rampant in South Florida.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Norovirus has torn through the United States this winter, peaking early in some parts of the country but taking hold in South Florida over the last few weeks. It arrives with cramps, diarrhea, vomiting, fever, dizziness and fatigue, symptoms that set in about 12 to 48 hours after exposure to viral particles. On average, one person with norovirus will infect two to seven others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;“It’s a tough illness to have to deal with,” said Dr. Maria Garcia, an emergency medicine physician at Baptist Health South Florida.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Garcia is seeing firsthand what &lt;a href="https://data.wastewaterscan.org/?plantId=d3ff13c4&amp;amp;target=Noro_G2&amp;amp;selectedLocation=%7B%22label%22%3A%22North%20Miami,%20FL%22,%22level%22%3A%22plant%22,%22value%22%3A%22d3ff13c4%22%7D" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;Florida wastewater data&lt;/a&gt; over the most recent 21 days confirms: Norovirus concentration levels through the state are high. Federal surveillance data only shows reported outbreaks in Florida through the end of January. Florida, like most of the south, had higher levels than in previous years as of Jan. 31, according to the Centers for Disease Control &amp;amp; Prevention (CDC).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Among those who caught the virus is Leslie O’Shea, of Fort Lauderdale, who said she missed three days of work last week due to the symptoms. She even slept on the bathroom floor, feeling lightheaded and struggling to stand up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;“This was the sickest I have been in a long time,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Similar experiences fill social media posts, with photos of people in bed declaring “I wouldn’t wish norovirus on my worst enemy” and “This virus is straight from the pits of hell.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Experts say the surge of cases is being driven by a new dominant strain of norovirus called GII.17[P17], which has displaced a strain that had been around for decades. Lower population immunity to this new strain could explain this year’s harsh wave of the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;This new strain, the CDC said, is linked to cruise-ship outbreaks in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Indeed, South Florida’s proximity to cruise ports may be exacerbating the spread. According to the CDC’s &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vessel-sanitation/cruise-ship-outbreaks/index.html" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;Vessel Sanitation Program&lt;/a&gt;, nine voyages that have departed from or docked in Florida this year have&lt;a href="https://www.sun-sentinel.com/2025/02/11/cdc-tracks-another-norovirus-outbreak-on-florida-based-cruise-ship/" target="_blank" rel=""&gt; resulted in outbreaks&lt;/a&gt; — seven were confirmed to be norovirus. Passengers exposed to norovirus often have overnight stays in Florida and travel through local airports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="h1"&gt;So, what to do?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Medical experts want Floridians to know that hand sanitizer does not kill norovirus. You need to thoroughly wash your hands with soap and water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Norovirus is also hard to kill on surfaces, where it can live for days to weeks. If someone in your household vomits in the bathroom, you need to clean every contaminated surface with a disinfectant (typically bleach).

Only a small particle is needed to pass on the infection.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Doctors recommend that adults and children stay hydrated with Pedialyte. “Pedialyte is less irritating to the stomach than Gatorade and people tolerate it better,” Gopal said. “Make sure to sip it frequently.” Dehydration can lead to other symptoms, like dizziness.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Zofran or antinausea medications may be necessary to curb the vomiting and fluid loss and allow you to take a fever reducer. However, antidiarrheal medications can be tricky, said Garcia from Baptist Health South Florida. “Some bacterial infections present similar symptoms and antidiarrheal medications will worsen them. You need to discuss it with a healthcare provider,” she said. “My recommendation is to avoid them.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;You can’t get norovirus from someone coughing or sneezing, so masking won’t help.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Symptoms from norovirus usually last one to three days.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;You can still spread norovirus for days after you’re feeling better. “If you are preparing food and had norovirus a few weeks ago, you may be still shedding, so adhere to strict hand hygiene protocols,” Gopal said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Most people get better after a few days. But not everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;“If you are dizzy, weak and the vomiting is out of control, you may have to seek medical attention,” Gopal said. “Dehydration can be problematic for young children, the elderly and anyone who is immunocompromised.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;There is no antiviral treatment for norovirus, and while there isn’t currently a vaccine, drug manufacturer Moderna is working on one. Any norovirus vaccine would require an educated guess as to which strains would be likely to circulate in a given year, which is the same concept behind the annual flu vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Additionally, it is possible to get norovirus more than once in a season, Garcia added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;“If there are multiple strains around, you might have had the virus and created immunity to one strain and someone is around you with another strain and you get infected again,” she said. “That’s why washing your hands is so important.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Tampa Bay Times</author><pubDate>Thu, 06 Mar 2025 10:11:35 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilAFBVV95cUxQM0JMdmxYaWJpNnFvX2t5a2tQWV9zdTRjQnRRQU9jbWhnWWlJN3JCQ0pueENqeVNiN1FUNG84R0xseTNKY2plVXNsVVVpaFJ1bjhfX3FROS1TQmRPUllnaG16SDRDS0NtNllKOEwxRF9VT1hzOEhHd1k4QW51MWZGUW5Vcl9Hc3VCanBCemRRd18xUEti</guid></item><item><title>6 Sources of Protein That Aren’t Meat - The New York Times</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifkFVX3lxTE9vcDl3aTg1S05ITXpLMjJNbjZBVEV0dXY1bVVLWm1HNU00bXZWamtrdXNjRjlQeHcwMGJiMXZxbWNBbE9WZlU3NFl1eFE5Q3NyZzVuWVczZ3B3T2I2TGlxdnhPRVBqMXd0elozTG1FTkF4V21DTWprZXl0TnZiUQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-0"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Scientists have long known about &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/20/well/eat/red-meat-diabetes-study.html" title=""&gt;the downsides of red and processed meats&lt;/a&gt;. Eating them has been linked with increased risks of health issues like heart disease, some types of cancer and earlier death. And &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/15/well/eat/plant-based-diet-nuts-beans-grains.html" title=""&gt;research suggests&lt;/a&gt; that replacing those protein sources with nonmeat alternatives like legumes, nuts, whole grains and more can improve your health in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Such swaps can also be better for the environment — and your wallet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“You hear the argument that eating healthy is expensive,” said Sara Elnakib, a dietitian and public health expert at Rutgers University. But you can enjoy plant-based sources of protein like beans right out of the can or ready-to-eat whole grains heated in the microwave. “It can be really easy. That’s the point: Whatever way you can get them into your system, do that,” Dr. Elnakib said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Here are six sources of protein that aren’t red or processed meat, and the reasons experts love them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-2"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Beans, peas, lentils, peanuts — legumes are “affordable, nutritious and delicious,” said Julia Wolfson, an associate professor of international health at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Federal guidelines &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/30/well/eat/protein-age.html" title=""&gt;recommend that most people&lt;/a&gt; ages 19 and older get 0.36 grams of protein per pound of body weight per day (though personal needs can vary).

After a period of smooth sailing, one day, seemingly out of the blue, you have achy knees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“You wake up in the morning and you suddenly feel old,” said Dr. Steve Hoffmann, a computational biology professor at the Leibniz Institute on Aging in Jena, Germany. “That’s sort of the takeaway.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;It turns out there may be a scientific basis for this experience. By analyzing &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/19/well/live/biological-age-testing.html" title=""&gt;age-related markers&lt;/a&gt;, such as proteins and DNA tags in the bloodstream, some scientists are coming to understand that aging in adulthood is not a linear process, but perhaps one that jumps dramatically at certain points in one’s life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Here’s what they’ve learned so far, and what it could ultimately mean for your health and life span.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;h2 class="css-1u37br4 eoo0vm40" id="link-e0f5dac"&gt;What does ‘nonlinear aging’ look like?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Scientists have long suspected that aging may happen in bursts, but they only began using molecular signals to measure the pace of aging in the past decade or so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;A &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-024-00692-2" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;widely covered Stanford study&lt;/a&gt; published last year tracked several molecular changes associated with aging in blood samples gathered from 108 adults between age 25 and 75. By comparing samples from different subjects of different ages, it found that people seemed to age more rapidly around age 44, and again around 60. The clusters of changes in the first spike appeared to be mostly related to fat and alcohol metabolism, as well as muscle function, and the second spike mostly to immune dysfunction and muscle function.

The flu “certainly is still around,” said &lt;a href="https://med.umn.edu/bio/beth-thielen" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Beth Thielen" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67c5f174e4b060a78674cba4" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://med.umn.edu/bio/beth-thielen" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="4"&gt;Dr. Beth Thielen&lt;/a&gt;, an infectious disease expert at the University of Minnesota Medical School.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don’t be deceived by the changing weather, either. “I think we see quite a tail out into the spring, and people should be aware that flu circulates around the globe year-round,” Thielen said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;That means there are still plenty of chances you could get sick. And if you are exposed, you might wonder how long it’ll take before the symptoms smack you (if they do at all). Below, medical experts share just how long it takes to come down with the flu after being exposed and what to do if you do get sick: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It takes one to four days to get sick with the flu after being exposed to the virus.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The typical flu incubation period, which is the time it takes from being exposed to a virus to coming down with symptoms, is “somewhere between one and four days,” Thielen said. “Maybe a peak around two days.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exactly when you get sick does vary but “when you look at the collective data that is looking at household exposures, the mean time usually is around three days,” noted &lt;a href="https://www.elisabethmarnikphd.com/" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Elisabeth Marnik" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67c5f174e4b060a78674cba4" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.elisabethmarnikphd.com/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="5"&gt;Elisabeth Marnik&lt;/a&gt;, a scientist and contributor for Those Nerdy Girls, an online resource for factual health and science information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We list it as a range because there are sometimes exceptions. Some people get it faster, and for some reason, some people get it a little bit later. But I would say that two to three days would be the typical exposure window,” Marnik noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flu spreads through respiratory droplets, which spray when someone coughs or sneezes, Thielen said. So if you are sick (or someone in your household is), it’s a good idea to wear a mask or stay entirely away from others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The virus also spreads through touch. “If somebody coughs or sneezes and then touches a surface like a light switch or a doorknob, they are leaving behind that flu virus on those surfaces that someone else can come along and pick up,” Thielen added. This makes proper hand washing important, as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if you don’t have flu symptoms (&lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/flu-symptoms-winter-2025_l_678826b5e4b086654c6eb4f9" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="such as body aches, fever, fatigue and cough" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67c5f174e4b060a78674cba4" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="678826b5e4b086654c6eb4f9" data-vars-target-content-type="buzz" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="6"&gt;such as body aches, fever, fatigue and cough&lt;/a&gt;) yet, you can still spread the illness. Folks who are infected can shed the virus roughly a day before having symptoms, Thielen said. If you know you’ve been exposed to the flu, consider wearing a mask when around others even if you don’t have any symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For people who are exposed to flu and are high-risk, talk to your doctor about preventative measures.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Thielen, there are antiviral medications available for high-risk adults and children (generally kids under 5) that reduce the likelihood of developing a symptomatic flu infection after a flu exposure. The most well-known post-flu exposure medication is Tamiflu, which is also used as a flu treatment after someone has symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The medications that decrease the likelihood of developing a symptomatic flu infection ― like Tamiflu, Xofluza, Relenza ― are really just meant for people in a high-risk group, Thielen noted. That includes children under 5, people over 65 and those with certain chronic conditions. If that’s you or your child, you can talk to your doctor about treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: miodrag ignjatovic via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;miodrag ignjatovic via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;You can test yourself for flu with at-home flu tests.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you’re not high-risk, there are other precautions you can take if you’ve been exposed.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’ve been around someone with the flu but aren’t at risk of severe disease or hospitalization, buy yourself an at-home flu antigen test, Marnik advised. At-home flu tests, which are much like at-home COVID tests, are available at stores like CVS and Walgreens, and on &lt;a href="https://r.bttn.io?btn_ref=org-677cb81987ed72f9&amp;amp;btn_url=https://www.amazon.com/iHealth-COVID-19-Authorized-Non-invasive-Discomfort/dp/B0D3T1X1FS/v_cOg29FV0mGIgwqc_oV29Q.9kUKBdGsOcgyRGJxLDmS3JNt3bwjg_-ofLGaKay7OkA&amp;amp;dib_tag=se&amp;amp;hvadid=692399481061&amp;amp;hvdev=c&amp;amp;hvlocphy=9007325&amp;amp;hvnetw=g&amp;amp;hvqmt=b&amp;amp;hvrand=12487517396036258426&amp;amp;hvtargid=kwd-373328626744&amp;amp;hydadcr=21850_13401802&amp;amp;keywords=home+flu+tests&amp;amp;mcid=060d4a6743853d7caa31264d180d8b33&amp;amp;qid=1741106534&amp;amp;sr=8-1-spons&amp;amp;sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGY&amp;amp;psc=1?tag=thehuffingtop-20%26ascsubtag%3D67c5f174e4b060a78674cba4%252C-1%252C-1%252Cd%252C0%252C0%252Chp-fil-am%253D0%252C0%253A0%252C0%252C0%252C0" target="_blank" role="link" data-amazon-link="true" data-aps-asin="B0D3T1X1FS" data-aps-asc-tag="thehuffingtop-20" data-aps-asc-subtag="67c5f174e4b060a78674cba4,-1,-1,d,0,0,hp-fil-am=0,0:0,0,0,0" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="sites like Amazon" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67c5f174e4b060a78674cba4" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://r.bttn.io?btn_ref=org-677cb81987ed72f9&amp;amp;btn_url=https://www.amazon.com/iHealth-COVID-19-Authorized-Non-invasive-Discomfort/dp/B0D3T1X1FS/v_cOg29FV0mGIgwqc_oV29Q.9kUKBdGsOcgyRGJxLDmS3JNt3bwjg_-ofLGaKay7OkA&amp;amp;dib_tag=se&amp;amp;hvadid=692399481061&amp;amp;hvdev=c&amp;amp;hvlocphy=9007325&amp;amp;hvnetw=g&amp;amp;hvqmt=b&amp;amp;hvrand=12487517396036258426&amp;amp;hvtargid=kwd-373328626744&amp;amp;hydadcr=21850_13401802&amp;amp;keywords=home+flu+tests&amp;amp;mcid=060d4a6743853d7caa31264d180d8b33&amp;amp;qid=1741106534&amp;amp;sr=8-1-spons&amp;amp;sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGY&amp;amp;psc=1?tag=thehuffingtop-20%26ascsubtag%3D67c5f174e4b060a78674cba4%252C-1%252C-1%252Cd%252C0%252C0%252Chp-fil-am%253D0%252C0%253A0%252C0%252C0%252C0" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="7"&gt;sites like Amazon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That way you have it on hand so that if you do get sick, you don’t have to go out and try to get one and spread the virus,” Marnik added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;From there, monitor yourself to see if you come down with any &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/flu-symptoms-winter-2025_l_678826b5e4b086654c6eb4f9" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="common flu symptoms" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67c5f174e4b060a78674cba4" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="678826b5e4b086654c6eb4f9" data-vars-target-content-type="buzz" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="8"&gt;common flu symptoms&lt;/a&gt;.

			&lt;p&gt;Feeling disbelieved when knowing that there is something very wrong with your body can have devastating and long-term consequences. One of the most obvious consequences is that you won't get the correct treatment and support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/rheumatology/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/rheumatology/keaf115"&gt;A study&lt;/a&gt; my colleagues and I conducted of over 3,000 people with autoimmune disease uncovered many extra long-lasting disadvantages when the misdiagnosis involved a mental health or psychosomatic label (often termed an "in your head" misdiagnosis by patients).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These often included feelings of shame, self-doubt and  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/depression" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73097" data-postid="154194" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;. For some, it extended to suicidal thoughts and even suicide attempts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A further consequence was that people had much lower trust in doctors. This distrust led to some people avoiding seeking further medical help, often for fear of being disbelieved again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A concerning finding from our study was that these negative emotions and distrust often remained just as strong many years after feeling that a doctor had not believed their symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psychological scars were deep and usually unhealed. Over 70 percent of people reporting a psychosomatic or mental misdiagnosis said that it still upset them. And over 80 percent said that it had damaged their self-worth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of our study participants, who had several autoimmune diseases, told her story that spoke for many: "One doctor told me I was making myself feel pain – I still can't forget those words. Telling me I'm doing it to myself has made me very anxious and depressed."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_154210" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-154210" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/HypermobilityInJointsCanBeAsignOfOftenMissedChronicCondition.jpg" alt="Wrist bending beyond average levels so thumb touches forearm" class="wp-image-154210 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/HypermobilityInJointsCanBeAsignOfOftenMissedChronicCondition.jpg 724w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/HypermobilityInJointsCanBeAsignOfOftenMissedChronicCondition-642x428.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/HypermobilityInJointsCanBeAsignOfOftenMissedChronicCondition-622x415.jpg 622w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/HypermobilityInJointsCanBeAsignOfOftenMissedChronicCondition-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 724px) 100vw, 724px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-154210" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Subtle signs of chronic conditions are often missed, like hypermobile joints in &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/ehlers-danlos-syndromes/"&gt;Elhers-Danlos syndrome&lt;/a&gt;. (Pheelings Media/iStock/Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;'I still can't forget these words'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings were not just anecdotal. Overall, we found depression levels were significantly higher and wellbeing levels lower in people who reported receiving mental health or psychosomatic misdiagnoses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We chose to use this woman's testimony in the title of our study: "I still can't forget those words."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only did it accurately reflect our findings, but it symbolizes our research team's ethos to give these often unheard patients a voice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hurt of misdiagnosis was compounded by having "nowhere to voice my anger" or distress. Some of the most moving stories were from people whose early symptoms of autoimmune disease, when they were still children, had been disbelieved by doctors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even in middle or older age, those words and feelings had remained with them for decades, often felt as strongly as the day that they were heard. As one of the patient partners in our research team described it, they lived the rest of their lives with "seared souls".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A woman with lupus told the interviewer that her doctor had told her at age 16 that she had "too many symptoms for it not to be hypochondria".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She spoke very emotively and articulately about the damage caused to a developing sense of self.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has affected my mental health very negatively and I do think it's affected me in my like sense of self. It's not good for anyone at any age but as a teenage girl being told you don't know your own feelings is absolutely no way to shape a human being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is natural when hearing all these very difficult stories, and seeing the damage caused, to blame doctors, but is that fair?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doctors very rarely set out to cause harm. Rather, in some cases, it is impossible to diagnose autoimmune diseases quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, our study highlights that some doctors do reach too quickly for a psychosomatic or mental health explanation for autoimmune disease symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some research that may have influenced doctors in giving psychosomatic misdiagnoses says that a long list of symptoms is a red flag that the symptoms are not caused by a disease. This generalization rather dangerously fails to account for the fact that a long list of symptoms is also a red flag for many autoimmune diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many autoimmune symptoms are also invisible, and there are no clear tests that will show how bad they are to the doctor. Some of the terms that patients find upsetting and dismissive when doctors talk or write about their symptoms include "vague" and "non-specific".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doctors often write letters quickly due to health service constraints, sometimes unthinkingly using terms passed down from their seniors; letters that use terms like "patient claims" or "no objective evidence found of" can increase feelings of being disbelieved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Empathetic listening&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our research suggests that more doctors need to think about autoimmunity as a diagnosis early on when faced with multiple varied symptoms that often don't seem to fit together. Above all, many diagnostic clues can be found by listening to and believing the people experiencing the symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Empathetic listening and support are also required to help misdiagnosed patients heal emotionally – they very rarely can just "move on" as one doctor advised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We should not underestimate the power of doctors saying "I believe you" to patients with multiple invisible symptoms, and "I am sorry for what has happened in the past" if they had a difficult road to diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the 50 doctors interviewed for the study reported that misdiagnoses were common in autoimmunity, but few had realized that the repercussions of these misdiagnoses were so severe and long lasting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reassuringly, almost all of them were saddened and motivated to improve their patients' experiences. Several explained that they thought they were being reassuring by telling patients that their symptoms were most likely to be psychological or stress-related and thought this would be preferable to patients worrying about having a disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although many people experience mental health and psychosomatic symptoms, and doctors must consider them as a possible explanation, a clear lesson from our study is that psychosomatic (mis)diagnoses are rarely seen as reassuring to patients with autoimmune disease symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather, they are usually deeply damaging with lifelong and life-changing repercussions.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/250953/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mendy Pellin opened with his personal journey about Ulcerative Colitis, sharing hilarious anecdotes that lightened the mood and helped everyone feel more comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With up to 5% of adult patients, and more than a few pediatric patients seen at ODA with some form of IBD, Dr. &lt;strong&gt;Eli Rosen&lt;/strong&gt;, beloved community doctor, emphasized that people can live full, happy lives despite their medical diagnoses. Dr. Rosen shared how maintaining a positive and uplifted attitude, believing “tracht gut vet zein gut” is not just a sweet sentiment, but actually affects the way we live and feel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. &lt;strong&gt;David Hudesman&lt;/strong&gt;, a leading Gastroenterologist and director of NYU’s IBD center, provided a thorough review of the condition; what factors contribute to its development; and the multitude of treatment options. He conveyed a sense of optimism, underscoring how manageable IBD can be, and prioritizing a great quality of life for all patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. &lt;strong&gt;Laurie Keefer&lt;/strong&gt;, a Gastro-Psychologist and director for Psychobehavioral Research at Mount Sinai addressed the mental and emotional impact of living with IBD. A trailblazer in her field, she highlighted how critical and impactful appropriate support can be, and offered practical solutions and ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Q&amp;amp;A that followed, attendees had the opportunity to anonymously ask their questions to specific doctors, covering a range of topics including medications, diet, mental health, and new, emerging research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One attendee noted that in the 40 years they’ve been living with IBD, the only support group available was when she arranged a group of 5 women from other communities who responded to her advertisements seeking peer support around this. To see tens of community members now gathered to learn more and be there for each other, was in itself already healing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A parent mentioned how she thought her son was the only child in the community with Crohn’s. Now, after meeting several other parents, she feels more confident in her ability to help him manage his symptoms and maintain a normal, healthy childhood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The event was intended to introduce the community to a new initiative, the Crown Heights Crohn’s and Colitis Support. The CHCCS was recently formed as it recognized the need for social support, and to destigmatize the condition. The CHCCS currently has a WhatsApp group for patients with Crohn’s and Ulcerative Colitis, and is planning to offer regular support groups for patients, as well as groups for parents and spouses/caregivers of those with IBD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next event, scheduled to take place before Pesach, will feature a health expert who specializes in IBD, to discuss tips and offer advice regarding staying flare-free and feeling good over Pesach. In addition, CHCCS has a database of recommended Gastroenterologists, surgeons, nutritionists, and psychologists.&lt;/p&gt;
