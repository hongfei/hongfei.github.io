Kennedy Jr. &lt;a class="link" href="https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1927368440811008138" target="_blank"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; this week that he was rescinding the federal government’s recommendation that pregnant women and healthy children get immunized against COVID, effective immediately. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Marty Makary, commissioner of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, also said the agency will no longer routinely approve annually formulated COVID-19 vaccinations for healthy people under age 65.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We simply don’t know whether a healthy 52-year-old woman with a normal BMI who has had COVID-19 three times and has received six previous doses of a COVID-19 vaccine will benefit from the seventh dose,” Makary, along with another FDA official, Dr. Vinay Prasad, &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsb2506929" target="_blank"&gt;wrote &lt;/a&gt;in the New England Journal of Medicine this month. “This policy will compel much-needed evidence generation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, some experts say mandating more extensive testing could delay vaccine access for many, as those efforts may not even be complete until after the end of the upcoming winter flu-and-COVID season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Pregnant women, infants and young children are at higher risk of hospitalization from COVID, and the safety of the COVID vaccine has been widely demonstrated,” Dr. Sean O’Leary, chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics’ Committee on Infectious Diseases, said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said that, in general, getting an updated vaccine provides children and adults &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.youtube.com/live/WX8rfa_f5o0?t=5503s" target="_blank"&gt;additional protection&lt;/a&gt; from COVID-related emergency room and urgent care visits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The recent federal changes, according to some experts, could also prompt private insurance companies and government insurers to stop paying for COVID shots for wide segments of the population, including babies and children. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Absent a recommendation by federal officials, Americans could end up paying the entire cost of a vaccine, experts say. The out-of-pocket cost for a COVID vaccine at CVS, for instance, is $198.99. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-02-28/do-not-post-californias-covid-emergency-is-over-now-what"&gt;emergency phase of the pandemic&lt;/a&gt; has long since passed, authorities note COVID remains a public health concern. A relatively new subvariant has been spreading in Europe and Asia, “particularly Hong Kong, Taiwan, other countries, Japan, etc.,” said Dr. Peter Chin-Hong, a UC San Francisco infectious diseases expert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That subvariant, NB.1.8.1, was first documented in January and has since been detected in California, including in Los Angeles County and the San Francisco Bay Area. The World Health Organization &lt;a class="link" href="https://data.who.int/dashboards/covid19/variants?n=o" target="_blank"&gt;designated&lt;/a&gt; it a “Variant Under Monitoring” last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NB.1.8.1 has grown exponentially worldwide in recent weeks. The Omicron subvariant represented 10.7% of genetically analyzed viral samples worldwide for the week ending April 27, WHO data show. That was up sharply from the week ending April 6, when the subvariant &lt;a class="link" href="https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/documents/epp/tracking-sars-cov-2/23052025_nb.1.8.1_ire.pdf?sfvrsn=7b14df58_4" target="_blank"&gt;accounted for&lt;/a&gt; 2.5% of samples worldwide. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While still low numbers, this is a significant rise,” the WHO said, adding that there was a “concurrent increase in cases and hospitalizations in some countries where NB.1.8.1 is widespread.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NB.1.8.1 isn’t yet prevalent enough in the United States to be &lt;a class="link" href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#variant-proportions" target="_blank"&gt;publicly tracked&lt;/a&gt; by the CDC. Another strain, LP.8.1,  accounted for an estimated 73% of coronavirus specimens nationally for the two-week period ending Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data suggest NB.1.8.1 does not cause more severe illness, “but it is more transmissible, at least from what we’re seeing around the world and also from lab experiments,” said Dr. Yvonne Maldonado, an infectious-disease expert at Stanford University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Taiwan, a top health official told reporters that an NB.1.8.1-fueled outbreak was “continuing to rise rapidly, with a sustained increase in severe and fatal cases,” the Central News Agency &lt;a class="link" href="https://focustaiwan.tw/society/202505270017" target="_blank"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;, prompting a shortage of COVID testing kits. Health officials said a factor in Taiwan’s surge was the lack of a major COVID wave over the winter, and forecast that the island’s current spike may not peak for another four to six weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NB.1.8.1 has seen increased prevalence in each of the three WHO regions that still consistently share genetic analysis of COVID samples — the Western Pacific (which includes East Asia, parts of Southeast Asia, and Australia); Europe; and the Americas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rate at which COVID tests are coming back positive in Los Angeles County has slightly increased over the past few weeks, although the overall positive rate remains low, at 3.5%, according to the county Department of Public Health. Coronavirus levels detected in the county’s wastewater have increased by 6% in the last three weeks, but also remain relatively low and are about one-eighth of the peak in the summer of last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although California experienced a mild winter season — a first of the COVID era — that followed a powerful &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2024-08-12/why-is-covid-still-surging-in-california-a-midsummer-mutation-may-be-to-blame"&gt;summer spike&lt;/a&gt; that was the strongest in years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many experts and officials have touted available COVID vaccines as effective both in warding off infection and in lessening the severity of symptoms. However, the need for otherwise healthy individuals to roll up their sleeves has been a matter of debate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a class="link" href="https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1927368440811008138" target="_blank"&gt;video message&lt;/a&gt; Tuesday on X, Kennedy — a noted vaccine skeptic — said that he “couldn’t be more pleased to announce that, as of today, the COVID vaccine for healthy children and healthy pregnant women has been removed from the CDC recommended immunization schedule.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts said they could not recall a time when a political appointee circumvented a well-established process of making vaccine recommendations, which typically involves panels of scientists advising the FDA and CDC. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s kind of chilling,” Chin-Hong said. “It’s out of step with the system we’ve learned to trust and follow.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement to The Times, the L.A. County Department of Public Health urged Kennedy to listen to experts in the field — including from the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, which is scheduled to meet next month — “before decreasing access to any vaccine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of Thursday, the CDC still had the long-standing vaccine recommendations on its website:  Everyone ages 6 months and older should get the most recent COVID-19 vaccine, officially known as the 2024-25 version, which was introduced in September. The CDC also recommends seniors ages 65 and up get a second vaccine dose six months after their first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement, the California Department of Public Health said that it supports the current expansive recommendation for COVID vaccines, and that it “will continue to follow the federal conversation through this dynamic situation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Staying up to date with COVID-19 vaccination can reduce the risk of disease, especially more severe cases that result in hospitalization or death,” the department added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Washington Post &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/05/28/vaccines-cdc-rfk-jr-covid/" target="_blank"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; Wednesday that the CDC did not know of Kennedy’s directive until he posted it, and officials have been “scrambling to find out what it meant.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts who spoke with The Times warned the practical effect of the edict — if it becomes official — could be far more costly vaccines for affected groups. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If vaccines are not recommended by the CDC, insurance companies would NOT be required to cover the cost,” the L.A. County Department of Public Health said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result, the vaccines may be less accessible to healthier people who still want them — perhaps because they live or work with elderly or other higher-risk people, they’ve had severe COVID illness before, or they want to protect themselves against the latest subvariant, the agency said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the FDA withholds a license for an updated COVID vaccination for younger, healthier adults, this group “would not be able to receive it unless their provider chooses to give it ‘off label,’” the county said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When asked whether healthy pregnant women and healthy children can still get vaccinated at its pharmacies, Walgreens said its teams operate “in full compliance with applicable laws.” CVS said its locations “follow federal guidance regarding vaccine administration and are monitoring any changes that the government may make regarding vaccine eligibility.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kaiser Permanente Southern California said it was aware of potential changes, but noted no new formal guidance has yet been issued. As a result, Kaiser is continuing to follow existing guidance, which recommends the shots for everyone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The L.A. County Department of Public Health said that as of Wednesday, “pregnant women and healthy children can get vaccinated for COVID-19,” according to existing  recommendations from an advisory panel and the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chin-Hong noted there were 150 pediatric deaths in the U.S. from COVID-19 in a recent one-year period. That’s in the same ballpark as the 231 &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/2025-week-20.html" target="_blank"&gt;pediatric flu deaths&lt;/a&gt; recorded this season, and federal health officials recommend everyone ages 6 months and older get an annual flu shot. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Most people would agree that kids should be targeted for flu vaccines. It seems kind of weird to have COVID as an outlier in that respect,” Chin-Hong said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the video published this week, Makary said that “most countries in the world have stopped recommending the vaccine for children.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maldonado, however, said the U.S. doesn’t use other nations’ standards to dictate vaccine recommendations. The U.S., for instance, recommends other types of vaccines that have a lower prevalence than COVID that people want to get, Maldonado said, such as the &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/meningococcal/vaccines/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;meningococcal vaccine&lt;/a&gt; for children to guard against a serious &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/meningococcal/about/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;bacterial disease&lt;/a&gt; that can infect the brain and spinal cord and cause death within hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The effect of a recommendation also varies by country. Canada, for instance, recommends updated COVID vaccines for seniors and other people who meet certain criteria, such as if they’re pregnant or are a healthcare worker. But the country’s universal healthcare system still allows everyone ages 6 months and older to get an updated COVID vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although it’s true that children overall are at lower risk of developing severe COVID illness, those under 6 months of age “have the same risk of complications as the 65-year-old-plus population in this country,” said Stanford’s Maldonado, who also serves on the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among children eligible for vaccination, COVID-associated hospitalization rates are &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/downloads/slides-2025-04-15-16/03-Havers-COVID-508.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;highest&lt;/a&gt; for those ages 6 months to 4 years, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So are children going to be the highest risk group? No, they’re not. But would you want to protect your child from a disease that could potentially put them in the hospital and get them on a ventilator? Yes, I would say that I would want to make that choice for myself. And why not allow the parent to make that choice?” Maldonado said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC says COVID vaccination during pregnancy builds antibodies that can help protect the baby; studies have also shown that vaccinated moms who breastfeed have protective  antibodies in their milk, which could help protect their babies.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There have been an estimated 260,000 to 430,000 &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/covid/php/surveillance/burden-estimates.html" target="_blank"&gt;hospitalizations&lt;/a&gt; attributed to COVID since October, causing “an enormous burden on the healthcare system,” Dr. Fiona Havers, a medical epidemiologist with the CDC, &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.youtube.com/live/WX8rfa_f5o0?feature=shared&amp;amp;t=4113" target="_blank"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; at a recent public meeting. There have also been an estimated 30,000 to 50,000 COVID-19 deaths over the same time period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is a major cause of morbidity and mortality, particularly in older adults, but it does affect other people, particularly those with underlying conditions, in younger age groups.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;COVID is also a major cause of pediatric hospitalizations, even among otherwise healthy children, she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If there’s a summer wave this year, we’ll be seeing it in children being hospitalized with COVID as well,” she said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Los Angeles Times</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 May 2025 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiwwFBVV95cUxOdXpTaGVINk01eEdSMGF2R1pUaWlqeTRPcXBrQ1h5MUlEdmlBWHlYRTA5MW5jSk4zV3F0TW1uWm91eVVvcUR5QmdvcTE3ZWEzVllha0VENkF6TFVuWmo5Zy00eHRJOEFFQ1k2aUVudWZ2Ukp1aTJMam8zOFdrSjBGVC1uZHBxVmFmdEdiZ2xwRUotc3Q5Z1RJVnE0QnRRWk5ZT1djeF9VcWNYYXQwelpCUEYtTkcxZVRsVDBWV2FZUVRSOFE</guid></item><item><title>为什么爬楼梯对身体和大脑都有好处- BBC | Why climbing the stairs can be good for your body and brain - BBC</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipgFBVV95cUxQTl9XXzFoeXRETlY3QWJxcjBsNnp2OXVmRjh3eVBhdS12UWYwSDluRzg1WFk0bG1zNllqaWw1NlJvMFNISHhWV19xS21YYlpVb1o1SFpXcDVvVUtneVZRSmRIelZ0QzZOMk1lUlMxSHlFeWZPVThQQUE1TXlLUTlhUWtKTXNvSzVoMVQ1eXpHSndIUGctOVBWZG1QYktPd05hT2hJTU5n?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article&gt;&lt;p data-component="headline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH"&gt;&lt;h1 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 dfvxux"&gt;Why climbing the stairs can be good for your body and brain&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 kVRMhO"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="hero-image" class="sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250529-103858-de9d27ef1-web-2.22.3-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0lf97cn.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0lf97cn.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0lf97cn.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0lf97cn.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0lf97cn.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0lf97cn.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0lf97cn.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0lf97cn.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0lf97cn.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0lf97cn.jpg.webp" loading="eager" alt="Alamy Close up of a person's feet wearing sandals as they climb a staircase painted red next to a green wall (Credit: Alamy)" class="sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU"&gt;Alamy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;&lt;b id="while-it-is-tempting-to-take-the-lift-or-escalator-rather-than-use-the-stairs,-even-scaling-just-a-few-flights-a-day-could-give-your-health-and-mind-a-boost." class="sc-d16436d-0 jpoiOL"&gt;While it is tempting to take the lift or escalator rather than use the stairs, even scaling just a few flights a day could give your health and mind a boost.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;As expeditions go, it was a gruelling one. In just under 23 hours on 3 September 2021, Sean Greasley climbed and descended 8,849 m (29,032ft) – a distance that would have taken him to the top of the highest mountain on Earth. By the end, he was dripping in sweat and could &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grk-1qipf-8" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;barely walk&lt;/a&gt;. And he did it all in the relative comfort of his own home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Greasley &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/2024/10/mans-mission-to-raise-charity-cash-by-climbing-everest-at-home" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;holds the world record&lt;/a&gt; for the fastest time to ascend and descend the same height as Mount Everest on stairs, achieving it in 22 hours, 57 minutes and two seconds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;While Greasley achieved this on the staircase at his home in Las Vegas, there are others who take stair climbing to other extremes. Tower running, for example, involves racing up enormous flights of stairs inside iconic buildings and skyscrapers. There is even a Tower Running Association and an official tower running &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.towerrunning.com/ranking/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;global ranking&lt;/a&gt; for the elite athletes dedicated to this unusual sport.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Most of us are unlikely to achieve such giddy heights, yet even climbing a few flights of stairs in our daily lives might be something to aspire to. According to research, climbing stairs can have surprising benefits for both &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0021915023052218" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;your physical health&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41465-024-00294-1" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;your brain&lt;/a&gt; without needing to hurtle up two steps at a time or break records.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;It's this everyday simplicity that is stair-climbing's greatest strength. Stairs are everywhere – we encounter them at home, at work and in public.

Researchers have found that stair-climbing results in surprising improvements in &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-50282-2" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;cognitive ability&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Andreas Stenling is an associate professor psychology at Umeå University, Sweden, who primarily researches the longer-term relationships between physical activity and health. He and his colleagues studied the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41465-024-00294-1#Sec17" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;immediate effects&lt;/a&gt; of stair-climbing on different cognitive abilities in young adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"Inhibition and switching were the two main cognitive functions we focused on here," says Stenling, "Cognitive switching, sometimes called mental flexibility, is how easy we're able to switch between cognitive tasks," he says. "So, going from one task to the other without having to reset your cognition, so to speak. Inhibition is about blocking out irrelevant information while you're engaged in the task." Stenling explains that we know that these cognitive functions are important for learning, cognitive word tasks, abstract thinking, and being able to keep your thoughts on one thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="quote-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-2b8ea91d-0 bgzaEJ"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-2b8ea91d-2 dYxeIv"&gt;Climbing more than five flights of stairs daily  is associated with a lower risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Stenling and colleagues found that their stair-climbing exercise significantly improved participants' "switching" abilities, which is also considered the most difficult of the cognitive tasks tested for. They also tested for changes in mood, finding that participants felt happier and more energetic after stair-climbing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Another study published by researchers at the Yamaguchi University Graduate School of Medicine in &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-50282-2" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;Japan also found that people who climbed two flights of stairs displayed&lt;/a&gt; more focused problem solving than those who took the elevator. Intriguingly, there weren't any improvements in problem solving when they climbed five or eight flights of stairs, suggesting the effect is not dependent upon the number of stairs. Another study by the same group also found that walking downstairs led to an &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/behavioral-neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fnbeh.2021.834097/full" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;increase in creative thinking&lt;/a&gt;, generating 61% more original ideas than those who travelled using a lift. So if you are looking for a burst of inspiration on a problem you are trying to solve, a quick jaunt up to the next floor and back may be all you need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;There is much interest in the mechanisms which link exercise to cognitive benefits, but little conclusive research. Stenling suggests, however, that the improvements could be linked to the cardiovascular system and the increase in blood flow to the brain, as well as growth hormones such as &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/15092" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor&lt;/a&gt; (BDNF), which seem to be impacted quickly by exercise in general.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Researchers including Stenling are also keen to explore whether there may be any delayed effects from stair climbing. Most studies focus on the cognitive effects immediately after climbing some stairs. One recent study found, however, that there were &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://ijbnpa.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12966-024-01683-7" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;some improvements in memory&lt;/a&gt; from stair-climbing that carry over to the next day when paired with good sleep quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But while the concept of taking 10,000 steps a day is ingrained in the public mind as the benchmark for daily exercise, is there a similar target we should be aiming for when it comes to stairs?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250529-103858-de9d27ef1-web-2.22.3-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0lf999d.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0lf999d.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0lf999d.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0lf999d.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0lf999d.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0lf999d.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0lf999d.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0lf999d.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0lf999d.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0lf999d.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images Many of us climb stairs as an incidental part of our day, so it can be an easy way to gain health benefits (Credit: Getty Images)" class="sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq"&gt;Many of us climb stairs as an incidental part of our day, so it can be an easy way to gain health benefits (Credit: Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The research is similarly sparse when it comes to putting a target on stair climbing. But the studies that do exist suggest that climbing more than five flights of stairs daily (equivalent to 50 steps) is associated with a &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.atherosclerosis-journal.com/article/S0021-9150(23)05221-8/abstract" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;lower risk&lt;/a&gt; of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), which is the build-up of plaque in the arteries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Marcotte-Chenard and his colleagues are optimistic that exercise snacks, specifically stair-climbing, could provide a good solution to breaking sedimentary habits at work. In a study assessing the psychological responses of office employees undertaking stair-climbing in the workplace, Marcotte-Chenard and colleagues found that &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37748202/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;71% of employees&lt;/a&gt; preferred several small exercise snacks, climbing 60 steps in three different sessions, over one intense HIIT (high intensity interval training) session of climbing 60 steps three times in one session.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"For them [the participants], it's easier to just go one time up and down the stairs and go back to sitting," says Marcotte-Chenard. "And because you spread it out throughout the day, it seems that people enjoy it a little bit more than if they do it in one single session." The researchers' study is unique for being conducted outside the laboratory, which could suggest that the research is more applicable to the real world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Not all research agrees that home stair-climbing is the answer, with some suggesting it is &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jcsm.12679" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;insufficient physical&lt;/a&gt; activity to lower the risk of CVD mortality and premature death.

Although the weather in Milwaukie, Ore., was cold and rainy that March evening, his apartment was too warm to explain his chills. He had been having abdominal pain for the past several weeks, but that night it was excruciating — like a knife plunged deep into his belly, sharp and burning. All the strength seemed to seep from his body, and he thought he might pass out. That’s when he asked his roommate to call 911.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The E.M.T.s were concerned by the man’s pallor and low blood pressure and took him to Kaiser Permanente Sunnyside in Clackamas, just north of the small town where he spent much of his childhood. In the E.R., initial blood tests showed that he had lost a tremendous amount of blood — nearly half the blood in his system. The man shook with cold beneath the several blankets layered over him. With trembling hands, he signed the consent forms for a transfusion to replace some of what he had lost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="css-1u37br4 eoo0vm40" id="link-72d7d2a"&gt;Months of Bizarre Symptoms&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;It had been a strange winter. In January, he noticed a bulge in the left side of his abdomen while taking a shower. He pressed on it, and it disappeared, only to reappear when the pressure was released. It didn’t hurt, but it was weird and new. He got in to see a physician assistant 10 days later. The P.A. couldn’t see or feel the lump but ordered an ultrasound to look for it. And they found it: a mass the size of a large grapefruit, about six inches in diameter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Three weeks later, before any follow-ups had been planned, the man was sent a Valentine’s Day lunch by his girlfriend. He had just started eating when he developed a stabbing pain in his abdomen. It lasted less than a minute. But every mouthful after that moment triggered the same searing pain — even water. He drove himself to a nearby urgent care center. A CT scan showed clearly that the grapefruit of fluid now filled his entire upper abdomen, compressing his stomach, pancreas and spleen. He was admitted to the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Before Dr. Amit Sadana, the gastroenterologist assigned to his care, met the patient the following day, he had already reviewed the images showing the mass. It was probably digestive enzymes leaking from the pancreas into the abdomen. The man’s body had responded by walling off the fluid with inflammatory cells, forming what is called a pseudocyst. This was usually seen after trauma — often a serious car accident in which the seatbelt was slammed against the abdomen. The man recalled an accidental hit sustained while wrestling in the snow with a friend a couple of months earlier. Sadana looked dubious — it usually took more force than that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;In any case, the doctor said, he could put a tube into the pseudocyst and let the fluid flow into the man’s stomach. That would reduce the pressure and allow the inflammatory mass to resolve. That was done the next day, and for the first time in weeks, the young man was able to eat and drink with no pain. He was sent home a day later; the plan was to let the fluid drain for three or four weeks and then remove the tube. Sadana sent the fluid to the lab to see if there was something else going on. The results showed no evidence of cancer. Pancreatic cancer is rare in someone this young, but it could cause a leak of pancreatic fluid. And it’s not a diagnosis you want to miss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-kbghgg"&gt;&lt;div class="css-121kum4"&gt;&lt;p class="css-171quhb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-asuuk5"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-7axq9l" data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true" class="css-1b5b8u1"&gt;&lt;path fill="currentColor" fill-rule="evenodd" d="M2.5 12a9.5 9.5 0 1 1 19 0 9.5 9.5 0 0 1-19 0Zm8.5 1.75v-7.5h2v7.5h-2Zm0 2v2h2v-2h-2Z" clip-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;div data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript-message" class="css-6yo1no"&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;We are having trouble retrieving the article content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dv1kvn" id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A pair of French scientists are exploring the impact of ionizing radiation on pollinators. Their research has taken them to Fukushima, Japan, site of the infamous 2011 nuclear disaster, to investigate how radioactivity might affect the cognitive abilities of these insects.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-actirise-slot="top-content" class="device-mobile device-tablet ads"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What Drives This Research?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First and foremost, it’s important to recognize that pollinators like bees and hornets possess &lt;strong&gt;numerous cognitive abilities&lt;/strong&gt;, enabling them, for example, to navigate space or recognize colors. However, we know that environmental pollution and other human-made substances can disrupt the cognition of these insects. So, what about radioactivity? This topic was explored in an article published by CNRS Le Journal on May 16, 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The magazine spoke with Olivier Armant from the Ecology and Ecotoxicology of Radionuclides lab at the Nuclear Safety and Radiation Protection Authority (ASNR) and Mathieu Lihoreau, an ethologist at the Animal Cognition Research Center (CRCA) of the Toulouse Integrative Biology Center (CBI). Armant is investigating the &lt;strong&gt;ecological effects of ionizing rays&lt;/strong&gt;, particularly on the wildlife and plant life in the contaminated Fukushima area in Japan. Lihoreau, on the other hand, is deeply interested in bee intelligence and the factors that could impair it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two researchers are now collaborating with Japan, using a system developed with the Toulouse-based startup BeeGuard (described below). This involves a concept of a connected hive that allows for &lt;strong&gt;real-time monitoring of the biological activity&lt;/strong&gt; of certain bee species in a radioactive environment. For the scientists, these studies could shed light on bees’ learning and memory capacities and could also be &lt;strong&gt;valuable in ecotoxicology&lt;/strong&gt;. According to Mathieu Lihoreau, &lt;em&gt;“if bees exhibit learning deficits in certain areas, it indicates a problem.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Initial Findings Are Not Encouraging&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scientists believe that &lt;strong&gt;radioactive residues present in nectar&lt;/strong&gt; could impair bees’ cognitive abilities. For instance, the insects might be unable to associate a reward with a color (or scent). Consequently, they might visit flowers of various species instead of focusing on one, thus failing to deliver the correct pollen to the appropriate plants. Over the long term, this could jeopardize the survival of the colonies and, more broadly, the &lt;strong&gt;pollination service crucial to the balance of ecosystems&lt;/strong&gt;. While this remains a hypothesis, similar conclusions exist concerning certain pesticide-laden areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After several tests in the Toulouse region, the connected hive was deployed in Fukushima’s contaminated zone as part of &lt;strong&gt;two field operations in 2023 and 2024&lt;/strong&gt;. The sites were selected based on the soil contamination levels with cesium 137, and local hornets were also included in the cognition study. In the hive, there’s a Y-shaped maze with two paths lit by LEDs of different colors. However, only one of the colors leads to a reward, namely sweet water. According to experts, a healthy bee &lt;strong&gt;needs about ten attempts&lt;/strong&gt; to find the correct path.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, while the study’s results have not yet been published in a scientific journal, the two French researchers are already concerned. Indeed, they have reported &lt;strong&gt;a decline in cognitive performance&lt;/strong&gt; in Fukushima’s contaminated zone. However, although correlations exist, there’s currently no proof of a causal link involving radioactive contamination. Moreover, since the area is now uninhabited, this decline in cognition cannot be attributed to the presence of pesticides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

It seems like everyone is pushing it these days. It's true that our bodies need protein to function, but how much is really necessary and is it possible to go overboard? We asked a doctor and a registered dietitian for the truth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is protein?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Essentially, protein is a chain of amino acids that every cell in your body needs to do its job. “&lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/002467.htm" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Protein;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Protein&lt;/a&gt; is the main building block for our body,” says &lt;a href="https://www.uclahealth.org/providers/zhaoping-li" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Zhaoping Li, M.D., Ph.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Zhaoping Li, M.D., Ph.D.&lt;/a&gt;, the director of the Center for Human Nutrition and the chief of the Division of Clinical Nutrition at the &lt;a href="https://medschool.ucla.edu/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The benefits of protein are seemingly endless. “&lt;strong&gt;Your body uses protein to repair and build muscle tissue, and it's also part of the structure of your bones, cartilage, skin and blood&lt;/strong&gt;,” says &lt;a href="https://samanthacassetty.com/about/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Samantha Cassetty, M.S., R.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Samantha Cassetty, M.S., R.D.&lt;/a&gt;, a nutrition and wellness expert, the founder of Sam’s Plate and co-author of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sugar-Shock-Hidden-Smart-Swaps/dp/1950785009/?tag=syn-yahoo-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5Bartid%7C10055.a.64853473%5Bsrc%7Cyahoo-us" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Sugar Shock;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;Sugar Shock&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. “It also helps &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413120303119" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:produce immune cells;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;produce immune cells&lt;/a&gt; that fight infections.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Protein, carbohydrates and fats are &lt;a href="https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/health/a37305530/macronutrients-and-micronutrients/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:the three macronutrients;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;the three macronutrients&lt;/a&gt; our bodies depend on. However, unlike carbohydrates and fats, protein is not stored in the body, notes Dr. Li. “We have limited protein reserve for a few hours to support our organ system metabolism,” she says. That means we have to eat protein every day to ensure our body has what it needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How much protein do we need?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It gets a little tricky because there’s not a one-size-fits-all number,” says Cassetty. The &lt;a href="https://www.myplate.gov/eat-healthy/protein-foods" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dietary Guidelines for Americans;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Dietary Guidelines for Americans&lt;/a&gt; recommends that women consume 5 to 6.5 ounces of protein foods every day, while men eat 5.5 to 7 ounces daily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A general rule of thumb is to eat.8 grams of protein per kilogram of your body weight every day.&lt;/strong&gt; (That would be about 54 grams for a 150-pound woman.) “Most Americans meet that, but that recommendation is based on the minimum amount needed to prevent deficiency and maintain basic functions — not necessarily the optimal amount to thrive,” says Cassetty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Most experts agree that a higher intake — around 1.2 to 2 grams per kilogram of body weight (that's 82-136 grams for a 150-pound woman)— may be better&lt;/strong&gt; for maintaining muscle mass, managing weight and supporting healthy aging,” Cassetty explains. “Your exact needs depend on things like your age, activity level and goals, but most people would benefit from getting a bit more than the bare minimum.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can you eat too much protein?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There is an upper limit, especially for folks with abnormal kidney function,” says Dr. Li. “But it is generally safe for healthy individuals.” In fact, she says, certain groups of people such as those who have an acute illness, are athletes or are elderly may need more than the general recommendations. &lt;strong&gt;To figure out the ideal amounts for your body, “it is important to see a &lt;a href="https://nbpns.org/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Physician Nutrition Specialist;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Physician Nutrition Specialist&lt;/a&gt; or/and &lt;a href="https://www.eatright.org/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:registered dietitian;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;registered dietitian&lt;/a&gt;,”&lt;/strong&gt; adds Dr. Li.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And remember, maintaining a balanced diet is key, even if you’re on a quest for more protein. “I often see people loading up on protein in ways that crowd out other essential nutrients — especially fiber from plant foods,” says Cassetty. “While protein has many benefits, it’s just one piece of a balanced diet. More than &lt;a href="https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/sites/default/files/2020-12/Dietary_Guidelines_for_Americans_2020-2025.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:90% of Americans;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;90% of Americans&lt;/a&gt; fall short on fiber, so it’s important to zoom out and look at the bigger picture.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the best sources of protein?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cassetty recommends starting with whole foods before reaching for highly processed protein bars and shakes. “You can get it from both animal and plant sources like chicken, fish, eggs, tofu and pulses (such as beans and lentils),” she says. “Some of my go-to easy options include Greek yogurt, cottage cheese, eggs, canned or pouched tuna and salmon, steamed lentils, frozen edamame and canned chickpeas. Frozen shrimp is great, too — it defrosts quickly and cooks fast.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a pinch, she says foods like &lt;a href="https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/health/fitness/g28089471/best-protein-powder/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:protein powder;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;protein powder&lt;/a&gt;, frozen veggie burgers, canned lentil soup and edamame or chickpea pasta can provide protein, but it’s best not to make them everyday staples. “All foods can fit, but they don’t fit equally,” says Cassetty. “Prioritizing whole food sources of protein is a better way to go for your long-term health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 May 2025 05:14:29 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiAFBVV95cUxOSWJVNFhnTGRWSmZIZzU2eVR1N2NjTUViYkJVZ3FraFBVcjZfMWFWV25VQ1FreWdLODIyaXdIY1FidVhoal9tT3RtX0pmYUpfenZLVUpXNUNFWHZqaG5EOW5VOHd6TUpKU0xoSTVsTEc2Z2pWS3BQa1AxRzM5cTNYNzBtOUFRSE9N</guid></item><item><title>感染多达50%人群的寄生虫可使人类精子斩首- ScienceAlert | Parasite Infecting Up to 50% of People Can Decapitate Human Sperm - ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimAFBVV95cUxNTXNKel8zRHlhb1F5NlZsZVhYSzVTWE5KeUtVZDVoQTdYbkJIekwwZEthZU80Z1BkUEh3RGtwUDFXbmNyVnJ6bW51LVp0MF94b1VVZU1OSXZ6a29uUW05aTBlSm9TcU9tQmUya211aWdfMjhHZm9BYV8wbHdNT2FZd1RoY0k5Z3hzbWk4ZjI5djZuQkVYZi1DSQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Male fertility rates have been plummeting &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/humupd/dmac035"&gt;over the past half-century&lt;/a&gt;. An analysis from 1992 noted a steady decrease in sperm counts and quality &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.305.6854.609"&gt;since the 1940s&lt;/a&gt;. A more recent study found that male infertility rates &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-023-16793-3"&gt;increased nearly 80% from 1990 to 2019&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reasons driving this trend remain a mystery, but frequently cited culprits include &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1097/mou.0000000000000745"&gt;obesity, poor diet and environmental toxins&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.fertility-academy.co.uk/blog/7-stis-that-affect-male-fertility/"&gt;Infectious diseases&lt;/a&gt; such as gonorrhea or chlamydia are often overlooked factors that affect fertility in men. Accumulating evidence suggests that a common single-celled parasite called &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/toxoplasmosis/about/index.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma gondii&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; may also be a contributor: An April 2025 study showed for the first time that "human sperm &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/febs.70097"&gt;lose their heads&lt;/a&gt; upon direct contact" with the parasite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am a microbiologist, and &lt;a href="https://medicine.iu.edu/faculty/13502/sullivan-william"&gt;my lab studies &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. This new study bolsters emerging findings that underscore the importance of preventing this parasitic infection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The many ways you can get toxoplasmosis&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Infected cats defecate &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt; eggs into the litter box, garden or other places in the environment where they can be &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1079/ahr2005100"&gt;picked up by humans or other animals&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/foods11162542"&gt;Water, shellfish and unwashed fruits and vegetables&lt;/a&gt; can also harbor infectious parasite eggs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to eggs, tissue cysts present in the meat of warm-blooded animals can spread toxoplasmosis as well if they are not destroyed by &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/people-risk-foodborne-illness/toxoplasma-food-safety-moms-be"&gt;cooking to proper temperature&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 youtube-iframe relative"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HOnhthD3yz4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While most hosts of the parasite can control the initial infection with few if any symptoms, &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt; remains in the body for life as &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1574-6976.2011.00305.x"&gt;dormant cysts in brain, heart and muscle tissue&lt;/a&gt;. These cysts can reactivate and cause additional episodes of severe illness that damage critical organ systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Between &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0090203"&gt;30% and 50% of the world's population&lt;/a&gt; is permanently infected with &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt; due to the many ways the parasite can spread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Toxoplasma can target male reproductive organs&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Upon infection, &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt; spreads to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/pim.12163"&gt;virtually every organ and skeletal muscle&lt;/a&gt;. Evidence that &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt; can also target human male reproductive organs first surfaced &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3755328"&gt;during the height of the AIDS pandemic&lt;/a&gt; in the 1980s, when some patients presented with the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.5812/jjm.7184"&gt;parasitic infection in their testes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While immunocompromised patients are most at risk for testicular toxoplasmosis, it can also occur in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/bcr-2018-224962"&gt;otherwise healthy individuals&lt;/a&gt;. Imaging studies of infected mice confirm that &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt; parasites &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1462-5822.2005.00517.x"&gt;quickly travel to the testes&lt;/a&gt; in addition to the brain and eyes within days of infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="align-center zoomable"&gt;&lt;a href="https://images.theconversation.com/files/669878/original/file-20250522-56-b04lgh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=1000&amp;amp;fit=clip"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" alt="Microscopy image of translucent, two-layers circular blobs" src="https://images.theconversation.com/files/669878/original/file-20250522-56-b04lgh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=237&amp;amp;fit=clip" srcset="https://images.theconversation.com/files/669878/original/file-20250522-56-b04lgh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=600&amp;amp;h=600&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/669878/original/file-20250522-56-b04lgh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=30&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=600&amp;amp;h=600&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/669878/original/file-20250522-56-b04lgh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=15&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=600&amp;amp;h=600&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/669878/original/file-20250522-56-b04lgh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;h=754&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/669878/original/file-20250522-56-b04lgh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=30&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;h=754&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/669878/original/file-20250522-56-b04lgh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=15&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;h=754&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=3 2262w" sizes="(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt; cysts floating in cat feces. (&lt;a class="source" href="https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/toxoplasmosis/index.html"&gt;DPDx Image Library/CDC&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2017, my colleagues and I found that &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt; can also &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/pros.23362"&gt;form cysts in mouse prostates&lt;/a&gt;. Researchers have also observed these parasites in the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.5812/jjm.7184"&gt;ejaculate of many animals&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jinf.2022.10.034"&gt;human semen&lt;/a&gt;, raising the possibility of &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mehy.2020.109725"&gt;sexual transmission&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowing that &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt; can reside in male reproductive organs has prompted analyses of fertility in infected men. A small 2021 study in Prague of 163 men infected with &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt; found that &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/andr.12969"&gt;over 86% had semen anomalies&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 2002 study in China found that &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12479125/"&gt;infertile couples are more likely&lt;/a&gt; to have a &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt; infection than fertile couples, 34.83% versus 12.11%. A 2005 study in China also found that &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16078665"&gt;sterile men are more likely to test positive&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt; than fertile men.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26622295/"&gt;Not all studies&lt;/a&gt;, however, produce a link between toxoplasmosis and sperm quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Toxoplasma can directly damage human sperm&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Toxoplasmosis in animals mirrors infection in humans, which allows researchers to address questions that are not easy to examine in people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Testicular function and sperm production are sharply diminished in &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt;-infected &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0096770"&gt;mice&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.exppara.2023.108571"&gt;rats&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/pathogens9121004"&gt;rams&lt;/a&gt;. Infected mice have significantly lower sperm counts and a higher proportion of &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2020.107573"&gt;abnormally shaped sperm&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that April 2025 study, researchers from Germany, Uruguay and Chile observed that &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt; can reach the testes &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/epididymis"&gt;and epididymis&lt;/a&gt;, the tube where sperm mature and are stored, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/febs.70097"&gt;two days after infection&lt;/a&gt; in mice. This finding prompted the team to test what happens when the parasite comes into direct contact with human sperm in a test tube.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After only five minutes of exposure to the parasite, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/febs.70097"&gt;22.4% of sperm cells were beheaded&lt;/a&gt;. The number of decapitated sperm increased the longer they interacted with the parasites. Sperm cells that maintained their head were often &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/febs.70097"&gt;twisted and misshapen&lt;/a&gt;. Some sperm cells had holes in their head, suggesting the parasites were trying to invade them as it would any other type of cell in the organs it infiltrates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to direct contact, &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt; may also damage sperm because the infection promotes &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/pros.23362"&gt;chronic inflammation&lt;/a&gt;. Inflammatory conditions in the male reproductive tract are &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26913230/"&gt;harmful to sperm production and function&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers speculate that the harmful effects &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt; may have on sperm could be contributing to large global declines in male fertility over the past decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="align-center zoomable"&gt;&lt;a href="https://images.theconversation.com/files/670065/original/file-20250523-56-l81t63.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=1000&amp;amp;fit=clip"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" alt="Series of microscopy images of slightly deformed sperm with holes in their heads" src="https://images.theconversation.com/files/670065/original/file-20250523-56-l81t63.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;fit=clip" srcset="https://images.theconversation.com/files/670065/original/file-20250523-56-l81t63.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=600&amp;amp;h=699&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/670065/original/file-20250523-56-l81t63.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=30&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=600&amp;amp;h=699&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/670065/original/file-20250523-56-l81t63.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=15&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=600&amp;amp;h=699&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/670065/original/file-20250523-56-l81t63.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;h=879&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/670065/original/file-20250523-56-l81t63.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=30&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;h=879&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/670065/original/file-20250523-56-l81t63.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=15&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;h=879&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=3 2262w" sizes="(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Sperm exposed to &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt;.

Testicular toxoplasmosis shows that parasites can invade human testes, but &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.diagmicrobio.2025.116709"&gt;symptomatic disease is very rare&lt;/a&gt;. Studies to date that show defects in the sperm of infected men are too small to draw firm conclusions at this time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, some reports suggest that rates of toxoplasmosis in high-income countries &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pt.2022.10.003"&gt;have not been increasing&lt;/a&gt; over the past few decades while male infertility was rising, so it's likely to only be one part of the puzzle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of this parasite's potential effect on fertility, it is wise to avoid &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt;. An infection can cause miscarriage or birth defects if someone acquires it for the first time during pregnancy, and it can be life-threatening for immunocompromised people. &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt; is also the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/toxoplasmosis/about/index.html"&gt;leading cause of death from foodborne illness&lt;/a&gt; in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taking &lt;a href="https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/23408"&gt;proper care of your cat&lt;/a&gt;, promptly cleaning the litter box and thoroughly washing your hands after can help reduce your exposure to &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt;. You can also protect yourself from this parasite by washing fruits and vegetables, &lt;a href="https://www.foodsafety.gov/food-safety-charts/safe-minimum-internal-temperatures"&gt;cooking meat to proper temperatures&lt;/a&gt; before consuming and avoiding &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1086/605433"&gt;raw shellfish&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/how-does-raw-water-compare-to-tap-water-a-microbiologist-explains-why-the-risks-outweigh-the-benefits-246866"&gt;raw water&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.1982.03330140038029"&gt;raw milk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/256892/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

of offering the “spectacular” drug more widely to men whose disease has not spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Now a team from the US, UK and Switzerland have built an AI test that shows which men would most likely benefit from abiraterone. The “exciting” breakthrough will enable healthcare systems to roll out the drug to more men, and spare others unnecessary treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The AI test is being unveiled in Chicago at the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, the world’s largest cancer conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Nick James, professor of prostate and bladder cancer research at the Institute of &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/cancer" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Cancer&lt;/a&gt; Research in London and a consultant clinical oncologist at the Royal Marsden NHS foundation trust, co-led the team that built it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Abiraterone has already hugely improved the outlook for hundreds of thousands of men with advanced prostate cancer,” said James. “We know that for many men with cancer that has not yet spread, it can also have spectacular results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“But it does come with side-effects and requires additional monitoring for potential issues with high blood pressure or liver abnormalities. It can also slightly increase the risk of diabetes and heart attacks, so knowing who is most likely to benefit is very valuable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“This research shows that we can pick out the people who will respond best to abiraterone, and those who will do well from standard treatment alone – hormone therapy and radiotherapy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The test uses AI to study images of tumours and pick out features invisible to the human eye. The team, funded by Prostate Cancer UK, the Medical Research Council and Artera, trialled the test on biopsy images from more than 1,000 men with high-risk prostate cancer that had not spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The AI test identified the 25% of men in the group most likely to benefit from the abiraterone – for these men, the drug halves the risk of death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In the trial, patients received a score – biomarker-positive or -negative – which was compared with their outcomes. For those with biomarker-positive tumours, one in four of the men, abiraterone cut their risk of death after five years from 17% to 9%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;For those with biomarker-negative tumours, abiraterone cut the risk of death from 7% to 4% – a difference that was not statistically or clinically significant, the team said. These men would benefit from standard therapy alone and be spared unnecessary treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-13" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;skip past newsletter promotion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;aside aria-label="newsletter promotion" class="dcr-av5vqf"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-1xjndtj"&gt;Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SecureSignup" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"newsletterId":"morning-briefing","successDescription":"Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1eusqlu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy Notice: &lt;/strong&gt;Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

However, it has been available for men with this indication in Scotland and Wales for two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Abiraterone costs just £77 per pack, compared with the thousands of pounds that new drugs cost,” said James. “I truly hope that this new research – showing precisely who needs the drug to live well for longer – will lead to NHS England reviewing their decision not to fund abiraterone for high-risk prostate cancer that has not spread.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Dr Matthew Hobbs, director of research at Prostate Cancer UK, described the AI test as “exciting”. He added: “We therefore echo the researchers’ urgent call for abiraterone to be made available to those men whose lives it can save – men who, thanks to this research, we can now identify more precisely than ever before.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Thu, 29 May 2025 23:01:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMivAFBVV95cUxOZy1LcWVVZnFMSlRaWU1NQnRxaGJJRnZOeXFmMHhkRHpXTnJZSVZ3ZzZPbUd0RzctQ3NUMDNhQkVYSUlHV3lzVVd5ZnotQndvV1R6MjA3eFlTZ1B2dzF2WF9ybmxXVEpTeWdFTTZaOEVZaHNvanVnVEZxYWVjay1vTDQwSUE0d1VMS2xJVmNJUUpNVkJkQ3liSDdaOGExcjlxa2pDXzYzd0VKX19DdWVzaHhQWklEbjhlcUZ4OA</guid></item><item><title>根据营养师的说法，您应该吃7种最好的罐头食品，以获得更好的血糖- EatingWell | The 7 Best Canned Foods You Should Be Eating for Better Blood Sugar, According to Dietitians - EatingWell</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibEFVX3lxTE55Mkpnc2FOek1Fc19HLS1KUkZfenBoSGlURXlCTHVyQndoY3p6aFdUSUs4Smp0N0NadGpWbi0tUjJQM0w3aXRRcU50eEh0VW9CLXAtaENDaElJcXZLRXZ1X2JmSkc2YXhBN1ozQw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-callout--summary mntl-sc-block-universal-callout--tips mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-summary callout--bordered" data-text="Key Points" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;
&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Canned foods can be a nutrient-packed option for making blood-sugar-friendly meals and snacks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Canned food high in protein and fiber can help stabilize blood sugar.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Look for low-sodium and no-sugar-added options, rinse if needed and consider store brands.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To support healthy blood sugar levels, it's crucial to focus on what you eat throughout the day. Eating balanced meals and snacks that include nutrient-dense foods with fiber and protein is important for blood sugar management—and canned foods are a convenient way to make this possible. We spoke to nutrition experts to find out which canned foods are best for blood sugar. Here are their top picks.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-1-canned-fish"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 1. Canned Fish &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Canned fish, such as tuna and salmon, are great protein options to keep on hand for managing blood sugar. “Protein slows digestion and increases satiety, or feelings of fullness, which promotes stable blood sugar,” says &lt;a href="https://lilianshepherd.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Lilian Shepherd, RD, CDCES&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian and certified diabetes care and education specialist&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;One 3.5-ounce serving of canned tuna contains 19 grams of protein.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Canned salmon provides about 22 grams of protein per 3.5-ounce serving.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; These fish also pack omega-3 fatty acids, which have been shown to support brain health and may help prevent cognitive decline as you age.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Shepherd suggests having &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/7935164/tuna-salad-with-egg/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Tuna Salad with Egg&lt;/a&gt; for a filling lunch or using canned salmon to make these &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/248780/easy-salmon-cakes/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;Easy Salmon Cakes&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-2-canned-chicken"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 2. Canned Chicken &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Canned chicken is a no-fuss way to add lean protein to many recipes without the need to cook, a great shortcut for recipes that call for shredded or rotisserie chicken.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Canned vegetables are a convenient and affordable way to add more fiber and micronutrients to your diet, and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/274447/fresh-vs-canned-vs-frozen-which-is-better/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;they are just as nutritious as their fresh counterparts&lt;/a&gt;. The fiber in canned veggies slows digestion, helping to prevent blood sugar spikes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Canned veggies are incredibly versatile and can be tossed into casseroles and soups, like this &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/261637/slow-cooker-vegetable-soup/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Slow-Cooker Vegetable Soup&lt;/a&gt;. You can also use them as a simple side dish. Look for low-sodium or no-salt-added options to limit sodium intake.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Having a couple of cans of tomatoes in your pantry is always a good idea. “Canned tomatoes can flavor soups and stews and can be used to make salsa or pasta sauces,” says &lt;a href="https://ontheroadmeals.com/about-1" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Hannah Heredia, M.S., RD&lt;/a&gt;, founder of On the Road Meals. “They are fairly low in carbohydrates and rich in antioxidants like lycopene, which supports heart health."
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Beans are an excellent source of fiber and plant-based protein, and both nutrients are important for maintaining stable blood sugar levels. A 3.5-ounce serving of canned black beans provides about 7 grams of protein and 7 grams of fiber, while 3.5 ounces of canned chickpeas (aka garbanzo beans) provides 7 grams of protein and 6 grams of fiber.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “This combination of protein and fiber slows down glucose absorption and helps maintain steady blood sugar levels throughout the day,” says &lt;a href="https://www.musiccitynutritionandwellness.com/music-city-nutrition-and-wellness-founder-emily-haddock" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Emily Haddock, RD,&lt;/a&gt; a dietitian and owner of Music City Nutrition &amp;amp; Wellness. She also recommends adding canned beans to soups, salads and grain bowls.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Canned pumpkin is rich in fiber, with one 3.5-ounce serving of canned pumpkin puree containing 3 grams of it. Pumpkin also has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties thanks to its high vitamin A content, providing more than 100% of your Daily Value of the nutrient per serving.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Canned fruit is a convenient and affordable option for managing blood sugar. “To reduce added sugar content, opt for canned fruits packed in water or fruit juices rather than syrup, if available,” says &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jessica-barron-ms-rd-ld-831b6843/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Jessica Barron, M.S., RD&lt;/a&gt;, founder of The Red Head RD&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; She also suggests pairing fruit with a food containing fat or protein to manage blood sugar. For example, try adding canned fruit to low-fat Greek yogurt or cottage cheese for a satisfying blood-sugar-friendly snack.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Canned foods can be a healthy and convenient option for managing blood sugar, as long as you know what to look for. Here are some things to consider when stocking your pantry:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Opt for low-sodium or no-salt-added options when possible. While managing blood sugar is the focus, lower sodium intake may also help support healthy blood pressure.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When low-sodium options aren’t available, rinse canned foods under cool running water to reduce sodium.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be mindful of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/whats-the-difference-between-natural-and-added-sugars-11694001" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;added sugars&lt;/a&gt; in canned foods, especially for fruits that are canned in syrup. Look for options with no added sugars or those canned in water or their own juice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check the expiration date. Canned foods have a long shelf life, but they don’t last forever. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t dismiss store brands. There’s a common misconception that store brands are lower quality compared to their branded counterparts. Grocery stores nationwide have affordable canned options, which can allow you to enjoy nutritious fruits and vegetables with less financial strain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A blood-sugar-friendly diet includes fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, legumes, fiber and healthy fats. Combining carbohydrates with protein, fiber and fat slows digestion, mitigating blood sugar swings and leaving you full and satisfied for longer. Here’s how to make the most out of canned foods:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_49-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Canned beans are good for more than chili. Try them in a quick side dish, like our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/259682/broccoli-chickpea-pomegranate-salad/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Broccoli, Chickpea &amp;amp; Pomegranate Salad&lt;/a&gt;. Combine tuna and beans for a fiber-packed lunch or snack with this &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/269012/tuna-white-bean-dill-salad/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Tuna, White Bean &amp;amp; Dill Salad&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you normally use fresh fruits in your smoothies, salads, desserts and parfaits, canned fruits can be a big time and money saver. We also love using canned fruit in recipes like &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/270911/easy-peach-cobbler/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;Easy Peach Cobbler&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/266430/cabbage-tofu-edamame-salad/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;Cabbage, Tofu &amp;amp; Edamame Salad&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have a lackluster salad that’s missing protein? Try adding canned chicken or fish for a protein and flavor boost. Toss in some canned chickpeas for extra protein and fiber. You can also use canned chicken in soups and casseroles the same way as you would use cooked chicken.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_54-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Eating a healthy diet high in protein, fiber and healthy fats is important for healthy blood sugar levels. Canned foods offer convenient, affordable and shelf-stable options, making it easier and quicker to prepare balanced meals and snacks. Add canned vegetables to soups and stews, or serve canned fruits like pineapple or peaches as a healthy dessert. When shopping, look for canned foods without added sugars and excess sodium.

Researchers used EEG and AI to analyze sleep in 40 adults after caffeine or placebo intake, identifying less predictable brain signals and increased wake-like brainwave patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caffeine altered deep sleep rhythms by dampening theta and alpha waves while stimulating beta waves linked to alertness. These effects were most pronounced in 20-somethings, likely due to age-related differences in adenosine receptor density, suggesting younger brains are more vulnerable to caffeine’s nighttime impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sleep Disruption:&lt;/strong&gt; Caffeine reduced slow-wave sleep rhythms and increased beta wave activity, keeping the brain in a more alert state overnight.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Criticality Increase:&lt;/strong&gt; Caffeine pushed the brain into a higher state of complexity, balancing order and chaos, even during sleep.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Age Sensitivity:&lt;/strong&gt; Younger adults (20–27) experienced stronger effects due to higher adenosine receptor density.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Montreal&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Caffeine is not only found in coffee, but also in tea, chocolate, energy drinks and many soft drinks, making it one of the most widely consumed psychoactive substances in the world.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;In a study published in April in &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications Biology&lt;/em&gt;, a team of researchers from Université de Montréal shed new light on how caffeine can modify sleep and influence the brain’s recovery, both physical and cognitive, overnight.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The research was led by Philipp Thölke, a research trainee at UdeM’s Cognitive and Computational Neuroscience Laboratory (CoCo Lab), and co-led by the lab’s director Karim Jerbi, a psychology professor and researcher at Mila – Quebec AI Institute.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Working with with sleep-and-aging psychology professor Julie Carrier and her team at UdeM’s Centre for Advanced Research in Sleep Medicine, the scientists used AI and electroencephalography (EEG) to study caffeine’s effect on sleep.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They showed for the first time that caffeine increases the complexity of brain signals and enhances brain “criticality” during sleep.  Interestingly, this was more pronounced in younger adults.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Criticality describes a state of the brain that is balanced between order and chaos,” said Jerbi. “It’s like an orchestra: too quiet and nothing happens, too chaotic and there’s cacophony.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Criticality is the happy medium where brain activity is both organized and flexible. In this state, the brain functions optimally: it can process information efficiently, adapt quickly, learn and make decisions with agility.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Added Carrier: “Caffeine stimulates the brain and pushes it into a state of criticality, where it is more awake, alert and reactive While this is useful during the day for concentration, this state could interfere with rest at night: the brain would neither relax nor recover properly.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;40 adults studied&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To study how caffeine affects the sleeping brain, Carrier’s team recorded the nocturnal brain activity of 40 healthy adults using an electroencephalogram.  They compared each participant’s brain activity on two separate nights — one when they consumed caffeine capsules three hours and then one hour before bedtime, and another when they took a placebo at the same times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We used advanced statistical analysis and artificial intelligence to identify subtle changes in neuronal activity,” said Thölke, the study’s first author.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The results showed that caffeine increased the complexity of brain signals, reflecting more dynamic and less predictable neuronal activity, especially during the non-rapid eye movement (NREM) phase of sleep that’s crucial for memory consolidation and cognitive recovery.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The researchers also discovered striking changes in the brain’s electrical rhythms during sleep: caffeine attenuated slower oscillations such as theta and alpha waves, generally associated with deep, restorative sleep, and stimulated beta wave activity, which is more common during wakefulness and mental engagement.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“These changes suggest that even during sleep, the brain remains in a more activated, less restorative state under the influence of caffeine,” says Jerbi, who also holds the Canada Research Chair in Computational Neuroscience and Cognitive Neuroimaging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This change in the brain’s rhythmic activity may help explain why caffeine affects the efficiency with which the brain recovers during the night, with potential consequences for memory processing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People in their 20s more affected&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also showed that the effects of caffeine on brain dynamics were significantly more pronounced in young adults between ages 20 and 27 compared to middle-aged participants aged 41 to 58, especially during REM sleep, the phase associated with dreaming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Young adults showed a greater response to caffeine, likely due to a higher density of adenosine receptors in their brains. Adenosine is a molecule that gradually accumulates in the brain throughout the day, causing a feeling of fatigue.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Adenosine receptors naturally decrease with age, reducing caffeine’s ability to block them and improve brain complexity, which may partly explain the reduced effect of caffeine observed in middle-aged participants,” Carrier said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And these age-related differences suggest that younger brains may be more susceptible to the stimulant effects of caffeine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given caffeine’s widespread use around the world, especially as a daily remedy for fatigue, the researchers stress the importance of understanding its complex effects on brain activity across different age groups and health conditions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They add that further research is needed to clarify how these neural changes affect cognitive health and daily functioning, and to potentially guide personalized recommendations for caffeine intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this caffeine, sleep, and neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#fe94d09d918c9a9b9f8bd3999f849f9792929bbe8b9391908a8c9b9f92d09d9f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Julie Gazaille&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://umontreal.ca" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Montreal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Julie Gazaille – University of Montreal&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s42003-025-08090-z" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Caffeine induces age-dependent increases in brain complexity and criticality during sleep&lt;/a&gt;” by Philipp Thölke et al. &lt;em&gt;Communications Biology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Caffeine induces age-dependent increases in brain complexity and criticality during sleep&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caffeine is the most widely consumed psychoactive stimulant worldwide. Yet important gaps persist in understanding its effects on the brain, especially during sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We analyzed sleep electroencephalography (EEG) in 40 subjects, contrasting 200 mg of caffeine against a placebo condition, utilizing inferential statistics and machine learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We found that caffeine ingestion led to an increase in brain complexity, a widespread flattening of the power spectrum’s 1/f-like slope, and a reduction in long-range temporal correlations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being most prominent during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, these results suggest that caffeine shifts the brain towards a critical regime and more diverse neural dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, this was more pronounced in younger adults (20–27 years) compared to middle-aged participants (41–58 years) during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, while no significant age effects were observed during NREM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interpreting these data in the light of modeling and empirical work on EEG-derived measures of excitation-inhibition balance suggests that caffeine promotes a shift in brain dynamics towards increased neural excitation and closer proximity to a critical regime, particularly during NREM sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Thu, 29 May 2025 22:40:04 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibkFVX3lxTFBrTE9DNHZJeWlZZ1lyVElCc1ZCU1YtYXZrMDc5VjV5UDF1dVVuYklHX044cDF3cURSb1gtZjFHcTZtVWZmcnNoMHdtMURpTDY3NWRiX3h0ckxjVHcyeWN2dzcwMUREWlNocGpOWmR3</guid></item><item><title>数百万美国人服用的常见草药补充剂可能与致命的肝损伤有关-雅虎 | Common herbal supplements taken by millions of Americans could be linked to deadly liver damage - Yahoo</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikAFBVV95cUxPTXBidFpySm1YTmNabEJFTE1JS2ZGb0RtUEZSQ2Z3aUswZGx1SEpvU2txeFAwX092OEZpaEJvM1lOSERla2k3aHR0QnV3THBOZHViZmJJUEFRRzdSQWxTeDNnbUo1bmpPSU9VSmZJSnJKcERBaEs0RmQtaDFLeXp6NmdQZ1Q1T2ZpYkFXS0F2M2Q?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="" data-article-body="true"&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Commonly-used herbal and dietary supplements taken by millions of Americans to stay healthy have been tied to a rising number of cases of &lt;a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/independentpremium/uk-news/adults-liver-disorder-over-eating-b2058118.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:liver damage and toxicity;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;liver damage and toxicity&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Supplement-related liver failure that required U.S. patients to be put on a waitlist for a transplant increased by eight times the previous level from 1995 through 2020, according to a 2022 study in the journal &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34331346/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Liver Transplantation;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;em&gt;Liver Transplantation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

But, overuse of some can result in liver damage and toxicity (Getty/iStock)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;So, what are the offending supplements tied to these cases? You may regularly use them in cooking. Many patients take them with the aim of improving their health. The bright yellow spice turmeric is the most commonly consumed in the U.S., according to a study published last year in the journal&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2821951" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:JAMA Network Open;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt; JAMA Network Open&lt;/a&gt;. Black cohosh, red yeast rice, &lt;em&gt;Garcinia cambogia&lt;/em&gt;, and green tea extract were also &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11301549/#:~:text=Turmeric%20or%20curcumin%2C%20green%20tea,the%20general%20population%20are%20unknown." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:identified on a list compiled by researchers;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;identified on a list compiled by researchers&lt;/a&gt; at the University of Michigan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“When you cook with turmeric, that could be really safe. But some of the supplements now are 2,000 milligrams plus, which is a very high dose of turmeric,” Halegoua-De Marzio said, noting that adding black pepper could make the liver “really sick.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Online, many of these supplements are promoted as more natural options than prescription medications. But, they are not subject to the same kind of testing and scrutiny as other drugs. That’s not the only issue. Physicians say insufficient attention in medical screenings and mislabeling are two other problems to be aware of.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“We performed analytical chemistry and found about a 50 percent mismatch between stated ingredients on the label and what they actually contained, which is quite alarming,” Dr. Robert Fontana, a University of Michigan Medicine hepatologist, said in a &lt;a href="https://www.michiganmedicine.org/health-lab/15-million-americans-take-supplements-may-be-toxic-liver" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:statement;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. “If you buy a supplement and it says it has a certain ingredient, it's basically a coin flip if that’s true or not.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://mydoctor.kaiserpermanente.org/mas/news/new-research-on-the-potential-dangers-of-turmeric-supplements-2292932" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Fewer than 40 percent;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Fewer than 40 percent&lt;/a&gt; of patients willingly tell their doctors about the supplements they are taking, according to Kaiser Permanente primary care physician Dr. Crystal Xue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Without the guiding hand of doctors, people who take too much may not realize the risk. New Jersey’s Robert Grafton told NBC News that if he hadn’t been in the medical field, he might have taken more supplements to help him feel better. Instead, following a trip to the hospital, he found out he had a drug-induced liver injury after taking ashwagandha, turmeric pills, and other supplements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taking turmeric and green tea extract is linked to risk, according to University of Michigan researchers. Most users do not take the supplements on the advice of a doctor (Getty/iStock)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Some people are even genetically vulnerable to this kind of damage.

&lt;p&gt;Cases of babesiosis, a rare disease most commonly spread by bites from deer ticks, are growing in Maryland and the mid-Atlantic region, according to a study published in the Journal of Medical Entomology, and so is the range of ticks infected with the parasite that causes the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the idea of a new tick-borne disease to watch out for can be worrisome, researchers are aiming to ensure that residents and health care providers are informed about the illness and its growing threat in the area, especially as summer approaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s not a freak-out issue because we can diagnose it and we have a cure,” said Ellen Stromdahl, an entomologist who worked at the Defense Centers for Public Health’s vector-borne disease laboratory in Aberdeen. “It’s an awareness issue.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="s2nPlayer k-WczsESEJ" data-type="float" data-s2n-api="dfm_stn_player_script_id_WczsESEJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stromdahl was one of nearly two dozen researchers who collected and tested ticks in Maryland, Delaware and Virginia, looking for ones that carried the parasite that causes babesiosis. Less than 3% of the deer ticks researchers tested were found to be infected with the parasite, according to the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maryland’s Eastern Shore and the Baltimore region are hot spots for ticks carrying babesiosis, the study says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people with babesiosis don’t feel sick or have symptoms, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, but some may experience flu-like symptoms such as a fever, chills, sweating, body aches, appetite loss, nausea or fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Symptoms may start a week after being infected, but typically develop over the course of a few weeks or months. The illness can be worse — even life-threatening — for older people or for those who have weakened immune systems.&lt;/p&gt;				
&lt;p&gt;“It’s rare, but if it’s overlooked, the consequences can be really bad,” Stromdahl said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of reported cases of babesiosis in Maryland remains low, though data from the Maryland Department of Health show an increase over the past decade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2023, for instance, there were 29 reported babesiosis cases in Maryland — a jump from seven cases in 2022 and 13 cases in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lyme disease, Maryland’s most common tick-borne illness, is far more prevalent, with 2,463 probable cases reported in 2023. Some symptoms of Lyme disease can be similar to babesiosis, but the two illnesses are treated differently, Stromdahl said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doctors generally prescribe antibiotics for Lyme disease. But if you’re still sick even after taking antibiotics, it may be time to return to the doctor and ask about babesiosis, Stromdahl said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;How to stay safe&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you spend time outside in grassy, bushy or wooded areas, wear long pants and a long-sleeved shirt. When you come inside, check your clothing and body for any ticks. And if you find a tick, remove it quickly using tweezers. You can dispose of the tick by putting it in a sealed bag or submersing it in alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re bitten by a tick, you can save it to show to a doctor, too, Stromdahl said.&lt;/p&gt;

The prolonged dry seasons can extend the periods of high-risk exposure to valley fever. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Valley fever is often misdiagnosed because the symptoms (cough, fever and chest pains) are similar to other infectious diseases, which can make it difficult for health officials to accurately report the number of cases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The number of valley fever cases so far this year is trending toward a new record but public health officials say it’s still &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/science/story/2025-04-25/valley-fever-cases-record-high"&gt;too early in the year to determine&lt;/a&gt; whether this will be a record breaker. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are some precautions to help locals, hikers and tourists in counties with high numbers of reported valley fever cases to avoid the disease this summer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-to-protect-yourself-from-contracting-valley-fever" class="subhead"&gt;How to protect yourself from contracting valley fever&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public health officials in Fresno County, which includes a section of the John Muir Trail, share the following cautionary tips for hikers: &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stay on well-maintained trails and avoid activities that kick up dust such as digging or biking off-path. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Consider wearing a properly fitted N95 mask when hiking in dusty or dry conditions. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Avoid hiking during windy days or right after a disturbance that may increase dust in the air. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Clean any skin wounds well with soap and water, especially if they have been exposed to soil or dust. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;For anyone who lives, works or travels in an area where valley fever fungus grows, the CDC recommends: &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stay indoors when it’s windy outside and the air is dusty. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;On windy days, keep windows and doors closed to prevent dust and possible spores from entering the home. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When driving through a dusty area, keep car windows closed and use recirculating air, if possible.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Before digging, wet down soil and dirt to prevent stirring up dust into the air.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Consider wearing a properly fitted N95 mask if you must be in dusty air outdoors in these areas.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="who-is-at-risk-of-contracting-valley-fever" class="subhead"&gt;Who is at risk of contracting valley fever&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who spend a lot of time outdoors and are exposed to dirt and dust in areas where valley fever is common are more likely to contract the disease, according to the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health. That includes construction workers, farmers, military workers and archaeologists. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who live and work near dry and dusty areas are also at risk of being exposed to valley fever. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who have an increased risk of contracting the disease include: &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Adults 60 years and older.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Those who have diabetes or health conditions that weaken the immune system, which include cancer, HIV, autoimmune illnesses, those with an organ transplant or who are receiving chemotherapy or steroids. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pregnant women, especially those in the later stages of pregnancy. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Children who are 5 years old and younger. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Those who are of Black, Latino, Native American or Filipino decent, although &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/valley-fever/symptoms-causes/syc-20378761" target="_blank"&gt;experts say they don’t have a clear answer&lt;/a&gt; on why these groups of people are more susceptible.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-are-the-symptoms-of-valley-fever" class="subhead"&gt;What are the symptoms of valley fever&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fungus infects the lungs and can cause respiratory symptoms that include:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cough&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fever&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chest pain&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fatigue&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Difficulty breathing &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Muscle or joint pain &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Night sweats &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Weight loss &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rash&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Valley fever shares many of the same symptoms as other respiratory diseases, including COVID-19, it takes about one to three weeks for valley fever symptoms to develop, and the illness can last a month or more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some people with valley fever may experience only mild symptoms that get better in a few weeks so treatment won’t be necessary, according to Los Angeles County public health officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, there are others who will have symptoms that last a month or longer and may need treatment depending on their doctor’s consultation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In rare severe cases, the disease can spread from the lungs to other parts of the body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The disease is usually diagnosed with a blood test. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you test negative for COVID-19 and have respiratory symptoms that last more than a week, and live in or have recently traveled to an area where valley fever is more common, public health officials suggest you talk to a doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because valley fever affects each person differently, treatment will be determined based on the severity of the disease. The disease is often treated with antifungal medications. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Los Angeles Times</author><pubDate>Thu, 29 May 2025 21:26:31 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi7AFBVV95cUxQbnNXeXFkNlREU2lRU1FBR19tWWtVdnNCWU9BS2podkJtMDlwNmFPM2pzVVBKb19oczlrOWMtcS1mN0luWGJNUDVLX0ZBcW5aQ0pvdTdZeHJXejNmTlUwTHJwMzBQZzRMUkJfcl92WHJPTkxfbG1NREJNNE9IZWtJN1hVM05TV0pTQ0MzVGFkN2lJNi1udTFrRi04ci1GX3J4TzljaFVKSzFFbXV1cjFITW5ia3NzLTN2TV9nVE9JVV9Hazh6TUlJV2c2ODY0LUU3TGdNM3JSY2ZDZkI3ZW5tamxEQ3pzZVd3TWp5bg</guid></item><item><title>一名男子在“大脑爆发”后死于蜱传病毒。现在他的家人正在警告其他人- AOL.com | Man Died from Tick-Borne Virus After His ‘Brain Had Blown Up'.

He started experiencing headaches, vomiting and other flu-like symptoms that rapidly progressed. Days later, the 62-year-old collapsed in his home and was rushed to Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston where he was admitted to the intensive care unit. Doctors diagnosed Kevin with Powassan virus, a rare and dangerous tick-borne disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Powassan virus is rare but the number of cases has significantly increased in the past decade. Symptoms include fever, headache, vomiting, weakness, confusion, loss of coordination, difficulty speaking, and seizures. Severe cases can lead to inflammation of the brain (encephalitis) or spinal cord (myelitis). About 10% of these advanced cases are fatal, according to &lt;a href="https://www.yalemedicine.org/conditions/powassan-virus" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Yale Medicine;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Yale Medicine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Erin explained that despite Kevin being treated in the ICU, he ultimately suffered severe brain damage from the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"His brain had blown up so much, from the encephalitis, and he had really bad brain damage," she told &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/boston/news/ticks-massachusetts-powassan-virus/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:CBS News;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;CBS News&lt;/a&gt;. "It was horrifying, but we knew what Kevin would want, so you know, we just had to let him go."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getty&lt;/p&gt; A tick in the palm of a hand&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Never miss a story — sign up for &lt;a href="https://people.com/people-news-daily-newsletter-sign-up-8692701" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:PEOPLE's free daily newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;PEOPLE's free daily newsletter&lt;/a&gt; to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kevin died a few weeks after arriving at the hospital, leaving behind a wife, two sons and a granddaughter. Erin said that she and her family are now hoping that sharing Kevin’s story will encourage others to be cautious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We just want the public to know what to look for and be wary of ticks, especially if you have one on your body," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2024, 54 cases of Powassan virus disease were reported in the United States, with 12 cases reported in Massachusetts.According to the CDC, there are no vaccines to prevent POWV or medicines to treat it. However, a number of precautionary measures can be taken to avoid ticks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To prevent exposure to ticks, according to the &lt;a href="https://magazine.medlineplus.gov/article/understanding-and-preventing-tick-bites" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:National Institutes of Health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;National Institutes of Health&lt;/a&gt;, wear clothing that covers your arms and legs and tuck your pants into your socks or put tape around openings in clothing. Wear light-colored clothing so you can see if a tick is on you. When you are in the woods, keep to the center of the trail, since ticks tend to like shrubs and bushes. Use a chemical repellent with DEET, permethrin or picaridin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After coming indoors, check yourself, children and pets for ticks. If you do find one, use tweezers to remove it as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It takes a week to one month after the bite from an infected tick to develop symptoms of POWV disease, and the virus can be transmitted in as little as 15 minutes after the tick first attaches, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.mass.gov/info-details/powassan-virus" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Massachusetts Department of Health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Massachusetts Department of Health&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A new study found that using margarine may raise the risk of type 2 diabetes by 41%.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Margarine use may also raise the risk of heart disease by 29%.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Using non-hydrogenated products without trans fats may help you avoid health drawbacks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The long-running debate over margarine or butter or other fats has been around for years, and rightfully so. Experts generally agree that trans fats, often found in older forms of margarine, should be avoided due to their link to heart disease.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; But saturated fats, commonly found in butter and other dairy products, remain controversial. While they’ve traditionally been associated with heart risks, some studies have suggested that &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/pasture-raised-cheese-heart-health-11700115" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;dairy fats might actually offer certain health benefits&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  Butter, however, has been noted in some research to increase "bad" LDL cholesterol, though not all studies agree.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Margarine and spreads similar to margarine are made from vegetable oils, which means they typically have less saturated fat than butter. Initially, margarine was believed to be a healthier alternative to butter for heart health and reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). But further research revealed that the trans fats in margarine could negatively impact health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; While regulations in the U.S. have significantly reduced and eventually eliminated industrial trans fats in these products, the levels of trans fats in foods in some other countries remain a concern.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Additionally, oils vary in their &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7595261/whats-the-difference-between-saturated-fat-and-unsaturated-fat/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;mix of unsaturated and saturated fats&lt;/a&gt;, and some margarines contain trans fats if they are partially hydrogenated. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Researchers are still trying to fully understand how long-term consumption of butter, margarine and non-hydrogenated oils (like olive oil) impacts heart disease and diabetes. Current dietary advice suggests limiting saturated fats, but some recent studies indicate that &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8027676/best-dairy-foods-to-eat/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;dairy fat might have certain health benefits&lt;/a&gt;. To learn more, a recent study was conducted to bridge this knowledge gap, and the results were published in the&lt;em&gt; European Journal of Clinical Nutrition&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-was-this-study-conducted"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Was This Study Conducted? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To conduct this study, researchers used data from the Framingham Offspring cohort, involving over 5,000 participants. The Framingham Offspring cohort concluded in 2014 after more than 40 years of data collection. After excluding participants who had certain traits, like having low or high body weights or drinking excessive alcohol intake, the researchers evaluated data from 2,459 subjects. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To gather information about what participants ate, researchers asked them to record everything they consumed over two sets of three days, covering two weekdays and one weekend day. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The analysis looked at three main types of fats people use in cooking and eating:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;Butter, which can come in tub or stick form &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Margarine, which can be full-fat or lower-fat&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Non-hydrogenated oils, such as olive oil, safflower oil, coconut oil, palm oil, soy oil and blends of these. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The researchers investigated potential links between consumption of these foods and cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes risk.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Four years after the final dietary assessment, researchers measured body fat, cholesterol and blood sugar levels to better understand participants' health. Since data from this later exam wasn't fully available, some information, like insulin resistance, was taken from the previous exam. Blood samples, taken after participants fasted overnight, were tested for "good" cholesterol (HDL), "bad" cholesterol (LDL), triglycerides and blood sugar levels using reliable methods. Body mass index (BMI) was also calculated. All of this data was used to track and evaluate various health outcomes over time.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Eating more margarine (around 7 grams or more per day compared to 2 grams or less) was linked to a higher risk of developing heart disease and type 2 diabetes. Specifically, people who consumed more margarine had about a 29% higher chance of heart health problems and a 41% greater chance of developing type 2 diabetes. Oils didn’t appear to affect the risk of developing type 2 diabetes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The findings also indicated that people who consumed the most butter had a 31% &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/mediterranean-diet-diabetes-risk-study-8736965" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt; compared to those who consumed less. Interestingly, both butter and oil seemed to be linked with a lower risk of cardiovascular disease, but the relationship wasn’t straightforward, and it varied depending on the amount consumed. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Eating &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/seeds-oils-inflammation-study-8740767" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;non-hydrogenated oils was linked&lt;/a&gt; to slightly higher levels of body fat, but neither butter nor margarine showed any clear connection to body fat levels. However, when factors like age, sex, body weight, carbohydrate intake and diet quality were considered, people who consumed more butter and non-hydrogenated oils had &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/ways-to-reduce-insulin-resistance-for-better-blood-sugar-8750433" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;lower levels of insulin resistance&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When it came to blood cholesterol levels, butter stood out as the only fat that showed a positive connection with "good" HDL cholesterol, lower triglycerides (a type of fat found in the blood) and a healthier balance between triglycerides and HDL cholesterol. On the other hand, eating more than 7 grams of non-hydrogenated oil per day, compared to 2 grams or less, was linked to higher levels of "bad" LDL cholesterol. For margarine, however, there didn’t seem to be any significant effects on cholesterol or blood fat levels in these analyses.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; An important limitation is that the study participants were mostly white and European, which means the findings may not apply to people from other backgrounds. Additionally, while efforts were made to consider other possible influencing factors, it’s still possible that not all of them were accounted for.  Another limitation of the study is the reliance on self-reported dietary data, which can be prone to inaccuracies and biases, such as underreporting or overestimating food intake. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Furthermore, as the study is based on observational data, it cannot establish a cause-and-effect relationship between the variables, only correlations. Finally, margarine, particularly at the time of the dietary data collection in this study, was more likely to contain industrial trans fats, which may not reflect the effects of margarines available at many retail stores that are free from those fats. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-does-this-apply-to-real-life"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Does This Apply to Real Life? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you are focused on making dietary choices to support your health, understanding these findings can help. For instance, if you're someone who enjoys using butter, this research suggests that moderate consumption might not be as harmful as once feared. Butter’s potential association with &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/284021/5-new-things-to-know-about-cholesterol/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;improved HDL cholesterol and lower triglycerides&lt;/a&gt; may provide some reassurance, especially when balanced with an otherwise healthy diet.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; However, it’s essential to keep portion sizes and overall saturated fat intake in mind, as excess consumption may still have negative health implications. For those looking to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/swap-to-lower-risk-of-heart-disease-and-diabetes-8679543" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;reduce risks of heart disease and type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, using non-hydrogenated oils like olive or safflower oil for cooking might be a better option when prioritizing healthy fats.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For margarine consumers, this study highlights the importance of being mindful about the products you choose. Opting for newer formulations that don’t contain trans fats is crucial, as older or partially hydrogenated margarines are linked to higher risks of heart disease and type 2 diabetes. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_50-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-the-bottom-line"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_51-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; The Bottom Line &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_52-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A new study published in the &lt;em&gt;European Journal of Clinical Nutrition&lt;/em&gt; sheds valuable light on how various fats may impact health. In particular, it found that regular margarine use may raise the risk of diabetes and heart disease. Choosing newer margarine products that are free of trans fats may help you avoid some of those health effects. This study also observed that butter, once widely criticized for its saturated fat content, shows potential benefits when consumed in moderation, particularly its association with improved HDL cholesterol and lower triglyceride levels. Non-hydrogenated oils also appear to be a solid choice for heart health, offering healthier fat profiles, though they do require mindful consumption due to their potential link to higher LDL cholesterol levels.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_53-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_54-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Ultimately, the key takeaway is that balance and informed choices are essential. Rather than demonizing or overly glorifying a single type of fat, focusing on variety and high-quality options may lead to better health outcomes.&lt;br&gt;

Any movement is better than none—&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6547157/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6547157/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="research" data-node-id="13.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="13.1.0"&gt;research&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; shows that walking just 4,400 steps a day can lower your risk of death by 41 percent compared to fewer than 2,700.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="14" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;That said, if your goal is &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/weight-loss/a63333085/how-long-should-i-walk-to-lose-weight/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/weight-loss/a63333085/how-long-should-i-walk-to-lose-weight/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="weight loss" data-node-id="14.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;weight loss&lt;/a&gt;, some structure can help. Walking contributes to your overall calorie burn and helps increase NEAT (non-exercise activity thermogenesis), which refers to the energy you burn outside of structured workouts.

Vary The Terrain&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="20" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;"If you’re really committed to using walking as a key weight loss tool, I would do variable terrains,' she says. “Everything from cross country and hilly walks to beach walks and roads."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="21" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;This will challenge you, as the uneven terrain stimulates different muscles in the ankles, knees, hips and core, she explains. "You can also choose to power it up by walking up a few hills or an incline to work your heart, lungs and your whole body a little more."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="23" class="css-1coetfg emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="23.0"&gt;2. A Brisk Pace Is Best&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="24" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;If you're looking to make the most of your daily walk, personal trainer Scott Laidler, CPT, has some advice on turning it up a notch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="25" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;"If your goal is weight loss, I’d recommend aiming for 5,000-7,000 steps performed at an elevated or brisk pace," Laidler says. Why? Because speeding up your stroll and walking uphill will increase your heart rate—and that’s when you begin to burn calories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="26" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;"When your heart rate reaches upwards of 100-120 bpm, age-dependent, [or roughly 60-70 percent of your maximum heart rate; 220 minus your age], you enter what’s known as the fat-burning zone, where fat is used as your primary energy source," Laidler adds. In other words, you torch cals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="28" class="css-1coetfg emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="28.0"&gt;3.

It said the findings suggest a rapid, potent, and durable immune response. Pre-existing immunity was minimal at baseline, with 2.1% of participants showing hemagglutinin titers at a level considered to correlate with protection. At day 43, which was 3 weeks after the second dose, 97.9% of participants had a 44.5-fold increase in titers from baseline,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Body"&gt;St&lt;span lang="FR"&gt;é&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang="PT"&gt;phane Bancel, MBA, MS, Moderna&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang="AR-SA"&gt;’&lt;/span&gt;s chief executive officer, said, &lt;span lang="AR-SA"&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;While the termination of funding from HHS adds uncertainty, we are pleased by the robust immune response and safety profile observed in this interim analysis of the Phase 1/2 study of our H5 avian flu vaccine and we will explore alternative paths forward for the program.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

RTX is a non-addictive pain therapy derived from a cactus-like plant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;National Institute of Health (NIH) scientists report that a first-in-human clinical trial of a new therapy based on the plant-derived molecule resiniferatoxin (RTX) shows that it is a safe and effective agent for pain control in patients with intractable cancer pain. Researchers tested a single injection of small quantities of RTX into the lumbar cerebral spinal fluid (by lumbar puncture) of advanced-stage cancer patients and found that it reduced their reported worst pain intensity by 38% and their use of pain-relieving opioids by 57%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The effects are immediate,” said Andrew Mannes, M.D., lead study author and chief of the NIH Clinical Center Department of Perioperative Medicine. “This is a potential new therapy from a new family of drugs that gives people with severe cancer pain an opportunity to return some normality to their lives.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trial enrolled research participants with terminal end-stage cancer who were among the 15% of cancer patients unable to find pain relief from standard of care pain interventions, including vast quantity of opiates without relief.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A single injection of RTX provided patients durable relief. Patients’ need for pain-relieving opioids declined sharply, and their quality of life improved. They no longer needed to spend significant periods being sedated with opioids and after treatment were able to reengage with their family, friends and communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The NIH scientists believe RTX has potential to treat many other pain conditions, including other types of cancer pain, chronic pain from nerve injuries called neuromas, post-surgical pain, a facial pain condition called trigeminal neuralgia, and chronic oral inflammatory problems following head and neck radiation therapy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Targeting specific nerves brings many pain disorders into range of RTX and allows physicians to tailor the treatment to the patient’s pain problem. This interventional approach is a simple path to personalized pain medicine,” said senior study author Michael Iadarola, PhD, a senior research scientist in the NIH Clinical Center Department of Perioperative Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RTX is not addictive and doesn’t cause a high. Instead, it prevents pain signals from reaching the brain by inactivating a specific sub-group of nerve fibers which transmit heat and pain signals from damaged tissue. RTX is an activator of the transient receptor potential vanilloid 1, or  TRPV1 ion channel and a super-potent equivalent of capsaicin, the active molecule in hot peppers. The ability of RTX to open the channel pore in TRPV1 allows an overload of calcium to flood into the nerve fiber and block its ability to transmit pain signals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Basically, RTX cuts the pain-specific wires connecting the body to the spinal cord, but leaves many other sensations are intact,” Iadarola said. “These TRPV1 neurons are really the most important population of neurons that you want to target for effective pain relief.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iadarola’s contributions have led decades of basic science research into the neurobiology of pain and pain control. That body of research has informed them that to effectively block pain, you must block it from getting into the spinal cord and from there having it leave the spinal cord to transit to the brain, where we perceive pain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike other current approaches that use heat, cold, chemicals, or surgery to non-selectively interrupt nerves to stop pain, RTX targets the specific sensory pathways of tissue damage pain and heat. Other sensory pathways, such as touch, pin prick, pressure, muscle position sense (known as proprioception), and motor function, remain intact. It is not a generalized numbing as occurs with local anesthetics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What makes this unique from all the other things that are out there is this is so highly selective,” Mannes said. “The only thing it seems to take out is heat sensation and pain.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RTX is derived from the &lt;em&gt;Euphorbia resinifera&lt;/em&gt; plant, a cactus-like plant native to North Africa. Euphorbia extract has been known for 2,000 years to contain an “irritant” substance, which NIH scientists identified how to use for patients through basic research on living cells observed through a microscope. Adding RTX to TRPV1-containing cells caused a visible calcium overload, which Iadarola and Mannes eventually translated into an early-stage human clinical trial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next steps include additional, larger clinical trials to move RTX toward eventual approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and clinical availability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This research was supported by the Intramural Research Program of the NIH Clinical Center and NIH’s National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the National Institutes of Health (NIH):&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Taurine, a common ingredient in energy drinks and supplements, was found to fuel the growth of aggressive leukemia cells.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Leukemia cells use a specific transporter protein to absorb taurine, and certain cells in the body — including those in the bones, brain, and heart — are capable of producing taurine naturally.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Research shows that inhibiting taurine production or its uptake by cancer cells slowed leukemic progression, indicating a potential new treatment strategy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It seems that energy drinks are everywhere. The U.S. energy drink market alone &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/even-better/360940/energy-drinks-health-risks-caffeine-celsius-monster-red-bull-panera-charged-lemonade-taurine-guarana-arrhythmia" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;grew by 73%&lt;/a&gt; between 2018 to 2023 and was valued at a staggering &lt;a href="https://store.mintel.com/report/us-energy-drinks-market-report" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;$23.9 billion in 2024&lt;/a&gt;. However, a new study published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09018-7" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="3" rel="nofollow"&gt;Nature&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;provides compelling evidence that, in certain circumstances, taurine, the common ingredient that gives those drinks their kick, could be fueling more than just your afternoon energy.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In May, researchers from the University of Rochester published their findings on taurine and its role in driving the growth of aggressive forms of leukemia.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The team behind the study, led by researchers at the University of Rochester, discovered that taurine doesn’t just get digested when you drink it or take it in supplements. Instead, certain cells in our bones, brain, heart, and muscles can also actively produce it (and it is often found in &lt;a href="https://www.webmd.com/diet/foods-high-in-taurine" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;fish and meat as well&lt;/a&gt;). In individuals with leukemia, taurine appears to stimulate the multiplication of cancer cells.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To understand why, it helps to know a little about how blood cancers like leukemia flourish in the body. Leukemia, the &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/types/leukemia/patient/adult-aml-treatment-pdq" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;National Cancer Institute explains&lt;/a&gt;, often starts with a small number of damaged stem cells in the bone marrow, which is also where your blood is produced. These cancer stem cells can grow uncontrollably and &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/acute-myeloid-leukemia/about/what-is-aml.html" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;hinder the body&lt;/a&gt; from producing the red and white blood cells it needs. Furthermore, this new study shows that those leukemia cells may be nourished by the taurine your body already produces. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The researchers discovered that as leukemia progresses, certain cells in human bone marrow begin producing more taurine, as the cancer cells absorb it through a specific protein known as TauT, which stands for taurine transporter. This taurine can assist the cancer cells in generating energy more efficiently, potentially causing them to grow at an accelerated rate.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; However, in mouse models, when the researchers blocked either the production of taurine in the bone or the cancer cells’ ability to absorb it, the growth of leukemia slowed. The mice with leukemia lived longer, and their cancer spread less quickly, indicating a potential new pathway for treating this disease.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "We are very excited about these studies because they demonstrate that targeting uptake by myeloid leukemia cells may be a possible new avenue for treatment of these aggressive diseases,” Jeevisha Bajaj, an assistant professor in the Department of Biomedical Genetics at the University of Rochester, and lead author of the study, &lt;a href="https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/news/story/a-downside-of-taurine-it-drives-leukemia-growth" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;shared&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It's essential to understand that this study does not state or imply that energy drinks and supplements will cause cancer in any way. However, it found that when the mice with leukemia were given additional taurine, similar to what you would consume in energy drinks, the cancer progressed significantly faster.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It's also important to remember that taurine has been shown in early-stage studies to be potentially helpful for people &lt;a href="https://journals.lww.com/cancerjournal/fulltext/2015/11020/effect_of_taurine_on_attenuating.35.aspx#:~:text=by%20taurine%20supplementation.-,CONCLUSION,drug%20reactions%20for%20the%20patients." data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;undergoing chemotherapy&lt;/a&gt;, as it could help mitigate side effects like nausea. Additionally, other studies have also shown that taurine couldmight have the potential to &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674%2824%2900303-9" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;combat gastric cancers&lt;/a&gt; in the stomach.
&lt;/p&gt;

The World Health Organization said Wednesday the rise in cases is primarily in the eastern Mediterranean, Southeast Asia and western Pacific regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Airport screening in the United States has detected the new variant in travelers arriving from those regions to destinations in California, Washington state, Virginia and New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new variant is called NB.1.8.1. It arrives as the United States’ official stance on COVID-19 vaccination is changing. On Tuesday, Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced that COVID-19 shots are no longer recommended for healthy children and pregnant women — a move immediately questioned by several public health experts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new variant, increasing globally, had by mid-May reached nearly 11% of sequenced samples reported. The WHO has designated it a “variant under monitoring” and considers the public health risk low at the global level with current vaccines expected to remain effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The WHO said some western Pacific countries have reported increases in COVID cases and hospitalizations, but there’s nothing so far to suggest that the disease associated with the new variant is more severe compared to other variants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The variant called LP.8.1 is currently the dominant version in the U.S. and globally. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

The findings show that individuals with Alzheimer’s who used SSRIs had lower levels of tau protein in the blood and showed restored activity in a brain region typically impaired by the disease. However, their performance on standard cognitive tests varied depending on the specific measure used.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease is a progressive neurological condition that leads to memory loss, behavioral changes, and ultimately, a loss of independence. One of the main drivers of Alzheimer’s progression is the accumulation of a protein called tau, which forms tangled clumps inside neurons and interferes with their function. Tau pathology is strongly linked to cognitive decline, and researchers have long sought ways to reduce or slow its buildup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SSRIs are a class of antidepressants commonly prescribed to treat major depressive disorder and anxiety. They work by increasing levels of serotonin, a neurotransmitter that affects mood, sleep, and cognition. The serotonergic system has also been implicated in Alzheimer’s disease, as some of the earliest signs of tau pathology appear in a serotonin-producing brain region known as the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN). This brainstem region plays a key role in regulating serotonin levels throughout the brain, and its dysfunction is thought to contribute to both depression and Alzheimer’s symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given this link, researchers set out to examine whether long-term SSRI use could influence Alzheimer’s pathology, brain metabolism, and cognitive outcomes. They drew on data from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), a large multi-site study that collects medical, cognitive, and imaging data from people at various stages of cognitive health. The analysis included 191 adults, all of whom had baseline brain scans using 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography, a tool that measures glucose metabolism in brain tissue. Participants also provided blood samples and underwent cognitive testing over a two-year period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To explore the effects of SSRIs, the researchers divided participants into those who had a documented history of SSRI use and those who did not. They excluded individuals who had ever used other types of antidepressants to isolate the effects of SSRIs. The participants were categorized as cognitively normal or diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease based on clinical assessments and standard diagnostic criteria. In the group with Alzheimer’s, 65 participants had used SSRIs, while 92 had not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the primary markers the researchers looked at was phosphorylated tau 181 (p-tau181), a form of tau protein found in the bloodstream that reflects tau accumulation in the brain. Among participants with Alzheimer’s disease, those who used SSRIs had significantly lower levels of plasma p-tau181 compared to non-users. This difference was not observed in cognitively healthy individuals, suggesting that the potential benefit of SSRIs in reducing tau may be specific to those with Alzheimer’s pathology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, the researchers examined how SSRIs affected brain metabolism, focusing on the DRN. In individuals with Alzheimer’s who did not use SSRIs, this brain region showed significantly reduced metabolic activity—an indication of impaired function. In contrast, those with Alzheimer’s who used SSRIs displayed restored activity in the DRN, with glucose metabolism levels similar to those of healthy participants. Interestingly, this effect was not seen in healthy participants who used SSRIs, suggesting that the drug’s impact on DRN function may be specific to disease-related changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team also looked at how SSRI use affected cognitive performance using three standard assessments: the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) sum of boxes. Across the two-year follow-up, MMSE scores declined in all participants with Alzheimer’s, regardless of SSRI use, indicating ongoing cognitive deterioration. However, MoCA scores were slightly higher among SSRI users, suggesting some preservation of certain cognitive functions. CDR scores, which assess the severity of dementia symptoms, increased over time in both groups, with a slightly greater increase in SSRI users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One unexpected finding was that the relationship between MMSE and MoCA scores shifted in those who used SSRIs. Normally, these two assessments are closely correlated because they measure overlapping aspects of cognition. But in SSRI users, this correlation broke down, possibly pointing to selective effects of the drug on certain cognitive domains or a shift in how these domains are measured. The researchers suggest that future studies should include more specific cognitive tests to determine which areas are most affected by SSRI use in Alzheimer’s patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the results are promising, the study has several limitations. The researchers were unable to assess the impact of different SSRI types, dosages, or treatment durations due to sample size constraints. They also could not account for other factors that may influence Alzheimer’s progression, such as co-occurring medical conditions, additional medications, or the timing of SSRI initiation relative to the onset of Alzheimer’s symptoms. Because the study was cross-sectional, it also cannot confirm whether SSRI use causes reductions in tau or improved DRN function, or whether people who benefit from SSRIs in these ways are simply more likely to have used them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite these caveats, the findings provide new insights into how a widely used class of antidepressants may influence biological and functional aspects of Alzheimer’s disease. The study supports the idea that SSRI use is associated with lower levels of tau-related pathology and improved activity in a serotonin-rich brain region that plays an early role in disease development. However, the benefits for cognitive performance remain uncertain and may vary depending on how cognition is measured.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future research will need to clarify whether starting SSRI treatment at specific stages of Alzheimer’s progression offers more benefit, and whether certain subtypes of patients are more likely to respond positively. Longitudinal studies that follow people over time while tracking tau levels, brain function, and detailed cognitive outcomes could help answer these questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/alz.14579" target="_blank"&gt;SSRIs reduce plasma tau and restore dorsal raphe metabolism in Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Dylan J.

              &lt;p&gt;One of the world’s oldest diseases has an even more complex history than expected. Research out today reveals that a form of leprosy was stalking people in the Americas long before Europeans arrived.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A large international team of scientists conducted the study, &lt;a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adu7144"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; Thursday in Science. The researchers found DNA evidence of &lt;em&gt;Mycobacterium lepromatosis&lt;/em&gt;—a recently discovered species of leprosy-causing bacteria—infecting people in North and South America over 1,000 years ago, predating European colonization. The findings upturn the prevailing belief that Europeans were responsible for leprosy’s introduction to the New World.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/leprosy"&gt;Leprosy’s&lt;/a&gt; reputation for human destruction is so notorious that it’s repeatedly referenced in the Bible (some of these references might have been about &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17516561/"&gt;other conditions&lt;/a&gt;, though). These bacteria can cause a chronic infection of our skin and nerve cells, though it may take years for symptoms like lesions and sores to appear. If not treated with antibiotics, the infection can progressively and permanently damage these cells, leading to lifelong disabilities and other serious complications.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Leprosy, also called Hansen’s disease, is primarily caused by &lt;em&gt;Mycobacterium leprae&lt;/em&gt; bacteria. But in 2008, scientists &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19019760/"&gt;discovered&lt;/a&gt; that a similar species, &lt;em&gt;M. lepromatosis&lt;/em&gt;, can cause it, too. Leprosy from &lt;em&gt;M. lepromatosis&lt;/em&gt; appears to be rarer than the former, with cases predominantly found in North and South America. And we know very little about it, partly because both species aren’t easy to culture in the lab (much like viruses, leprosy-causing bacteria can only replicate by hijacking our cells from the inside).&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Study author Nicolas Rascovan, who specializes in the evolution of human diseases, and his team decided to take a closer look at the bacteria after making a discovery of their own.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Our interest began when we unexpectedly detected &lt;i&gt;M. lepromatosis&lt;/i&gt; DNA in the remains of an ancient individual in North America,” Rascovan, a researcher at the Pasteur Institute in Paris, France, told Gizmodo. “That prompted us to ask how long this pathogen had been circulating in the continent, how much spread there was before European contact, and what diversity it might still hold today.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The team analyzed hundreds of samples collected from modern-day people (mostly recent leprosy patients), as well as ancient DNA samples recovered from people in the Americas before European contact. Three of these ancient samples tested positive for the bacteria, the researchers found, from people living in what’s now Canada and Argentina.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“Leprosy has long been considered a disease brought to the Americas by Europeans, which is true for the case of &lt;i&gt;M. leprae&lt;/i&gt;. But our study shows that at least one of the two species that causes it—&lt;i&gt;M. lepromatosis&lt;/i&gt;—was already here centuries earlier, and probably evolved locally for thousands of years,” Rascovan explained. “This essentially changes how we understand the disease’s history in the Americas.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thanks to antibiotics and improved sanitation, leprosy is rare in much of the world (only about 200 cases are &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/leprosy/about/index.html"&gt;documented&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S. every year). But it remains a public health issue in some countries, with more than 200,000 cases &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/leprosy" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; annually globally. And the researchers’ findings may complicate both the past and future of leprosy.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;While most modern cases of &lt;em&gt;M. lepromatosis&lt;/em&gt; were linked to one specific lineage, or clade, of the bacteria that has recently expanded, the team also identified older clades that have likely been evolving independently in the Americas for over 9,000 years. That suggests these bacteria have been hiding out in still mysterious animal hosts (in the U.S. the classic form of leprosy has &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/so-whats-going-on-with-leprosy-in-florida-1850696205"&gt;sometimes been linked to armadillo exposure&lt;/a&gt;). And though &lt;i&gt;M.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;em&gt;leprae &lt;/em&gt;still causes the majority of leprosy cases worldwide, its less famous cousin certainly has the potential to become a bigger threat.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Given its diversity and spread, &lt;i&gt;M. lepromatosis&lt;/i&gt; could be an emerging pathogen with dynamics different from &lt;i&gt;M. leprae&lt;/i&gt;,” Rascovan said.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As is often the case in science, the team’s work has raised even more questions for them to answer. They’re hoping to unearth the animal reservoirs where the bacteria have potentially been circulating all this time, for instance, and to trace its journey from the Americas to other parts of the world. They now believe that a strain of &lt;i&gt;M. lepromatosis&lt;/i&gt; was brought over to the British Isles sometime in the 19th century, where it still infects red squirrels today. But we’re still in the dark about how it reached Asia, where cases have been documented.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“All of this suggests that this is not just a neglected disease, but a neglected pathogen—one whose history and spread are only now beginning to be understood,” Rascovan said.&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

Methyl adaptogens are natural compounds found in plant-based foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="article-im-prompt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The foods that researchers found decreased epigenetic age are green tea, oolong tea, turmeric, rosemary, garlic and berries. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 hmmOgn sc-482ou5-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="3" class="sc-482ou5-0 kUZVxN"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/05/28/20/30/GettyImages-2207856700.jpg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/05/28/20/30/GettyImages-2207856700.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/05/28/20/30/GettyImages-2207856700.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="A new study has revealed six foods men can eat to slow aging, and they are all plant-based" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-482ou5-1 kJMYuf" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-2586"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 bpFomM hgzWpY"&gt;A new study has revealed six foods men can eat to slow aging, and they are all plant-based&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 CXMrn"&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Typically, morning is the best time to poop for most people.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You can train your body to poop in the morning with a few key tactics.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The most important thing is that you're pooping regularly and completely.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Whether you call it poop, No. 2 or a bowel movement, it’s about time we got more comfortable talking about it. As the kids’ book taught us: &lt;em&gt;Everyone Poops&lt;/em&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Our stool can share secrets about everything from our fiber and water intake to the potential presence of an infection or disease. How much, how often and the &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/292275/what-the-appearance-of-your-poop-can-tell-you-about-your-health/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;appearance of our poop&lt;/a&gt; can offer a robust window into our internal health.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While we know that the “&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8047475/how-often-should-you-poop/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;normal” frequency for pooping&lt;/a&gt; ranges from twice per day to three times per week, we also wanted to find out if there was a best time of day to poop. So, we tapped two gastroenterologists to help us get to the bottom of this question.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-is-there-a-best-time-to-poop"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Is There a Best Time to Poop? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; We’ll cut to the chase: There’s not necessarily a “best” time of day to poop, admits &lt;a href="https://theplantfedgut.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Will Bulsiewicz, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, a Charleston, South Carolina-based gastroenterologist, owner of The Plant-Fed Gut and the author of &lt;em&gt;Fiber Fueled&lt;/em&gt;. Far more important than the exact time is a consistent time. “Similar to nearly all other life on this planet, our body functions on a rhythm that aligns with the rise and fall of the sun. Rhythm is important,” says Bulsiewicz. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Our post-meal metabolic response, sleep quality and gut health are all impacted by our body’s natural rhythms. “When our gut is in rhythm, we are having good, complete and regular bowel movements that are satisfying. Having an irregular gut rhythm compromises our bowel motility [the movement of food and waste through the digestive system] and our gut microbiome. This may manifest with chronic constipation or irritable bowel syndrome,” explains Bulsiewicz.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Since this rhythm is so critical, Kenneth Brown, M.D., a gastroenterologist in Plano, Texas, and the host of the &lt;em&gt;Gut Check Project &lt;/em&gt;podcast, says that certain times of day tend to be better than others in terms of setting a stool schedule. “In general,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;in the morning, shortly after waking up&lt;strong&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt; tends to be the best time to poop for most individuals,” says Brown.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There are three main reasons why morning may be best:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your circadian rhythms.&lt;/strong&gt; As we mentioned, our bodies operate on a 24-hour internal clock called our circadian rhythms, which regulates various physiological processes, including digestion. The colon tends to be more active during the day, with peak activity occurring in the morning.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Simultaneously, our body experiences a rise in natural cortisol levels&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;in the A.M., which can stimulate bowel movements, adds Brown.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You fasted overnight.&lt;/strong&gt; “During sleep, our digestive system is relatively inactive, allowing the colon to accumulate stool,” says Brown. Bulsiewicz adds that this is a good thing, because it would be a drag having to wake up at night to poop. The colon fills up overnight, then in the morning, things pick back up, making morning a great time to have a bowel movement, both doctors agree. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The gastrocolic reflex kicks in. &lt;/strong&gt;“After eating or drinking, our stomach stretches, triggering a physiological response called the gastrocolic reflex. This reflex stimulates the colon to contract and move its contents forward, leading to a bowel movement,” explains Brown. The morning is when this reflex is often the strongest, especially after we &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7988280/should-you-be-drinking-water-first-thing-in-the-morning/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;down that first glass of water&lt;/a&gt; and fuel up with breakfast (preferably &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-breakfast-foods-to-help-you-poop-that-arent-oatmeal-8708873" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;one that helps you poop&lt;/a&gt;!).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-8-factors-that-can-impact-how-often-and-when-you-poop"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 8 Factors That Can Impact How Often and When You Poop &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; 1. Diet &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The simple act of eating, especially consuming a high-fiber meal, stimulates our intestines into action, says Bulsiewicz.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Other dietary factors also come into play. “Maintaining &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/healthiest-habit-to-do-before-9-am-11719250" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;adequate hydration&lt;/a&gt; is crucial for soft, easy-to-pass stools. Dehydration can lead to the colon absorbing more water from stool, resulting in harder, drier stools and potential constipation,” says Brown.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Caffeine, alcohol and other substances can boost bowel movements by stimulating colon contractions and increasing gut motility, while a diet that’s high in processed foods and low in fiber can contribute to constipation, adds Brown.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; 2. Physical Activity &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Get going—and your gut will, too. “While we’re actually engaged in cardiovascular exercise, our gut motility typically slows down temporarily, only to rebound when we stop exercising,” says Bulsiewicz. “Exercise stimulates motility, which can help you have a bowel movement. When you move, your bowels move."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The reverse is also true: Lack of physical activity can slow gut motility and contribute to &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8030662/normal-reasons-youre-constipated/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;constipation&lt;/a&gt;. Prolonged sitting can also place undue pressure on the rectum. According to Brown, over time, this can weaken the muscles involved in pooping. And those muscles need to function well for a full, complete BM.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; 3. Traveling &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In a 2024 Instagram post, Bulsiewicz clued us in about the &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8013627/reasons-why-you-cant-poop-when-traveling/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;5 reasons why you can't poop when traveling&lt;/a&gt;. This is a common challenge, the doctors agree, due to the way time zone shifts affect our circadian rhythms, changes in diet and water intake, increased stress and the possibility of less activity while traveling (those tarmac delays and long flights are brutal for more than one reason).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; 4. Stress &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; More than 1 in 3 American adults report experiencing “completely overwhelming” amounts of stress on most days, according to a 2023 Stress in America survey by the American Psychological Association.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  This is messing with our perspective on the world, of course, as well as how often and when we poop. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;“&lt;/strong&gt;Stress and anxiety impact the gut-brain axis, leading to alterations in bowel habits. Stress can increase colon contractions, causing diarrhea &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; reduce gut motility, resulting in constipation,” says Brown.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; How your gut reacts to stress depends on your own physiology and the hormones your body pumps out (like cortisol or adrenaline) when you’re feeling flustered.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; 5. Certain Health Conditions &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Besides those mental challenges, other health issues can affect bowel movements, including inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/ibs-symptoms-8654975" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)&lt;/a&gt;, celiac disease, hypothyroidism, diabetes and neurological disorders like Parkinson’s disease or multiple sclerosis, says Brown. These medical conditions can increase or decrease the frequency with which you poop.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Over-the-counter meds like laxatives and stool softeners are designed to enhance bowel movements or facilitate easier stool passage. Other prescriptions, including some antidepressants, as well as certain narcotics, including opioids, may lead to constipation, since they reduce intestinal secretions and slow gut motility, according to Brown. If you’ve started a new medication and notice that your bathroom habits have changed, talk to a health care provider—they may be able to adjust your medication or provide recommendations to help get things moving.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_50-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; 7. Pregnancy &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_51-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Carrying a kiddo stacks the deck against regularity. A growing fetus places pressure on the rectum, potentially hindering bowel movements. In addition, “Pregnancy-related hormonal shifts can reduce gut motility, causing constipation,” says Brown. “Increased progesterone levels can relax digestive tract muscles, hindering stool movement through the colon."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_52-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_53-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; 8. Aging &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_54-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Our digestive system naturally slows down as we age, leading to less frequent bowel movements, explains Brown. Most of us start to move a little less as we get up there in years, and as already mentioned, lower levels of activity make people of any age more likely to poop less frequently. Plus, with age, all of our muscles—including those in the colon and rectum—generally weaken. This can increase the risk of constipation. And, according to Brown, our nerves become less sensitive, too, including those within the rectum, making it challenging to sense the urge for a bowel movement.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_57-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Fine-tuning your lifestyle can help you poop comfortably and like clockwork. Remember that everyone will respond differently to the following adjustments, and if you’re dealing with diarrhea or constipation for more than two weeks&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;(or if either are painful or severe for shorter times than that), talk to a health care provider.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_58-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_59-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To stay more regular, follow these expert-approved tips:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_60-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_61-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Create consistent morning habits. &lt;/strong&gt;This starts with a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7921626/what-i-did-for-one-week-for-better-sleep/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;good night’s rest&lt;/a&gt;, maintaining a regular sleep-and-wake schedule and allowing your body to charge up with some outdoor light exposure soon after you rise, recommends Bulsiewicz. As part of this kick-start, consider a cup of morning Joe, since coffee can help stimulate a bowel movement. “Pair this with a high-fiber breakfast to set yourself up for success," says Bulsiewicz. Doing this every day helps to synchronize your body's internal clock with your digestive system, prompting more regular bowel movements, adds Brown.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Take time to train your body to poop in a timely manner. &lt;/strong&gt;Morning is often the most natural time for our bowels and our personal preferences (we don’t know about you, but &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7836695/why-your-body-only-wants-to-poop-at-home-according-to-a-doctor/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;pooping at the office&lt;/a&gt; is not our fave). And get this—you can actually “coach” your colon into being about as predictable as your alarm clock. “Teach your body to poop at a specific time by sitting on the toilet for five minutes after you have your morning coffee and breakfast,” says Bulsiewicz. Once there, don’t strain or force it, and if after five minutes you’re not actively pooping, get up and leave. “But if you repeat this process a few days in a row, your body will recognize that you’re trying to poop at that time and will help you make it possible,” he adds.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-sc-block-adslot-inline"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Engage in regular physical activity. &lt;/strong&gt;Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise most days of the week. Brisk walking, cycling, swimming, dancing, playing tennis or hiking all count. Then try to sneak in a few more physical activity “snacks” throughout the day by taking the stairs instead of the elevator or heading out for a two- to five-minute walk after meals. The latter can be a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7998411/walking-after-meals-lower-blood-sugar-science/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;boon for your blood sugar&lt;/a&gt;, too!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aim to meet your fiber quota each day. &lt;/strong&gt;Fiber in general adds bulk to the stool, making it easier to pass through the colon. The 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for America promote eating about 30 grams of fiber per day, depending on age and sex.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; If you’re not quite hitting that mark, gradually increase your fiber intake to avoid &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8048994/does-fiber-make-you-gassy/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;bloating and gas&lt;/a&gt;. Fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts and seeds are all solid sources.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stay hydrated. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7948091/why-drinking-water-all-day-long-is-not-the-best-way-to-stay-hydrated/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="5"&gt;No need to chug&lt;/a&gt;, but try to &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7825445/how-much-water-should-you-drink-by-the-numbers/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="6"&gt;drink plenty of water&lt;/a&gt; and feast on &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/17576/8-hydrating-foods-to-help-you-meet-your-water-goals/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="7"&gt;hydrating foods&lt;/a&gt; throughout the day. “Sufficient hydration is crucial for maintaining soft, easy-to-pass stools,” says Brown. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-sc-block-adslot-inline"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Seek out stress-relievers. &lt;/strong&gt;“By &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/ways-to-relieve-stress-in-10-minutes-8739935" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="8"&gt;managing stress&lt;/a&gt; and practicing relaxation techniques, you can regulate bowel movements and promote a sense of calm,” says Brown. Near the toilet, try to foster a relaxing environment when using the bathroom (a pretty painting or a plant can’t hurt) and avoid rushing or straining during bowel movements.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consider a magnesium supplement. &lt;/strong&gt;Bulsiewicz suggests that after all of these steps, if you find that you struggle with constipation on any level, ask your doctor if a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-nutrient-for-constipation-recommended-by-gastroenterologist-8419895" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="9"&gt;magnesium supplement&lt;/a&gt; might be a good fit for you. “Typically magnesium oxide, sulfate or citrate are good for stimulating a bowel movement, and the ideal time to take them for a healthy morning poo is before bed. Magnesium is also helpful for sleep,” says Bulsiewicz.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_62-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_63-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “The most important thing is that you poop with adequate regularity to keep things from backing up. Although a daily bowel movement may be a great way to accomplish this, it’s not a requirement to achieve my goal of adequate regularity,” says Bulsiewicz. “Additionally, there are many, many people who poop everyday and are still constipated. If you’re not completely emptying, then a small little daily nugget may not be adequate! So for me, I’m more interested in making sure it’s adequate rather than rigidly adhering to a specific frequency."

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_64-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_65-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If your typical “normal” has changed and you’re suddenly pooping way more or less or the consistency is radically different, those are all cues to talk to a health care practitioner to make sure everything is good with your gut and overall health.

&lt;p&gt;Regular bowel movements, no matter what time of day they occur, play a vital role in maintaining gut health and preventing issues like constipation or fecal impaction, according to Brown. While our bodies are naturally primed for bowel movements in the morning, the most important thing is that you're going regularly, no matter what time it is. “Regardless of the time of day, it’s crucial to pay attention to your body's signals and not ignore the urge to have a bowel movement,” says Brown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adjusting your lifestyle to promote an A.M. poop is possible. Drink plenty of water, consume a high-fiber diet, aim to reduce stress and create a consistent sleep-and-wake schedule. Soon after you wake up, eat a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/gallery/7913071/high-protein-high-fiber-breakfast-recipes/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;fiber-rich breakfast&lt;/a&gt; and drink a cup of coffee or tea, then sit on the toilet for five minutes.

&lt;p&gt;From a scientific perspective, there is no single "correct" frequency for bowel movements, says Brown. What’s “normal” can vary from about two times per day to three times per week. As long as your stools are well-formed and easy to pass, and the schedule doesn't cause discomfort, any time is A-OK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_70-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The best time to poop is in the morning, and you can make that happen by creating a solid poop-friendly A.M. routine with a fiber-rich breakfast, some water and coffee and a consistent time on the toilet. That said, each of us is unique, and what may be a “normal” bowel movement pattern can vary from person to person.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_71-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_72-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Keep a keen eye on any sudden or persistent changes in bowel habits and consult a health care provider to address any concerns. By doing so, you will optimize your digestive health and overall well-being,” advises Brown.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

But the age when a child’s period begins, called menarche, can tell them a little about their health later in life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Menarche that begins “anytime between the age of 10 and 14 is considered normal,” Dr. Anne-Marie Amies Oelschlager, pediatric and adolescent gynecologist at the University of Washington School of Medicine, tells TODAY.com. “The average age in the U.S. most recently has been around age 12. But in some recent studies, it has actually dipped even to 11.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Most American girls, 98%, will start their periods by age 15, she adds. Children who start periods at a younger age within the normal range can experience some “adverse effects long term.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“Ideally, you want your period to come in the typical range,” says Amies Oelschlager, a fellow with the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;For the most part, girls start their period about the same age their mothers did and there’s not much they can do to change this. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“The most common reason for getting an earlier period is familial. So, if your mother or your older sister had an earlier period then you’re likely going to have it (early) also,” Dr. Adi Davidov, associate chair of OB/GYN at Staten Island University Hospital, tells TODAY.com. “There are probably some environmental factors that really are not very clear.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Ahead, the experts share how the age of one’s first period impacts future health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-cc7e7c" class="body-heading"&gt;Cancer &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;People who start their periods at a younger age have an increased risk for cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“Menarche or first period at age 11 or lower was associated with a higher risk for any cancer,” Amies Oelschlager says. “But particularly those (cancers) that are hormonally sensitive, like breast and endometrial cancer.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Doctors are unsure why starting one’s period at 10, for example, might lead to increased cancer risk but they have some theories, especially as it relates to hormone-driven cancers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“When a girl develops menarche earlier in life, she’s exposed to higher levels of female hormones earlier and life and prolonged exposure to female hormones can cause some of these diseases,” Davidov says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Amies Oelschlager says research hasn’t found a “clear cause” for why cancer risk increases but agrees that when it comes to breast and endometrial cancers, experiencing more years of hormones could be at play. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“The question is — is there something about having a longer duration of estrogen exposure over time,” she says. “Your estrogen levels really increase with puberty and then stay pretty elevated until the age of menopause. So having the longer timer period of higher levels of estrogen is that, by itself, a risk factor?” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Ovulation also comes with a spike in progesterone levels and perhaps that could contribute to some types of breast cancer, for example. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“Is it just unique to these higher levels of estrogen or progesterone for longer time periods?” Amies Oelschlager says. “Or is it possible that there may be other things that are triggering early puberty, like endocrine disruptors that are … causing changes in the breast tissue that can increase your risk of breast cancer.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Natural or synthetic chemicals that disturb the endocrine system are called &lt;a href="https://www.niehs.nih.gov/health/topics/agents/endocrine" target="_blank"&gt;endocrine disrupters&lt;/a&gt;, according to the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-9a999c" class="body-heading"&gt;Insulin resistance and metabolic disorder &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/diabetes/overview/what-is-diabetes/prediabetes-insulin-resistance" target="_blank"&gt;Insulin resistance&lt;/a&gt; occurs when the body doesn’t properly react to insulin, a hormone the pancreas produces, according to the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Disease. This inability to respond to insulin means people can experience increased blood sugar levels and gain weight. If left unaddressed, it causes people to develop Type 2 diabetes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“There are some (studies) that have shown earlier puberty has been associated with higher insulin resistance and what we would call metabolic disorders,” Amies Oelschlager says. “It’s not totally clear if it’s just the early period or if it’s related to body mass index (BMI).” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;It’s difficult to tease out the relationship between BMI, early periods and metabolic disorders. A higher BMI can lead to people starting their periods earlier because adipose tissue, body fat, produces estrone, a type of estrogen. And, a higher BMI can cause insulin resistance and metabolic disorders. Right now, it's unclear whether BMI or the date of a first period contributes to these conditions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;What’s more, there’s an association between having an earlier first period and type 2 diabetes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“We know that girls that start their (puberty and periods) early are at a higher risk for diabetes when they’re younger,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;While the ovaries control the menstrual part of puberty, the adrenal glands control other aspects of puberty such as the development of pubic hair and body odor. Sometimes one puberty starts before the other. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“They don’t always go in sync,” Amies Oelschlager says. “Those puberties can start earlier or later. So, some girls may have signs of early onset of the pubic hair and the adrenal type of puberty and those can be associated with … an increased risk for diabetes.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-605081" class="body-heading"&gt;Heart disease &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The research on when one starts their period and its relationship to later heart health remains murky. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“There’s been studies that have shown that an early period, before age 11 or lower, was associated with higher blood pressure levels,” Amies Oelschlager says. “But it’s not totally clear if it’s just the early period or if it is related to body mass index because an elevated body mass index also increases your risk for higher blood pressure.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Davidov says he has also seen research indicating that the timing of one’s first period — both early or late — could be connected to heart disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“Anything that’s not exactly the norm, a little bit earlier, a little bit later, may potentially increase your risk of heart disease,” he says. “Honestly, it’s not clear to me what the underlying mechanism is.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;One of the problems is that it can be difficult to study the impact of one’s first period on future health, such as heart disease. Many factors likely contribute to heart health troubles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“(Studies are) retrospective in nature,” Davidov says. “There (are) so many confounding variables that it’s very hard to determine the actual causes.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;For example, perhaps a woman with a slightly early first period had a health condition that caused it. That health condition could also contribute to a later diagnosis of heart disease. Also, lifestyle factors such as smoking, drinking, stress, obesity or sedentary lifestyles contribute to poor heart health and it can be difficult to tease out how much of a role early menarche plays. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="endmark body-graf"&gt;While more research is needed, Amies Oelschlager encourages her patients who start their periods early to eat healthy and work out. Regular exercise can help people “decrease their risk of having those other metabolic, cardiovascular issues,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>TODAY.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 29 May 2025 16:33:23 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikwFBVV95cUxPQWh3NHI4bnFQZ3ZENFZtYjdxX3JLUkFaM2dIM3FzWkFJU09nQTFZOV83WFNCeVNuYXdUQUZBZlF5MlFIeDZLY0pUYlVZb0J1NzlBUFRXTW5VYlh3YmVNMlRUNjFvYTczQm9VY0Fqc1BvTUxqR1JEYk85cUxHT0NMaUNBM1FwSnR6RC1ab29mUFhzTmvSAVRBVV95cUxONmVtejl1NVFPQl9wNGwxUm9iWURSYkpHdEJQQTVMbmlMa0hXcHlWRjFKTTN5X0RPZHU4V1MwQUkzU25zYS1IYV81MlNGZnpJOXU3dkc</guid></item><item><title>随着Moderna报告取得积极成果， RFK Jr.为大流行疫苗提供资金- Ars Technica | RFK Jr. yanks pandemic vaccine funding as Moderna reports positive results - Ars Technica</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipwFBVV95cUxPaVhMMUN1ZWhEZnlTUjlXUllUSjMzeHNOYUtrWFlXRXUtV3BYZFVJUE10V3EzcjNTZnhHWGJxREVEd0dEWHllTGFGMkRPdUw2SmFuTldfMjFIR1JDaVlVMjBaYUxkejY1b2JSUEN6bkV6dVcxMmZrZm8xNWJKM0xTOFpDcXVkeGV3ejVhODJJeTA1Smd5ZkRRdFNVNDlKMVBoNW5IN2lvTQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
                      
                      
          &lt;p&gt;The Department of Health and Human Services—under the control of anti-vaccine advocate Robert F.

In the administration's final days in January, HHS awarded the vaccine maker an additional &lt;a href="https://news.modernatx.com/news/news-details/2025/Moderna-Announces-Updates-on-Pandemic-Influenza-Program/default.aspx"&gt;$590 million&lt;/a&gt; to support "late-stage development and licensure of pre-pandemic mRNA-based vaccines." The funding would also go to the development of five additional subtypes of pandemic influenza.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, as news broke that the Trump administration was reneging on the contract, &lt;a href="a%20rapid,%20potent%20and%20durable%20immune%20response."&gt;Moderna reported positive&lt;/a&gt; results from an early trial of a vaccine targeting H5 influenza viruses. In a preliminary trial of 300 healthy adults, the vaccine candidate appeared safe and boosted antibody levels against the virus by 44.5-fold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An HHS spokesperson said that the decision to cancel the funding—which would support thorough safety and efficacy testing of the vaccines—was because the vaccines needed more testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This is not simply about efficacy—it’s about safety, integrity, and trust." HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/05/28/hhs-moderna-bird-flu-vaccine-funding/"&gt;told The Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;. "The reality is that mRNA technology remains under-tested."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nixon went on to claim that the Trump administration wouldn't repeat the "mistakes of the last administration, which concealed legitimate safety concerns." The accusation refers to mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines, which were developed and initially released under the first Trump administration. They have since been proven safe and effective against the deadly virus.&lt;/p&gt;

It is not a medical disaster. It is a bodily process, like giving birth or like going to the bathroom or coughing,” she continues. “Your body knows what to do.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;She’ll eat and drink less, for example, and sleep a lot more; she won’t get out of bed and might become delirious. Eventually, her breathing will slow down until the death rattles take over. She might even experience “the rally”, the nurse says, or a burst of energy and mental clarity days before her last breath.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The scene is based on real events in the life of Molly Kochan, who received a &lt;a href="https://everythingleadstothis.com/2015/08/12/everything-leads-to-this/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;terminal breast cancer diagnosis&lt;/a&gt; in 2015 and embarked on a sexual journey until her death four years later. Kochan, who died at age 46, documented her experiences in a &lt;a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/3zzOFMwPlA0bbPkt4R0Lku" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt; with her best friend, Nikki Boyer, which inspired the TV series.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="b4a99c13-b22b-480c-b1cb-8283c0505284" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":5,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"I’m a death expert.

It feels too scary or sad,” says Kim Rosenstock, the show’s co-creator, writer and executive producer. “So we felt like we had an opportunity to depict death in a different way. And in doing so, to hopefully make death feel even a tiny bit less mysterious and scary.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;To some extent, each death is unique because it depends on a person’s age, health status and reason for dying, says Julie McFadden, a hospice nurse and online educator in Los Angeles, California. But for those unaffected by a traumatic event, such as a car accident, most people will experience certain stages and symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Experts say that knowing more about death – which they call “death literacy” – can actually help quell fears of dying. Here’s what they said about the science and psychology of the death process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="the-transition-phase" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;The transition phase&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Months before death, the transition phase begins, says McFadden. This entails spending more time in bed, eating and drinking less, and needing more help with daily tasks such as getting dressed and going to the bathroom. During this time, it can be hard to keep up with conversations and sleep will take up most of the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="InteractiveBlockComponent" priority="critical" deferuntil="idle" props='{"url":"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2023/10/archive-zip/giv-13425WMrLo2pc9VIk/","scriptUrl":"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js","alt":"Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’ ","format":{"design":10,"display":2,"theme":4},"elementId":"12238a06-9966-40ef-b97f-14bda5679320","isMainMedia":false}'&gt;&lt;figure id="12238a06-9966-40ef-b97f-14bda5679320" class="element element-interactive element--inline element-inline dcr-w422y2" data-alt="Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’ " data-testid="interactive-element-Graphic%20with%20three%20lines%20of%20text%20that%20say,%20in%20bold,%20%E2%80%98Well%20Actually%E2%80%99,%20then%20%E2%80%98Read%20more%20on%20living%20a%20good%20life%20in%20a%20complex%20world,%E2%80%99%20then%20a%20pinkish-lavender%20pill-shaped%20button%20with%20white%20letters%20that%20say%20%E2%80%98More%20from%20this%20section%E2%80%99%C2%A0" data-spacefinder-role="inline"&gt;&lt;a data-name="placeholder" href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2023/10/archive-zip/giv-13425WMrLo2pc9VIk/" class="dcr-1eupayo"&gt;Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’ &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;This stage can be particularly difficult to notice in people who have conditions such as dementia or Parkinson’s disease, adds McFadden, because the signs mirror those of their illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The transition phase could also involve a “detachment from the world” in a way that makes time feel non-existent, says &lt;a href="https://coleimperi.com/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Cole Imperi&lt;/a&gt;, a certified thanatologist, a specialist who studies death, dying, grief and loss. Senses will begin to dull as well, she says, so sight, hearing, taste, smell and touch won’t be as intense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside data-spacefinder-role="supporting" class="dcr-1eyan6r"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 22 14" class="dcr-scql1j"&gt;&lt;path d="M5.255 0h4.75c-.572 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941H0C.792 9.104 2.44 4.53 5.255 0Zm11.061 0H21c-.506 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941h-8.686c.902-4.837 2.485-9.411 5.3-13.941Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;blockquote class="dcr-zzndwp"&gt;When we die, our bodies get less efficient at running like clockwork&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Due to a lower food and beverage intake, at this point it’s possible to enter ketosis, a state in which the body burns fat for energy instead of glucose. Imperi says some people may experience pain relief or euphoria as a result, but it’s &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0306987706005779" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;not entirely clear why&lt;/a&gt;. Some &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2722878/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; suggests the neurotransmitter Gaba increases during ketosis, which makes you feel calm, while cortisol, the stress hormone, decreases, says Imperi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="active-dying" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;Active dying&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;All these symptoms will worsen until the last stage of life, called “active dying”, says McFadden. This can begin a few days or hours before death. For the most part, a person is unconscious, she says, and breathing and heart rate can become irregular.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;If respiration or heart rate becomes too erratic and causes discomfort, hospice workers can bring in a music-thanatologist to help stabilize vitals and ease anxiety, says Imperi. These trained professionals play the harp and use their voice at bedside. “When we die, our bodies get less efficient at running like clockwork,” says Imperi, “so when music-thanatologists come in, the body sort of tethers itself to the pattern of their music.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-19" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;skip past newsletter promotion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;aside aria-label="newsletter promotion" class="dcr-av5vqf"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-1xjndtj"&gt;Practical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good life&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SecureSignup" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"newsletterId":"well-actually","successDescription":"Practical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good life"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1eusqlu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy Notice: &lt;/strong&gt;Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

About a third of dying people undergo this sudden rush of mental clarity shortly before they die, according to McFadden. For a brief couple of days, hours or even minutes, personalities return, loved ones’ names are remembered and favorite foods are craved yet again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“There’s not a definitive scientific reason why this happens,” says Imperi. “But I will say that it is a beautiful, beautiful gift.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;It’s also very common, at any point during active dying, to experience hallucinations or visions that typically involve loved ones who have passed. Imperi says dying people often talk about needing to pack their suitcase or waiting to be picked up at an airport.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="terminal-secretions-or-the-death-rattle" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;Terminal secretions, or the ‘death rattle’&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The last thing that happens before death is a change in breathing pattern called Cheyne-Stokes respiration, says Imperi. Like a fish out of water, a person experiences a series of rapid breaths followed by long periods of no breathing. As a result, one can’t swallow mucus or saliva, so it thickens and builds up in the back of the throat, making each breath sound a bit gurgly, says Imperi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;These noises are called terminal secretions, commonly referred to as the “death rattle”. Although it sounds painful, Cheyne-Stokes breathing doesn’t hurt – just like most of the active dying process, says McFadden, who says she can tell based on patients’ non-verbal cues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“A dying person is like a baby,” McFadden says. “Babies can’t say they’re hungry or teething, but you can tell something is wrong by how they’re acting. Dying people are the same.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="why-death-literacy-is-important" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;Why death literacy is important&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“In American culture, death is largely feared and seen as this disaster to avoid at all costs,” says Rosenstock. “It was important to us to convey the dying process in a truthful way.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;It’s normal to be scared of death because it’s in our nature to survive, says Imperi, but the best way to quash a fear of dying is to educate yourself. Several &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-82421-8" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; show that the more we learn about and contemplate death, the less anxiety we have about experiencing it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Death literacy can be especially helpful for people who are already dying, McFadden says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="0164ed53-26ce-4bf5-912e-b762c132c05e" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":32,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"Dying for Sex review – Michelle Williams’ erotic journey is revolutionary TV","elementId":"0164ed53-26ce-4bf5-912e-b762c132c05e","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/apr/04/dying-for-sex-review-michelle-williams-erotic-journey-is-revolutionary-tv"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":10,"display":2,"theme":4}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Most people are not comfortable talking about it, so everyone skirts around the issue. But at the end of the day, they do want answers, and generally speaking, we have some,” McFadden says. “We don’t know exactly what it’s going to be like after you’re gone, but we know enough about what you can expect [during the process], and in most cases, my patients and their families sigh with relief once they learn more about it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;That’s because one of the hardest parts about dying is losing control, says Imperi, and death education can help put the ball back in your court. On the other hand, some people might find a sense of control by refusing to learn more about what’s happening to them or their loved one, adds Imperi, which can be equally as therapeutic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Supporting that resistance is sometimes more important,” says Imperi, because that might be what a person needs at that point in their journey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Above all, “we are built for death just like we’re built for birth”, says McFadden. “The more we understand that, the better we will live – and the more peaceful we will die.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Thu, 29 May 2025 16:01:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMif0FVX3lxTE13bnFrWEg2RVV3QXRxZlV1SHM5ME1OVlIyaS1ZODZ5X1ZpRERKdWpaNFkwVTk5Vnlyb1BMVUhFcGpnSF9NMjUtVHFyd2VOMHRELTA2a2Rjei12WjhibXlaTGZMU2tyMXJpN3VDa1IyckFqMldVVkJBYVF3WmpMSVU</guid></item><item><title>瘫痪后生孩子的妈妈-伤口 | The Mom Who Had a Baby After Becoming Paralyzed - The Cut</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimgFBVV95cUxQRllJcktXRkgzOWlkNkswWmNPT0wxT3hnZFcxV2V3VlZ3aEdmbDlMcF9pdmRIUEdWa3AycmxWZWNfLUtZRzlVQU9hSDhUM1RoOFYwZXJ6UmZUNmFWWDZQdThwRXk3djR1aG11MVI1dVZFUzBBOXNhNVNVZ1JvaE13S0hZQU5BZ1JHbm5IMkVGbTZ3cHc0Ym1EdzVn?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="wwwthecut-zephr-anchor" class="article-content inline" data-editable="content"&gt;

But “every patient with a spinal-cord injury is unique,” Charlotte says. Her specialists told her there was a chance that the communication between her legs and her brain could be restored, and that she could get some degree of mobility or sensation back. About six months after her injury, Charlotte surprised herself — and her specialists — when she discovered she could feel and move her toes. “I was sitting in the shower and my toes suddenly wiggled,” she remembers. At first the movement was inadvertent, but then she found she could do it again, on purpose. “It wasn’t a spasm,” Charlotte says. “I was in disbelief.’ &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb8mma3z003f3b6d6jg0355y@published" data-word-count="146"&gt;&lt;em&gt;With additional rehab, Charlotte learned how to rise into a standing position and, slowly and haltingly, take a few steps. Still, for a young adult in her prime, and a former college swimmer, the adjustment to her new limitations was brutal, physically and emotionally. In the beginning of her recovery, tasks she had once considered mindless were huge challenges. “You can imagine how hard it is to put pants on in a seated position,” Charlotte says. “Before I learned how to do that, I’d be rolling around on the bed for ten minutes, trying to put underwear on.” Navigating an ableist world not designed for wheelchair users was a major shock to the system: “Something as simple as getting around a hose somebody left out in the sidewalk to water their lawn, that was hard for me, especially as I was getting used to my chair.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb8mm0b5002p3b6dhchdc3w6@published" data-word-count="53"&gt;&lt;em&gt;“I definitely grieved, and the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/grief-quotes-to-share.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;grieving&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; took a long time,” Charlotte adds. “I’ve always been a confident person, someone who believed I could do anything. But back then, in the early days of my recovery, I found myself suddenly worrying about all of the potential things I may never be able to do.” &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb8mm0b5002q3b6doc884kf9@published" data-word-count="120"&gt;&lt;em&gt;That’s why Charlotte was relieved when a doctor assured her that the injury wasn’t likely to impede her ability to have children someday. Her reproductive organs hadn’t been affected by the accident, he said. With those reassuring words, the knot in Charlotte’s chest loosened. “It felt like a glimmer of hope,” says Charlotte. “I wasn’t anywhere near ready to have a family — I wasn’t even dating anyone seriously,” she says. “But I knew I wanted kids. I helped raise my younger siblings, who are a lot younger than I am, by ten and 12 years. I was a camp counselor, a coach. As a kid, I used to tell people I wanted at least five children. It felt nonnegotiable.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Charlotte, now 41, reveals how her dream of becoming a mother came true. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb8mk4ou000m0iikj4xcaas0@published" data-word-count="79"&gt;A year or so after the accident, I was like&lt;em&gt;, Let’s get back out there and start dating&lt;/em&gt;. At first I just went about my life, trying to meet people organically while getting groceries or going to the park or the pool. When that bombed, I decided to try online dating. Right away, I think I felt more secure, being able to write my little synopsis and put my profile up, and sort of screen people in or out.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb8mposf006e3b6dyaw7tcr0@published" data-word-count="94"&gt;For a while I didn’t write anything about my injury. I’d talk to guys for a couple of weeks before deciding when to share. I’m picky, so I didn’t get to that point with a lot of people. But when I did, there was a mix of reactions. Some guys were like, “Okay, good to know.” But other ones weren’t as nice. This one guy — I should’ve saved the screenshot — wrote back “I don’t know if I can do all that,” to which I was like, &lt;em&gt;Okay, good-bye.&lt;/em&gt; Obviously he wasn’t the one.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb8mk4ou000o0iikb94z4j7h@published" data-word-count="29"&gt;I kept tweaking my profile, then decided to be fully transparent about my injury. Being guarded wasn’t helping me meet better guys; if anything it was making it harder.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb8mq99q006m3b6dil4p6ra0@published" data-word-count="41"&gt;After a while, online dating got old. I’d been doing it for a couple of years when one of my app subscriptions was about to end.  I decided that when the time was up, I was going to take a break.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb8mq99q006n3b6d1k9eetr3@published" data-word-count="37"&gt;Then I got this little ping from this guy — Mark. I checked him out, and I couldn’t believe it. He was funny, handsome. Suddenly I was like, &lt;em&gt;Okay, this might be someone I want to meet.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb8mq99q006o3b6db5af31rk@published" data-word-count="55"&gt;We started talking, and there was chemistry. He made me laugh, and we never ran out of stuff to talk about. We moved the conversation to email, and we would write to each other all day, sometimes till 2 a.m. I didn’t want to get my hopes up, but it felt like something was happening.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb8mq99q006p3b6dnlyimvii@published" data-word-count="58"&gt;We decided to meet for a first date. I was definitely nervous; I had him meet me at my friend’s café so she could back me up if he did anything weird. We talked over coffee and a sandwich, and I really liked him. He was genuine, super-smart, really funny. We had the same silly sense of humor.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb8mk4ou000q0iikw6qf8bkn@published" data-word-count="77"&gt;I proceeded in the relationship with caution, and so did he — he’d been married before, had a 4-year-old son, and had only recently gotten divorced. But I think we both fell pretty hard, and at some point, I knew he was it for me. I was clear with him that the clock was ticking — I was in my 30s and wanted to have a baby. He was still licking his wounds, though, and needed time.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb8mqwos006w3b6dltrv5lhp@published" data-word-count="67"&gt;But five years in, he proposed. I knew I wanted to walk to my husband and stand for our first dance, so I got back in touch with the first physical therapist who worked with me after I regained sensation. It was a really emotional day, but I did manage to walk down the aisle at the wedding with the help of my walker and leg braces.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb8mrcsf00793b6dpelkiucu@published" data-word-count="89"&gt;My husband and I had decided not to have sex until we were engaged — but we talked about it a lot before we did it for the first time. Mark had a ton of questions: Do we need any accommodation? Is anything going to be painful for you? Do you need an extra pillow here or there? He was totally concerned with my comfort, which is totally him. We didn’t take ourselves too seriously. I think that’s honestly the key with everything for us, just keeping things light.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb8msbtb007g3b6de99et0d8@published" data-word-count="31"&gt;Clearly we figured it out. I went off birth control after our wedding, and less than a year later, I got pregnant. We were both shocked by how quickly it happened.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb8mz4ov007t3b6dm8f0zl6v@published" data-word-count="116"&gt;Even before I got pregnant, I’d been talking about the prospect of it with my general practitioner. She linked me up with a great high-risk maternal-fetal medicine specialist. People with spinal-cord injuries are more susceptible to UTIs and blood clots when they’re pregnant, so my doctor put me on low-dose, prophylactic antibiotics to protect against infection as well as a daily blood thinner shot in my belly to stave off clots. It was important for me to move around as much as I could throughout the day too. Thankfully, I work remotely, so I would step away from my desk a few times a day to walk with my walker and my braces down the hallway.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb8mzb7s00803b6dkfqb8vo7@published" data-word-count="67"&gt;I wasn’t prepared for the extreme nausea I had for the whole nine months. It wasn’t hyperemesis gravidarum, because I wouldn’t vomit. I was just miserably sick — I could barely eat, and I lost so much weight. I was also covered in bruises — my whole abdomen was bruised from the blood-thinner injections. And in the sixth month, I developed gestational diabetes.The whole experience was exhausting.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb8mzp0i008d3b6dlz1lwbww@published" data-word-count="104"&gt;Throughout the pregnancy, I worried about losing the baby. Specifically, I worried that I would miscarry and not know it. I developed bad anxiety over it, to the point that I bought my own doppler to listen to the baby’s heartbeat at home. I was taking a lot of meds — my usual anti-spasm medications, which I take to prevent dangerous muscle spasms that can interfere with things like driving or transferring from one position to another. I worried the meds would affect the baby, even though my MFM and my physiatrist — my spinal-cord injury specialist — insisted there was nothing to fear.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb8mzuqm008k3b6dcm0zhsve@published" data-word-count="29"&gt;It was endlessly relieving that every time I went in for a checkup, the baby looked great. She was growing well and had enough fluid and a strong heartbeat.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb8mzuqm008l3b6dz66z3v2m@published" data-word-count="50"&gt;And I could feel her. When I got pregnant, I wasn’t sure I’d be able to, but at about 19 weeks, there she was — a little flutter. I have a couple of videos of her doing a complete 180 in my stomach. That was a happy surprise, that feeling.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb8n07v3008y3b6dsdh9wg72@published" data-word-count="62"&gt;The pregnancy happened to coincide with a big move for us. We’d been in a two-bedroom apartment and knew we’d need a one-level house with at least three bedrooms — one for my stepson and another for the baby. We found one right around the time we found out I was pregnant and closed on it when I was two months along.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb8n0dbo00953b6di0gc66qx@published" data-word-count="63"&gt;Accessibility was top of mind. We planned to have the baby sleep in our room, in a bedside bassinet, for most of her first year, then move into a crib in her room. I was concerned about being able to transfer her in and out of her crib from my chair. We ended up adapting a conventional crib by adding a sliding door.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb8n0t2k009i3b6ddq62e7aq@published" data-word-count="100"&gt;Spinal-cord-injury patients can experience a rare but potentially dangerous condition during labor. It’s called autonomic dysreflexia, and it happens when painful stimuli below your spinal cord injury trigger a central-nervous-system reaction that can make your heart rate go crazy, among other problems. I wanted to try for a vaginal birth regardless, and my doctors said I could do so with a few precautions. Specifically, rather than waiting to go into labor, I would have to have an induction so they could control my labor more tightly. About a month from my due date, we scheduled the induction for 39 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb8n12ij009p3b6dkpq945xz@published" data-word-count="68"&gt;My OB and I talked a lot about what was going to happen during labor. I was a little nervous that my injury would prevent me from pushing hard enough, and we talked about the possibility that the doctors would have to intervene with suction or forceps. They assured me that the baby wouldn’t be harmed. I didn’t like the idea, but I accepted that it could happen.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb8n12ik009q3b6dvejty45q@published" data-word-count="74"&gt;But once labor actually began, it felt like my body kicked in and did what it was born to do. About 12 hours after they started my induction, I began having strong contractions. I had an epidural — I have very minimal sensation below my injury, but they wanted to prevent dysreflexia, which is why they gave it to me. But I did feel strong pressure, and I definitely felt like I was pushing.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb8n12ik009r3b6diy35btss@published" data-word-count="39"&gt;About 15 hours after my induction began, my daughter arrived. She was little — five pounds, 15 ounces — but perfect, with thick black hair and big brown eyes. It was love at first sight. We named her Maya.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb8n1jzz00a43b6dscne98cp@published" data-word-count="108"&gt;Before Maya was born, I started following a lot of other wheelchair moms online and learned a lot of their tricks. I used a baby carrier a lot. I’d roll around the house with Maya strapped to my chest. As Maya got bigger and developed head control, I was able to secure her to my lap with a specialized, wide Velcro belt. To get her in and out of the car, I’d put her in her car seat, then put the car seat on my lap and roll out the door. We got a beautiful revolving car seat that spins to forward-facing or rear-facing, and that was super-helpful.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb8n1r8g00ab3b6datu2jvmx@published" data-word-count="87"&gt;I didn’t expect to feel lonely, but I really did. It was the middle of the pandemic, so people just weren’t gathering together yet. My husband is wonderful, but it was just the two of us. We were sleep deprived and still having to be functional parents to my stepson, and I was extra emotional with all the hormones. I nursed Maya, but it didn’t come easily, which affected my ability to bond with her. It took a few months for that distant feeling to go away.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb8n25i100ao3b6dn983o2bx@published" data-word-count="127"&gt;At first I was pretty nervous about being out and about with my baby by myself. When she was still a newborn, we took a family vacation to spend time with relatives on a lake. A conflict came up with work for Mark, so I decided to make the four-hour drive with the baby by myself. I was so freaking scared, but I planned everything perfectly. It can be hard to find accessible parking and accessible bathrooms when you’re on a road trip, so before we left, I mapped out a bunch of stops and made sure we had all the gear we needed. When we made it, I was so proud. Since then, May and I have taken several other four- to six-hour drives by ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb8n3h7o00bf3b6dv7ycvjxa@published" data-word-count="115"&gt;More and more, I’ve leaned into my friendships with other spinal-cord-injury moms. I know four others now — women I connected with through some of the doctors we share, who are all in the D.C. area and have two or three kids apiece. I’m able to talk to them totally openly, and I go to them often for advice and help with problems. Now that Maya is 4, I talk to them a lot about how to be mobile when she and I are out and about by ourselves. Maya usually listens, but I still harbor a fear that she’ll bolt across a parking lot or something and I won’t be able to catch her.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb8n3qnb00bm3b6d6iikgsg4@published" data-word-count="81"&gt;One of my friends, who flies solo a lot with her two littlest kids, told me she uses backpacks with tethers on them. In a crowded airport, for example, she’ll tie the tethers to her chair. Maya has a similar backpack now, and we’ve used it a few times when I knew we were going to be in crowded places. It’s not something we do all the time — but sometimes that sort of solution is necessary to keep us safe.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb8n3qnb00bn3b6dv0pm3lwg@published" data-word-count="42"&gt;I still have anxiety around taking her to playgrounds by myself, as they’re not always wheel-friendly. There’s often sand or wood chips to navigate.  Usually we do playground time when I know someone else, like my husband, can tag along with us.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb8n42g400c03b6drdaanfg1@published" data-word-count="75"&gt;Maya is in preschool, and she’s starting to notice differences and ask more questions. Lately, she’s been asking a lot about why I use a wheelchair. I just tell her that her mama’s legs don’t work as well as other people’s do, so I use my wheels to get around. She seems satisfied with that. As she gets older and more mature, I’ll share more about the accident and the injury in an age-appropriate way.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb8n4ahj00c73b6dqxlr3har@published" data-word-count="86"&gt;Sometimes it makes me a little bit sad that she doesn’t have other friends at school with parents on wheels. She hasn’t voiced this, but I worry that someday she’ll think something is “wrong” with me, or that she’ll be bullied because her mom is different. I make a big effort to visit her school as much as possible to show her and her classmates that my wheels don’t stop me from doing anything, and that I’m just as involved and capable as the other parents.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb8n4ahk00c83b6dxdjwy2kq@published" data-word-count="55"&gt;But preschooler parenting is tough! Maya is strong-willed. Sometimes she gets herself into spots around the house that she knows I can’t access in my chair. I’ll be trying to get her into the bath or discipline her but won’t be able to reach her. That’s definitely frustrating. But it’s also life with a preschooler.&lt;/p&gt;

The &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/should-the-nausea-drug-zofran-be-over-the-counter.html"&gt;nausea&lt;/a&gt; was beyond debilitating. Dealing with that, plus taking the blood-thinner shots and all of the other pills I was on, was a lot. I have no desire to potentially go through any of that again.&lt;/p&gt;

Researchers collaborated to simulate how vesicles—tiny sacs that release neurotransmitters—operate within synapses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The model reveals how proteins like synapsin-1 and tomosyn-1 regulate the recycling of vesicles, enabling synaptic transmission even at high firing rates. This breakthrough clarifies a long-standing mystery in neuroscience and opens the door to better understanding of diseases like depression and myasthenic syndromes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vesicle Behavior:&lt;/strong&gt; Only 10–20% of vesicles are active at a time; the rest are stored in reserve.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Insights:&lt;/strong&gt; Proteins like synapsin-1 and tomosyn-1 regulate vesicle movement and release.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Medical Relevance:&lt;/strong&gt; Findings could aid treatments for disorders involving faulty synaptic transmission.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;OIST&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do we think, feel, remember, or move? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These processes involve synaptic transmission, in which chemical signals are transmitted between nerve cells using molecular containers called vesicles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, researchers have successfully modeled the vesicle cycle in unprecedented detail, revealing new information about the way our brain functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-110470"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/vesicle-synapses-neurosicnce.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/vesicle-synapses-neurosicnce-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/vesicle-synapses-neurosicnce-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/vesicle-synapses-neurosicnce-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/vesicle-synapses-neurosicnce-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/vesicle-synapses-neurosicnce-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/vesicle-synapses-neurosicnce-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/vesicle-synapses-neurosicnce.jpg" alt="This is an illustration of a vesicle." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/vesicle-synapses-neurosicnce.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/vesicle-synapses-neurosicnce-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/vesicle-synapses-neurosicnce-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/vesicle-synapses-neurosicnce-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/vesicle-synapses-neurosicnce-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/vesicle-synapses-neurosicnce-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/vesicle-synapses-neurosicnce-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;They discovered that the vesicle cycle was able to operate at high stimulation frequencies, far beyond what is normally found in nature. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;A joint study, published in &lt;em&gt;Science Advances&lt;/em&gt;, between researchers at the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology (OIST), Japan, and the University Medical Center Göttingen (UMG), Germany, has applied a unique computational modeling system, which considers the complicated interplay of vesicles, their cellular environments, activities and interactions, to create a realistic picture of how vesicles support synaptic transmission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their model predicts parameters of synaptic function that could not be tested experimentally in the past, opening new avenues in neuroscience investigations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Recent technological advances have enabled experimental scientists to capture increasing amounts of data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The challenge now lies in integrating and interpreting all the different types of data, to understand the complexities of the brain,” said Professor Erik De Schutter, head of the OIST Computational Neuroscience Unit and co-author on this study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our model provides better molecular and spatial detail of the vesicle cycle, and much faster, than any other systems before. And it’s transferable to different cells and scenarios too. It’s a significant leap forward towards scientific aspirations of full cell and full tissue simulation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have been working on synapses for over 20 years, but some functional steps were difficult to test experimentally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“After several years of fine-tuning experimental and computational work with our Japanese colleagues, we now have a model for testing new hypotheses, especially in the context of neurological diseases”, added Professor Silvio Rizzoli, director of the Department for Neuro- and Sensory Physiology at the UMG and also co-author on the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the synaptic vesicle cycle?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vesicle cycle describes the steps through which neurotransmitters (chemical signals) are released at a synapse (a junction between nerve cells), to transfer information between cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vesicles containing neurotransmitters move and dock at the membrane, ready to fuse and release their contents, before being recycled. The process is prompted by electrical stimulation within the brain and is driven by a complex signaling cascade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Depending on the situation, different amounts of neurotransmitters need to be released over different time periods. To enable controlled and sustained synaptic transmission, only 10-20% of vesicles are readily available to dock at any given time (these are known as the recycling pool). Most vesicles are instead in a reserve pool, immobilized in a cluster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many details of this process, including how vesicles move between the reserve and recycling pool, were poorly known.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The mechanisms of vesicle recycling at high stimulation frequency&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In their publication, the researchers shed new light on the vesicle recycling process in hippocampal synapses. With their model, they aimed to both confirm the behavior of vesicles at experimentally-observed firing frequencies, and explore behavior at higher frequencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They discovered that the vesicle cycle was able to operate at high stimulation frequencies, far beyond what is normally found in nature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They were also able to pinpoint some of the reasons behind this robust cycle, identifying the roles of key proteins synapsin-1 and tomosyn-1 in regulating vesicle release from the clustered reserve pool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers noted that the efficiency of the vesicle cycle relied on molecular tethering. By physically connecting some vesicles to the membrane with tethers, a close supply of vesicles could be made available for rapid docking and neurotransmitter release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These important findings enable deeper understanding of vesicle recycling, a process involved in many different diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For example, the release of neurotransmitters is hampered in botulism or some myasthenic syndromes. Treatments for depression and other major neurological diseases also often focus on synaptic transmission,” explained Prof. De Schutter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As we expand our models, the potential applications are vast, both in developing new therapeutics, and in deepening our fundamental understanding of how the brain works.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#f3879c9e9c9e9add9c9886919cb39c9a8087dd9983" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Tomomi Okubo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://oist.jp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;OIST&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Tomomi Okubo – OIST&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.adq6477" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Dynamic Regulation of Vesicle Pools in a Detailed Spatial Model of the Complete Synaptic Vesicle Cycle&lt;/a&gt;” by Erik De Schutter et al. &lt;em&gt;Science Advances&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dynamic Regulation of Vesicle Pools in a Detailed Spatial Model of the Complete Synaptic Vesicle Cycle&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Synaptic transmission is driven by a complex cycle of vesicle docking, release, and recycling, maintained by distinct vesicle pools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the partitioning of vesicle pools and reserve pool recruitment remain poorly understood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We use a novel vesicle modeling technology to model the synaptic vesicle cycle in unprecedented molecular and spatial detail at a hippocampal synapse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our model demonstrates robust recycling of synaptic vesicles that maintains consistent synaptic release, even during sustained high-frequency firing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also show how the cytosolic proteins synapsin-1 and tomosyn-1 cooperate to regulate recruitment of reserve pool vesicles during sustained firing to maintain transmission, as well as the potential of selective vesicle active zone tethering to ensure rapid vesicle replenishment while minimizing reserve pool recruitment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also monitored vesicle usage in isolated hippocampal neurons using pH-sensitive pHluorin, demonstrating that reserve vesicle recruitment depends on firing frequency, even at nonphysiologically high firing frequencies, as predicted by the model.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Thu, 29 May 2025 15:38:38 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMia0FVX3lxTE0zUVBGSlBEcFFTaXh1Rng0Z0FUbkxHU3VGX1E2S1Rvd3ZOcUVyUW00QXRna1VpdFNueHAtQVBkam03U1d2aVlIcm5PM1ZLQzE1alBNNU1pQzlQN0V1bm9rcDVrYTNQSEVmYVlR</guid></item><item><title>肖恩·汉尼提（ Sean Hannity ）突然对“愚蠢的流感疫苗”有很多话要说-媒体对美国很重要 | Sean Hannity has a lot to say about the “stupid flu shot” all of a sudden - Media Matters for America</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMioAFBVV95cUxQZF9vMUsyZTc4Z2hMN3dqSUZIcEh5b0kyei1zTzlnVW1DZDBmcG9KMEl4cmFRVFoyR2U2eEsweV9mZnA2QmNxLW90NVZUMGdjMjZERHFEZzd2a1BhYW53MzBkMU1aWUFpaHByVzByTXk4cFdKamJSYjc4MU94YzhMQ1Nqc2VoaElYSEhZSnhCQmFYSkJwM3JYdTBvRElzSWlj?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="block-quote__quote"&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;SEAN HANNITY (HOST): And even the creator, who I know you're familiar with, Dr. Robert Malone, was very outspoken, and he came on this program often. And he said that mRNA technology has not been perfected. He did support emergency authorization vaccinations for people over 65 that had preexisting conditions and comorbidities because they were the ones that were more likely to be -- their lives would be put in jeopardy by the virus. He absolutely was crystal clear. It was not designed for healthy people that were younger, meaning below the age of 65, and it's absolutely not designed for children. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, he's the one that created the technology that allowed for the creation of this, and he's saying this. And then he gets excoriated like you got excoriated for trying alternative treatment, which, by the way, studies, since that time have proven that you were right about things like hydroxychloroquine taken early, mitigating circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How many studies now have come out confirming that? How many studies have come out showing that masks really didn't help? How many studies came out, you know, showing that your protocols actually worked? How many patients' lives did you save, and how many patients did you lose in the process?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DR. BRIAN TYSON (GUEST): Yeah. I mean, it's -- so you're 100% correct. If you go to the website c19.org, you'll be able to pull up all the different treatments and all of the studies that are listed underneath those. There's over 400 studies on hydroxychloroquine, there's over 300 studies on ivermectin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we found was early treatment is the key. It's not about vaccines at this point because these vaccines are not effective. Actually, they're negative effective, just like last year's flu shot. Last year's flu shot had a negative efficacy of 26%, meaning those who got the flu shot were more likely to get the flu. It's the same thing with these COVID vaccine boosters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HANNITY: Well, people don't understand that. Every year, they will start producing a flu virus. They're guessing what flu is likely to hit. They don't know for sure. And my understanding is that they're wrong 75% of the time, and people, you know, annually go get the stupid flu shot anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TYSON: Yeah. But they made $6 billion off of it last year. And that's the problem. When you continuously approve vaccines without data and without research -- this is where you know the MAHA movement is -- hopefully it's going to make some ground -- you can't continue to produce vaccines without seeing the results. And you have to start holding the pharmaceutical companies accountable.&lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;When Sarah Beran started noticing &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/bi-today-colon-cancer-diagnosis-early-symptoms-2023-3" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;blood in her poop&lt;/a&gt;, she didn't know how to bring it up to her doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I felt like I went in there with my tail between my legs, and not only was I talking about poop, but I was talking about my butt and blood and it's just all these things you don't want to talk about," Beran, 39, told Business Insider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beran, who was later diagnosed with stage 3 colon cancer at age 34, went on to talk about bowel movements a lot: she co-founded &lt;a target="_blank" class="" href="https://www.worldclassclothing.com/" data-track-click='{"click_type":"other","element_name":"body_link","event":"outbound_click"}' rel=" nofollow"&gt;Worldclass&lt;/a&gt;, an apparel brand that donates proceeds to fund colonoscopies for people who are underinsured.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beran's experience of anal bleeding is not uncommon. It is statistically the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.facs.org/for-medical-professionals/news-publications/news-and-articles/bulletin/2024/november-december-2024-volume-109-issue-10/clinicians-struggle-to-understand-dramatic-rise-in-early-onset-colorectal-cancer/" data-track-click='{"click_type":"other","element_name":"body_link","event":"outbound_click"}' rel=" nofollow"&gt;most common warning sign&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/most-common-symptoms-colon-cancer-under-50s-chart-2024-5" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;colon cancer in patients under 50&lt;/a&gt;.

Part of why it's so difficult to diagnose is that &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/get-colonoscopy-colon-cancer-symptoms-colorectal-oncologist-2024-4" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;early symptoms&lt;/a&gt; like diarrhea and bloating can be caused by everything from hemorrhoids to a &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/colon-cancer-misdiagnosis-young-people-ibs-gluten-allergy-symptoms-2025-3" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;gluten allergy&lt;/a&gt;. The other hurdle is stigma: people just don't want to talk about seeing blood in the toilet or in their pencil-thin stools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Unfortunately, it's something that I see quite frequently," Dr. Fola May, a gastroenterologist and an associate professor of Medicine at UCLA, told BI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said it's common for people to ignore and they may avoid &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/colorectal-cancer-high-mortality-young-people-signs-symptoms-disease-2024-1" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;sharing their symptoms&lt;/a&gt; out of embarrassment. "They delay bringing it up until it gets more and more severe, and they actually can't function or have a normal workday," May added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By then, their cancer is likely to have progressed to later stages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="dc18d645-de64-41b5-9de4-286bba25de41" data-toc-id="dc18d645-de64-41b5-9de4-286bba25de41"&gt;Anal bleeding is common with younger patients&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early colon cancer symptoms are easy to miss. Abdominal pain or constipation can be linked to many different conditions, like &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/woman-stage-4-colon-cancer-symptoms-pain-2025-3" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;celiac disease or IBS. &lt;/a&gt;That's why rectal bleeding is important to flag.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joshua Demb, a researcher who studies early-onset colon cancer and an assistant professor at the University of California, San Diego, led a &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2819248" data-track-click='{"click_type":"other","element_name":"body_link","event":"outbound_click"}' rel=" nofollow"&gt;2024 study&lt;/a&gt; on the most common symptoms of colon cancer in young people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Demb's study found rectal bleeding was the most common sign of colon cancer — more than altered bowel movements or abdominal pain — because it was more specific and harder to explain with &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/colon-cancer-environmental-causes-microplastics-antibiotics-sleep-2025-1" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;lifestyle changes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It can be hard to know how seriously to take some symptoms. Anal bleeding is often caused by non-life threatening conditions like &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/health/conditions-symptoms/why-does-my-butthole-itch" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;hemorrhoids&lt;/a&gt;. Some patients who are otherwise young, healthy, and who have no family history can be dismissed by doctors, partly because colonoscopies are more involved procedures and can &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.goodrx.com/conditions/colon-cancer/colonoscopy-cost" data-track-click='{"click_type":"other","element_name":"body_link","event":"outbound_click"}' rel=" nofollow"&gt;cost a few thousand dollars&lt;/a&gt; without insurance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The difficult work is making sure a symptom is "attributed to the correct condition," Demb said, without preemptively scaring people or overlooking the early signs of colorectal cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="c1f258d5-c987-48db-ae17-f32bbac8c3fe" data-toc-id="c1f258d5-c987-48db-ae17-f32bbac8c3fe"&gt;Millennials are afraid to talk about stool&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Poop has a long history of &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/why-is-shitting-still-so-embarrassing/" data-track-click='{"click_type":"other","element_name":"body_link","event":"outbound_click"}' rel=" nofollow"&gt;being taboo&lt;/a&gt;, regarded as unsanitary and embarrassing. As societies like &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.ted.com/pages/why-are-we-so-awkward-about-poop-transcript" data-track-click='{"click_type":"other","element_name":"body_link","event":"outbound_click"}' rel=" nofollow"&gt;Victorian-era England&lt;/a&gt; developed indoor plumbing and individual latrines to replace communal ones, defecation became more private — and consequently more shameful to talk about in public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stigma has never really gone away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From interviewing colon cancer patients, Demb learned many young people are afraid to broach the topic of poop and rectal bleeding with their doctor, even though that conversation could be life-saving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Part of that apprehension comes from probably not having had to discuss this ever before in their care," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As people enter their 50s and colonoscopies become standard care, talking about bowel movements becomes slightly more normalized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Naiké Vorbe started cycling through diarrhea and constipation, she didn't know how to talk about it, and hesitated at first. "You don't really speak about gastrointestinal issues," Vorbe, who grew up in Haiti, told BI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vorbe was diagnosed with &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/woman-years-of-stomach-pain-diagnosed-colon-cancer-2025-5" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;stage 3B colon cancer&lt;/a&gt; at 31. By then, her cancer had spread so much that she needed to have parts of her colon and liver removed.&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;figure class="figure image-figure-image   " data-type="img" data-e2e-name="image-figure-image" data-media-container="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;

              &lt;/figure&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Chris Rodriguez, who was otherwise fit and healthy when he was diagnosed with stage 3 rectal cancer at 35, remembers feeling embarrassed about sharing his digestive agony with friends, relatives, and even doctors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He feels from personal experience that younger people are averse to talking about cancer because they feel they're "not supposed to" be worrying about it yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I know that people are too afraid to talk about these things with their doctor, too afraid to talk about these things with anybody around them," Rodriguez, now 37, told BI. "That's pretty scary for me."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vorbe and Rodriguez both had late-stage cancer and rectal bleeding as a symptom. It makes the symptom all the more important to flag: sometimes, blood in the stool won't show up until the cancer has progressed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="0528ada7-dce3-4dfe-9e83-605df7806c0f" data-toc-id="0528ada7-dce3-4dfe-9e83-605df7806c0f"&gt;The push to make rectal bleeding less taboo&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brooks Bell, one of the Worldclass co-founders, remembers struggling to share how she was feeling with her husband — they weren't the types to use the bathroom with the door open, for instance.&lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/figure&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;But ultimately, the biggest change might have to start in the doctor's office. Even though she's a GI doctor, May said she still gets patients who blush when they talk about their bowel movements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;May says she tries to shift that dynamic by being intentional about her language. "When I'm in public, I say words like 'rectum' and 'poop' and 'stool,'" she said, adding that she wants her peers to do the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Talking about blood in poop should be as normalized as talking about spotting &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/breast-cancer-signs-symptoms-lump-nipple-discharge-pain-2022-9" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;breast cancer lumps&lt;/a&gt;, May said.

If you have ongoing rectal bleeding for the first time in your life or unusual stomach pain that won't go away, consider &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/i-had-my-first-colonoscopy-in-my-twenties-2024-10" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;booking a colonoscopy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;May also suggested getting a colonoscopy sooner if you have any family history of the cancer. She recommended getting screened at age 40 instead of the standard 45, and for primary care physicians to start bringing up the potential of screening before age 45 in general.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because colonoscopies can be expensive and inaccessible to people under 45, the best anyone can do is be vigilant, Demb said of symptoms like anal bleeding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rodriguez, who is now cancer-free, believes it's important to investigate any warning signs. "You're not being silly by thinking about them," he said. "You're not overreacting by thinking it could be cancer."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Additional reporting by Kim Schewitz and Mia de Graaf.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

                                        &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Many people ignore or downplay the sudden symptoms of a transient ischemic attack (TIA), also called a ministroke—but new research suggests that's a mistake. A large study published in &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaneurology/article-abstract/2830012"&gt;&lt;em&gt;JAMA Neurology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by the University of Alabama-Birmingham and University of Cincinnati tracked more than 30,000 adults and found TIA survivors show a cognitive decline over five years that matches the rate seen in stroke survivors, per &lt;a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/ministrokes-can-be-just-as-dangerous-for-the-brain-as-regular-strokes/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Scientific American&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The decline isn't usually immediate, but over time, and TIAs appear to change a person's cognitive trajectory, possibly leading to increased risk for dementia later. "If you have one stroke or one TIA ... the rate of cognitive decline is the same," says lead author Victor Del Bene.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        About 240,000 Americans every year &lt;a href="https://www.stroke.org/en/help-and-support/resource-library/lets-talk-about-stroke/transient-ischemic-attack#:~:text=About%20240%2C000%20Americans%20experience%20a,severe%20stroke%20within%20a%20year."&gt;have a TIA&lt;/a&gt;. Symptoms are fleeting, often resolving within minutes, so many don't seek urgent care. Indiana office manager Kristin Kramer, 54, is one example. She experienced slurred speech and weakness in her hand but returned to bed without seeking help. Her symptoms disappeared, but days later she was unable to sign her name and learned she'd had a small stroke. Doctors warn that ignoring-the-problem approach is risky: The chance of a full stroke within 90 days is 5% to 20%, with much of that risk in the first two days.

                                        "These events are serious, acute, and dangerous," Dr. Clay Johnston, a neurologist and chief medical officer at Harbor Health in Austin, Texas, tells the &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/17/health/elderly-tia-stroke.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Experts urge using the &lt;a href="https://www.dukehealth.org/blog/know-signs-of-stroke-be-fast"&gt;"BE FAST" checklist&lt;/a&gt;—for balance, eyesight, face, arms, speech, and time, as in don't let too much time pass before calling 911 at the first sign of trouble. The overriding takeaway: TIAs are more serious than their "transient" label suggests, and ignoring symptoms or putting off treatment can lead to lasting harm. Some experts argue for renaming TIAs "minor ischemic strokes" to prompt faster responses—or to simply include the word "stroke" somewhere in the description, per the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt;.

New research reveals that our circadian rhythms track daylight shifts across seasons, impacting mood, sleep alignment, and overall health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using data from medical residents and genetic samples, the study found that individuals’ internal clocks are tuned to both dawn and dusk, and that some people may be more genetically sensitive to these shifts. This dual-clock mechanism suggests deeper physiological seasonality and opens new paths for understanding disorders like seasonal affective disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dual Circadian Clocks:&lt;/strong&gt; Humans have two internal clocks—one tracks dawn, the other dusk.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Genetic Sensitivity:&lt;/strong&gt; Some individuals are more vulnerable to sleep disruption from seasonal shifts.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Health Implications:&lt;/strong&gt; Misalignment with circadian rhythms may affect mood, metabolism, and cardiovascular health.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Michigan&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s tempting to think that, with our fancy electric lights and indoor bedrooms, humanity has evolved beyond the natural influence of sunlight when it comes to our sleep routines. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But new research from the University of Michigan shows that our circadian rhythms are still wild at heart, tracking the seasonal changes in daylight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Humans really are seasonal, even though we might not want to admit that in our modern context,” said study author Ruby Kim, U-M postdoctoral assistant professor of mathematics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-110466"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/seasonal-circadain-sleep-neuroscince.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/seasonal-circadain-sleep-neuroscince-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/seasonal-circadain-sleep-neuroscince-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/seasonal-circadain-sleep-neuroscince-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/seasonal-circadain-sleep-neuroscince-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/seasonal-circadain-sleep-neuroscince-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/seasonal-circadain-sleep-neuroscince-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/seasonal-circadain-sleep-neuroscince.jpg" alt="This shows a person sleeping and DNA." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/seasonal-circadain-sleep-neuroscince.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/seasonal-circadain-sleep-neuroscince-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/seasonal-circadain-sleep-neuroscince-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/seasonal-circadain-sleep-neuroscince-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/seasonal-circadain-sleep-neuroscince-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/seasonal-circadain-sleep-neuroscince-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/seasonal-circadain-sleep-neuroscince-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Now, the U-M team has provided some of the strongest support for the idea yet in observing how that seasonality plays out in a large, real-world study. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Day length, the amount of sunlight we get, it really influences our physiology. The study shows that our biologically hardwired seasonal timing affects how we adjust to changes in our daily schedules.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This finding could enable new ways to probe and understand seasonal affective disorder, a type of depression that’s connected to seasonal changes. It could also open new areas of inquiry in a range of other health issues that are connected to the alignment of our sleep schedules and circadian clocks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, researchers—including the study’s senior author, Daniel Forger—have previously shown that our moods are strongly affected by how well our sleep schedules align with our circadian rhythms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This work shows a lot of promise for future findings,” Kim said of the new study published in the journal &lt;em&gt;npj Digital Medicine.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This may have deeper implications for mental health issues, like mood and anxiety, but also metabolic and cardiovascular conditions as well.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research also showed there is a genetic component of this seasonality in humans, which could help explain the vast differences in how strongly individuals are affected by changes in day length.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For some people they might be able to adapt better, but for other people it could be a whole lot worse,” said Forger, U-M professor of math and director of the Michigan Center for Applied and Interdisciplinary Mathematics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exploring this genetic component will help researchers and doctors understand where individuals fall on that spectrum, but getting to that point will take more time and effort. For now, this study is an early but important step that reframes how we conceive of human circadian rhythms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A lot of people tend to think of their circadian rhythms as a single clock,” Forger said. “What we’re showing is that there’s not really one clock, but there are two. One is trying to track dawn and the other is trying to track dusk, and they’re talking to each other.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kim, Forger and their colleagues revealed that people’s circadian rhythms were tuned into the seasonality of sunlight by studying sleep data from thousands of people using wearable health devices, like Fitbits. Participants were all medical residents completing a one-year internship who had enrolled in the Intern Health Study, funded by the National Institutes of Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interns are shift workers whose schedules change frequently, meaning their sleep schedules do as well. Furthermore, these schedules are often at odds with the natural cycles of day and night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fact that circadian rhythms in this population exhibited a seasonal dependence is a compelling argument for just how hardwired this feature is in humans, which isn’t altogether surprising, the researchers said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s a lot of evidence from studies of fruit flies and rodents that animals possess seasonal circadian clocks, Forger said, and other researchers have thought humans’ circadian clocks may behave similarly. Now, the U-M team has provided some of the strongest support for the idea yet in observing how that seasonality plays out in a large, real-world study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think it actually makes a lot of sense. Brain physiology has been at work for millions of years trying to track dusk and dawn,” Forger said. “Then industrialization comes along in the blink of evolution’s eye and, right now, we’re still racing to catch up.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants in the Intern Health Study also provide a saliva sample for DNA testing, which enabled Kim and Forger’s team to include a genetic component of their study. Genetic studies led by other researchers have identified a specific gene that plays an important role in how other animals’ circadian clocks track seasonal changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Humans share this gene, which allowed the U-M team to identify a small percentage of interns with slight variations in the genetic makeup of that gene. For that group of people, shift work was more disruptive to the alignment of their circadian clocks and sleep schedules over seasons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again, this raises many questions especially about health implications and the influence of shift work on different individuals. But these are questions the researchers plan to explore in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this genetics and circadian rhythm research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#315c504545415e434571445c5852591f545544" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Matt Davenport&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://umich.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Michigan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Matt Davenport – University of Michigan&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41746-025-01678-z" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Seasonal timing and interindividual differences in shiftwork adaptation&lt;/a&gt;” by Ruby Kim et al. &lt;em&gt;npj Digital Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Seasonal timing and interindividual differences in shiftwork adaptation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Millions of shift workers in the U.S. face an increased risk of depression, cancer, and metabolic disease, yet individual responses to shift work vary widely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We find that a conserved biological system of morning and evening oscillators, which evolved for seasonal timing, may contribute to these interindividual differences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this study, we analyze seasonality in medical interns working shifts, revealing that summer-winter variation correlates with increased circadian misalignment after shift work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mathematical modeling suggests that seasonal timing influences the rate of adaptation to new schedules, predicting differential effects on morning and evening oscillators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, we examine genetic polymorphisms linked to seasonality in animals and find that human variants can impact how quickly circadian rhythms respond to schedule changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on our findings, we hypothesize that the vast interindividual differences in shift work adaptation—critical for shift worker health—can in part be explained by biological mechanisms for seasonal timing.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Thu, 29 May 2025 14:59:46 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMia0FVX3lxTE5hWXRNYjJEd19mMXVqM1Zwd29aWGVUOHlBMWpwZmZKTEUtMDNLMmgyTzNDMW0wUEh1ZWFDampUXzBaN1ZJTlN1elh0OXFDY1Z3RkxQYVdsUnMydFZQU2xiNFZENHNaVnJYbURv</guid></item><item><title>当导致瘫痪的寨卡病毒袭击美国度假热点时，医生发出警报-每日邮报 | Doctors sound alarm as paralysis-causing Zika virus hits US vacation hotspot - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinAFBVV95cUxNaUNfTXphWVNxR2pOaVFBMWtqQkpoNVhrQmZvRm1ZT0M3SkJENTRYd1hKcjhIUHFIc0t1N3BTWDROeDZrTkpfM0VEMjRDOGN1OWxfblU2bXZjSDFyMEN2djh6OENwdWxuWTRtdS0tV0NNM2xhSEp6QXFQZkYtVzRZcVlMdC1RTVJRa2c2NHVPRk5EZWs2T2dKMmUzcW3SAaIBQVVfeXFMTWhMWV9vQVBqZGFoXzRoMjNEcHh3cWxRSVZnSkI0M2s2anhDWTFVdmtnbUtONUhmWEVQeFhpT2o1LWdPdE00OThHTm9ONWVkVFk1c3dicjZfUDAxTUVTdHpuQUZrWm9wUkN0TS05dDFQeFFDNHU2QjNFU1p0b2ItdlN0Y2lNR3NsNGVmQ2JjRU5NanNaSFA2MmR3eEcycVFVWWtB?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A mosquito-borne virus linked to birth defects and paralysis has been detected in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/hawaii/index.html" id="mol-e3d08ff0-3c97-11f0-a507-0fdd8d97b93e"&gt;Hawaii&lt;/a&gt; for the first time in years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The state's health department revealed one confirmed case of Zika virus and two cases under surveillance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The confirmed case was a person who had traveled from overseas, while officials have pinpointed two individuals who 'may have been exposed'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;All three patients spent their time on the island of Oʻahu and in the sparsely-populated north shore neighborhoods of Waialua and Haleʻiwa. It is the &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14750265/hepatitis-outbreak-elite-enclave-rich-famous-provincetown-massachusetts.html"&gt;first reported case&lt;/a&gt; of Zika in Hawaii since 2019.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;a target="_self" href="/news/zika_virus/index.html" id="mol-969a7ef0-3c90-11f0-afc7-91e278030920" class=""&gt;Zika virus&lt;/a&gt; is transmitted by the Aedes species of mosquito, which also spread dengue and chikungunya viruses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They are common in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/texas/index.html" id="mol-969c2ca0-3c90-11f0-afc7-91e278030920"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/florida/index.html" id="mol-969b1b30-3c90-11f0-afc7-91e278030920"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt; and elsewhere in the US, particularly in the south.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Most adults do not become seriously ill from the infection, but in rare cases it can cause damage to the nerves, brain, or spinal cord as well as a blood disorder that can result in bleeding, bruising or slow blood clotting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Zika infection during pregnancy can also cause serious birth defects and is linked to pregnancy complications, including miscarriage, stillbirth and preterm birth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The Zika virus has landed in Hawaii, with two individuals exposed to the paralysis-causing infection&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the US, Zika virus cases are mostly travel-associated, with limited local transmission. The number of cases has varied significantly year to year, with a high point in 2016. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In that year, there were over 5,000 travel-associated cases, with 224 locally acquired cases. However, following this high, the number of cases dropped significantly, to over 400 in 2017 and in 2023, there were just 7 confirmed cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Hawaii's health department says it is currently monitoring mosquito activity in the affected areas and will 'implement further control measures as needed'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Residents and tourists alike are being urged to take additional precautions to reduce mosquito breeding and avoid bites. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some of the recommendations on a health advisory include wearing insect repellent at all times while outdoors and dressing in loose-fitting long-sleeved shirts and pants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Islanders have also been instructed to check their insect screens are intact, with doors kept closed. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, any standing water around homes and buildings should be removed, as this is where mosquitos tend to breed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Once it takes hold in a human host, the Zika virus can be spread between people during unprotected sex, and from pregnant mothers to their children. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The virus has been found in semen, vaginal fluids, saliva, urine and breast milk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Zika virus symptoms are typically mild and may include fever, rash, headache, joint pain, red eyes and muscle pain. Symptoms typically last a few days to a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About 80 percent of Zika infections are asymptomatic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There is no preventive vaccine or treatment, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Once it takes hold in a human host, the Zika virus can be spread between people during unprotected sex, and from pregnant mothers to their children&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Fetuses' brains can be affected by the virus when it is passed on from the mother and it can cause microcephaly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Microcephaly is a condition in which babies' heads are unusually small, which can lead to seizures, delayed development and other disabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The virus can also increase the risk of unborn children developing Guillain-Barre syndrome – an uncommon illness in which the immune system attacks the nerves and can cause muscle weakness and paralysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While Hawaii has the mosquito species capable of transmitting Zika, health officials say the virus is not established in the region. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mosquito-borne disease experts are concerned that as global temperatures continue to rise, warmer, more humid weather will become the norm in new places, making those locations the perfect breeding grounds for mosquito populations to flourish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And as temperatures heat up and mosquitoes migrate to places they previously couldn't thrive in, their extended reach and longer lifespans give them ample opportunity to spread diseases in new parts of the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To date, Zika has been most prevalent in Central and South America, Africa and South East Asia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There was an outbreak of the virus in Brazil's capital, Rio de Janeiro, in 2016, and there were fears that year's Olympic Games would have to be cancelled after more than 200 academics wrote to the World Health Organization warning about it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Thu, 29 May 2025 14:30:11 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinAFBVV95cUxNaUNfTXphWVNxR2pOaVFBMWtqQkpoNVhrQmZvRm1ZT0M3SkJENTRYd1hKcjhIUHFIc0t1N3BTWDROeDZrTkpfM0VEMjRDOGN1OWxfblU2bXZjSDFyMEN2djh6OENwdWxuWTRtdS0tV0NNM2xhSEp6QXFQZkYtVzRZcVlMdC1RTVJRa2c2NHVPRk5EZWs2T2dKMmUzcW3SAaIBQVVfeXFMTWhMWV9vQVBqZGFoXzRoMjNEcHh3cWxRSVZnSkI0M2s2anhDWTFVdmtnbUtONUhmWEVQeFhpT2o1LWdPdE00OThHTm9ONWVkVFk1c3dicjZfUDAxTUVTdHpuQUZrWm9wUkN0TS05dDFQeFFDNHU2QjNFU1p0b2ItdlN0Y2lNR3NsNGVmQ2JjRU5NanNaSFA2MmR3eEcycVFVWWtB</guid></item><item><title>植物性蛋白质可能有助于降低高血压风险-《西雅图时报》 | Plant-based proteins may help lower high blood pressure risk - The Seattle Times</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimwFBVV95cUxQM1FzQnJBYmx2ZVZPa0hVYWYtS0MzLUMwOFdod3VYcDY5VGpEQmFLQVU0YWZtWTFqMGZFSWswR2tfZ3ktYVFQNDJQR1R2eG1FU1BVRDBkaHVQdUNQcHI3TXEtT0pDa2ZmdFpyTlRhX19ZeWNwNkUyZE4xaVlrZDRkY1dtV3UtMG1lWkFHN01KU3lFWjdnbTM5Sndabw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-content" class="article-content entry-content"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Eating more minimally processed plant-based proteins – such as beans, nuts and lentils – may lower the risk for high blood pressure, according to new research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/JAHA.124.037813" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;, published recently in the Journal of the American Heart Association, also suggested that minimally processed animal proteins could be included in weekly meal plans without significantly affecting a person’s high blood pressure risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our study focused on foods, not the plant-based supplements that can be found on store shelves,” said the study’s senior author Dr. Marcia Otto, a nutritional epidemiologist and an associate professor at UT Health Houston School of Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearly half of adults in the U.S. have high blood pressure, or hypertension, a condition that raises the risk for heart attacks, strokes and other health problems. Prior research has shown diet plays a critical role in the prevention and management of high blood pressure. A large body of evidence finds that eating patterns rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains and low-fat dairy that are also low in sodium and saturated fat can significantly reduce blood pressure. But how proteins within these eating patterns affect blood pressure has been unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the new study, researchers investigated how the quantity and diversity of proteins a person eats from plant and animal sources might affect their hypertension risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers analyzed data for 2,294 participants in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis who filled out a 120-item questionnaire about the foods they ate. Participants also indicated they had no history of high blood pressure. They were an average 58 years old at the start of the study and were followed for up to 18 years, with a median follow-up of almost nine years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, participants reported eating an average of 68 grams per day of protein, with about 24 grams coming from plant sources and the rest coming from animals. On average, participants consumed nine different types of protein per week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers found no strong evidence to support a link between animal protein intake and high blood pressure risk. But they did find that the more plant-based proteins a person ate, the lower their risk for hypertension.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For every 20 grams of plant-based protein consumed each day, the risk for hypertension decreased by 16% compared to those who ate the fewest plant foods. Those benefits leveled out once a person consumed 30 grams of plant-based protein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But eating a broader range of plant protein sources ended up increasing high blood pressure risk among the participants. While the study did not investigate why, Otto said the findings indicate that participants who consumed a broader range of plant protein sources may include highly processed plant-based options in their diet, which could increase the risk of high blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Their eating patterns started to move toward less healthy plant protein options,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The amount of protein found in plants and animals varies. For example, 3 ounces of light tuna fish canned in water has almost 22 grams of protein, 1 cup of store-bought hummus has 19 grams, and 1 cup of boiled lima beans has 15 grams. According to the American Heart Association, which funded the new study, good sources of plant-based protein include beans and legumes, chickpeas, lentils, edamame, nut butter, oats, quinoa, nuts and seeds, tofu and soy milk. These whole foods also contain high levels of dietary fiber, vitamins, minerals and other nutrients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think in many ways this study reaffirms things we already knew,” said Dr. Matthew Landry, an assistant professor of population health and disease prevention at the University of California, Irvine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the findings underscore the importance of choosing those plant proteins wisely, Landry said. He was not involved in the research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to plant-based proteins, it’s important to choose whole food sources, he said. “People should focus on more minimally processed proteins rather than the highly processed ones.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, Landry said, “a very simple plant-based protein like tofu is very different from a burger made from meat alternatives. Both contain plant proteins, but they undergo different levels of processing,” meaning they can have different amounts of sodium, saturated fat and other additives. “You can’t just lump them under the same ‘healthy’ umbrella,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p id="userMessagingIn-story"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The researchers also observed reduced production of new neurons in the hippocampus and elevated neural inflammation. The findings were published in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022316625000306?via%3Dihub"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Journal of Nutrition.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin K is a fat-soluble vitamin essential for blood clotting. It activates proteins that enable blood to coagulate properly. Without adequate vitamin K, even minor injuries can result in excessive bleeding. Vitamin K also contributes to bone health by regulating calcium deposition and supporting bone mineralization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are two main forms of this vitamin: vitamin K1 (phylloquinone), found primarily in leafy green vegetables, and vitamin K2 (menaquinone), which includes several subtypes produced by gut bacteria and found in fermented foods and animal products. The predominant form of vitamin K in the brain is menaquinone-4, a subtype of vitamin K2. Adequate intake of vitamin K has also been linked to a lower risk of osteoporosis and cardiovascular disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study author Tong Zheng and his colleagues noted that previous research found higher concentrations of menaquinone-4 in the brains of deceased individuals who had better cognitive function prior to death. Other studies have associated greater brain levels of menaquinone-4 with fewer symptoms of dementia. With this background, the researchers aimed to investigate how vitamin K deficiency might affect cognitive function in mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study involved sixty 9-month-old C57BL/6 mice, a widely used inbred laboratory strain known for its genetic consistency and sensitivity to dietary and metabolic changes. These characteristics make it a suitable model for nutritional neuroscience research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mice were randomly assigned to one of two groups. One group received a control diet containing the recommended amount of vitamin K1 (1 mg/kg), while the other group received a diet low in vitamin K (80 μg/kg). Both diets were based on a vitamin K-deficient basal mix and did not include menadione, a synthetic precursor of vitamin K that is sometimes used in animal feed but is not permitted in human diets due to safety concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mice were kept on these diets for six months. After this period, a subset of the animals underwent two behavioral tests: the Morris water maze (to assess spatial learning and memory) and the novel object recognition test (to measure recognition memory). Two weeks after the behavioral assessments, the mice were euthanized, and their brain tissues were analyzed for vitamin K content and markers of neurogenesis in the hippocampus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers reported that more mice died in the low vitamin K group than in the control group, particularly males, and some displayed signs of visual impairment. Behavioral testing revealed that mice fed the vitamin-K-deficient diet had poorer recognition memory and required more time to learn the spatial task in the water maze, indicating cognitive deficits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Examination of the hippocampus showed that the low vitamin K group had significantly fewer proliferating cells and immature neurons compared to the control group, suggesting reduced neurogenesis. Additionally, these mice exhibited increased signs of neuroinflammation, including changes in microglial morphology, indicating a shift toward a more activated, inflammatory state. Brain tissue analysis confirmed that menaquinone-4 concentrations were significantly lower in the vitamin-K-deficient group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our data indicate that low vitamin K intake reduced menaquinone-4 concentrations in brain tissues and impaired learning- and memory-related cognitive function. This impairment may be related to the observed reduced hippocampal neurogenesis and elevated neural inflammation,” the study authors concluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study sheds light on the effects vitamin K deficiency has on cognitive functioning and brain physiology. However, it should be noted that this was a study on mice, not on humans. While mice and humans share many physiological similarities, they are still very different species. Effects on humans might not be identical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tjnut.2025.01.023"&gt;Low Vitamin K Intake Impairs Cognition, Neurogenesis, and Elevates Neuroinflammation in C57BL/6 Mice&lt;/a&gt;” was authored by Tong Zheng, Shannon Marschall, Jasper Weinberg, Xueyan Fu, Andrew Tarr, Barbara Shukitt-Hale, and Sarah L Booth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>psypost.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 29 May 2025 14:18:37 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiswFBVV95cUxPWXJScW81OTZsRlRSMHNGakVCLV9BSm1BR2laV1lNbUdnZGJFa29UZ1JRRWpzR01NeVhjNWliWTZ4QzEzVE5MZjdWeFZnR29SQmZ4Q2JmMjdNdWYzc2pKbkxmYlhZNlVrbmpCbzlUVld1WlozblIySl9fSTI5dVBVR0RRTXdyMjEzbFIwb0dVeVNGR0JMRjdoQ1NfVFM3WU5DY3ktamk0aFNGWUFNOGo1VmFGOA</guid></item><item><title>根据营养师的说法，在患有糖尿病时保持水分的首选饮料- EatingWell | The #1 Underrated Drink for Staying Hydrated When You Have Diabetes, According to Dietitians - EatingWell</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiwFBVV95cUxQZlNIMFppdVFYclcydkxJMUpFbXhSakwwYXRDN0l3VWhodHhtTXk0MXNYT29tendFZ0VaeEVWM2F6dVhFYy1BN2lBNlZqdm1ldU9mLUZRNGw1NFh2eDNuT3o5WFBZRHJOdVlDZ242M1BOa2Y3M1ZCMk9pSkhTVUxuZXhuaUNaNld4WTFj?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-callout--summary mntl-sc-block-universal-callout--tips mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-summary callout--bordered" data-text="Key Points" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;

&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It’s Free of Added Sugars &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;br&gt;
“Research shows that regularly drinking sugar-sweetened beverages is linked to higher incidences of type 2 diabetes and heart disease,” says &lt;a href="http://www.graciouslynourished.com" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Kelsey Kunik, RDN&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Of course, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/habit-more-hydrated-for-diabetes-11715677" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; is the best choice for hydration. But sometimes, you just need a sweet-tasting pick-me-up, and coconut water without added sugars can be a great choice. An 8-ounce serving of unsweetened coconut water contains roughly 10 grams of carbohydrates.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; While most of these come from natural sugar, they don’t compare to those from sweet tea or soda, which can easily supply two to four times as much sugar from empty-calorie added sugars.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  Because coconut water’s natural sugar comes from a plant, it travels with other helpful nutrients. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It Contains Electrolytes  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “When living with diabetes, it’s important to stay hydrated for optimal blood sugar management,” says &lt;a href="https://www.milkandhoneynutrition.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Mary Ellen Phipps, M.P.H., RDN, LD&lt;/a&gt;, who specializes in working with people with diabetes. Drinking coconut water can help with hydration by replenishing electrolytes you lose through sweat during a workout, being outdoors on a hot day or while fighting off an illness. “In these instances, rehydrating with just water may not be enough,” Kunik says. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Electrolytes are minerals that play lots of important roles in the body, and one of those is holding on to water to prevent dehydration. “[Unsweetened] coconut water naturally contains electrolytes, without all the added sugar found in many sports drinks,” says Kunik. “This makes it a much better choice for blood sugar balance.” 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While coconut water contains several electrolytes, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290053/8-foods-with-more-potassium-than-a-banana/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;potassium&lt;/a&gt; is a standout. In addition to helping with hydration, potassium helps regulate blood pressure. That’s especially important for people with diabetes for two reasons. The first is that people with diabetes are often more prone to heart-health issues. In addition, few of us consume enough potassium. With 400 milligrams of potassium per 8 ounces (roughly 9% of the Daily Value), coconut water can be a helpful way to work in the potassium you need.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It’s Naturally Low in Calories  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Weight management is a key component of a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7886108/diabetes-meal-plan-for-beginners/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;diabetes management plan&lt;/a&gt;. However, sugar-sweetened beverages can be a sneaky source of hidden calories, says Kunik. That’s why &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8076322/best-drink-for-weight-loss/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;choosing low-calorie beverages&lt;/a&gt; is key. Eight ounces of unsweetened coconut water contains about 44 calories. By comparison, a typical sports drink has roughly 65 calories and 13 grams of added sugars per 8-ounce serving.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “Swapping a sugary electrolyte drink with [unsweetened] coconut water reduces the amount of calories you consume while still offering hydration and natural sweetness,” Kunik says. That said, some brands of coconut water can easily contain two servings per container. To know how many calories and carbohydrates are in your bottle, be sure to check out the Nutrition Facts panel.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Hydration has all kinds of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/how-much-water-you-should-drink-daily-11739359" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;health benefits&lt;/a&gt;. But when you’re living with diabetes, adequate fluid intake is especially vital. According to the American Diabetes Association, people with diabetes are more &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8072324/does-dehydration-cause-high-blood-sugar/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;prone to dehydration&lt;/a&gt; because of fluid losses stemming from increased urination as well as certain medications they may take.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; That’s not all, though. “Staying hydrated can help you manage your blood sugar levels,” says Kunik. “Even just a few days of minimal water intake can increase the concentration of sugar in your blood.” 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-other-diabetes-friendly-beverage-options"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Other Diabetes-Friendly Beverage Options &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Water and unsweetened coconut water aren’t the only sensible beverage options for people with diabetes. Unsweetened tea and coffee, sparkling water and sugar-free infused waters can also help you meet your fluid goals.  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; So can choosing the right foods. “Drinking water and eating electrolyte-rich foods, particularly fruits and vegetables, can help keep your body hydrated while also nourishing it with essential vitamins, minerals and fiber that support healthy blood sugars,” Kunik says.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; What about sports drinks? They can work in certain circumstances, like if you’re working out for an hour or more. However, you don’t need them for shorter workouts or day-to-day hydration. “If you're replenishing carbohydrates after a long, sweaty workout, combining a natural source of sugar, like fruit, with protein will steadily refuel your body, instead of the rapid spike that a sugary sports drink may cause when enjoyed by itself,” Kunik says. If you do need a sports drink to replace extensive post-exercise fluid losses, Kunik recommends choosing one with less than 15 grams of sugar per serving. Or, try a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/dietitians-favorite-electrolyte-supplement-11736890" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;sugar-free electrolyte supplement&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Staying hydrated is an essential component of managing diabetes. While water is the best drink for overall hydration, dietitians say unsweetened coconut water is also an excellent—and underrated—hydration drink for people with diabetes. It has no added sugars, is low in calories and is rich in electrolytes. Whether you need a little hydration variety or are sweating up a storm, unsweetened coconut water can be a diabetes-friendly way to get the fluids you need. It can be helpful to know that some brands can contain multiple servings per container. So, be sure to check out the nutrition label to find out how many calories and carbs are in your bottle to make sure they fit with your diabetes management program.&lt;br&gt;

Researchers found that this orexin receptor antagonist not only restored healthier sleep patterns but also preserved brain structure and reduced inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mice treated with lemborexant had up to 40% greater hippocampal volume than untreated controls or those given a different sleep aid. Importantly, these neuroprotective effects were seen only in male mice, which may reflect sex differences in tau pathology severity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neuroprotection:&lt;/strong&gt; Lemborexant reduced tau accumulation and brain cell death in male mice.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Selective Mechanism:&lt;/strong&gt; Only sleep aids blocking orexin receptors, like lemborexant, showed benefits.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Structural Preservation:&lt;/strong&gt; Treated mice had significantly larger hippocampal volumes, a region key to memory.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;WUSTL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A common sleep aid restores healthier sleep patterns and protects mice from the brain damage seen in neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer’s disease, according to new research from Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The drug, lemborexant, prevents the harmful buildup of an abnormal form of a protein called tau in the brain, reducing the inflammatory brain damage tau is known to cause in Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study suggests that lemborexant and other drugs that work in the same way could help treat or prevent the damage caused by tau in multiple neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s, progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal syndrome and some frontotemporal dementias.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published May 27 in &lt;em&gt;Nature Neuroscience.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have known for a long time that sleep loss is a risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease,” said senior author David M. Holtzman, MD, the Barbara Burton and Reuben M. Morriss III Distinguished Professor of Neurology at WashU Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In this new study, we have shown that lemborexant improves sleep and reduces abnormal tau, which appears to be a main driver of the neurological damage that we see in Alzheimer’s and several related disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are hopeful this finding will lead to further studies of this sleep medication and the development of new therapeutics that may be more effective than current options either alone or in combination with other available treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The antibodies to amyloid that we now use to treat patients with early, mild Alzheimer’s dementia are helpful, but they don’t slow the disease down as much as we would like,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We need ways to reduce the abnormal tau buildup and its accompanying inflammation, and this type of sleep aid is worth looking at further. We are interested in whether going after both amyloid and tau with a combination of therapies could be more effective at slowing or stopping the progression of this disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Holtzman and his team were among the first to identify the connection between poor sleep as a risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease and the buildup of proteins such as amyloid and tau.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In past work studying mice genetically prone to amyloid and tau buildup characteristic of Alzheimer’s disease, they showed that sleep deprivation makes this buildup worse. Improving sleep in these mice with lemborexant appeared to be protective, the latest study showed, with less buildup of tau protein tangles and less nerve cell death associated with Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The protein tau accumulates in the brain in multiple neurological disorders, including Alzheimer’s, and causes inflammation and the death of brain cells. Holtzman and his team, co-led by first author Samira Parhizkar, PhD, an instructor in neurology, tested lemborexant in part because it has effects in parts of the brain known to be affected by abnormal tau accumulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also does not impair motor coordination, which is a concern for people with dementia taking hypnotic sleep aids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lemborexant is one of three sleep drugs approved by the Food and Drug Administration that inhibit the effect of orexins, small proteins that regulate sleep, by acting as orexin receptor antagonists. Lemborexant blocks both orexin receptors (type 1 and type 2).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Receptors are proteins on the cell surface that bind to other molecules and regulate cell activity. These receptors are known to play important roles in sleep-wake cycles and appetite, among other physiological processes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pharmaceutical company Eisai provided lemborexant for these studies as part of a research collaboration with WashU Medicine focused on developing innovative treatments for Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease and other neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In mice genetically prone to harmful tau buildup, lemborexant reduced brain damage compared with control mice. For example, those receiving lemborexant showed 30% to 40% larger volume in the hippocampus — a part of the brain important for forming memories — compared with control mice and those receiving a different sleep drug, zolpidem, which belongs to a different class of drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zolpidem increased sleep but had none of the protective effects against tau accumulation in the brain that were seen with lemborexant, suggesting that the type of sleep aid — orexin receptor antagonist — is key in producing the neuroprotective effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also found that the beneficial effects were only seen in male mice, which they are still working to understand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Normal tau is important in maintaining the structure and function of neurons. When healthy, it carries a small number of chemical tags called phosphate groups. But when tau picks up too many of these chemical tags, it can clump together, leading to inflammation and nerve cell death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors found that by blocking orexin receptors, lemborexant prevents excess tags from being added to tau, helping tau maintain its healthy roles in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Holtzman said his team is continuing to explore the reasons lemborexant treatment’s neuroprotective effects were seen only in male mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He speculated that the sex discrepancy could be due to the observation that female mice with the same genetic predisposition to tau accumulation developed less-severe neurodegeneration compared with male mice. With less damage to begin with, potential beneficial effects of the drug could have been smaller and more difficult to detect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;This work was supported by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), grant numbers P01NS074969, RF1NS090934 and RF1AG061776; the JPB Foundation; the Alzheimer’s Association, grant number AARF-21-850865; the Rainwater Foundation, and a COBRAS Feldman Fellowship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Holtzman is an inventor on a patent licensed by Washington University to C2N Diagnostics on the therapeutic use of anti-tau antibodies.
