Researchers found that the MIND diet is particularly effective at lowering the risk of conditions such as dementia, stroke, depression, and anxiety. These findings were published recently in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eclinm.2025.103616" target="_blank"&gt;eClinicalMedicine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neurological and psychiatric disorders represent a leading cause of disability worldwide. As the global population ages, the burden of these conditions continues to grow. Doctors currently possess few curative options for diseases like dementia. This reality makes prevention a primary goal for public health officials. Prior research has identified links between nutrition and individual health outcomes. However, previous studies often examined single dietary patterns or single diseases in isolation. This fragmented approach has left gaps in understanding how different diets compare directly against one another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A team of researchers sought to address these knowledge gaps. They wanted to determine which dietary patterns offer the most comprehensive benefits for the brain. The investigation was led by Yisen Shi, Yixiang Lin, and Yiling Zheng from Fujian Medical University Union Hospital in China. They aimed to create a holistic picture of the connection between food and neurological health. Their team also sought to uncover the specific biological mechanisms that explain why certain foods help or harm the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers analyzed data from the UK Biobank to conduct their investigation. This is a massive biomedical database containing health information from residents of the United Kingdom. The study included nearly 170,000 participants. These individuals were between the ages of 37 and 73. None of the selected participants had a diagnosis of a brain disorder at the start of the study. The research team tracked the health of these individuals for a median period of roughly ten years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team evaluated ten different healthy eating scores. These included well-known regimens like the Mediterranean diet and the DASH diet. They also assessed the Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay, or MIND diet. In addition to healthy patterns, they calculated the intake of ultra-processed foods. These are industrial food products that typically contain additives, preservatives, and artificial flavorings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers used statistical models to compare these diets against the incidence of five major disorders. These disorders were dementia, Parkinson’s disease, stroke, depression, and anxiety. The analysis revealed that the MIND diet offered the broadest neuroprotective effects. This eating pattern combines elements of the Mediterranean and DASH diets. It specifically emphasizes green leafy vegetables, berries, nuts, whole grains, and fish. It also advises limiting butter, cheese, and red meat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants who adhered closely to the MIND diet saw significant benefits. The data showed a reduced likelihood of developing dementia. The risk of suffering a stroke was also lower in this group. Mental health outcomes were similarly positive. High adherence to the MIND diet correlated with lower risks for both depression and anxiety. The study did not find a significant link between the MIND diet and Parkinson’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results for ultra-processed foods were starkly different. High consumption of these foods was associated with negative health outcomes. The analysis linked processed food intake to an increased risk of dementia. It also showed a correlation with higher risks for depression and anxiety. Unlike the healthy dietary patterns, high consumption of ultra-processed foods was also linked to a greater risk of Parkinson’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers sought to confirm these findings in other populations. They utilized data from two independent groups. These were the U.S. Health and Retirement Study and the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey. This validation step ensures that the results are not specific to just one region or culture. The protective associations of the MIND diet held true in these diverse cohorts. The diet was linked to better cognitive performance and fewer symptoms of depression and anxiety in both the American and Chinese groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A key innovation of this study was its focus on biological mechanisms. The researchers wanted to understand how diet physically alters the body to protect the brain. They analyzed blood samples and brain imaging data from a subset of the participants. They looked at biomarkers related to metabolism, inflammation, and aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study suggests the MIND diet works through several specific pathways. One major pathway involves metabolism. The diet appears to improve the body’s lipid profile. This includes how the body processes cholesterol and triglycerides. A favorable metabolic signature explained a large proportion of the reduced risk for stroke. It also accounted for a significant part of the reduction in depression and anxiety risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another pathway involves the biological aging process. The researchers measured markers that indicate how fast the body’s cells are aging relative to chronological age. Adherence to the MIND diet was associated with slower biological aging. This deceleration in aging appeared to be the primary way the diet reduces the risk of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Body composition played a role as well. The MIND diet was linked to a lower Body Mass Index. This reduction in obesity contributed to the lowered risk of depression and anxiety. The diet also seemed to reduce chronic inflammation in the body. Lower inflammation levels are generally associated with better long-term health outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brain imaging provided physical evidence of these benefits. The researchers examined magnetic resonance imaging scans. They found that people who followed the MIND diet had preserved brain volume in key areas. These areas included the pallidum and the thalamus. These brain structures are essential for processing sensory information and regulating emotions. High intake of ultra-processed foods was linked to reduced volume in these same areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team also performed a detailed analysis of proteins in the blood. This technique is known as proteomics. They identified specific proteins that act as mediators between diet and disease. One protein called GDF-15 was highlighted. Changes in levels of this protein helped explain the link between processed foods and depression. The analysis indicated that these proteins are involved in immune responses and metabolic regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also utilized a technique called Mendelian randomization. This method uses genetic data to infer potential causal relationships. The results supported the idea that the diet’s metabolic effects directly influence aging and obesity markers. This strengthens the argument that the diet causes the health improvements rather than just being associated with them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are limitations to this research. It is primarily an observational study. This design can identify strong associations but cannot definitively prove cause and effect. Participants reported their own dietary intake through questionnaires. Self-reported data is subject to memory errors and may not capture long-term changes in eating habits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study population in the UK Biobank is predominantly of European descent. While the validation cohorts included American and Chinese participants, the results may not apply perfectly to every global population. The researchers attempted to adjust for lifestyle factors like smoking and exercise. However, residual factors could still influence the results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future research is necessary to confirm these findings. The authors suggest that randomized controlled trials are the next logical step. Such trials would assign participants to specific diets and monitor their health over time. This would provide more definitive evidence of the biological pathways involved. Researchers should also investigate how these dietary changes affect brain health at different stages of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study provides a detailed roadmap of how food impacts the brain. It highlights the MIND diet as a promising strategy for reducing the burden of neurological and psychiatric disorders. It also identifies ultra-processed foods as a significant modifiable risk factor. The findings offer potential targets for future medical interventions and public health guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eclinm.2025.103616" target="_blank"&gt;Association between different dietary patterns and the risk of major brain disorders: a prospective multi-cohort study&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Yisen Shi, Yixiang Lin, Yiling Zheng, Xinxi Yu, Binfan Ou, Kaitai Yang, Fabin Lin, Xinyang Zou, Jiayi Zheng, Ruitian Zeng, Xuan Lin, Qinyong Ye, Lina Chen, Yuqi Zeng, and Guoen Cai.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 17:01:46 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijAFBVV95cUxOV3hmNzZkc2ExVVBaVy1PSE5GSm4zUmt3R3ZxZktvamF6c1dESnJvdUZRZ3c1a08ybGdHNDdtSkRVWWEyaXFydDlPUVJUZkltdGpiTDJnYVkxZktWM0F3ZUk5TW51eTBNZnd5cFBXUS1LZ3NyNDFNdVJ3WXdWU2lIZHJQUGZyUFF0bXNNUA</guid></item><item><title>一半的GLP-1用户放弃注射—有些人正在转向其他减肥方法- MarketWatch</title><link>https://www.marketwatch.com/story/half-of-glp-1-users-ditch-their-injections-and-some-are-turning-to-other-weight-loss-methods-instead-8effac61</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>MarketWatch</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 16:51:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi2wFBVV95cUxQZnVYMWx3eVJZT0RJSFFPQjNsVXlvdGtjYWVMYU8tN05GV0xfTm55bHU0SWpzdjFwb0xHTW9xZ01jSG83aktvLXdTRDItNUFmVlhZNGlwT3o0S05BVlJKUWVJUXNGZGR4N1BUdjFCb2tWc3NybVo2YjhYQXpfbm43WmdqaG1MZTRzT21MMk5JSlRTU2E3UjFQZV9xZWc4MHlCcVAtbTdVN3cxT0VMOThYckZabmMtWXNoRGV4ejZOOTg3dmlyakppSDQ5MS1CYkhweDVkc3lrRjV2Y1E</guid></item><item><title>新地图显示了如何在邮政编码中识别麻疹风险水平- ABC新闻</title><link>https://abcnews.go.com/Health/new-map-shows-spot-measles-risk-level-zip/story?id=129179712</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="xvlfx ZRifP TKoO eaKKC EcdEg bOdfO qXhdi NFNeu UyHES " data-testid="prism-article-body"&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;&lt;em class=" "&gt;Type in your ZIP code below or search your county to see vaccination levels and the risk in your area. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em class=" "&gt;Move your cursor over your neighborhood for results.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;As measles has spread throughout the United States, with &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://abcnews.go.com/Health/us-measles-cases-hit-highest-number-33-years/story?id=123564379" target="_blank" dir="ltr"&gt;cases recently reaching a 33-year high&lt;/a&gt;, many Americans have worried about their risk level. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;For the first time, a map has been created that allows people to type in their ZIP code and see an estimated percentage of their neighbors who have been vaccinated against measles, which can help determine the risk of the disease in their area. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Vaccination status is the most critical factor in determining one's risk, doctors say, and lower rates of vaccination allow the virus to spread more easily in communities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The data was provided through a collaboration of researchers from Boston Children's Hospital, Harvard School of Medicine and Icahn School of Medicine at Mt.

Almost 90% of cases in 2025 were associated with outbreaks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;For the study, the researchers used a nationally representative sample of more than 22,000 adults with children under age 5 who received one or more doses of the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine. The team then used statistical models to generate county-level estimates of MMR vaccination coverage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Based on vaccination levels, the researchers grouped counties -- and ZIP codes -- into five categories of risk from "lowest risk" with 85% or more of children under 5 years old receiving one or more MMR dose to "very high risk" with fewer than 60% of children under age 5 receiving one or more MMR dose. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The researchers used the term "hot spots" to identify areas of low vaccination coverage and "cold spots" to identify areas with high vaccination coverage&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;They found hot spots in West Texas, southern New Mexico, parts of Mississippi and across the rural Southeast. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The authors noted that several of these high-risk hot spot counties were in states that experienced recent measles outbreaks.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;For example, Gaines County -- which was the epicenter of last year's measles outbreak in Texas -- was grouped into the second-highest risk category with 60% to 69% of children under age 5 receiving one or more doses of the MMR vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Lea County, located in New Mexico and the epicenter of that state's outbreak, was grouped into the highest risk category with fewer than 60% of young children vaccinated.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Last year, at least three measles deaths were recorded, including &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://abcnews.go.com/Health/child-measles-dies-texas-hospital-officials/story?id=120539137" target="_blank" dir="ltr"&gt;two among unvaccinated school-aged children in Texas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://abcnews.go.com/Health/unvaccinated-new-mexico-resident-tests-positive-measles-after/story?id=119529919" target="_blank" dir="ltr"&gt;one among an unvaccinated adult in New Mexico&lt;/a&gt;, marking the first U.S. deaths from measles in a decade. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Meanwhile, the researchers found that cold spots were concentrated in the Northeast and Upper Midwest. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;In Maine, for example, no county was placed in a category higher than medium risk, with every county recording at least 70% to 79% of young children receiving at least one MMR dose. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"We know that outbreaks are highly local, so to be able to respond to an outbreak that is highly localized, you need highly localized data, and this is really a first-of-a-kind study to do this," Brownstein said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;&lt;strong class="vtkaO "&gt;Declining MMR vaccination rates&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;It comes as the rate of kindergarteners receiving the MMR vaccine has dropped steadily since before the COVID-19 pandemic, &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.cdc.gov/schoolvaxview/data/index.html" target="_blank" dir="ltr"&gt;CDC data&lt;/a&gt; shows.

It is especially important to help those who have not been vaccinated, including newborns, or cannot receive vaccines, infectious diseases experts say. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Herd immunity was a key component in how measles was declared eliminated from the U.S. in 2000 -- a status that is now under threat.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The authors noted there are some limitations including that the risk levels are estimates, risk levels are individual, and that vaccination rates include children who are not eligible for the vaccine, particularly those under 1 year old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;But they add that the estimates may help the general public, as well as public health officials, make informed choices about vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC eTIW sUzSN "&gt;"Hopefully [this] will help provide more up-to-date information, more localized information, for not only the public, but also the government agencies to make the best decisions that work for everyone," Zhou said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>ABC News</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 16:06:26 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilAFBVV95cUxPc09PQl9EQlhHOS1fSW04OGVfemVIYzFKS0lnclgtYUFMNS1JREdTNW9hVk5yMkZyaVBxY0VKZUNYRWJMNVJ5SXZBY2ZTNXAxeFhkdGM0RGpEQzg0UzVyb29ZTnE2Yl9wYWFCbWlXcExsZ3ZqUkd0ZEZCdnNDYVAyMkNFbUdZVU1FS3M0bWNnMWs5alRI0gGaAUFVX3lxTFBQWHA0d2NtR2tPVDR5bTQzdzY5NS1IQkRtVXpqM251MXZKQ0hRcEI0LWVWdkdNWlVkYWNFSGFnUFVMM2NVeUFNaWFxcTFCOUZkT0R0VUwtRldSQnpnU2lEZlpmQy1IRXJwWGFQZFNidVNWclIwNEdlWEoxMF9LRkpFNkxmS3BORmkxeE9CWXdGMUdYZVBRaF9IN2c</guid></item><item><title>美国关于非洲乙型肝炎疫苗的有争议的研究被取消-卫报</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/jan/15/hepatitis-b-vaccines-study-africa-cancel</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body-commercial-selector article-body-viewer-selector dcr-hdpgoq"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The controversial US-funded study on hepatitis B vaccines among newborns in &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/guinea-bissau" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Guinea-Bissau&lt;/a&gt; has been halted, according to Yap Boum, a senior official at the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“The study has been cancelled,” Boum told journalists at a press conference on Thursday morning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The $1.6m study, funded under the purview of Robert F Kennedy Jr, longtime vaccine skeptic and secretary of the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) , drew outrage and criticism over ethical questions about withholding vaccines proven to prevent hepatitis B in a country with a very high burden of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“It’s of importance for &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/africa" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Africa&lt;/a&gt; CDC to have evidence that can be translated in policy, but this has to be done within the norm. So we are glad that at this point the study is being cancelled,” Boum said. The study was halted because it raised critical questions on the ethics of the trial, he said, adding: “The way the study was designed was a big challenge.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Officials in Guinea-Bissau say the trial will still happen, according to one journalist on the press call. But Africa CDC officials said the trial would only move forward once it has been redesigned to address ethical issues. There were “still some conversations happening” between Guinea-Bissau officials and the US on how to conduct a trial like this ethically, and Africa CDC had assembled a team to make sure Guinea-Bissau officials “receive the adequate support to ensure that this study, if it has to happen, will also fit the ethical regulations”, Boum said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Guinea-Bissau, which underwent a coup in November, appears to have replaced all top officials, including at the ministry of health. Previous officials did not respond to media inquiries, and the number and email address for the health ministry appear to be disconnected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“The good guys won,” said Paul Offit, an infectious diseases physician at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and a former member of the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee for the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The cancellation news was “extremely heartening”, he said, adding that except for the birth of his children, he had “never been happier”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“This administration did not see people in Africa as valuable,” Offit said. “You can’t treat children like this, you can’t treat people like this. We were able to stand up for them. We were able to convince people about the fact that this was unethical.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The HHS did not respond to the Guardian’s inquiries about why the trial was cancelled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The news could represent a turning point for Guinea-Bissau and other countries where researchers are conducting work that critics say is unethical. It shows that “the institutions are getting stronger” by pushing back on unethical and exploitative studies in Africa, said Boghuma Titanji, an assistant professor of medicine at Emory University who is currently studying vaccine misinformation in Africa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The halt was “a win for advocacy and upholding the ethics of research”, said Titanji, who called the trial as it seems to be designed a “damaging” study. “It can lead to damage that lasts for several decades after the study has been completed,” said Titanji.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The researchers &lt;a href="https://www.bandim.org/hepatitis-b-vaccine-at-birth/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;argued&lt;/a&gt; that the trial would make the vaccine available to 7,000 newborns when they would “not otherwise receive it”. But that means the other 7,000 children in the trial wouldn’t have access to the vaccine “due to the flip of a coin”, which would “knowingly deprive 7,000 children of a vaccine that could save their lives”, Offit said. Instead, he said, “take the $1.6m and vaccinate as many children as you can at birth”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;About 18% of adults and about 11% of children under the age of one in Guinea-Bissau have hepatitis B. Children are much more likely to develop long-term effects, such as liver cirrhosis that can lead to cancer and death, if they catch the virus when they are very young.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Guinea-Bissau currently recommends the hepatitis B vaccine to all babies at six weeks of age because of issues accessing the vaccine, but that recommendation will change to all newborns at birth in 2027 when more doses roll out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Offit likened the trial to the Tuskegee experiment, in which US researchers knowingly withheld an effective antibiotic from African American men suffering from syphilis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The Danish researchers conducting the trial have also been criticized for not publishing the results of a study on the DTP vaccine, potentially because it contradicted their belief that the vaccine is dangerous, &lt;a href="https://www.weekendavisen.dk/samfund/et-daarligt-immunforsvar" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;according&lt;/a&gt; to the Danish journalist Gunver Lystbæk Vestergård.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The protocols for the study have not been made public by the researchers or health officials, but a leaked version was published by &lt;a href="https://insidemedicine.substack.com/p/scoop-the-leaked-protocol-of-the" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Inside Medicine&lt;/a&gt;. Frederik Schaltz-Buchholzer, one of the Danish researchers, also shared some &lt;a href="https://substack.com/@frederikschaltzbuchholzer/note/c-198070651?" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;details&lt;/a&gt; on social media. Titanji didn’t find his argument compelling. “It actually just raises even more concerns in my mind,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The researchers argue that live vaccines may bring nonspecific effects – improving overall health, not just against the disease the vaccine is targeting. But, they say, adding an attenuated vaccine like hepatitis B could interfere with these possible effects. Yet the evidence to support possible overall health effects is based upon the researchers’ prior research, which has been called into question.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Other Danish researchers analyzed these studies and found no statistically significant effects, according to their new &lt;a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.64898/2025.12.31.25343212v1" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;preprint study&lt;/a&gt;, which has not been peer-reviewed or published yet. One of the researchers on that study, Anders Hviid, &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/prof-anders-hviid_p%C3%A5stande-om-vacciners-skjulte-effekter-share-7417091616009736192-pFPy/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; on LinkedIn that these findings were especially important given recent decisions in the US to limit several vaccines for children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The Danish researchers also argued that trials should be done in Africa in order to study their effects on African children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Titanji agreed that there needed to be more randomized controlled trials done in Africa on Africans, but said that they should be led by African scientists and powered by questions from Africans. Projects like the Danish study “basically exploit the scarcity of a proven beneficial vaccine in a context where that vaccine is needed”, Titanji said. The study, as it is currently designed, would be “exploiting a window where the government is not able to provide that intervention to its citizens”, Titanji said. “You are not solving the problem. You’re actually being part of the problem.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The trial was slated to begin on 5 January. When reached last week about whether the trial had begun, the lead researchers, Peter Aaby and Christine Stabell Benn, disputed the Guardian’s &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/dec/19/hepatitis-b-vaccine-study-guinea-bissau-rfk" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;previous story&lt;/a&gt; that cited ethical concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“That article was totally wrong,” Aaby said. “The report had virtually no evidence-based content about vaccines to transmit to the readers, only a lot of ethical condemnations from those who might potentially be questioned by the future results of the study.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Aaby and other researchers on the project did not respond to further inquiries about the project’s cancellation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Aaby and Stabell Benn, who are Danish researchers, have close ties with Trump administration health officials. Stabell Benn hosted a &lt;a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/vaccine-curious/id1629371129" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt; with Tracy Beth Høeg, now an FDA official who has worked to &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/31/tracy-beth-hoeg-fda-vaccines" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;find deaths after Covid vaccination&lt;/a&gt; and advocated for the US to &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2026/jan/05/trump-rfk-jr-child-vaccine-recommendations" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;slash vaccine recommendations&lt;/a&gt; to align with Denmark’s schedule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;On Joe Rogan’s &lt;a href="https://podscripts.co/podcasts/the-joe-rogan-experience/1999-robert-kennedy-jr" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt; in 2023 Kennedy praised Aaby as a “very famous” researcher whose work showed the diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP) vaccine was deadly, he said – research Kennedy also cited when he ended funding to Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance. But he didn’t mention that the year before, in 2022, the researchers found completely different results when they conducted the same trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 15:34:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikgFBVV95cUxQeGVoY2dfS1hNcVJSWms5WWxwdmk5TWpCVWJpcmR5emVRc3ZJQ1RRdWo3Nk5FVFllWmZ1N016akl0b3dHWU9hNExHUTlFY2E3NFJSZlQ3THZPdUFBVk1ZUjVVZHJWdXJKckFDU1lya0ktUW1jUFJIdWk3bGNmVmthQnJSZGI3VldUSWZQbWQxemxOZw</guid></item><item><title>哈佛培训的胃肠病学家AIIMS揭示了“1种生活方式习惯” ，可以在不改变饮食的情况下降低血糖|健康-印度斯坦时报</title><link>https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/aiims-harvard-trained-gastroenterologist-reveals-1-lifestyle-habit-that-lowers-blood-sugar-without-changing-your-diet-101768488254944.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="artContent"&gt;&lt;div class="storyParagraphFigure"&gt;&lt;p class="content"&gt;Managing blood sugar can feel overwhelming, especially with all the diet restrictions, calorie counting, and constant monitoring.

In 2024, however, it was ready, and the system has done a large push through both 2024 and 2025 to educate families about RSV vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If we know something's going to work, and we have the science behind it, what can we do to jump on it and try to do it as quickly as we can?" Reynolds said. "And I would say, within the last two seasons, we've been able to show that we can make an impact."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intermountain Health is encouraging vaccinations in three different ways:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pregnant women can be immunized in their third trimester with the maternal RSV protection Abrysvo, passing immunity to their babies within two weeks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Babies born during the RSV season can be immunized in the form of Nirsevimab monoclonal antibodies shortly after they are born, giving immunity within a few days.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Families of infants born between April and September, outside of RSV season, are invited to bring them to their pediatrician for a vaccination.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you haven't heard from your pediatrician and you want (an RSV vaccine), call your pediatrician, and they can get you in and get that injection," Reynolds said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vaccine effectiveness&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;RSV is particularly hard for infants because it causes bronchiolitis, making it very difficult to breathe and eat. Reynolds said a bad case of RSV can disrupt infants' development and cause ongoing troubles with breastfeeding for some babies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our moms know what RSV is like, and we all are scared of it. None of us, none of us wants a baby who's sick. ... Because we know RSV, I think we've been more willing to do something to prevent it," Reynolds said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without the vaccine, 1 in every 48 infants in their first year of life will be hospitalized with RSV in Utah, and 1 in every 200 needs intensive care, Reynolds said an Intermountain Health study shows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But for infants who are immunized, only 1 in every 400 is hospitalized, and 1 in every 1,000 ends up in the ICU, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reynolds said national studies show the RSV vaccine is safe and effective, and parents can also look at &lt;a href="https://news.intermountainhealth.org/colorado-montana-and-utah-among-nations-top-states-in-rsv-protection-for-babies-following-intermountain-health-awareness-effort/#:~:text=Additionally%2C%20Intermountain%20Children's%20Health%20gathered,It%20found%3A&amp;amp;text=16%2C000%20Utah%20Intermountain%20infant%20patients,expectant%20mothers%20received%20RSV%20protection." rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;Intermountain Health's data&lt;/a&gt; showing it has made "a huge difference to us in our community."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The ability to keep babies well and out of the hospital with a single shot is a game-changer," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="kt_disclaimer"&gt;

Doctors had told his family that, despite his age, his brain showed degeneration comparable to that of a 70-year-old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to SWNS, Yarham, from Dereham in Norfolk, was diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia (FTD) a month before his 23rd birthday. Caused by a protein mutation, FTD is a rare form of dementia that typically affects people aged between 45 and 65, though in rare cases it can strike much younger patients. Unlike Alzheimer’s, which usually impacts memory first, FTD often presents through changes in personality and behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Study: Physical and mental activities help to reduce risk of dementia&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The condition affects around &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.alzheimersresearchuk.org/news/frontotemporal-dementia-ftd-what-is-it-and-how-close-is-a-cure/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;one in 30&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;people with dementia in the UK and is exceptionally rare in young adults. Yarham’s family first noticed changes in 2022, when he began moving and speaking more slowly, became increasingly forgetful, and at times appeared blank or unresponsive during conversations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div data-pos="0" class="id-r-component QbQNS undefined

A consultant later told the family that the scan showed his brain resembled that of someone decades older. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fewer than 0.1 per cent of people in the UK are diagnosed with any form of dementia before the age of 65, placing Yarham among a vanishingly small group of patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the diagnosis, his condition deteriorated quickly. His mother, Sam, became his full-time carer, helping him eat, dress and bathe as his speech faded and his mobility declined. “Andre got his official diagnosis just before his 23rd birthday,” she said. “In that time his speech went totally. He was just making noises. The last six months was when we started to see a very rapid decline.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;By late summer, he was struggling to feed himself or hold a cup and had become increasingly unsteady. The family made the decision to move him into a nursing home in September. Within weeks, he required a wheelchair and hoist support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before his illness, Yarham had lived what his family described as a typical young life. He played rugby and football at school, followed wrestling closely and spent time gaming with friends on titles such as FIFA and Call of Duty. He also worked briefly at Lotus Cars in Norwich, replacing car headliners, but left after six months because he was struggling to get through the working day and could not explain why something felt wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div data-pos="0" class="id-r-component QbQNS undefined

(via Samantha Fairbairn / SWNS)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In December, he was admitted to hospital with an infection. His mother later described this as the point at which his decline accelerated sharply, with her son becoming less aware of his surroundings. After three weeks in hospital, he was moved to Priscilla Bacon Lodge Hospice, where he was placed on end-of-life care. He died on 27 December.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following his death, the family donated his brain to medical research in the hope that it could help others. “We made the decision to donate Andre’s brain to medical research,” his mother said. “If in the future, if Andre has been able to help just one more family have a precious few more years with a loved one, that would mean the absolute world.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case has drawn renewed attention to the difficulty of recognising dementia in younger patients and the speed with which rare forms such as frontotemporal dementia can progress. Yarham’s family said the diagnosis and its aftermath had been devastating for them all, including his father Alastair and his brother Tyler, but they hope that greater awareness may encourage others to seek help earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the end of his life, Sam urged families not to dismiss early warning signs because of age. “If people do have concerns about loved ones and their memories, there are tests available and go to your GP,” she said, adding thanks to those who supported the family throughout her son’s illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Early symptoms of dementia (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/2023/12/nhs-urges-people-to-spot-dementia-warning-signs-in-loved-ones-this-christmas/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="strong" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;according to NHS England&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt; Emotional changes&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; Forgetfulness&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; Difficulty concentrating&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; Struggling to follow a conversation or find the right word&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; Being confused about time and places&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Symptoms of frontotemporal dementia (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/frontotemporal-dementia/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="strong" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;according to the NHS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="59"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="60"&gt;&lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt; personality and behaviour changes, such as acting inappropriately or impulsively, appearing selfish or unsympathetic, neglecting personal hygiene, overeating, or loss of motivation&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; language problems, including speaking slowly, struggling to make the right sounds when saying a word, getting words in the wrong order, or using words incorrectly&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; problems with mental abilities, such as getting distracted easily, struggling with planning and organisation&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 12:58:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi9wFBVV95cUxPdjg1NlRta0paMWRsQzY5RlFhRDNjZFRfVC1YR1NmQkhNaTQ0QUMySk8wZmJVSGpaV3NUMnhfSXdxSGlaSS1fMHpwT2xlSTVmXzIyYjN0dlR0ekExYjBNX2gybmQ5aGxCbjlvVmFianNic05aMjM2LTNKX0VoYXkxLUVoUlgtc3JqNkhYNHRFNS1lQm9RdzNQT3BRbzRnNDM3cEVRSjJUTURCZ2FxYWZXWG56RlA4SGwyN1VwX1ZZRExVNUc4a1gzeEhEUVB0cGphU2gtUU9nSndzbVVkLXhfVHNrZTZ4SnFRenpQTnVTUldwTV9mTjVR</guid></item><item><title>抑郁症的大脑治疗被证明是有帮助的- CNN</title><link>https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/15/health/saint-tms-depression-therapy-wellness</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;

            “I felt like the fog was in my head as well as outside,” said Zeko, now 57, describing the mood disorder that would squelch her happiness, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/27/health/procrastination-how-to-stop-adhd-depression-wellness"&gt;motivation and self-esteem&lt;/a&gt; for 28 years until she finally found effective treatment.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkesohtl001z3b6p8uha9vd9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Everything in my life appeared to be perfect and wonderful, but my head was full of this really bad, negative self-talk constantly,” Zeko told CNN. “I felt like my whole life was falling apart around me. I couldn’t get things done in my house.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkesohtl00203b6p98pj9x5i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When Zeko first sought help in 2011, her doctor prescribed the antidepressant bupropion, which Zeko took on and off for several years. It made her feel more energized, but sometimes that boost morphed into anxiety. Then Zeko and a psychiatrist tried to tackle her mood disorder with a series of seven other antidepressants.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkesohtl00213b6pyin9oe67@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “They just either didn’t work at all, made it worse, made me feel suicidal,” she said. Other “horrible” side effects included urinary issues, headaches, nightmares, emotional numbness and fatigue, Zeko said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkesohtl00223b6prp856m9c@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Zeko’s predicament fit what experts call &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/19/health/vagus-nerve-stimulation-depression-treatment-wellness"&gt;treatment-resistant depression&lt;/a&gt;, which isn’t a formal diagnosis separate from major depressive disorder. Instead, experts may use the term, or TRD for short, to characterize depression unimproved by one or more validated, conventional treatments for depression, said psychiatrist Dr. Brandon Bentzley, cofounder and chief scientific officer of Magnus Medical, a neurotechnology company. &lt;a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/mood-disorders/treatment-resistant-depression" target="_blank"&gt;Nearly one-third&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/depression" target="_blank"&gt;332 million people&lt;/a&gt; worldwide with depression fall into the treatment-resistant category.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkesohtl00233b6pymr8909w@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The year 2023 was when Zeko’s depression “was really bad, when I was desperate,” she said. Though Zeko never contemplated taking her own life, she began to understand why two acquaintances who had &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/10/health/suicide-why-you-shouldnt-say-committed-wellness"&gt;died by suicide&lt;/a&gt; had &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/10/health/suicide-myths-facts-prevention-wellness"&gt;considered that an option&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkesohtl00243b6plp4b8f3t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Then a friend recommended that Zeko sign up for a randomized controlled clinical trial testing an innovative, five-day therapy for treatment-resistant depression at Stanford University’s &lt;a href="https://bsl.stanford.edu/" target="_blank"&gt;Brain Stimulation Lab&lt;/a&gt; in California. Called SAINT, for &lt;a href="https://stanfordhealthcare.org/medical-treatments/s/stanford-accelerated-intelligent-neuromodulation-therapy.html" target="_blank"&gt;Stanford Accelerated Intelligent Neuromodulation Therapy&lt;/a&gt;, the treatment sends quick magnetic pulses to a targeted region in a patient’s prefrontal cortex. The prefrontal cortex is a core region for emotional and cognitive processing and regulation; its dysfunction is thought to be a key aspect of what causes depression.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkesohtl00253b6pf1wfh7r2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Within just the first week or so of receiving SAINT in November 2023, Zeko’s ability to enjoy life — the lack of which is a hallmark &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/17/health/clinical-depression-explainer-wellness"&gt;symptom of depression&lt;/a&gt; — significantly improved.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkesohtl00263b6p7ys2fv45@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Just a few days later, my whole family had Thanksgiving in San Francisco, and we rented e-bikes and rode our bikes across the Golden Gate Bridge,” Zeko said. “I had done this before and never enjoyed it. I was always like, ‘Oh, my butt hurts, it’s freezing, it’s loud, I can’t wait for this to be over.’
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkesohtl00273b6pxgb20x2x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “This time, it was a whole different experience,” Zeko added. “I was like, ‘I want to do everything that I have always done again, because it’s so much better now.’”
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkekn2mx000x3b6pcbpfyoq8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Zeko wasn’t the only participant who benefited from the trial, the results of which are&lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/wps.70032" target="_blank"&gt; detailed in a study&lt;/a&gt; published today in the journal World Psychiatry. Half of the 24 participants in the treatment group achieved remission by one month after undergoing SAINT, compared with nearly 21% of the 24 people in the placebo treatment group.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkest82o002c3b6puenrge1y@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We have brought mental health treatment into the same precision medicine as the rest of medicine itself,” said Bentzley, a lead developer of SAINT and a lead author of the therapy’s first randomized controlled trial, which was &lt;a href="https://psychiatryonline.org/doi/10.1176/appi.ajp.2021.20101429" target="_blank"&gt;published in 2021&lt;/a&gt;. Bentzley’s company, Magnus Medical, holds the SAINT license.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkest82o002d3b6poxzd2tq3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We do have the tools to … actually understand the human brain on an individual basis, take that knowledge and apply it to treatments in the same way that a cardiologist or cardiothoracic surgeon would on the heart,” Bentzley added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkesp0ct002a3b6phzu0ovev@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Typically, the more treatments someone with persistent depression has tried, the less likely the next therapeutic will work for them, which can deepen feelings of hopelessness, said Dr. Ian Kratter, lead author of the new study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkests4u002i3b6p758qte6m@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Potentially showing a treatment can help people even in those circumstances is an incredibly powerful message for patients who are suffering,” added Kratter, clinical assistant professor in the department of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Stanford University School of Medicine.
    &lt;/p&gt;



  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkesyeig002t3b6p40ejxiyh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Most major mental health treatments — such as some antidepressants or electroconvulsive therapy — were accidentally discovered when initially being used for other diseases, particularly the bacterial infection tuberculosis, Bentzley said. In contrast, formulating SAINT involved “a true engineering process around how the brain worked,” he added.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkesyeig002u3b6pyijooci6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We started that process in the early 2010s,” Bentzley said. The team Bentzley is referring to was led by neuroscientist &lt;a href="https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2025/12/nolan-williams-obituary.html" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Nolan Williams&lt;/a&gt;, who died by suicide in October at age 43. Williams started Stanford’s Brain Stimulation Lab, the eventual hub for SAINT, in 2015. He had experienced depression himself and never underwent his own therapy, Bentzley said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkesyeig002v3b6pynykeyg9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Nolan was an amazing scientist, but he was a healer before being a scientist. That was by far and away more important to him,” Kratter said. “He wanted to get people better faster.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkesyeig002w3b6paib5vxe8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The team explored which brain area to change to get someone out of depression and back to themselves noninvasively with minimal to &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/03/21/health/antidepressants-sexual-side-effects-tips-wellness"&gt;no side effects&lt;/a&gt;, Bentzley said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkesyd6m002q3b6pv4osxok0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The SAINT technology first obtains a structural and functional MRI of the brain, with the latter providing a window into how different parts are communicating with each other, Bentzley and Kratter explained.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkesyu2v002z3b6p8rzrrbsu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The MRI helps identify the location of the strongest connection between the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and a deeper subregion, the subgenual cingulate, which is associated with depression, Kratter said. The researchers then send thousands of rapid signals, or pulses, to that location through the electromagnetic coil inside the stimulator on the participant’s scalp, Bentzley said. These signals cause the connections to become stronger, thus treating depression.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkesz0c300323b6pvaviktog@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This process is administered in ten 10-minute sessions per day for five consecutive days, which is faster than conventional transcranial magnetic stimulation that’s also less precise. Conventional TMS can take two to three hour-long treatments weekly for four to six weeks, said Dr. Nina Kraguljac, chair of the American Psychiatric Association’s council on research. Kraguljac, who wasn’t involved in the study, added that the schedule may be difficult for clinics that are understaffed or only running during business hours, but more convenient for patients taking time away from other responsibilities.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkeszpyl00373b6pv512hp5g@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            While SAINT is administered, some patients feel nothing whereas others feel slight discomfort or pain. “It felt like my whole brain was a rubber band and they were pulling it back and then letting it go, and it would snap back,” Zeko said. “The snaps were very painful but so short that it was not a problem.”&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkeszoi400353b6poqitctqh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The latest clinical trial adds to several years’ worth of scientific support for SAINT.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmket0n4q003f3b6p1rrdqz1w@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In &lt;a href="https://psychiatryonline.org/doi/10.1176/appi.ajp.2019.19070720" target="_blank"&gt;SAINT’s second clinical trial&lt;/a&gt;, which had 21 participants but no control group, 90.5% of participants went into remission, Bentzley said. That paved the way for SAINT’s &lt;a href="https://psychiatryonline.org/doi/10.1176/appi.ajp.2021.20101429" target="_blank"&gt;first randomized controlled trial&lt;/a&gt; that was also double blinded, meaning neither the participants nor the researchers knew who was receiving which treatment. The placebo treatment replicates every aspect of SAINT except for the magnetic field fully entering the patient’s brain, Bentzley explained. Instead, only a small part enters.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmket0lco003d3b6peic3lz0k@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The US Food and Drug Administration &lt;a href="https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cdrh_docs/pdf22/K220177.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;cleared SAINT as a therapy&lt;/a&gt; for treatment-resistant depression in September 2022 — making it the first rapid, noninvasive neuromodulation system for treatment-resistant depression. The therapeutic is currently available at 17 clinics in the United States.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmket1b7y003k3b6pb6afskp7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We’re looking to hopefully double that by the end of 2026,” Bentzley said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmket1b7y003l3b6ped1c0nia@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The new study replicated previous results but in a larger population, Kratter said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmket1b7y003m3b6pai67z3gy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I think the study is going to be a landmark study in terms of how we think about mechanisms in TMS and how we can personalize treatments using biological markers in the brain,” said Kraguljac, who is also executive vice chair of the department of psychiatry and behavioral health at the Ohio State University.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmket1b7y003n3b6pnks8zocw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The study also more objectively measured SAINT’s potential effects on the brain by conducting electroencephalograms, or EEGs, before and after the trial. Those tests involve placing small electrodes on the scalp to record electrical activity in the brain.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmket1b7y003o3b6p0h6l24vh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The EEGs found SAINT “had a very interesting effect” on beta brain waves, Kratter said —relatively high-frequency brain waves associated with focus, decision-making and concentration. Overactivity in beta waves has &lt;a href="https://www.neuroregulation.org/article/view/23374" target="_blank"&gt;been linked &lt;/a&gt; to depression and anxiety.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmket1b7y003p3b6pxhjx92sh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The treatment decreased beta power specifically in “the left anterior cingulate cortex, which is known to be important in emotion and mood regulation,” Kratter said. “The more someone got better, the greater the reduction in the beta range on EEG.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmket1b7y003q3b6pg72z5jhr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Additionally, participants with more beta power in that region pre-treatment were more likely to improve, Kratter said. If these findings are replicated, EEG measures may help predict optimal participants and times for the treatment.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmket19nk003i3b6p257bgytk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I feel like I’ve walked out of a dense fog,” Zeko said. “Clarity and peace are the main things I feel in my brain now. There’s not a constant negative chatter in my brain anymore.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmket2zez003v3b6p8bft8rj4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Thoughts about sad events stopped causing days-long spirals, and tasks that once felt insurmountable were no longer a second thought. “One of the things I texted  was, ‘I came home and unpacked my suitcase immediately, and I didn’t leave it sitting there for like a month,’” said Zeko, referring to messages she sent her friends.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmket2zez003x3b6pe343qztp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Though the latest trial helps explain how SAINT works for some people, “what we don’t know is infinite,” Bentzley said. “The people who don’t get better, their brains look a lot more like what we call ‘healthy controls,’ or people who don’t have depression. And that doesn’t mean that they don’t have depression.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmket2zez003y3b6p4zjvsmrd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This means the neurobiology of depression can vary from person to person, even if people have the same symptoms. If that variability truly influences how a patient will fare with different treatments, psychiatry may need to advance how depression is diagnosed and thus treated, Bentzley said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmket2zez003z3b6pvvf92yqj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The EEG findings “still should be viewed as highly preliminary,” said Dr. Paul Holtzheimer, professor of psychiatry at Dartmouth University’s Geisel School of Medicine in New Hampshire. “It could be a mechanism of SAINT or it could be a generic finding when depression improves, regardless of what improves the depression.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmket2zez00403b6poesc71w3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The study population was also largely White, relatively highly educated and had few co-occurring conditions, Holtzheimer said — so how SAINT may work for more diverse groups or ones with more than one diagnosis isn’t fully clear, though this wasn’t the point of the study. Future studies comparing SAINT with conventional TMS and other depression treatments are also needed, though SAINT seems to outperform others in terms of how substantially some patients recover within a short time frame, he added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmket2zez00413b6paia099ar@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The 50% remission rate is notably higher than what we’ve seen in other studies,” he added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmket2zez00423b6p61q2hosl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The researchers also excluded patients who were acutely suicidal or who had attempted suicide in the year prior to the study, noted Dr. Holly Lisanby, founding dean and Foundation Professor of the John Shufeldt School of Medicine and Medical Engineering at Arizona State University. That exclusion for the sake of participant safety is normal in experimental trials, Lisanby, who wasn’t involved in the study, added — but suicidality is also important to consider when comparing SAINT with other treatments in the future.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmket2zez00443b6pwogs7bcz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            What also remains to be seen is more consistent evidence of how long SAINT’s benefits will last. Remission after just one five-day course of treatment has lasted anywhere from several months to years for some participants of various trials. Others have needed a tune-up here and there to remain in remission for a year, Bentzley said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmket2zez00453b6pltvdlio0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “For other folks,” he added, “it’s an uphill battle that requires a lot more than just a neurobiological treatment, but also psychological reintegration, occupational treatment and time to relearn the important aspects of how to live a life of genuine remission from depression.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmket2zez00463b6psobuk03i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Relapsing into depression isn’t an issue unique to SAINT; symptoms can still recur with conventional treatments.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmket2zez00473b6pbrk0ntda@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The experience of Willow, who has treatment-resistant depression,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;may represent some of these unknowns. Willow participated in the latest randomized controlled trial in July 2023 but was never told whether she received SAINT or the placebo treatment. This confidentiality is standard for such studies.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmket2xg3003t3b6pppjqfqzg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Despite that lack of information, Willow thinks she underwent SAINT treatment due to how her mental health shifted during and after the trial.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmket4eor004c3b6pm34jnk2p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “On the fourth morning, I walked out of the MRI to head over to the clinic, and a squirrel ran in front of me, and I truly said, ‘Hello, squirrel,’ and smiled,” recalled Willow, who asked that her full name not be used due to privacy concerns.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmket4eor004d3b6pw3taa2sv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I just stopped in my tracks because smiling sometimes feels, with depression, unnatural,” added Willow, who’s 43 and based in California. “The fact that I cared about this little squirrel and thought, ‘Oh, that’s a cute thing’ — I was like, ‘Oh, my goodness, this is definitely something different.’”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmket4eor004e3b6p6z632n71@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Willow’s world felt more vibrant overall, she said, and she began to be more mindful and present with her family and her fellow soccer parents.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmket4eor004f3b6pkvdycn8n@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The treatment “was beneficial for me for about five months, then unfortunately, I started to notice my depression returning,” Willow said. The trial researchers pulled Willow from the study and gave her another round of SAINT in February 2024, which relieved her symptoms for about six months. Since October 2024, she has managed her depression with weekly &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/28/health/ketamine-therapy-depression-wellness"&gt;ketamine treatments administered&lt;/a&gt; by a doctor.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmket4eor004g3b6ppxsdjv9v@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Now over two years since Zeko received SAINT, she has started feeling depressed again in the past six months, she said. But her symptoms may just be from losing her dream job and now working in a nonideal job rather than signs of a relapse, she said. She has been trying to get her insurer to cover a potential next round of SAINT but said the company denied her claim, saying she hasn’t sufficiently explored all her options. Stanford is helping her try to contest the insurer’s decision, she said.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmket4eor004i3b6p0zuvmbve@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kratter and Bentzley are hopeful for what the SAINT trials could mean for the broader population with treatment-resistant depression, but other hurdles remain — including awareness and insurance coverage.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmket4eor004j3b6pjrqhedt4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Of the people in the US who need transcranial magnetic stimulation, only 0.7% get it, Bentzley said. “That technology has been out for nearly two decades with FDA clearance and has a mountain of evidence.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmket4eor004k3b6pswa1fhc1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The SAINT therapy generally isn’t covered by most private insurance plans, but some companies are considering it or offering coverage in some states. Medicare covers SAINT in hospital-based, outpatient settings. Without insurance, one course of SAINT can cost roughly from $16,000 to over $30,000, Bentzley said. The therapy is only available through clinics &lt;a href="https://www.magnusmedical.com/find-a-provider/" target="_blank"&gt;supported by Magnus Medical&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://bsl.stanford.edu/for-patients/" target="_blank"&gt;a clinical trial&lt;/a&gt; supported by Magnus Medical or Stanford, he added. “There are numerous clinics that advertise they provide SAINT but actually do not.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmket4eor004l3b6pq2vrxrqs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The hope is that brain stimulation technologies … can be moved up earlier in the so-called treatment algorithm,” said Kratter, referring to treating people with treatment-resistant depression and those who would rather do a potentially one-off treatment like SAINT instead of trying pharmaceuticals and experiencing negative side effects. But whether SAINT could also be a first-line treatment for general depression hasn’t yet been studied.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmket4eor004m3b6pw6py8f2v@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We all dream about a major cultural shift in how we treat this population, and the optimistic side of me wants to see that happen fast,” Bentzley said. “But historically, those types of changes take several decades.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            The United States reported a record number of measles cases in 2025, and the virus continues to spread rapidly in the new year. At least ​171 measles cases have been reported in the first two weeks of 2026, according to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt; published Wednesday by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention – nearly as many as the average annual total in the 25 years since measles was declared eliminated.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkejxdbi00043b6pe56ez6nq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Most of the new cases are concentrated in areas with large ongoing outbreaks — in the upstate region of South Carolina and along the Utah-Arizona state line — but the sheer scale of those outbreaks leaves the broader public at risk, even in places that aren’t currently reporting high numbers of cases.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkejxdbi00053b6pxeita2uy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As measles cases grow exponentially, it becomes harder to track every exposure, said Dr. Linda Bell, South Carolina’s state epidemiologist. People may also be out in the community without knowing that they’re infectious, and this can lead to unknown exposures.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkejxdbi00063b6pry66xvn3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dozens of public exposure locations have been identified in South Carolina over the past week, Bell said Wednesday — at schools, churches, restaurants, shops and health care settings — but the health department doesn’t always publicize all of those exposure locations unless it can share specific details about the date and time of the occurrence.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkejxdbi00073b6pe3duwhvn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Exposures can happen when people are visiting areas experiencing an outbreak, as happened with a North Carolina family who visited Spartanburg County, South Carolina, and when infected individuals travel, as in New Mexico, where the health department recently warned of possible measles exposure at a hotel in Albuquerque from someone visiting from South Carolina.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkeyztxi00023b6s5rp73kvc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            At least four major international airports in the US reported measles cases or potential exposures during peak holiday travel last month, and an infectious individual traveled through major cities in the Northeast on an Amtrak train last week.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkejxdbi00093b6phhmcdby1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We’re going to see more of those exposures” because of falling vaccination rates and greater spread, said Dr. Jesse Hackell, a retired pediatrician and member of the American Academy of Pediatrics, but “vaccinating almost completely eliminates the risk of an exposure leading to disease.”
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkejxdbi000a3b6p08swepr4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Here’s how to prepare for a possible measles exposure and how to respond if it happens.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkejxdbj000c3b6p74ozarbd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Measles is one of the most contagious diseases there is, but the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine is extremely effective. One dose is 93% effective against measles, and the recommended second dose bumps that protection up to 97% — and the immunity is lifelong.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkejxdbj000d3b6pi7whaiu9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s generally recommended that children get their first dose around 12 months to 15 months of age and the second between ages 4 and 6, but that timeline can move earlier amid outbreaks — with the first dose given as young as 6 months. Older children and adults can get vaccinated at any time, too.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkejxdbj000e3b6pgr4puenm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            People who are vaccinated don’t have much to worry about, experts say.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkejxdbj000f3b6pq22n7cmd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “If you have immunity to measles, you will most likely just be directed to watch for symptoms as a precaution,” said Dr. Raynard Washington, director of the public health department in Mecklenburg County, North Carolina. “The vaccine should do what it is intended to do.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkejxdbj000g3b6pydv2setg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For people who are not vaccinated when they’re exposed to the virus, there still is a chance to benefit from the protection the vaccine provides — but quick action is required.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkejxdbj000h3b6pw86ufj7u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            An MMR vaccine given within 72 hours of exposure to measles may offer some protection or lead to milder illness. This timeframe is often before symptoms appear.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkejxdbj000j3b6ppif9m3e3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            People who know that they have been exposed to measles, or who are worried that they might have been exposed, should contact a health care provider.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkejxdbj000k3b6pwkmzi0kp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Public health experts stress that folks should call ahead, rather than just showing up to doctor’s offices, emergency rooms or other health care clinics, to keep from infecting other people.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkejxdbj000l3b6pqtxqalos@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Due to the exposures that have occurred in multiple health care settings, we remind anyone who needs medical care and knows or suspects that they may have measles, that they must notify a health care provider before visiting a health care facility. And if they have one available, they should consider wearing a mask when seeking care, to protect others in those settings from being exposed,” Bell said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkejxdbj000m3b6p0qisex7q@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We are focusing all of our efforts on containing the spread of the virus around the surveillance information that’s reported to us,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkejxdbj000n3b6pw1ihpkti@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Stuart Simko, a pediatrician with Prisma Health who practices in upstate South Carolina, has treated multiple measles patients and consulted with many others about possible cases. He says that protocols reminiscent of the early Covid-19 days — including telehealth visits, masking and asking people to wait in the car — has helped prevent spread.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkejxdbj000o3b6pdzh57ot7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We took our policies and the policies that Prisma developed for screening, and we revved that up. We took it to the next level,” he said. When his office called the state health department to report the measles cases, he said officials were happy to hear that no one else had been exposed as a result.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkejxdbj000p3b6p57ksycnj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The amount of work that goes into contact-tracing and figuring out who is exposed in the office and who’s had their vaccines — to me, that would be a nightmare,” Simko said. “I was really proud of our team for stepping it up and in a really fast manner and make adjustments on the fly.”
    &lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;h2 class="subheader inline-placeholder subheader-elevate vossi-subheader_elevate vossi-subheader_elevate--size-h2" data-editable="text" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/subheader/instances/cmkejz96h001l3b6pw9pus0bz@published" data-component-name="subheader" id="watch-for-symptoms-and-monitor-change" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
        Watch for symptoms and monitor change
&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkejxdbj000r3b6ptixbsvg4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Early symptoms of a measles infection may make it appear like a different respiratory illness; it often starts with a fever, cough and runny nose.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkejxdbj000s3b6p2dtvjt7l@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The hallmark rash typically shows up a few days later, starting in the mouth and along the hairline and working its way down the body.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkejxdbj000t3b6porzyran9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There is one other early indicator that someone might be sick with measles instead of a different respiratory virus: conjunctivitis, or pink eye.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkejxdbj000u3b6pnzupnnec@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “That’s something that would show up even maybe before the rash,” Hackell said. “So if you see that pattern, you should definitely talk to your pediatrician.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkejxdbj000v3b6p1qc35nf3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There is no specific therapy to treat measles, so vigilance is key when monitoring and managing the symptoms, experts say, including regular check-ins with health care providers.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkejxdbj000w3b6phaf630jx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Simko met with his measles patients every couple of days through telehealth, watching to be sure they were staying hydrated and showing signs of improvement after a week or so.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkejxdbj000x3b6p6ahuqhcd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Most kids do OK with measles, but a few don’t, and there’s no real good way at the beginning to predict which child is going to be that way,” Hackell said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkejxdbj000y3b6ppqh4m291@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Hospitalization may be necessary if there are signs of pneumonia or encephalitis, which is swelling of the brain.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkejxdbj00103b6pv6ncw36t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s important to know what is going on in your environment,” Hackell said. “I think it’s important that parents know what the vaccination rates are in their local schools.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkejxdbj00113b6pg3yf6nz4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            An exposure in a school with a high vaccination rate is much less likely to spread than in a school with a lower vaccination rate, and small differences in coverage matter. This awareness can help parents make decisions about their own behaviors and communicate relevant information to their health care providers if concerns arise.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkejxdbj00123b6pr1ec44lw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “What you can’t plan for is the public exposures like airports, trains and things like that,” Hackell said. “What’s really critically important is that the local health department, the state health department and the CDC continue to monitor what’s going on and be very quick at announcing when there has been an outbreak.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkejxdbj00133b6pw0xlfhqh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The State Carolina public health department shares two updates about the measles outbreak each week, and many other state and local health departments have issued notices about possible exposures in their area.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkejxdbj00143b6pstk7c4m1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The public health department in Mecklenburg County, North Carolina, recently alerted the public that it had detected measles in the wastewater — a sign that someone with a measles infection had been present in the area even though no cases had been reported.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkejxdbj00153b6pjhhhdllb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This notification also allowed the county health department to let residents know that same-day MMR vaccination was available through the Mecklenburg County Public Health Immunization Clinic and that the mobile unit would be onsite at Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools locations through the end of the school year.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkejxdbj00163b6pieq7f34r@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Local public health is on the front line of response for this work. So if you have been exposed, or there’s a potential that there was an exposure, that is the first thing that we are responsible for doing,” Washington said. “In most cases, we’re able to directly notify individuals who were involved, and if we’re not, if there’s a situation where we’re not able to contact all those individuals, then we will send the public notice.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkejxdbj00183b6plhfmmpd5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Unvaccinated people who have been exposed to measles should stay home and away from others for 21 days after the exposure date.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkejxdbj00193b6prcqfx7je@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A person who has measles can be infectious before they have any symptoms of the disease, and this quarantine period helps reduce the risk of continued spread during the incubation period.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkejxdbj001a3b6p8grspzga@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In South Carolina, more than 400 people are in quarantine after known exposures, and the state health department has said that a significant share of cases have resulted from those in quarantine — an indication of just how important the public health practice is to interrupting spread.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkejxdbj001b3b6pvkhb9asx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But weeks of missed school or work and all of the associated costs can be avoided: People who have gotten both of their recommended MMR shots don’t have to quarantine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkejxdbj001c3b6pzxqagtn1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Vaccination is the best way for parents to have some confidence, even in the event of an exposure,” Hackell said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;A unique AI model developed by Stanford University researchers and their colleagues could one day be used to predict your risk of more than 100 health conditions, without you even needing to be awake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As detailed in a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-04133-4"&gt;recently released paper&lt;/a&gt;, the SleepFM AI model analyzes a comprehensive suite of physiological recordings to predict a person's future risk of dementia, heart failure, and all-cause mortality – based on a single night of sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SleepFM is a foundation model, like &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/chatgpt-5-surprising-truths-about-how-ai-chatbots-actually-work"&gt;ChatGPT&lt;/a&gt;, trained on a vast dataset of nearly 600,000 hours of sleep data gathered from 65,000 participants. As ChatGPT learns from words and text, SleepFM learns from 5-second increments of sleep data from recordings from various sleep clinics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/there-are-5-profiles-of-sleep-heres-what-yours-says-about-your-health"&gt;There Are 5 Profiles of Sleep – Here's What Yours Says About Your Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sleep clinicians collected this data through an extensive, if uncomfortable, technique called &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-explain-what-a-good-nights-sleep-actually-looks-like"&gt;polysomnography&lt;/a&gt; (PSG).

This could be an early sign of the various conditions causing poor sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though some data types and sleep stages were more accurate predictors than others, the best results were owed to bodily interrelationships and contrasts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specifically, the most reliable disease predictors were physiological functions that appeared out of sync: "a brain that looks asleep but a heart that looks awake, for example – seemed to spell trouble," Mignot &lt;a href="https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2026/01/ai-sleep-disease.html"&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers note several limitations, such as evolving clinical practices and patient populations in recent decades. Additionally, the data were drawn from patients referred for sleep studies, meaning a portion of the general population is underrepresented in the PSG data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet despite AI's controversy in realms like art, its healthcare potential is a life-saving reminder of the invaluable and scientifically awe-inspiring capabilities of AI agents. For example, future use cases can combine SleepFM with wearable sleep devices to provide real-time health monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, as large language models (LLMs) learn our lingo by relating words and text, "SleepFM is essentially learning the language of sleep," Zou &lt;a href="https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2026/01/ai-sleep-disease.html"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research is published in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-04133-4"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-04133-4"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The floor curves in a circle: older kids do laps pushing their IV poles, while the younger ones trundle around on wagons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;There’s a playroom in which they hold themed events – bingo nights, slime nights, candy-cart nights – to inject some fun into a space otherwise sated with illness and death. One year Janosko, who worked as a nurse, dressed up as a blow-up cow to make the kids laugh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The floor has its own soundtrack. There’s the ubiquitous beeping of machines: low battery alert, air in line, infusion complete. On a good day, it echoes with laughter and the chirping of little voices. Many other days there is crying, and sometimes screaming, as kids are held down to change their dressings or mediport needles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The worst are the silent days, when a patient is approaching death. It’s when you brace yourself for what follows: the wailing of parents who have lost their child.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Janosko knew all these sights and sounds so intimately that last August, when she returned to the ward holding four-year-old Izzy’s hand, it felt like a homecoming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside data-spacefinder-role="supporting" data-gu-name="pullquote" class="dcr-p6qh0t"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 22 14" class="dcr-scql1j"&gt;&lt;path d="M5.255 0h4.75c-.572 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941H0C.792 9.104 2.44 4.53 5.255 0Zm11.061 0H21c-.506 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941h-8.686c.902-4.837 2.485-9.411 5.3-13.941Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;blockquote class="dcr-zzndwp"&gt;[Kids with DIPG] can’t move, they can’t talk or smile or eat … but their minds are fully intact&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Except this time, her own daughter was the patient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Izzy had been diagnosed with the cancer every nurse on the ninth floor fears most: diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma, or DIPG. There is no cure, and the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/cancer" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; is almost universally fatal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The tumor arises in the brainstem, which controls critical functions such as breathing and heart rate. Surgery is usually impossible given the location, and the disease progresses with brutal speed with a median survival of &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6075859/pdf/JCO.2017.75.9308.pdf" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;11 months&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="1c8515d0-09f6-4e0f-a39a-3eb8cfe844c2" data-spacefinder-role="showcase" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="element element--showcase element-showcase dcr-5h0uf4"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-9ktzqp"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Jenn Janosko and her daughter, Izzy,  embrace on a recent afternoon at their home.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Janosko took her child to their allocated room. She passed former colleagues who recognised her, some giving her hugs, others looks of pity. As she settled Izzy in, she could picture the faces of the kids she had nursed in the exact same bed, some of whom had succumbed on her watch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Most parents have no idea what a DIPG diagnosis means. Janosko knew exactly: she was all too aware that the standard treatment of radiation and chemotherapy ultimately does not work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The only hope for Janosko was to find a clinical trial that would offer Izzy the prospect of a few more months or years of life, or – if she dared to dream – even a glimpse of that elusive cure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;For the past four months, Janosko has chased that vanishingly small hope relentlessly. She has tracked down the 10 medical centers in the US offering the most promising clinical trials, calling again and again until she had to restrain herself, worried about causing irritation. Most trials had a long waiting list, while others were not a good fit for Izzy’s condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;One, however, could have been a match: a clinical trial run by Izzy’s own neurosurgeon at Memorial. But a new hurdle emerged: the trial, which was ready to launch in cancer centers across the country, was abruptly called off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Politics had intervened, Janosko was told.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="0d39bdf3-364b-4462-bd07-b1182095690e" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="element element--richLink element-richLink dcr-47fhrn"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":20,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"‘Impossible to rebuild’: NIH scientists say Trump cuts will imperil life-saving research","elementId":"0d39bdf3-364b-4462-bd07-b1182095690e","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/07/nih-scientists-trump-cuts"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":18,"display":0,"theme":0},"isInStarRatingVariant":false}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Trump administration’s&lt;/a&gt; dismantling of federal agencies has hit cancer research hard. It has led to budgets being slashed, grants canceled or delayed, while clinical trials – often the final hope for children with terminal illness – have been suspended or closed. Laboratories have imposed a hiring freeze on researchers and postponed orders for new equipment, and world-class scientists are seeking jobs in the private sector or abroad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Izzy and children like her are suffering the consequences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;For the families involved, this means so much more than the cold budgetary figures cited in congressional debates or across news headlines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“I know what DIPG does to kids,” Janosko said. “Eventually they can’t move, they can’t talk or smile or eat, they can’t see or hear, but their minds are fully intact. That’s the urgency.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;She put the reality facing her daughter starkly: “If I don’t find a clinical trial for my child, she’ll be dead in a year.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="the-big-funding-freeze" class="dcr-12ibh7f"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The big funding freeze&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The paradox is hard to miss. Trump’s bid to “&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2026/jan/10/mass-surveillance-the-metaverse-making-america-great-again-the-novelists-who-predicted-our-present" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Make America great again”&lt;/a&gt; is undermining an area in which America is already great – at the global forefront of the search for a cure for this disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Over the past 15 years, US medical centers have pioneered breakthroughs in understanding the genetic makeup of child brain tumors. American scientists, working with colleagues around the world, have expanded knowledge of the mutations that cause the tumors to grow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Those advances have spawned new treatments targeting the cancers’ weak spots at a cellular level. The resulting clinical trials – many of them customized to target the vulnerabilities of each child’s own tumor – do not yet amount to a cure. But they do point towards the path forward. A very small, but potentially significant, number of children with DIPG are still alive several years into treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside data-spacefinder-role="supporting" data-gu-name="pullquote" class="dcr-p6qh0t"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 22 14" class="dcr-scql1j"&gt;&lt;path d="M5.255 0h4.75c-.572 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941H0C.792 9.104 2.44 4.53 5.255 0Zm11.061 0H21c-.506 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941h-8.686c.902-4.837 2.485-9.411 5.3-13.941Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;blockquote class="dcr-zzndwp"&gt;The NIH monopoly on directing research should be broken&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Many of the greatest innovators in this space have been shaped by the American medical system, or have made their way here from across the world, drawn by its cutting-edge medical research. Despite their disparate roots, they share a common desire to save the lives of children. Neuro-oncologists and surgeons, microbiologists and biostatisticians have joined forces in a team effort that is the envy of other countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But science, even at its most altruistic, still needs funding. These cancers are so rare – about 5,000 children are diagnosed with brain tumors in the US each year, including about 300 with the deadly DIPG – that there is little profit incentive to lure big pharma. Federal money is therefore vital, but government support has been limited even during normal administrations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Pediatric cancers are now the leading cause of death by disease for children in the US, with brain tumors being the most common.

On the frontlines of the disease, scientists and families say the opposite is unfolding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;How the country arrived here is no secret. The blueprint for the administration’s approach to scientific research was set out by&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/project-2025" data-link-name="in body link"&gt; Project 2025&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="https://static.heritage.org/project2025/2025_MandateForLeadership_FULL.pdf" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;920-page report&lt;/a&gt; compiled by the rightwing Heritage Foundation. It called for, in effect, the dismantling of the federal National Institutes of Health (NIH) as the world’s largest funder of medical research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“The NIH monopoly on directing research should be broken,” the document says on page 462.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Trump appointed the architect of Project 2025, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/10/who-is-russell-vought-trump-office-of-management-and-budget" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Russell Vought&lt;/a&gt;, as the government’s top budget official. In that role, he spearheaded the assault on the NIH, announced the “dramatic overhaul” of the agency, and blocked the release of&lt;a href="https://x.com/atrupar/status/1949482040727834978" data-link-name="in body link"&gt; billions of dollars&lt;/a&gt; of cancer research funding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Then there was Elon Musk. Even before Trump’s inauguration, the tech billionaire was intervening in ways that would profoundly affect children with brain tumors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;A month before Trump returned to the White House, Musk &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/19/us/politics/elon-musk-spending-bill-fact-check.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;used&lt;/a&gt; his own platform, X, to push a stream of &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/12/18/elon-musk-false-claims-cr-00195252" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;falsehoods&lt;/a&gt; and help sink a bipartisan spending bill in Congress. A number of provisions that would have boosted funding for child cancer research &lt;a href="https://www.pcrf-kids.org/2024/12/31/a-heartbreaking-outcome-funding-for-childhood-cancer-research-cut-from-u-s-spending-bill/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;were scrapped&lt;/a&gt;, including a voucher system that would have injected millions of dollars into experimental trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="19827247-827f-444a-ad2a-97d26360f4c4" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="element element--richLink element-richLink dcr-47fhrn"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":41,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"Cancer experts alarmed over ‘gut-wrenching’ Trump plan to cut research spending by billions","elementId":"19827247-827f-444a-ad2a-97d26360f4c4","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/26/cancer-research-trump-nci-cuts-plan"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":18,"display":0,"theme":0},"isInStarRatingVariant":false}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Within days of Trump’s inauguration, the White House imposed a funding freeze on all federal agencies, including the NIH.

Instead of the top 9% of peer-reviewed applications being approved, from now on only 4% would go ahead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;And in August, the Trump administration said it would &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/28/well/pediatric-brain-cancer-trial-group.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;withdraw support&lt;/a&gt; from North America’s oldest and most productive pediatric brain cancer research network – a group that has led the search for a cure for 25 years. All funding for the Pediatric Brain Tumor Consortium (PBTC), an alliance of 16 leading children’s hospitals in the US and Canada, will end in March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Almost overnight, the decision brought many of the continent’s most promising clinical trials to a halt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Children who were already participating in those trials would continue to receive care. But families like Izzy’s had a bitter pill to swallow: the experiments on which they had pinned their last hope would henceforth be closed to new patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="a-raft-of-closing-trials" class="dcr-12ibh7f"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A raft of closing trials&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The Janoskos live in an idyllic lakeside house an hour’s drive north of New York City. When I visited last month, it looked like a holiday postcard: a light dusting of snow on the lawn, a large American flag flapping over the front porch. Inside, model trains and furry animals were scattered liberally over the living room floor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Yet here was Janosko, amid this idealized vision of American family life, talking to me with tears rolling down her cheeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Occasionally, her face would betray a look of total and utter bewilderment. How was it possible, after so many years nursing children with brain cancer, that her own daughter had been hit by the disease?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“I just can’t make sense of it,” she said. “Was this my destiny forever?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="77950055-4c49-4332-ad7e-65bca84febac" data-spacefinder-role="showcase" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="element element--showcase element-showcase dcr-5h0uf4"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-9ktzqp"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Izzy plays with her dad and siblings while the Janosko family spends time together in their living room on a recent afternoon.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Sarah Blesener/The Guardian&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Years spent caring for gravely ill children had left Janosko so anxious about one of her own falling sick that, long before Izzy was diagnosed, she sought therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Whenever a dark thought about her child contracting a terminal illness entered her head, she was encouraged to look at a square and think of something positive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;It didn’t work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;She continued having dire ideations for months before the discovery of Izzy’s tumor. She even found herself agreeing with other pediatric nurses that when you formed a family, it was best to have three children. That way, if one of them died, the survivor wouldn’t be an only child.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Janosko has three children, of whom Izzy is the eldest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Then one day Izzy’s eyes began crossing themselves, and Janosko’s world imploded. Tests revealed a growing mass on her brainstem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Dr Mark Souweidane, Izzy’s neurosurgeon at Memorial, designed a clinical trial during which &lt;a href="https://neurosurgery.weill.cornell.edu/about-us/news-updates/breakthrough-dipg-pediatric-brain-cancer-treatment-novel-drug-delivery" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;tiny catheters&lt;/a&gt; are inserted directly into the brain tissue to channel high concentrations of therapeutic agents slowly into the tumor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Early tests have been promising. Several children on the trial lived longer than three years, and three patients are long-term survivors. One of them is still alive 12 years on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside data-spacefinder-role="supporting" data-gu-name="pullquote" class="dcr-p6qh0t"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 22 14" class="dcr-scql1j"&gt;&lt;path d="M5.255 0h4.75c-.572 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941H0C.792 9.104 2.44 4.53 5.255 0Zm11.061 0H21c-.506 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941h-8.686c.902-4.837 2.485-9.411 5.3-13.941Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;blockquote class="dcr-zzndwp"&gt;I don’t consider it optional to offer research to these kids – I think every one of them should have that option&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;When Izzy was first diagnosed, it appeared that she would be a candidate for this novel drug delivery technique. Through the Pediatric Brain Tumor Consortium, Souweidane was only weeks away from launching an expanded trial across 12 medical centers nationwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Then the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Trump administration&lt;/a&gt; closed the consortium, forcing Souweidane to call off the launch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The other groundbreaking new treatment Janosko hoped to secure is called Car T-cell therapy. It works by extracting T-cells from a patient’s blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;T-cells – the foot soldiers of the immune system – are then trained to recognise and attack specific proteins on the surface of the cancer cells. The repurposed Car T-cells are put back into the body and dispatched to the battlefield.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Janosko herself nursed the first children who had received Car T-cells for leukemia. She knows several of those pioneer kids who are still alive today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Spurred on by the hope that the success of Car T-cell therapy in childhood leukemia might be transferable, Janosko has lobbied several leading medical centers that are applying it to DIPG.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;At the time of my visit, however, every door remained closed to her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="92307207-8203-4a5b-94d3-89af43813afb" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="element element--inline element-inline dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-fd61eq"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Izzy’s art decorates the walls of the Janosko home.  &lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Sarah Blesener/The Guardian&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;A clinical trial at Texas Children’s Cancer Center has been suspended as a result of the consortium’s closure.

And at Seattle Children’s hospital, she learned more than 50 kids were already on the waiting list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Professor Sarah Leary, who runs the program in Seattle, said the hardest part of her job was turning frantic parents like Janosko away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“I don’t consider it optional to offer research to these kids – I think every one of them should have that option,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;She paused, tearing up. “I’ve been doing this for 20 years, and I still get emotional.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;After our interview, Janosko took me with her to pick up Izzy from school. The child emerged carrying a pink backpack. She hugged her mother, leaning heavily against her legs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Izzy had a shock of golden curls cascading to her shoulders, tied with a red ribbon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“That’s a pretty red ribbon,” I said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“No, it’s not pretty,” she fired back, tired and annoyed by the presence of a stranger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“No, I don’t want to say hello,” she corrected her mother.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Later that day, Janosko texted me a short phone video. In it Izzy, red ribbon still in her hair, looked into the camera and said: “Sorry I was grumpy. It was nice to meet you.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Soon after I left, Izzy’s spirits had lifted. “I think her meds are making her more irritable,” her mom said. “I just wanted you to experience her cute side.

It’s the first thing he sees when he looks up from his desk – about 40 smiling faces beaming back at him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Every one of those kids is one of my patients who has passed away,” he said. “It’s a constant reminder. I want to be pushed to remember so I know how urgent this is.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;That urgency has inspired Hwang, a pediatric neuro-oncologist at George Washington University cancer center in Washington DC, to devote the past 15 years caring for children with brain tumors. He approaches every new child he sees with the ambition to cure them, or at least to prolong their life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Even when I think the chances of a patient being cured are low, the chances of them having more time than they would without treatment are high. That is the space in which we function,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Hwang led the PBTC’s working group on immunotherapy, and relished its power to move science rapidly forward thanks to “active critical discussion and collaboration”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The idea behind the consortium was quite simple: “Get some of the best minds in the world, put them in a room together, and tell them you don’t leave until you’ve fixed it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside data-spacefinder-role="supporting" data-gu-name="pullquote" class="dcr-p6qh0t"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 22 14" class="dcr-scql1j"&gt;&lt;path d="M5.255 0h4.75c-.572 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941H0C.792 9.104 2.44 4.53 5.255 0Zm11.061 0H21c-.506 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941h-8.686c.902-4.837 2.485-9.411 5.3-13.941Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;blockquote class="dcr-zzndwp"&gt;This goes against evolution … It’s like watching a countercurrent &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The wind-down of the consortium leaves him deeply concerned about the future of science itself. So many potentially transformative experiments are ending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Where and how are we going to do this kind of science and research?” he asked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Hwang’s own research has been grinding to a halt. He and Elias Sayour, a pediatric oncologist at the University of Florida &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/health" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt;, were working on devising a new treatment for DIPG.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Their approach involves an mRNA vaccine using similar technology to the Covid vaccine. It fires up the body’s immune system – it’s like hitting the nitro button on a racing car, Hwang said – then educates it to be able to recognise and attack a key mutation in the tumor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Planning for the study was already showing exciting results. Tests on mice did not only shrink the tumor, they destroyed it altogether. A separate mRNA vaccine trial with adults had such a massive inflammatory immune response that it made patients sick, but there, too, no viable tumor cells remained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;There is no guarantee that the technology will work for children with DIPG. But in Hwang’s view, it is certainly worth trying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;A rigorous peer-reviewed process thought the same. It placed Hwang and Sayour’s proposal within the top 7% of grant applications – well within the 9% that had been the federal government’s official cutoff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;When the qualifying band was reduced to 4%, their hopes and ambitions were set back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“It’s such a major task to walk these families through their darkest times,” Hwang said. “There’s so much uncertainty for them already, and now we have additional uncertainty causing a flight of talent from the research world, slowing the pace of discovery.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Dr Souweidane, the neurosurgeon at Memorial Sloan Kettering in New York, whose groundbreaking&lt;a href="https://neurosurgery.weill.cornell.edu/about-us/news-updates/breakthrough-dipg-pediatric-brain-cancer-treatment-novel-drug-delivery" data-link-name="in body link"&gt; catheter delivery trial&lt;/a&gt; Janosko hoped Izzy might join, has also been forced to postpone his plans.

It’s like watching a countercurrent flowing against the evolutionary maturity of cancer therapy and cooperative group trials,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Leary, the Seattle children’s hospital doctor, helps lead several nationwide collaborative bodies for childhood brain cancer. She has noticed that several research laboratories across the country are facing hiring freezes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Labs are where much of the heavy lifting is done to analyse the results of clinical trials. They are where some of the big questions are being tackled: why does a particular trial do wonders for 20% of kids, and not the other 80%? How can you tell in advance which kids will be in either cohort?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Federal funding cuts are eating into the capability of labs to answer such critical questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;One of the stranger consequences of Trump’s new regime is that researchers now contort their language to avoid antagonizing the health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr, over his hostility to &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2026/jan/05/trump-rfk-jr-child-vaccine-recommendations" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;childhood vaccinations&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Both childhood vaccines and the experimental cancer vaccines rely on mRNA, a molecule that carries genetic instructions inside cells. But in human terms they are apples and oranges: one is designed to protect healthy children from viruses; the other is a last-ditch effort to keep dying children alive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside data-spacefinder-role="supporting" data-gu-name="pullquote" class="dcr-p6qh0t"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 22 14" class="dcr-scql1j"&gt;&lt;path d="M5.255 0h4.75c-.572 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941H0C.792 9.104 2.44 4.53 5.255 0Zm11.061 0H21c-.506 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941h-8.686c.902-4.837 2.485-9.411 5.3-13.941Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;blockquote class="dcr-zzndwp"&gt;For parents of children who potentially have just a few months left to live, ‘as soon as is feasible’ is a hard sell&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Advice is now circulating privately among top scientists working in many different cancer settings, urging them to avoid using the term “mRNA” in federal applications.

I asked them if they wished to comment about the apparent stark contrast between Trump’s pledge to defeat childhood cancer and the reality on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The HHS responded with a statement. “NIH continues to invest significantly in bold and innovative cancer research,” it said. “Ending the scourge of cancer is one of our highest priorities, as reflected in the National &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/cancer" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Cancer&lt;/a&gt; Institute’s (NCI’s) budget of more than $7 billion – the largest of any NIH institute or center.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The director of the NCI, Dr Anthony Letai, also commented. He said that the NCI, which leads most US cancer research, spent more last year in extramural grants than in any previous year, and that “pediatric brain cancer research remains a high priority”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;He added that the decision to “pivot” away from the consortium had been made for “good logistical reasons”. PBTC trials would be enrolled in a new system “as soon as is feasible”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;For parents of children who potentially have just a few months left to live, “as soon as is feasible” is a hard sell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;As for the White House, a spokesperson asked for details of specific grants that had been cancelled leading to delays in cancer research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;I provided the information, but that was the last I heard from them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="no-new-patients" class="dcr-12ibh7f"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No new patients&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“She’s just a baby! She’s just a baby!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Nikki Owens can still hear herself screaming the words after doctors told her that her daughter, Kinlee, had a brain tumor. Owens was 41 at the time. Kinlee was nine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;She remembers the moment viscerally – the shock, the disbelief, the sound of her own voice breaking free before she could stop it. Owens is a nurse herself, working with people with learning disabilities. Unlike Janosko, however, she had never heard of DIPG before a doctor delivered the news on 18 December 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;I met Nikki and Kinlee at the Downtown Aquarium in Houston, Texas, one of Kinlee’s favorite places. It was an emotionally fraught moment: the following day marked the first anniversary of her diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="51399fb2-846d-443d-8e9c-e9be2d03d766" data-spacefinder-role="showcase" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="element element--showcase element-showcase dcr-5h0uf4"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-9ktzqp"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Kinlee Owens, center, her mother, Nikki Owens, right, and grandmother Pam Zoshak, left, look at fish at the Downtown Aquarium in Houston, Texas. &lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Danielle Villasana/The Guardian&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;During our visit, Kinlee sat in a wheelchair wrapped in a Lilo &amp;amp; Stitch blanket. Her hair was immaculately groomed and she had long manicured nails, but she was drowsy and her face was swollen from steroids. Because she could no longer blink with one eye, she wore a mermaid eyepatch. As we passed the tanks with giant stingrays and bamboo sharks, she momentarily perked up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Strangely for an aquarium, there was also a tiger pacing nervously behind glass. The animal looked taut with pent-up energy, bursting to get outside. Owens carried the same tension, as if her body could barely contain the sadness and anger boiling inside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“I’m pissed. That’s an understatement. I’m infuriated,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;It was hard to grasp the extent to which cancer has changed Kinlee. Then her mother sat beside me and opened the photo gallery on her phone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;She showed me images of a healthy Kinlee dressed as a cheerleader, dancing to Footloose, fishing in the bayou, wearing a filigree white dress. She came across just as her mother describes her: “Quick-witted, sassy, full of one-liners. A busy, active, happy, sociable child. Definitely the life of the party.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="2cb1b4d9-bcb4-4b83-a3b4-f0667efbfa54" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="element element--inline element-inline dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-fd61eq"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;A picture of Kinlee Owens from the phone of her mother, Nikki Owens, before she was diagnosed with DIPG, or diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma. &lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Danielle Villasana/The Guardian&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;At first Kinlee was put on ONC201, one of very few new drugs for deadly child brain tumors to have been&lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/resources-information-approved-drugs/fda-grants-accelerated-approval-dordaviprone-diffuse-midline-glioma" data-link-name="in body link"&gt; FDA-approved&lt;/a&gt;. But it made her so sick she had to stop taking it after just a few days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Next, Owens was told her daughter qualified for two DIPG clinical trials, only to be informed that NIH cuts meant that neither was enrolling new patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Later, she turned to an innovative treatment developed by a biopharma startup called Flag Therapeutics. Its experimental drug, Flag 3, was showing promise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Flag 3 also ground to a halt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;I contacted Frank Sorgi, Flag Therapeutics’s chief executive, to find out what had happened. He told me that he had created his startup after his wife died of the most deadly adult form of brain tumor, glioblastoma (GBM), in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="8c9e8bb9-d119-48ab-a91a-703ee66ee165" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="element element--richLink element-richLink dcr-47fhrn"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":134,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"When I found out about the brain tumour that would kill me, I faced my worst fears – but I chose to take it on","elementId":"8c9e8bb9-d119-48ab-a91a-703ee66ee165","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/may/28/jessica-morriss-all-in-my-head-book-extract-glioblastoma-brain-cancer"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":18,"display":0,"theme":0},"isInStarRatingVariant":false}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;That gave us a personal connection. My wife,&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/may/28/jessica-morriss-all-in-my-head-book-extract-glioblastoma-brain-cancer" data-link-name="in body link"&gt; Jessica Morris&lt;/a&gt;, also died of GBM in 2021. She had been a medical pioneer, too, having taken part in a number of experimental clinical trials during the five years she lived with the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Sorgi explained that Flag 3 was a novel small-molecule therapy designed to target, bind and kill cancer cells while leaving normal healthy cells unharmed. Provisional lab tests have been remarkably successful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But he hadn’t counted on Elon Musk’s bombardment against government spending in the days before Trump’s inauguration. The tech billionaire scuppered the voucher scheme that would have generated the investment Sorgi was relying upon to get started.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The loss of this funding stream forced Sorgi to cancel plans for a clinical trial. He is still trying to advance his novel drug, but has no idea how to pay for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;It’s like, he said, “having to jump out of a plane without a parachute. I’ll just have to figure out the parachute on the way down.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;As for Owens, the multiple knockbacks on top of the trauma of Kinlee’s ailment have left her livid. “It’s like a slap in the face after being punched in the gut,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;A month before Kinlee was diagnosed, she had joined millions of other Americans in the polling booths to vote for Trump. “Crazy I know, I voted for this man.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;She backed him, she said, because she liked his straight talking and had admired how he got things done during his first presidential term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“He buttered me up, made me feel good. Then he turned around and betrayed me,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Betrayed?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Oh absolutely. I voted for him without hesitation, then I watched as the dude went rogue. He’ll go and bomb the hell out of a country, blow it to smithereens at the cost of billions, then cut healthcare for children to save money. It doesn’t make any sense.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="6673c556-c426-4bd0-b98a-f539eca8fe1d" data-spacefinder-role="showcase" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="element element--showcase element-showcase dcr-5h0uf4"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-9ktzqp"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Kinlee Owens, left, rests her head on her mother, Nikki Owens, right, during a visit to the aquarium.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Danielle Villasana/The Guardian&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 id="a-ray-of-hope" class="dcr-12ibh7f"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A ray of hope&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“She was the most courageous person I’ve ever met,” Mike Henry told me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Mike and his wife, Kate, were both 36 when their daughter Blair was diagnosed with a rare and fast-growing brain tumor called ETMR. She was just shy of three. She died eight months later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;A month into chemotherapy, the Henrys were presented with a choice so brutal that their oncologist, a veteran with decades of experience, cried as she explained it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“She told us it was a fork in the road,” Mike said. “Either we could handcuff Blair to this bed, pin her down to give her shots that made her sick, until she passed away in hospital … or we could spend the next few months with her at home, doing things she loved. We knew that if we decided to take her home, she would die.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Ten days before her third birthday, they chose home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Blair’s illness and death have transformed the Henrys’ lives beyond recognition. Almost six years later, they still devote themselves to finding a cure to pediatric brain tumors. It’s Blair’s legacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Kate is now an active member of a bereavement group working in the Philadelphia area. Mike is director of advocacy for the&lt;a href="https://curethekids.org/about/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt; Pediatric Brain Tumor Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, a non-profit that offers family support, raises research funding, and pushes for government action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;His new vocation is to spare other families the disaster that befell his own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Mike Henry used to work in public policy. That old life now gives him pause. In 2013-14 he was employed by Heritage Action, the political arm of the conservative Heritage Foundation that would, a decade later, go on to draft Project 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;A decade is a long time in conservative politics. Henry was at Heritage a year before Trump descended the golden staircase, and well before he had remodeled the Republican party in his image. Heritage was not as extreme then as it is today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Still, Henry looks back on how he used to lobby for fiscal responsibility and smaller government, and ponders. Since Blair became sick, the way he perceives the role of government and the importance of caring for one another has changed drastically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;He knows now what he did not know then: that, in an instant, any one of us can be toppled from our lives and plummet to the depths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“We had a great family, stable jobs, two wonderful children. We lost all of our savings in the first two weeks after the diagnosis. We were thrust on Medicaid, unemployment, then we lost Blair.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside data-spacefinder-role="supporting" data-gu-name="pullquote" class="dcr-p6qh0t"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 22 14" class="dcr-scql1j"&gt;&lt;path d="M5.255 0h4.75c-.572 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941H0C.792 9.104 2.44 4.53 5.255 0Zm11.061 0H21c-.506 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941h-8.686c.902-4.837 2.485-9.411 5.3-13.941Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;blockquote class="dcr-zzndwp"&gt;Giving in is not in our vocabulary&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Their freefall has made Henry a more empathetic person, he thinks. He understands that in America you can do all the right things, be an upstanding citizen, and still get chewed up and spat out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“I see now that I was naive to the experience of others,” Henry said, “until I went through it myself.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The foundation Henry works for is scrambling, alongside many other charitable groups formed by bereaved parents, to raise money to fill the void left by Trump’s cuts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;They can never compete with the vastness of federal funding, of course. But their voices and passion serve an important purpose: they send a message to politicians on Capitol Hill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;As Owens put it: “Giving in is not in our vocabulary.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The same goes for Hwang. “My initial gut response was anger,” he said. But he has come to see that wallowing in it would only hurt the mission. He is determined to remain calm, present an optimistic face to worried families, and find a new way forward for his mRNA vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“If I thought that something was insurmountable, I would just go home. And that would be a disservice to these families and to these children.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;And there’s another reason not to give up. Every so often, a ray of light pierces through.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;A couple of weeks after my visit, Janosko contacted me. She had news.

   &lt;p&gt;Clinical psychologist &lt;a href="https://www.drorma.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Steve Orma&lt;/a&gt; was in his early 40s when he developed insomnia — difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;He couldn't stop fixating on it. "I started getting into the frame of mind most people get sucked into. I worried, 'What's going on? Is there something wrong with me?'" he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That fear of not being able to sleep is a phenomenon called "sleep anxiety," says Orma, who went on to become a specialist in insomnia treatment. Left untreated, that anxiety can prevent people from actually falling asleep.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The more you focus on it, the less chance you'll sleep, which then makes you more anxious. That's the cycle that spins," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;One of the most powerful ways to overcome sleep anxiety is cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I). It's well studied, doesn't rely on sleep drugs and has been shown to be effective for clinical insomnia. Orma used this treatment to heal his sleep, and it's now the main focus of his therapy practice.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Typically, a CBT-I program lasts about six to eight weeks, and each week, you and a provider work on a strategy to reset sleep behaviors and restructure your thinking around rest.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But you don't have to be in an official program to benefit from CBT-I. Whether you're dealing with some sleep stress or just the occasional off-night, these CBT-I practices can help.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Wake up at the same time every day&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Having a consistent wake-up time helps your body know when it's time to get sleepy, says Aric Prather, a sleep scientist and the author of &lt;a href="https://www.aricprather.com/the-sleep-prescription" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Sleep Prescription: 7 Days to Unlocking Your Best Rest&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The sleepy cues are managed by your circadian rhythm, or your body's internal clock. A set wake-up time keeps your internal clock ticking on time.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Prather uses the analogy of a "sleep balloon." When you wake up, your sleep balloon is empty. Your balloon fills up with sleepiness throughout the day. Once it's full, you feel ready to sleep. Waking up at the same time every day, even on weekends, keeps your sleep cues consistent.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Focus on a wind-down time, not a bedtime &lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Instead of trying to force yourself to go to bed at a specific time, even though you're not sleepy, focus on&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;winding down for bed earlier, says &lt;a href="https://www.uclahealth.org/providers/ravi-aysola" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Ravi Aysola&lt;/a&gt;, director of the Sleep Disorders Center at the University of California, Los Angeles.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Pick a time to transition from daytime activities to nighttime activities. This can look like unplugging from screens, putting on comfortable clothes and dimming the lights in your home.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;He says having a wind-down time instead of a strict bedtime can help lessen the feeling that you must get to sleep immediately — and can reduce the anxiety that can occur when you don't.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Schedule your "worry time"&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;If all your stress comes flooding in at bedtime, put some dedicated "worry time" on your calendar during the daylight hours, says Prather. "Use your brain space when you're more rested to do some worrying."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That way, if your brain starts to drift to tax season, child care troubles or that big mess in the garage while you're in bed, "you have a way of saying, 'I did this worrying already,'" he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Try taking just 10 or 15 minutes at the same time each day to write out what's bothering you. It can help your brain relax when your head hits the pillow, Prather says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Be mindful when tracking sleep&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Managing sleep anxiety means also being cognizant of how much information you're taking in about your sleep.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The prevalence of sleep-tracking devices and wearables has led to the advent of orthosomnia, a type of insomnia developed from anxiety over wanting to achieve perfect sleep data, says Aysola.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Sleep trackers can give you helpful information about how you slept, but it's important to have a healthy level of skepticism when it comes to the data and a plan for what you'll do with it, he adds.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;If you use these devices to track your sleep, he says to ask yourself: "Is that information helping you make changes in your behavior or lifestyle, or is it stressing you out and making the insomnia worse?"&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;If you notice you've been waking up feeling more rested, for example, that could tell you that your new wind-down time and earlier morning alarm are starting to work for you.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;If you tend to fixate on your sleep-tracker data, try tracking your sleep with a pen and paper instead. It can help you focus on how your sleep is &lt;em&gt;feeling&lt;/em&gt; to you instead of the numbers.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Reshaping your sleep habits is only half the battle, Orma says. The rest of the work comes down to shifting your mindset. Sleep will vary from night to night and everyone has a bad night of sleep now and then, so adjust your expectations accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"When you have that frame of mind, your sleep starts to get better," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="hr"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The digital story was edited by Malaka Gharib, with art direction by Beck Harlan.

The vitamin C in berries supports your immune system and boost skin health. Typically low in calories, they are also full of fiber, which supports a healthy, happy gut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-TATV93fxqGURSqmHRoDLvk" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-TATV93fxqGURSqmHRoDLvk slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Start your week with achievable workout ideas, health tips and wellbeing advice in your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a id="elk-3-bone-broth" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-3-bone-broth"&gt;&lt;span&gt;3.

Roast the veg first to get a deeper flavor. Add lentils to up the protein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-4-sweet-potato" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-4-sweet-potato"&gt;&lt;span&gt;4.

I roast them and use them all week—in goodness bowls, sides, or mashed with cinnamon and salt.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sweet potatoes are complex carbohydrates, which means they provide a steady supply of energy. They are full of vitamin A, which supports immunity and boosts eye health, while the fiber aids digestion and helps to keep your gut working efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The potassium in sweet potatoes is also known to support muscle and nerve function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-5-avocado" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-5-avocado"&gt;&lt;span&gt;5.

I mix it with olive oil, lemon, and herbs or add it straight to a bowl.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Omega-3s boost cognitive and heart health, and are known for their anti-inflammatory properties, making them a good choice for anyone with conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), arthritis and heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re plant-based and want a big hit of omega-3s, swap fish for walnuts, which you can add on top of salads, curries and stews.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-7-grass-fed-ground-beef" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-7-grass-fed-ground-beef"&gt;&lt;span&gt;7.

Grass-fed typically has more omega-3s in it than other types of beef.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are plant-based, a high-protein alternative to beef is tempeh or tofu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-8-medjool-dates" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-8-medjool-dates"&gt;&lt;span&gt;8.

I stuff them with nut butter and chocolate or chop one or two into salads for a sweet bite.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medjool dates are a fiber-rich source of carbohydrates that provide a quick energy boost and help support an efficient digestive system. They have potassium and magnesium in them, which is good for muscle and nerve health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They are naturally sweet so can be used as a sweet substitute in baking, but note they are still very high in sugar and calories, and could cause blood sugar spikes if you eat too many at one time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-9-jasmine-rice" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-9-jasmine-rice"&gt;&lt;span&gt;9.

This makes it a good source of quick energy for anyone who has a sensitive digestion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-10-eggs" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-10-eggs"&gt;&lt;span&gt;10.

I add cottage cheese to up the protein and finish with arugula for something light, peppery and fresh,” says Lindgren.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like beef, eggs are a complete protein. They are packed with healthy fats, vitamins A, B12, D and E, and choline, which improves memory and brain development.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Some mosquitoes have become increasingly reliant &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/there-is-a-shockingly-weird-reason-mosquitoes-always-seem-to-find-us-says-study"&gt;on human blood&lt;/a&gt;, new research shows – and it's probably our own fault.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A sampling study of the bloodsuckers in Brazil has found that as biodiversity drops, mosquitoes are more likely to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-discover-mosquitoes-are-using-infrared-to-track-humans-down"&gt;hunt &lt;em&gt;us&lt;/em&gt; down&lt;/a&gt;. It makes sense, really: As human activity pushes other animals out of the region, mozzies have fewer alternatives to feast on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The consequences are more dire than just an itchy annoyance, though. Mosquitoes are key &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/us-man-dies-from-rare-disease-following-mosquito-bite"&gt;vectors of disease&lt;/a&gt;, so a shift in preference for biting humans can have major health implications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/jurassic-park-was-right-mosquitoes-really-can-carry-libraries-of-animal-dna"&gt;Jurassic Park Was Right: Mosquitoes Really Can Carry Libraries of Animal DNA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers from the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro and the Oswaldo Cruz Institute set up light traps in two nature reserves in the Atlantic Forest, Brazil, to capture 52 species of mosquito.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_189051" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-189051" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Reserva-Ecologica-do-Guapiacu-REGUA-Cachoeiras-de-Macacu-Rio-de-Janeiro-642x361.jpg" alt="Wildlife in a green reserve" class="size-medium wp-image-189051" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Reserva-Ecologica-do-Guapiacu-REGUA-Cachoeiras-de-Macacu-Rio-de-Janeiro-642x361.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Reserva-Ecologica-do-Guapiacu-REGUA-Cachoeiras-de-Macacu-Rio-de-Janeiro-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Reserva-Ecologica-do-Guapiacu-REGUA-Cachoeiras-de-Macacu-Rio-de-Janeiro-600x338.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Reserva-Ecologica-do-Guapiacu-REGUA-Cachoeiras-de-Macacu-Rio-de-Janeiro.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-189051" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Cachoeiras de Macacu – one of the reserves where mosquitoes were collected.

Of these, 24 contained identifiable DNA, which contained traces of 18 different humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next highest group was birds, with blood from six different birds present in the samples, while amphibian, rodent, and canid blood each turned up once in the samples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Here we show that the mosquito species we captured in remnants of the Atlantic Forest have a clear preference for feeding on humans," &lt;a href="https://frontiersin.org/news/2026/01/15/mosquitoes-human-blood-biodiversity-loss"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Jeronimo Alencar, biologist at the Oswaldo Cruz Institute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There could be a few reasons for the high human count, the team says. But the most obvious is that with increased deforestation, there are just more people around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"With fewer natural options available, mosquitoes are forced to seek new, alternative blood sources. They end up feeding more on humans out of convenience, as we are the most prevalent host in these areas," &lt;a href="https://frontiersin.org/news/2026/01/15/mosquitoes-human-blood-biodiversity-loss"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Sergio Machado, microbiologist at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team says more detailed analysis is needed, including perhaps better methods for capturing the insects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The light traps are much more likely to attract hungry mosquitoes, while those that have recently fed prefer to sleep it off, making them harder to catch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A better understanding of mosquito feeding habits could improve &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/drug-for-rare-disease-turns-human-blood-into-mosquito-poison"&gt;disease prevention strategies&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was published in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2025.1721533/full"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

The first step was identifying which of the region’s roughly 40 mosquito species were biting. This involved careful scrutiny of the creatures with a stereoscope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“The identification itself is not complicated,” Machado says, “but there is a shortage of entomologists to perform it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;This fact, along with the need to transport the mosquitoes back to Rio de Janeiro for analysis, meant by the time the samples were analyzed, the DNA and RNA inside of them had started to break down. Even with these difficulties, the analysis provided Machado with a pretty good idea of which mammal species the mosquitoes in question preferred for dinner. In several cases, this &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/drug-turn-blood-mosquito-poison-170000526.html" data-ylk="slk:blood was human;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;blood was human&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“This was something we didn’t expect,” Machado says. “Since we were in a forest reserve, we expected to find DNA from vertebrates in the local fauna.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Related Mosquito Stories&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/scientists-engineer-mosquito-std-combat-140000120.html" data-ylk="slk:Scientists engineer mosquito STD to combat malaria;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;Scientists engineer mosquito STD to combat malaria&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/mosquitoes-barely-see-male-vision-150000199.html" data-ylk="slk:Mosquitoes can barely see–but a male’s vision perks up when they hear a female;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;Mosquitoes can barely see–but a male’s vision perks up when they hear a female&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/mosquitos-seem-beer-drinkers-recently-183508516.html" data-ylk="slk:Mosquitos seem to like beer drinkers who recently had sex;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;Mosquitos seem to like beer drinkers who recently had sex&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/world-without-mosquitoes-look-120000143.html" data-ylk="slk:What would a world without mosquitoes look like?;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;What would a world without mosquitoes look like?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Shifting tastes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;So why so much &lt;a href="https://www.popsci.com/mosquitoes-fly-full-of-blood/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:human blood;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;human blood&lt;/a&gt;? The researchers hypothesize that the Atlantic Forest’s changing environment has led these species to develop a taste for human blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“We believe it’s a matter of opportunity given the lack of a preferred food source,” Machado says. “It seems that if mosquitoes can’t find their preferred blood source, they seek out whatever is available.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;As &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/climate-change/qa-infectiousdiseases-who.pdf?sfvrsn=3a624917_3" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:biodiversity declines and animal species go extinct;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;biodiversity declines and animal species go extinct&lt;/a&gt;, more mosquito food sources are disappearing. However, unlike many of the animals on which they feed, mosquitoes are adaptable creatures. There’s almost always a ready-made alternative, including humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;While this might be good news for the mosquitoes, it risks being terrible news for humans. As an increasing number of mosquito species develop a taste for humans, so too does the risk that species which have not been particularly problematic in the past could act as new vectors for &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/scientists-engineer-mosquito-std-combat-140000120.html" data-ylk="slk:blood-borne diseases;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;blood-borne diseases&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Once mosquitoes acquire a new food source, they tend to develop a preference for that particular blood—and humans are one species whose availability is most definitely &lt;em&gt;not &lt;/em&gt;declining. Today, the Atlantic Forest occupies &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-025-01508-w" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:barely a quarter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;barely a quarter&lt;/a&gt; third of its former area, and it’s not alone. With every passing year, more wilderness is lost to human incursion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The answer seems to be first arresting, and then reversing, this process of deforestation and habitat destruction. But it’s not altogether clear that the damage is so easily reversible. Humans certainly aren’t going anywhere, so who’s to say that the mosquitoes won’t just keep feeding merrily on us regardless?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Machado expresses cautious optimism on how we can address how deforestation affects what mosquitoes eat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“We believe this is a reversible process, but this will require restoring the biome while simultaneously continuing our study. We are still seeking more evidence that [these] mosquitoes have a preferred food source. For now, we are observing that there is a possibility that they are adapting to different sources and do not [prefer] human blood.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Jumping species&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Nevertheless, humanity continues to play with fire as it pushes further and further into previously unspoilt ecosystems. A&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1088493/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:landmark 2001 study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt; landmark 2001 study&lt;/a&gt; found that new diseases are twice as likely to be zoonotic—transmissible between animals and humans—than existing ones. The danger posed by such diseases was exemplified by &lt;a href="https://www.popsci.com/category/covid-19/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:COVID-19;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;COVID-19&lt;/a&gt;, which &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/why-bats-spread-many-diseases-184226580.html" data-ylk="slk:jumped from bats to humans;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;jumped from bats to humans &lt;/a&gt;to catastrophic effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;While disastrous scenarios surrounding a novel pathogen spread by mosquitoes are hypothetical, there are also very real dangers linked to deforestation. For instance, the &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/scientists-engineer-mosquito-std-combat-140000120.html" data-ylk="slk:malaria parasite;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;malaria parasite&lt;/a&gt; in the Amazon is largely spread by the &lt;em&gt;Anopheles darlingi&lt;/em&gt; mosquito. It was thought to have been eradicated in the 1960s, but re-emerged in the 1990s, and is now common. Another &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3757555/pdf/nihms151521.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; found that cleared forest patches had created a perfect breeding environment for the insect, helping its return.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Ultimately, Machado stresses that it’s important to control the emergence of new &lt;a href="https://www.popsci.com/mosquitoes-climate-change/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:disease vectors;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;disease vectors&lt;/a&gt; and thus mitigate further risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“The re-establishment of ecosystems will certainly contribute to this and should minimize the climate changes we are experiencing,” he says. “We need to learn that our actions today, however small, will always have global repercussions in the future.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikgFBVV95cUxOdDR2c1F2YzJldUJ6N1d6NzRCVTdKUjVkejRQOW0teWtsNFF2QURHSTFDWTVUTlpQRTRJR1ZRRlA4MFF4OF93d2dNZ3lxNUE3MEp1amctS3dIOElrWVB6dl8xS25PU0JJV2pBTFExQU9QTkZfd1lHS2kyd2VoVXk4WXVISkhRWGhnSW9QMERHdkR4dw</guid></item><item><title>医疗团体将要求法院阻止新的CDC疫苗建议- CNN</title><link>https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/14/health/vaccine-recommendations-aap-block</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;

            Six prominent medical associations say they will ask the courts to reverse the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s new recommendations for what vaccines children should get.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkeo1rlr0002336ppayi0uo6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/aapnews/news/34142/AAP-co-plaintiffs-seek-to-block-changes-to?searchresult=1?autologincheck=redirected" target="_blank"&gt;American Academy of Pediatrics&lt;/a&gt; said Wednesday that it’s part of the effort with the American College of Physicians, the American Public Health Association, the Massachusetts Public Health Alliance, the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine. The groups are also seeking to stop next month’s scheduled meeting of the CDC’s independent vaccine advisers, all of whom were appointed by US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. after he fired the previous advisers.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkeo1rls0003336pnwgrx9e2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Last week, HHS announced &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/05/health/childhood-vaccine-schedule-overhaul"&gt;changes to the vaccine schedule&lt;/a&gt; for American children that narrowed recommendations for vaccinations against meningococcal disease, hepatitis B and hepatitis A to people at higher risk for infections. the updated CDC schedule also recommends that decisions on vaccinations against flu, Covid-19 and rotavirus be based on “shared clinical decision-making,” which means people who want one must consult with a health care provider. HHS said that all insurers will still cover these vaccines.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkeo1rls0004336puq4se4s9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When there were previous changes to the government’s vaccine recommendations, new evidence published in the scientific literature or presented by vaccine makers would be evaluated by the CDC’s vaccine advisers, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkeo54dq000i336pm3pqpr63@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But that wasn’t the case with the latest changes; no new evidence was brought to the committee to challenge the safety or effectiveness of the recommended vaccines. Rather, the decision was made in the wake of an order from President Donald Trump to HHS to review the US childhood vaccination schedule along with those of other developed nations. The new US vaccine schedule resembles the schedule in Denmark.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkeo1rls0005336pt9aaxb4v@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Children’s health depends on vaccine recommendations based on rigorous, transparent science,” American Academy of Pediatrics President Dr. Andrew Racine said in a statement Wednesday. “Unfortunately, recent decisions by federal officials have abandoned this standard, causing unnecessary confusion for families, compromising access to lifesaving vaccines and weakening community protection.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkeo1rls0006336pay1nv3jx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The medical groups’ first request to a federal judge is to restore the vaccine schedule to where it was on April 15, 2025, before any changes were made by HHS under Kennedy.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkeo1rls0007336pyje962vq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The second request is to stop ACIP from meeting at the end of February. The groups say the panel relies on “spurious evidence” to make its recommendations, and they are seeking to replace the members, saying Kennedy appointed advisers who lack the required experience and credentials.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkepzanl00003b6sl47zh9j7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “AAP continues with their attempts to hinder this Administration’s work through procedural and legal challenges while trying to preserve a broken status quo,” HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon said in a statement Wednesday. “ACIP continues to operate lawfully and transparently, and its next meeting is scheduled to proceed in February.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkeo1rls0008336ptzkndy6u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy removed all the previous ACIP members last year and replaced them with his own picks, many of whom share his skepticism of vaccines. He also ousted the CDC director, who typically signs off on the agency’s vaccine recommendations.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkepmoz400073b6s5etkyzlw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy appointed two more members to the vaccine panel on &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/secretary-kennedy-appoints-two-ob-gyns-cdc-advisory-committee-immunization-practices.html" target="_blank"&gt;Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;. One of them, Dr. Kimberly Biss, an obstetrician/gynecologist, has &lt;a href="https://rumble.com/v2r9elx-ob-gyn-dr.-kimberly-biss-i-was-not-anti-vaccine-i-am-now.html" target="_blank"&gt;described herself&lt;/a&gt; as “anti-vaccine.” The other, Dr. Adam Urato, also an ob/gyn, has said on &lt;a href="https://x.com/AdamUrato1/status/1938322690185544005?s=20" target="_blank"&gt;social media&lt;/a&gt; that “the science is not ‘long-settled’ regarding vaccines.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkeo1rls000a336p9wqwrupc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When Kennedy’s newly reconstituted ACIP met last year, members voted to weaken recommendations for universal hepatitis B vaccination for newborns and to stop recommending certain flu vaccines that have thimerosal, a mercury-based preservative that has been falsely linked to autism. The committee has said it will continue to reassess even long-established vaccine data.

            The efforts announced by the medical groups Wednesday are part of a &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/aapnews/news/33682" target="_blank"&gt;larger lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; against HHS over ACIP and its changes to Covid-19 vaccine recommendations. HHS has made a motion to dismiss the suit, but Judge Brian Murphy rejected the request last week.

			&lt;p&gt;Huntington's disease (HD) has long been impossible to cure, but new research is finally giving fresh hope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HD is a progressive, hereditary brain disease that affects movement, cognition, and emotions. &lt;span&gt;Doctors often diagnose HD when people show clear movement problems, typically around 30-50 years of age, after which patients live about &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5870025/"&gt;15-20 years&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://movementdisorders.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/mds.29228#xd_co_f=ZGQ3ZjEzNTktMWE2NS00Njg4LWEzMDktMzViMDcwNTYwZGM5%7E"&gt;global prevalence&lt;/a&gt; of HD is about five per 100,000 people. While it is not as prevalent as  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="188925" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; disease, the disease starts &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590112520300244"&gt;much earlier&lt;/a&gt; in life, often when people are still working and raising families.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/breakthrough-gene-therapy-slows-huntingtons-disease-by-75"&gt;Breakthrough Gene Therapy Slows Huntington's Disease by 75%&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sadly, there is no cure. But a couple of new research papers, by our team and others, suggest this may be about to change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The causes of HD long remained a mystery since it was discovered in the 19th century. But &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/abstract/0092-8674(93)90585-E"&gt;in 1993&lt;/a&gt;, researchers uncovered that HD is caused by repetitive expansions of three DNA letters (C, A, and G) in the Huntingtin (HTT) gene, resulting in the production of a mutant huntingtin protein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_188950" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-188950" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/dna_strand_huntingtin_642-1.jpg" alt="dna strand" class="wp-image-188950 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/dna_strand_huntingtin_642-1.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/dna_strand_huntingtin_642-1-600x374.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-188950" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Huntington's disease is caused by repeating bases at the ends of a chromosome. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MAG3JpLJPcA/"&gt;sasirin pamai's Images/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;This gene normally has a section that repeats the letters CAG over and over. In healthy people, the repeat is lower than 35. Repeat lengths greater than 39 will result in HD. The more repeats you have, the earlier symptoms usually start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to your inherited CAG length, this sequence tends to continually expand in certain cells over a person's lifetime, known as somatic expansion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the time, in 1993, the discovery generated lots of excitement. First, you could identify which relatives in a family with a history of the disease would develop it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those of us working in HD clinics at the time were highly concerned about the ethical and mental health issues this also raised. There was a big need for counselling, for example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, it was thought, somewhat mistakenly, that very quickly there would be a treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many studies have investigated people with the HD gene expansion 15 years before onset, and some even as far as 25 years before onset. Even before the onset of movement problems, changes in cognition, mood, and the brain have been found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In particular, the brain changes &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21130037/"&gt;start in a part called the striatum&lt;/a&gt;, which helps control movement. Here, certain nerve cells (called GABAergic medium spiny neurons) die off. As HD gets worse, damage &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21130037/"&gt;spreads to other areas&lt;/a&gt;, like the cortex, which is important for cognition, and white matter, which connects brain regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_188951" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-188951" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/striatum_huntingtings_642.jpg" alt="striatum diagram" class="wp-image-188951 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/striatum_huntingtings_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/striatum_huntingtings_642-600x374.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-188951" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Death of neurons in the striatum has been linked with Huntington's symptoms. (Dr_Microbe/Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Progress at last&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only recently have there been some promising results in the treatment of HD by clinical researchers Sarah Tabrizi and Edward Wild at University College London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the research is still waiting to be peer reviewed and published, the results &lt;a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/390/bmj.r2029?hwshib2=authn%3A1764854446%3A20251203%253A4dc02f01-51cc-4daa-9bdd-b9cd303ef685%3A0%3A0%3A0%3AU72qy%2B4nUTZop8ODA36O2g%3D%3D"&gt;have been reported&lt;/a&gt; in a press release by uniQure, a US biotechnology company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this trial, &lt;span&gt;AMT-130 – &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;a gene therapy that reduces the production of the toxic mutant huntingtin protein – was given to 29 HD patients between the ages of 25 and 65 who had a definitive clinical diagnosis. The results showed slower cognitive decline on standard neuropsychological tests, particularly in processing speed and reading ability. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Most significantly for doctors, cerebrospinal fluid levels of a protein called neurofilament light, a general marker for neurodegeneration, were reduced after three years of follow-up, even below baseline levels.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This indicates that the therapy &lt;a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/390/bmj.r2029?hwshib2=authn%3A1764854446%3A20251203%253A4dc02f01-51cc-4daa-9bdd-b9cd303ef685%3A0%3A0%3A0%3AU72qy%2B4nUTZop8ODA36O2g%3D%3D"&gt;may actively protect brain cells&lt;/a&gt; from damage rather than simply masking symptoms. It is hoped that, in the future, it will be possible to provide safe and effective treatments at earlier stages of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hopefully, people with the HD gene expansion will have improved cognition and emotion and reduced motor symptoms, which will improve quality of life and may even extend their lifespan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/huntingtons-breakthrough-may-not-be-the-success-it-seems-expert-cautions"&gt;Huntington's Breakthrough May Not Be The Success It Seems, Expert Cautions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was a motivation for our new work, a collaboration between UCL and the University of Cambridge, for &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32470422/"&gt;the HD- Young Adult Study&lt;/a&gt;. The study recruited 131 people: 64 with the HD gene expansion and 67 controls, long before predicted disease onset, approximately 24 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32470422/"&gt;gathered in-depth information&lt;/a&gt; about participants' cognition, mood, and behaviour, alongside brain scans and tests of blood and other fluids that can show how healthy their brain cells are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At this early stage, we noted some increases in markers of neurodegeneration with limited effects on brain volume and cognition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given that the striatal circuits are disrupted early in HD, we wanted to determine whether cognitive flexibility, how easily people can swap between different approaches and perspectives, a function that relies on this circuitry, was affected at this very early stage in those with HD gene expansion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, we showed some mild early disruption to cognitive flexibility, which was &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7841479/#R3"&gt;associated with alterations&lt;/a&gt; in the connectivity in these circuits. This cohort &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39825149/"&gt;was also followed up&lt;/a&gt; about 4.5 years later, where changes in many measures became more apparent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, in collaboration with the University of Glasgow, we showed that &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39825149/"&gt;somatic expansion&lt;/a&gt;, how the CAG sequence tends to continually expand in certain cells over a person's lifetime, can give crucial information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study was the first to show in living humans that the faster this somatic expansion, the faster the disease progresses. This can explain why some people who have identical inherited CAG length in the Huntingtin gene can still have different onset of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cognitive deficits were apparent at this time, although they were in a specific cognitive process. &lt;a href="https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/alz.70944"&gt;Our findings&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/alz.70944" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;reveal early sustained attention deficits in people with expanded CAG sequences, which are associated with changes in brain circuits in the inferior frontal gyrus (involved in attention), well before movement was affected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intriguingly, this brain area is also linked to the inability of people with  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-adhd" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73112" data-postid="188925" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;ADHD&lt;/a&gt; to focus their attention, as we discovered in an &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24199662/"&gt;earlier study&lt;/a&gt;. This suggests that this disruption in sustained attention in HD may reflect a neurodevelopmental process rather than a neurodegenerative one at this early stage of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings suggest that there is a treatment window, potentially decades before motor symptoms are present, where those with the HD gene expansion are functioning normally despite having detectable measures of subtle early neurodegeneration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Identifying these early markers of disease is essential for future  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/clinical-trials" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73032" data-postid="188925" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; in order to determine whether a treatment is having any effect and preserving the quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, as drugs that slow the worsening of the disease rather than treat the symptoms are approved by the regulatory bodies for HD, they could be implemented at an early stage to improve quality of life and well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We hope that these now rapid advances in the understanding and treatment of HD will, in the near future, bring great benefits to patients.&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/273376/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade"&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Using exercise to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/vagus-nerve-stimulation-has-lasting-effects-in-people-with-severe-depression"&gt;treat depression&lt;/a&gt; can be as effective as therapy or antidepressants, according to a new review of previous trials, potentially offering an affordable and personalized approach to improving mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A team led by researchers from the University of Lancashire in the UK analyzed 73 randomized, controlled trials involving a total of almost 5,000 adults. The studies covered a variety of different exercise regimes and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/ketamine-can-treat-depression-as-effectively-as-electroconvulsive-therapy"&gt;depression treatments&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, the data showed that exercise can work as a way of easing the symptoms of  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/depression" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73097" data-postid="188383" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;, in line with findings from some &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-single-30-minute-exercise-session-has-an-immediate-antidepressant-effect"&gt;previous investigations&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-link-gut-bacteria-to-bipolar-depression-in-mouse-study"&gt;Scientists Link Gut Bacteria to Bipolar Depression in Mouse Study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, results vary to some extent between individuals and between exercise types.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our findings suggest that exercise appears to be a safe and accessible option for helping to manage symptoms of depression," &lt;a href="https://www.cochrane.org/about-us/news/exercise-treat-depression-yields-similar-results-therapy-and-antidepressants"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Andrew Clegg, a professor of Health Services Research at the University of Lancashire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This suggests that exercise works well for some people, but not for everyone, and finding approaches that individuals are willing and able to maintain is important."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_188386" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-188386" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/WomanExercising.jpg" alt="Woman exercising" class="wp-image-188386 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/WomanExercising.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/WomanExercising-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-188386" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;It remains to be seen if some types of exercise work better than others at tackling depression. (&lt;a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/woman-in-green-tank-top-and-black-leggings-doing-yoga-on-blue-round-trampoline-YxCrQm9XNgg"&gt;Gabin Vallet/Unsplash&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across all of the trials, exercise was shown to be moderately beneficial &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/these-2-key-lifestyle-changes-can-treat-mild-depression-as-well-as-therapy"&gt;for treating depression&lt;/a&gt;, compared to no treatment at all. It was about on a par with psychological therapy, and (with a lesser degree of certainty) antidepressants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Light to moderate exercise seemed to work better than &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/study-finds-potential-downside-to-vigorous-exercise-that-we-didnt-know-about"&gt;more vigorous activity&lt;/a&gt; when it came to alleviating symptoms of depression, the review found. Between 13 and 36 sessions appeared to be the sweet spot, though none of the trials tracked depression and exercise over a long period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was some evidence favoring the combination of different types of exercise, though no single activity type stood out as a clear winner. For exercise to provide benefits, it would need to be tailored to suit individual needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For people with depression, the evidence indicates that exercise may offer similar short-term benefits to therapy or medication for some," &lt;a href="https://www.sciencemediacentre.org/expert-reaction-to-exercise-having-similar-results-as-therapy-for-treating-depression/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; neuroscientist Brendon Stubbs, from King's College London, who wasn't involved in the research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Decisions on switching or combining approaches should be made collaboratively with healthcare providers, considering individual circumstances."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The review focused mainly on structured trials, and while this is beneficial in terms of the comprehensiveness of the data that gets collected, these types of experiments tend to attract people who are naturally more motivated &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/one-fitness-accessory-makes-you-up-to-7-times-more-likely-to-stay-active"&gt;and active&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_188384" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-188384" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/LonelyMan-642x361.jpg" alt="Lonely man" class="size-medium wp-image-188384" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/LonelyMan-642x361.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/LonelyMan-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/LonelyMan-600x338.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/LonelyMan.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-188384" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Exercise works well for some people, but not for everyone.

                                    &lt;div class="hsa-paywall"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Hawaii Department of Health said a travel-related Zika virus case has been confirmed on Oahu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is Hawaii’s first confirmed Zika case this year. Another travel-related Zika case was &lt;a href="https://www.staradvertiser.com/2025/05/28/breaking-news/doh-travel-related-zika-virus-case-confirmed-on-oahu/" target="_self" rel="noopener"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; in Hawaii, also on Oahu, in May of last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOH said travel-associated cases were more frequently reported in Hawaii between 2015 to 2019, when Zika was circulating globally, and peaked at 25 cases in 2017. To date, no locally acquired cases have been documented in Hawaii.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The&lt;a href="https://health.hawaii.gov/docd/disease_listing/zika-virus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt; Zika &lt;/a&gt;virus – like dengue — spreads primarily through the bite of an infected mosquito. While Hawaii has the mosquito species capable of transmitting Zika, the virus is not established in Hawaii.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can also be spread through sex, or to a fetus during pregnancy, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention – and infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects and is linked to complications, including miscarriage, stillbirth and preterm birth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most common symptoms of Zika include fever, rash, headache, red eyes and joint and muscle pain. Many people infected with Zika, however, will have no symptoms or only have mild symptoms, CDC said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Separately, DOH also confirmed another travel-related case of dengue on Oahu, which will be counted as the 15th case of dengue in Hawaii in 2025 based on when the symptoms began.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Symptoms of dengue include fever, rash, nausea, vomiting and aches and pains, including eye pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cases are not related to one another, according to DOH, and affected individuals were exposed while traveling in regions where the viruses are known to circulate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;”DOH teams have been deployed to conduct outreach, inspections and implement mosquito control measures in the affected areas,” the department said. “Because both Zika and dengue are transmitted by mosquitoes that exist locally, controlling mosquito populations in the affected areas is critical to preventing spread.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOH said it would continue to monitor mosquito numbers in the affected areas, but did not disclose what parts of Oahu were impacted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CDC advises travelers to check Zika and dengue risk information before departure. Anyone experiencing symptoms within two weeks after visiting an area with risk of Zika or dengue should consult their doctors and inform them of possible exposure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health care providers and anyone who suspect Zika or dengue infection should also call the Disease Reporting Line at 808-586-4586.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;A measles outbreak in South Carolina that began in October is now wildly accelerating, doubling in just the past week to a total of &lt;a href="https://dph.sc.gov/diseases-conditions/infectious-diseases/measles-rubeola/2025-measles-outbreak"&gt;434 cases&lt;/a&gt;, with 409 people currently in quarantine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amid the outbreak, South Carolina health officials have been providing updates on cases every Tuesday and Friday. On Tuesday, state health officials reported &lt;a href="https://dph.sc.gov/news/tuesday-measles-update-dph-reports-124-new-measles-cases-upstate-new-public-exposures-and"&gt;124 more cases&lt;/a&gt; since last Friday, which had &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2026/01/measles-continues-raging-in-south-carolina-99-new-cases-since-tuesday/"&gt;99 new cases&lt;/a&gt; since the previous Tuesday. On that day, January 6, officials noted a more modest increase of 26 cases, bringing the outbreak total at that point to &lt;a href="https://dph.sc.gov/news/tuesday-measles-update-dph-reports-26-new-measles-cases-upstate-bringing-outbreak-total-211"&gt;211 cases&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the 3-month-old outbreak now doubled in just a week, health officials are renewing calls for people to get vaccinated against the highly infectious virus—an effort that has met with little success since October. Still, the health department is activating its mobile health unit to offer free measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccinations, as well as flu vaccinations at two locations today and Thursday in the Spartanburg area, the epicenter of the outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officials are also warning that they’re losing the ability to trace cases, and exposures are continuing. Last Friday, someone contagious with measles was in the South Carolina State Museum in Columbia between 1 pm and 5 pm ET. Anyone in the museum during that time and unvaccinated is at risk of contracting the infection. The virus spreads through the air and can linger in a room’s airspace for up to two hours after an infected person has left. Measles is so contagious that up to 90 percent of unvaccinated people exposed will fall ill.&lt;/p&gt;

The virus has driven a wave of illness and hospitalizations in countries such as the United Kingdom, Italy and the United States, where “suddenly everybody is seeing not just cases, but high numbers of cases”, says Andrew Pekosz, a virologist at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore, Maryland. In many nations, the flu season started earlier and accelerated faster than usual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03608-1" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-026-00061-6/d41586-026-00061-6_51697274.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;A universal flu vaccine has proved challenging — could it finally be possible?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, why is this flu season so bad? Scientists suspect that it is in part due to a &lt;a href="https://nextstrain.org/seasonal-flu/h3n2/ha/2y?label=Subclade:K" data-track="click" data-label="https://nextstrain.org/seasonal-flu/h3n2/ha/2y?label=Subclade:K" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;new strain of the influenza virus that has risen to dominance&lt;/a&gt;. The variant has a high number of key mutations, which means that it is much less similar to the strain used in the flu vaccine than previous seasons’ viruses have been. This might make it easier for the virus to shrug off the immune system and vaccines. Furthermore, the dominant strain belongs to a viral subtype that has been circulating for decades but was not dominant in the past few flu seasons, meaning that many people have relatively weak immunity against it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even so, there is &lt;a href="https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/early-estimates-seasonal-influenza-vaccine-effectiveness-against-influenza-requiring" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/early-estimates-seasonal-influenza-vaccine-effectiveness-against-influenza-requiring" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;evidence&lt;/a&gt; to suggest that currently available flu vaccines offer protection against severe illness&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the United States, it’s too early in the flu season “to say exactly how this one will stack up compared to [others] over the last few decades”, says Jesse Bloom, a virologist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center in Seattle, Washington. But “this is a worse than average flu season, that’s for sure”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A year for H3N2&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 2025–26 flu season started a month earlier than expected in the United Kingdom, much of Europe and Japan, which &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03367-z" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03367-z" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;declared a flu epidemic because of the unexpectedly high number of infections&lt;/a&gt;. Australia’s flu season continued for at least a month longer than usual&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR2" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. In Canada, “all provinces and territories saw a massive increase in the number of cases, all at the same time”, says Eleni Galanis, a director general at the Public Health Agency of Canada in Ottawa. “And that, of course, puts a lot of pressure on the health-care system.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The virus causing many of this year’s cases is an example of the H3N2 subtype, which evolves faster than other strains&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR3" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. A variant of the H3N2 virus called subclade K became globally dominant in September and now accounts for about 80% of influenza infections worldwide. “Everything can be attributed to this clade K variant,” Pekosz says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vaccine mismatch&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Modelling suggests that subclade K emerged &lt;a href="https://nextstrain.org/seasonal-flu/h3n2/ha/2y?label=Subclade:K" data-track="click" data-label="https://nextstrain.org/seasonal-flu/h3n2/ha/2y?label=Subclade:K" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;as early as February last year&lt;/a&gt;.

The study has not yet been peer reviewed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;More mutations&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Created by a Japanese expert, the fitness routine has social media influencers of all ages raving about its health benefits on Instagram, TikTok and YouTube. The New York Times also named it one of its "10 fitness tips to help you get moving in 2026."&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;h2&gt;Interval walking training&lt;/h2&gt;

                    &lt;p&gt;The "Japanese Walking" method consists of fast and slow walks in three minute intervals. First, you walk briskly with large strides. And next, you walk slowly for three minutes at a pace where you can hold a conversation.&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;p&gt;Its creator recommends repeating this cycle at least five times, and doing this routine a minimum of four times a week. This method is also called interval walking training, or IWT.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/figure&gt;
    
                    &lt;p&gt;Teo says he always asks himself if the content he is thinking about making is something his mother could do.&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;p&gt;He explains, "They're the people who are probably at the highest risk of injuries and detriments to their health, who don't have the skill set or the knowledge or the tools available to them to be able to improve their health."&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;figure class="p-article__img -full"&gt;
                                &lt;img src="/nhkworld/en/news/backstories/4530/images/XydElwMJAQsJYHZrSVcVPV117ahzM12c2I5DUQq1.jpg" alt=""&gt;
                                &lt;figcaption&gt;Teo and his mother&lt;/figcaption&gt;
        &lt;/figure&gt;
    
                    &lt;p&gt;He was searching for exercise methods for people of all ages when he discovered a report on interval walking by Japanese researchers. He says it was exactly what he needed.&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;h2&gt;Better than 10,000 steps&lt;/h2&gt;

                    &lt;p&gt;In his now viral video, Teo introduces the "Japanese Walking" method by saying: "You've probably heard that you should walk 10,000 steps a day. But in 2007, Japanese researchers discovered a walking technique that gives you 10 times the benefits in just 30 minutes."&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;p&gt;Teo says: "It makes a lot of sense from a mechanistic cardio metabolic standpoint. And it was really cool to see research backing it up, as to here is the protocol you can start to use. And I love just how accessible it was."&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;p&gt;To pay respect to the Japanese researchers, he dubbed the method "Japanese Walking."&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;p&gt;Teo credits the name as a reason for why his video went viral.&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;p&gt;He says: "I think people just on some level understand that there is a very specific, unique way that Japanese people do things. It is very thorough. It is very detail oriented."&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;figure class="p-article__img -full"&gt;
                                &lt;img src="/nhkworld/en/news/backstories/4530/images/tKTGtM7jxfoDE6ATg6kqg20w5JITrNsqDALwileE.jpg" alt=""&gt;
                                &lt;figcaption&gt;Teo's video on 'Japanese Walking' is shared and liked by thousands on social media.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
        &lt;/figure&gt;
    
                    &lt;p&gt;Praised for being simple, practical and gym-free, the method soon drew attention. People began posting videos of themselves going "Japanese Walking."&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;p&gt;Global media, such as Fortune, Time, The New York Times and The Washington Post, also published features on the burgeoning fitness trend.&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;h2&gt;Japanese experts continue efforts&lt;/h2&gt;

                    &lt;p&gt;The creator of "Japanese Walking" is Nose Hiroshi, a specially appointed professor at Shinshu University in Matsumoto City, Nagano Prefecture. He researched the method as a way for elderly people to maintain their physical strength.&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;p&gt;He says it is important to do 60 minutes of fast walking a week to strengthen muscles and boost endurance. His research team also found that this exercise is effective for improving memory.&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;figure class="p-article__img -full"&gt;
                                &lt;img src="/nhkworld/en/news/backstories/4530/images/daRl0MI0ptWra9e0V5d9S5oergJr2lmyohLT4WyL.jpg" alt=""&gt;
                                &lt;figcaption&gt;Nose Hiroshi on NHK World's Medical Frontiers program.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
        &lt;/figure&gt;
    
                    &lt;p&gt;Nose's collaborative researcher, Professor Masuki Shizue, ran studies on the exercise and says it may help lower blood pressure, reduce the risk of a stroke and combat depression. She also found it effective for improving or maintaining bone density.&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;p&gt;Masuki's team has also developed an online system that allows people to see how this exercise routine will improve their health. By entering information like age, body weight, blood pressure and how long they will continue this exercise, people can see how their bodies will transform.&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;p&gt;As this research and innovation continues in Japan, the growing trend of "Japanese Walking" is changing the lives of people worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Stiff knees, aching hips, and the slow grind of chronic joint pain are often accepted as an unavoidable part of getting older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But while osteoarthritis is the world's most common joint disease, experts say the way we treat and prevent it is badly out of step with the evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best medicine isn't found in a pill bottle or an operating theatre – it's movement. Yet across countries and health systems, too few patients are being guided toward the one therapy proven to protect their joints and ease their pain: &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/topics/exercise-670"&gt;exercise&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-breakthrough-to-restore-aging-joints-could-help-treat-osteoarthritis"&gt;New Breakthrough to Restore Aging Joints Could Help Treat Osteoarthritis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exercise is one of the most effective treatments for chronic, disabling joint conditions &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/what-are-the-key-risk-factors-for-developing-knee-osteoarthritis-we-reviewed-the-evidence-253722"&gt;such as osteoarthritis&lt;/a&gt;. Yet very few patients actually receive it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research across health systems in &lt;a href="http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11227783/"&gt;Ireland, the UK, Norway&lt;/a&gt;, and the United States shows the same pattern: fewer than half of people with osteoarthritis are referred to exercise or physiotherapy by their primary care provider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 60 percent are given treatments that guidelines do not recommend, and around 40 percent are sent to a surgeon before &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/do-you-have-knee-pain-from-osteoarthritis-you-might-not-need-surgery-heres-what-to-try-instead-236779"&gt;non-surgical options&lt;/a&gt; have even been tried.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand why those figures are so troubling, it helps to understand what exercise does for joints. Osteoarthritis is by far the most common form of arthritis, already affecting more than 595 million people worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanrhe/article/PIIS2665-9913(23)00163-7/fulltext"&gt;global study in &lt;em&gt;The Lancet&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, that number could approach one billion by 2050. Longer life expectancy, increasingly sedentary lifestyles, and rising numbers of overweight or obese people are driving the trend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet people who exercise regularly are physically and biologically protecting themselves from developing the disease and from suffering its worst effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cartilage that covers the ends of our bones is a tough, protective layer with no blood supply of its own. It relies on movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like a sponge, cartilage is compressed when we walk or load a joint, squeezing fluid out and then drawing fresh nutrients back in. Each step allows nutrients and natural lubricants to circulate and maintain joint health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is why the old idea of osteoarthritis as simple "wear and tear" is misleading. Joints are not car tires that inevitably grind down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Osteoarthritis is better understood as a long process of wear and repair in which regular movement and exercise are critical to healing and to the health of the entire joint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_177108" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-177108" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/WomenHoldingOntoHandLikeItsInPain-e1760056845637.jpg" alt="women holding onto her other hand like she's in pain" class="wp-image-177108 size-full" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-177108" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Osteoarthritis impacts the whole joint region. (SimpleImages/Moment/Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A disease of the whole joint&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We now know osteoarthritis is a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3295952/"&gt;whole-joint disease&lt;/a&gt;. It affects the joint fluid, the underlying bone, the ligaments, the surrounding muscles, and even the nerves that support movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Therapeutic exercise targets all these elements. Muscle weakness, for instance, is one of the earliest signs of osteoarthritis and can be improved with resistance training. There is strong &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0889857X12001299?via%3Dihub"&gt;evidence&lt;/a&gt; that muscle weakness increases the risk of both developing the disease and seeing it progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nerve and muscle control can also be trained through &lt;a href="https://www.jospt.org/doi/full/10.2519/jospt.2025.13041"&gt;neuromuscular exercise&lt;/a&gt; programs &lt;a href="https://bmcmusculoskeletdisord.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12891-017-1439-y"&gt;such as GLA:D®&lt;/a&gt; (Good Life with osteoArthritis: Denmark) for hip and knee osteoarthritis. Usually delivered in supervised group sessions by physiotherapists, these programs focus on movement quality, balance, and strength to improve joint stability and rebuild confidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Significant improvements in pain, joint function, and quality of life &lt;a href="https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1063458421000339"&gt;have been recorded&lt;/a&gt; for up to 12 months after completing the program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/do-your-knees-click-heres-what-it-means-and-when-to-see-a-doctor"&gt;Do Your Knees 'Click'? Here's What It Means, And When to See a Doctor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exercise is good medicine for the whole body: it has documented benefits across more than &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26606383/"&gt;26 chronic diseases&lt;/a&gt;. In osteoarthritis, it helps not only by strengthening cartilage and muscle but also by tackling the inflammation, metabolic changes, and hormonal shifts that drive the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obesity is a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2596954/"&gt;major risk factor&lt;/a&gt; for osteoarthritis, and not merely because of the extra mechanical load on joints. High levels of inflammatory molecules in the blood and in joint tissues can degrade cartilage and accelerate disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For osteoarthritis, regular activity can counter this at a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9110817/#S1"&gt;molecular level&lt;/a&gt;, lowering inflammatory markers, limiting cell damage, and even altering gene expression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Exercise first, surgery later&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently there are no drugs that modify the course of osteoarthritis. Joint replacement surgery can be life-changing for some people, but it is major surgery and does not succeed for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exercise should be tried first and continued throughout every stage of the disease. It carries far fewer side effects and brings many additional health benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Osteoarthritis is not simply a matter of "worn-out" joints. It is shaped by muscle strength, inflammation, metabolism, and lifestyle.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regular, targeted exercise addresses many of these factors at once – helping to protect cartilage, strengthen the whole joint and improve overall health. Before considering surgery, movement itself remains one of the most powerful treatments we have.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/260638/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

Her family said that she was taken to McKay Dee Hospital, where she was diagnosed with the flu and adenovirus. Adenovirus has similar symptoms to the cold and flu and is also highly contagious.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Her family added that the flu had gone around the family, starting around Christmas. At the beginning, Ellie was doing OK and seemed to be battling the flu pretty well. The entire family had similar symptoms, but Ellie developed a concerning cough, and Sarah Rudd, her mom, took her to the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mediumRec1Mobile" class="mobile-ad medium-rectangle centered"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I took her in, (and) they kept her overnight because her oxygen was pretty low,” Sarah said, adding that they were preparing to be discharged until Ellie’s oxygen dropped again. Overnight, her condition worsened and she developed pneumonia and sepsis, requiring her to be life-flighted to Primary Children’s Hospital.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A team of doctors worked to try to increase Ellie’s oxygen levels and blood pressure while she was in the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="smallTile1Mobile" class="mobile-ad small-tile centered"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I think she was about four days in the PICU, and they took her in for a CAT scan the day that she died and saw that she had a stroke,” Sarah said. “They wouldn’t be able to fix it, so we made the decision to take her off life support, and she passed.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure&gt;&lt;a href="https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ellierudd2_GFMbg.jpg" class="fancybox"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ellierudd2_GFMbg.jpg" alt="Elora 'Ellie' Ann Rudd, a 4-year-old from Utah, passed away recently due to complications from the flu. | Courtesy GoFundMe" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-803945" srcset="https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ellierudd2_GFMbg.jpg 900w, https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ellierudd2_GFMbg-300x200.jpg 300w, https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ellierudd2_GFMbg-768x512.jpg 768w, https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ellierudd2_GFMbg-860x573.jpg 860w, https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ellierudd2_GFMbg-750x500.jpg 750w, https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ellierudd2_GFMbg-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Elora ‘Ellie’ Ann Rudd, a 4-year-old from Utah, passed away recently due to complications from the flu. | Courtesy GoFundMe&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Sarah and Michael, Ellie’s parents, are now speaking on their daughter’s life and how much she means to them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We named her after the character from (the film) ‘Willow’, the little baby. She was very much a nurturing little girl; she loved her baby dolls,” Sarah said. “She loved to put them to bed at night, put them down for naps. She loved Barbies. She loved ‘One Hundred and One Dalmatians’, and ‘Frozen’.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mediumRec2Mobile" class="mobile-ad medium-rectangle centered"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sarah went on, “She was the sweetest little girl alive and would always come home from preschool and give me a present that she created in preschool. She was in school for speech therapy. … She was making bounds and leaps this year for it.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Michael Rudd, Sarah’s father, said that Ellie was “always very sweet, always very sharing, very loving and affectionate.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“She loved to have dance parties in her sister’s room all the time. They would go and turn off all the lights and get dressed up,” Sarah added.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At this point, the Rudds say they have more questions than answers, and one of those questions is most prominent in Sarah’s mind.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I just wonder, ‘Why her?’… I don’t know why it hit Ellie so hard,” Sarah said. The Rudds’ oldest daughter also caught pneumonia and bronchitis while the family was sick and was hospitalized.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Fortunately, their oldest is doing better, but the Rudd family is still left with the hole left by Ellie’s loss.

Berkeley’s Public Health Officer recommended that encampment residents move out of the area as soon as possible, and relocate to at least a third of a mile away due to public health risk caused by the rat infestation transmitting the disease.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p data-v-6c8e215c&gt;"The absence of confirmed human cases is reassuring but does not remove the risk of undiagnosed cases or future cases," Noemi Doohan, Berkeley’s Public Health Officer said in a Jan. 6 court filing. "If a human case were confirmed, that would elevate the urgency of the recommended response to protect human life and other animal life in the city of Berkeley."&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p data-v-6c8e215c&gt;The city advises dog owners to vaccinate their pets against leptospirosis, and the wrote the owners of "free roaming cats" should consider the same.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p data-v-6c8e215c&gt;Signs of pet illness may include "excessive thirst, vomiting, shivering, and lethargy, and can progress to liver failure if untreated. Lepto can also be fatal to dogs."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p data-v-6c8e215c&gt;In humans, leptospirosis can cause sudden high fever, throbbing headache, severe calf/leg pain, and red eyes (conjunctivitis), the court documents state. Without treatment the disease can cause kidney damage, meningitis, liver failure, trouble breathing, and even death.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p data-v-6c8e215c&gt;The disease may not be immediately recognizable by doctors either, as it is usually associated with tropical conditions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 data-v-6c8e215c&gt;Problem area&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p data-v-6c8e215c&gt;Rats and their urine are a common vector for the disease.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p data-v-6c8e215c&gt;"Current Harrison Street encampment conditions (tents, refuse, uncontained foods, RVs, standing water) prevent standard vector control teams from accessing and destroying rat nesting sites," the city alert states. "Rodent eradication, ongoing rat testing for leptospirosis, and remediation of the area to prevent a growing rat infestation is a medical and public health safety necessity that cannot be successfully completed while the encampment is occupied by temporary dwellings, people and dogs."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p data-v-6c8e215c&gt;In addition to pushing for Harrison Street residents to relocate, the city is also encouraging residents to take precautions by avoiding touching the water in Codornices Creek or walking or biking through standing water in the area.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p data-v-6c8e215c&gt;The creek has not been tested for leptospirosis, but noted that the presence of the disease so close to the creek means there is a significant risk of the disease spreading to the creek and wildlife if the infected rodent population is not brought under control. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p data-v-6c8e215c&gt;Veterinarians treating sick dogs at the Harrison Street encampment first identified the disease in November, and Alameda County Vector Control confirmed the presence of leptospirosis by trapping and testing rats.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p data-v-6c8e215c&gt;"This was of particular concern because testing of rats trapped at encampment over the last five years… had never previously produced any findings of leptospirosis in rats," the city’s health advisory states.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 data-v-6c8e215c&gt;What's next&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p data-v-6c8e215c&gt;Berkeley city staff have launched an ongoing public health investigation into the disease’s spread in the encampment and the nearby community.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p data-v-6c8e215c&gt;Cleanup will take at least 30 days — the length of time leptospirosis can live in soil — and the eradication of rats requires "many cycles of baiting the rats with poison in their underground burrows, removing the carcasses, and rebaiting over time," the advisory states.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p data-v-6c8e215c&gt;The city is &lt;a href="https://www.ktvu.com/news/federal-judge-orders-city-berkeley-temporarily-halt-removal-encampment" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;barred by a federal injunction&lt;/a&gt; from clearing the Harrison Street encampment, which has blocked the city from "implementing fully effective eradication efforts," in stopping the spread of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p data-uid="fts-ar-17" class="vendor-unit" data-v-6c8e215c&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>KTVU</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 21:55:21 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilgFBVV95cUxNZHg1RmVhbGdxaVlrY1ZBTHVTVjgtOE5yamdlalNXSmF5SXNVMzZUa1c2MmdOVEgtWUd1TEZSWmI3S2JxUE5PckxqSENBQkpRdVc1dE1xUWdVSXFyQjZNU0V3NFlsQXh0T0I3ajU0aDdPY0g2aUh2MGZ5RnVORDdBSFM3aVpCbDlsUHdQeDBkWE0tcnJPOFHSAZsBQVVfeXFMTUw4cnN6REdhRDRyeVZ1NkVtaldPcU50ZEVQMDNtQmlEcW9zWWpaRzBXSWY0dFZ0VUt0OUhyX3I2N25DUm13ZmM4cElBdEVZckxVMjRsYWZFczJySEg2VjN1Mlh3ekhRaDJlOTUyOUlueUY3Y1ZvUzJCTHIwb09ySy1meUJnVnBhOTU1c2l2cFZNOHpYODdWU3dObjQ</guid></item><item><title>在洛杉矶发现的新型XDR志贺氏菌株- CIDRAP</title><link>https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/antimicrobial-stewardship/novel-xdr-shigella-strain-identified-los-angeles</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/antimicrobial-stewardship-and-healthcare-epidemiology/article/emergence-of-a-novel-genotype-of-extensively-drugresistant-shigella-sonnei-carrying-bladha1-in-diverse-patient-populations-los-angeles-20242025/25182B42316C650A12B6F782C73A221E"&gt;case report&lt;/a&gt; published yesterday in &lt;em&gt;Antimicrobial Stewardship &amp;amp; Healthcare Epidemiology&lt;/em&gt; describes the identification of a novel strain of extensively drug-resistant &lt;em&gt;Shigella&lt;/em&gt; in Los Angeles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The strain of XDR &lt;em&gt;Shigella sonnei&lt;/em&gt; was isolated separately from two patients in Los Angeles with no known epidemiologic connection or transmission route a year apart, researchers from the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) David Geffen School of Medicine reported. One patient was a 34-year-old man with advanced HIV and a history of substance abuse, the other a 33-year-old immunocompromised woman with high-grade B-cell lymphoma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Shigellosis is a highly infectious gastrointestinal condition caused by one of the four species of Shigella bacteria: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;S sonnei, S flexneri, S boydii,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; or &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;S dysenteriae&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;It's transmitted by the oral-fecal route; via contaminated fomites, food, and water; or by direct person-to-person contact. Symptoms range from mild diarrhea to severe dysentery. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Isolates from both patients were resistant to several oral antibiotics commonly used to treat shigellosis, along with other antibiotic classes. Molecular analysis identified the resistance gene &lt;em&gt;bla&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;DHA-1&lt;/sub&gt;, which confers resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics,&lt;sub&gt; &lt;/sub&gt;in isolates from both patients. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Isolates from the immunocompromised patient also carried the extended-spectrum beta-lactamase gene &lt;em&gt;bla&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;CTX-M-15&lt;/sub&gt;, which has been found in XDR &lt;em&gt;S sonnei&lt;/em&gt; strains acquired through sexual transmission among men who have sex with men (MSM) in US cities. A previous study by the same researchers identified a unique strain of XDR &lt;em&gt;S sonnei&lt;/em&gt; carrying the CTX-M gene spreading among MSM in Los Angeles. Recent studies have also documented the spread of XDR &lt;em&gt;Shigella&lt;/em&gt; strains in other high-risk populations, such as the unhoused.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors of the study say XDR &lt;em&gt;Shigella &lt;/em&gt;isolates carrying both resistance genes have not been reported before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“The clinical implications of this are significant given that dual cephalosporinase producers may exhibit higher resistance than the more typical CTX-M–associated XDR &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Shigella,”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; they wrote. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Concerns about broader spread&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Most shigellosis cases are self-limiting, but antibiotics are frequently used to treat more-severe symptoms and to reduce shedding, which can help limit transmission. In 2023, however, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/antimicrobial-stewardship/cdc-warns-increase-extensively-drug-resistant-shigellosis"&gt;warned&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; in a health advisory that cases of XDR &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Shigella&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; were rising in the United States. CDC data showed that the percentage of XDR &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Shigella&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; isolates collected in the United States rose from 0% in 2015 to 5% in 2022.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another significant finding from the report was that molecular analysis showed that isolates from both patients had a close genetic relationship and a common ancestor, even though the two patients lived 80 miles from one another, and their visits did not overlap at the institution. There were also no known outbreaks of foodborne &lt;em&gt;Shigella&lt;/em&gt; at the time the two cases were identified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Corresponding report author Shangxin Yang, PhD, who directs the UCLA Molecular Microbiology and Pathogen Genomics Laboratory, said the biggest message of the report is that XDR &lt;em&gt;Shigella&lt;/em&gt; appears to be spreading beyond MSM and other high-risk populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Based on my genomic analysis it seems to be a different strain just emerging recently, meaning there two different kinds of XDR &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Shigella&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; circulating simultaneously, with one strain still actively circulating among the MSM population, but the new strain (remotely related to the MSM-circulating strain) spreading in a more general population,” Yang told CIDRAP News.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;That’s a concern, Yang said, because broader spread could lead to more treatment failure, since the strains are “pretty much resistant to all oral drugs.” Both patients in the report required intravenous treatment with carbapenem antibiotics, which are a last-resort option for invasive infections.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Yang and his colleagues say the situation warrants close monitoring and continuous genomic surveillance.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;figure id="article-featured-image" class="article-featured-image"&gt;&lt;img fetchpriority="high" src="https://newsday.co.tt/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/24725108-683x1024.jpg" alt="Dr Robert Jupiter. - "&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Dr Robert Jupiter. - &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A PAIR of Trini-born US board-certified doctors has returned to the twin islands to set up a practice which focuses on obesity and metabolic health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Called Stellar Medical, the practice is founded by husband and wife team Dr Robert Jupiter and Dr Karen Moses, a release said on January 14.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jupiter is a diplomate of the American Board of Family Medicine and Obesity Medicine and is a registered obesity medical specialist with the Medical Board of TT, while Dr Moses is a Fellow of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are excited to return home after several years of study and practice in the US. This new chapter signals our focus on bringing science-based, stigma-free care to citizens of TT that addresses the biological, hormonal, and environmental drivers of weight gain and metabolic disease,” Jupiter said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Obesity is not simply about willpower or eating less. It is a chronic metabolic disease that affects nearly every system in the body. Effective treatment must be compassionate, evidence-based, and tailored to each individual.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ad-manager-half-page-mobile-ad-300x600 ad-space-centered" id="div-gpt-ad-1550239531467-0"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The release said Jupiter has expert guidance on GLP-1/GIP medications such as Wegovy, Ozempic, Zepbound and Mounjaro, which are generally more effective and better tolerated than older weight-loss drugs, with patients often losing 16 to 23 per cent of their total body weight, versus five to ten per cent with earlier treatments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although experienced with the new drugs, the release said Jupiter prefers exploring other options such as nutrition, movement, hydration, sleep and mental wellbeing before considering pharmaceutical options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There is no “magic pill” to weight loss because obesity is a chronic condition where long-term care and ongoing support are often required,” Jupiter underscored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Shame and stigma often prevent people from seeking help. We work to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;create a judgment-free environment and, when needed, collaborate with therapists to address the emotional side of weight management.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;

One of the hedgehogs, later named Brora, wasn’t feeling well and decided he needed some food and water despite the nine inches of snow blanketing the ground. He plowed his way through the snow, ate and drank a little, then collapsed in the feeding station, too weak to go on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-element-index="1"&gt;And that’s exactly where the couple found him, waiting for someone to rescue him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-element-index="2"&gt;Hedgehogs hibernate during the winter months and go into an energy-saving state.

Recent research has identified a neural connection responsible for delaying the start of activities associated with unpleasant experiences, even when these activities offer a clear reward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;The study, led by Ken-ichi Amemori, a neuroscientist at Kyoto University, aimed to analyze the brain mechanisms that reduce motivation to act when a task involves stress, punishment, or discomfort. To do this, the researchers designed an experiment with monkeys, a widely used model for understanding decisionmaking and motivation processes in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;The scientists worked with two macaques that were trained to perform various decisionmaking tasks. In the first phase of the experiment, after a period of water restriction, the animals could activate one of two levers that released different amounts of liquid; one option offered a smaller reward and the other a larger one. This exercise allowed them to evaluate how the value of the reward influences the willingness to perform an action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-VgtPr ekoLDG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;In a later stage, the experimental design incorporated an unpleasant element. The monkeys were given the choice of drinking a moderate amount of water without negative consequences or drinking a larger amount on the condition of receiving a direct blast of air in the face. Although the reward was greater in the second option, it involved an uncomfortable experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;As the researchers anticipated, the macaques' motivation to complete the task and access the water decreased considerably when the aversive stimulus was introduced. This behavior allowed them to identify a brain circuit that acts as a brake on motivation in the face of anticipated adverse situations. In particular, the connection between the ventral striatum and the ventral pallidum, two structures located in the basal ganglia of the brain, known for their role in regulating pleasure, motivation, and reward systems, was observed to be involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;The neural analysis revealed that when the brain anticipates an unpleasant event or potential punishment, the ventral striatum is activated and sends an inhibitory signal to the ventral pallidum, which is normally responsible for driving the intention to perform an action. In other words, this communication reduces the impulse to act when the task is associated with a negative experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="paywall"&gt;The Brain Connection Behind Procrastination&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;To investigate the specific role of this connection, as described in the study published &lt;a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2025.12.035"&gt;in the journal Current Biology&lt;/a&gt;, researchers used a chemogenetic technique that, through the administration of a specialized drug, temporarily disrupted communication between the two brain regions. By doing so, the monkeys regained the motivation to initiate tasks, even in those tests that involved blowing air.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Notably, the inhibitory substance produced no change in trials where reward was not accompanied by punishment. This result suggests that the EV-PV circuit does not regulate motivation in a general way, but rather is specifically activated to suppress it when there is an expectation of discomfort. In this sense, apathy toward unpleasant tasks appears to develop gradually as communication between these two regions intensifies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Beyond explaining why people tend to unconsciously resist starting household chores or uncomfortable obligations, the findings have relevant implications for understanding disorders such as &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/depression/"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/mutations-in-a-single-gene-have-been-linked-to-mental-illness/"&gt;schizophrenia&lt;/a&gt;, in which patients often experience a significant loss of the drive to act.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;However, Amemori emphasizes that this circuit serves an essential protective function. “Overworking is very dangerous. This circuit protects us from burnout,” he said in comments reported by Nature. Therefore, he cautions that any attempt to externally modify this neural mechanism must be approached with care, as further research is needed to avoid interfering with the brain's natural protective processes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story originally appeared in &lt;a href="https://es.wired.com/articulos/neurocientificos-descifran-la-procrastinacion-un-mecanismo-cerebral-explica-por-que-dejamos-ciertas-tareas-para-despues"&gt;WIRED en Español&lt;/a&gt; and has been translated from Spanish.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WIRED</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 20:09:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikgFBVV95cUxPMVQ4OWVYX194ZnFoYzBWWmFwbHlKQmVkNEQ5bHZMM1drMU5SWDNRTm1Eb0RVSDY4Vlg3WUhlamVzOU1ZWmYzblktMVdqMURLbWc1QWdKWWZnMGJTSmFIMHBIOHQ4LUhwazllLWp3VExwdHc3ek5XZm1xZ2Y4Yi1QdWlWUVBSbHpmTVVQYVRXaExodw</guid></item><item><title>营养师评选的9种最佳高蛋白酸奶- TODAY.com</title><link>https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/best-high-protein-yogurts-rcna254046</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body__content"&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e46158" class="body-graf"&gt;Yogurt is one of the easiest ways to add protein to your day, without any cooking required. Whether you’re blending it into smoothies, spooning it on top of granola or using it as a savory substitute for sour cream, high-protein yogurt can help keep you fuller longer, support muscle recovery and make meals more satisfying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-5f6891" class="body-graf"&gt;But not all yogurts are created equal. Some are loaded with added sugar, while others fall short on protein. If you're not sure which yogurt to pick in the dairy aisle, look no further than this list. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-210c26" class="body-graf"&gt;I taste-tested and scoured the nutrition facts on many yogurts to create a list of my top picks. I factor in protein content, ingredient quality, taste and overall versatility. These are the high-protein yogurts I consistently recommend, plus a few strong runners-up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-5320d8" class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What to Look for in a High-Protein Yogurt&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7304b5" class="body-graf"&gt;When shopping for high-protein yogurt, keep these key criteria in mind:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul id="anchor-80e629" class="break-above body-ul body-list-el"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Protein content:&lt;/strong&gt; Aim for at least 12–15 grams of protein per serving. Greek yogurt and skyr tend to deliver the most protein, thanks to their straining process.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Minimal added sugar:&lt;/strong&gt; Plain yogurts are ideal, but if you choose flavored, look for options with reduced or no added sugars. Less sugar makes it easier to enjoy yogurt daily without going over the daily added sugar recommendations.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fat level that fits your needs:&lt;/strong&gt; Nonfat, low-fat and whole milk yogurts can all be healthy choices. The “best” option depends on satiety, taste preference and how it fits into your daily calorie goals.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Taste:&lt;/strong&gt; Nutrition is important, but so is the flavor of the yogurt. Of course, taste is a personal preference, but I argue that these are some of the best-tasting high-protein yogurts in stores now. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-32e394" class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Best Plain Greek Yogurt&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id="anchor-66f53b" class="body-heading"&gt;Fage Total 0%&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii styles_noCaption__qtPhQ" id="anchor-3ebcd7"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture" data-flavor="fit" data-original-height="1024" data-original-width="1024"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2026-01/fage-total-0-0ed5dc.png 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2026-01/fage-total-0-0ed5dc.png 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2026-01/fage-total-0-0ed5dc.png 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2026-01/fage-total-0-0ed5dc.png 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2026-01/fage-total-0-0ed5dc.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;Fage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-405709" class="body-graf"&gt;&lt;a href="https://usa.fage/products/yogurt/fage-total-0" target="_blank"&gt;Fage Total 0%&lt;/a&gt; is a classic for a reason.

&lt;p&gt;TOLEDO, Ohio — The Toledo-Lucas County Health Department is reporting two confirmed flu-related pediatric deaths in the county during the 2025-2026 influenza season.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the health department, the deaths involved one child under the age of 6 and one teen under the age of 18. No additional details were released.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our hearts are with the families who are grieving the loss of their children,” Health Commissioner Karim Baroudi said. “Influenza is a serious illness that can lead to severe complications, especially in children. We want families to know that precautions, vaccination, and early care are critical tools in reducing risk.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to LCHD, the Ohio Department of Health typically reports between one and seven influenza-associated pediatric deaths statewide each flu season. So far this season, Ohio has reported three pediatric flu-related deaths, including the two in Lucas County.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health officials said flu activity is increasing in Lucas County and across Ohio. The health department continues to recommend annual flu vaccination as the most effective way to reduce the risk of severe illness and complications, particularly for young children, people with chronic health conditions and those who care for high-risk individuals.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To increase access to vaccines, the health department will hold a walk-in flu vaccination day on Jan. 15 from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. No appointment is required.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to vaccination, health officials recommend staying home when sick, washing hands frequently with soap and water, covering coughs and sneezes and seeking medical care if symptoms persist or worsen.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flu symptoms can include fever, cough, sore throat, body aches and fatigue. In young children, symptoms may also include vomiting or diarrhea. Parents and caregivers are urged to seek immediate medical attention if a child has difficulty breathing, a persistent high fever, bluish lips or face, signs of dehydration or extreme exhaustion.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2025/05/27/microplastics-found-in-insects-for-first-time/"&gt;Microplastics are everywhere&lt;/a&gt;. We drink them in our water, we eat them in our food, we breathe them in our air, leading to – so we are told – alarming levels of plastic accumulating in our tissues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So it was somewhat of a shock this week when &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/the-guardian/"&gt;the Guardian&lt;/a&gt; published a “bombshell” article suggesting that scientists may be overstating the health concerns. The award-winning journalist Damian Carrington, a champion of green issues, accepted that he himself had warned of the dangers, but said there was mounting concern over the technology used to detect tiny pieces of plastics in the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The article followed a recent letter published in&lt;em&gt; Nature Medicine&lt;/em&gt; which questioned the analytical techniques used to detect microplastics in human tissue, warning they lacked controls and validation. One of the signatories, Dr Dusan Materic, of the Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research in Germany, argued that fat in the body can give a false positive for polyethylene, and said the obesity epidemic could be behind the perceived rise in bodily plastic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Most studies ‘are not scientifically convincing’&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Fazel Monikh, of the University of Padua, Italy, another signatory, who has spent a decade working on the detection of nanomaterials in biological samples, says he has never come across the kinds of microplastics reported in recent studies. “When particulate materials enter a living organism, including the human body, they undergo biotransformation,” he tells The Telegraph.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Even if one were to assume the highly unlikely scenario in which an intact particle reaches a protected compartment, such as the brain, and is then successfully detected, it would not retain the appearance shown in most of the reported data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For these reasons, most of the presented results and their interpretation are not scientifically convincing to me, nor to my colleagues who are experts in this field.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microplastics were first detected in the human body in 2018 when Austrian scientists analysed stool samples of people in eight countries – including Britain – and found every one contained the tiny particles. Such research is not in doubt, and there is good evidence that humans do ingest tens of thousands of plastic particles each year. The sticking point is whether these become embedded in tissues, causing long-term harm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem seems to lie in the tinier versions of microplastics, known as nanoplastics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officially, microplastics are no larger than 5mm in size (the size of a grain of rice or smaller) whereas nanoplastics are 1nm to 1,000nm in size (as small as bacteria) and are a lot harder to detect. In recent years, studies have claimed to have found these miniscule particles in nearly every human organ and tissue, including the lungs, liver, kidneys, heart, brain, placenta, testicles, bone marrow and blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is feared that these tiny intruders carry toxic chemicals which cause inflammation and cell damage, as well as disrupting hormones, damaging microbes in the gut, lowering IQ, decreasing fertility and increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease, cancer, heart attacks and strokes. The paper which sparked the recent &lt;em&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/em&gt; rebuttal letter claimed to have found microplastics and nanoplastics in the brain, which the scientists behind it linked to dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such studies have sparked &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2025/05/27/microplastics-found-in-insects-for-first-time/"&gt;a wave of eco-anxiety&lt;/a&gt;, with people switching to plastic-free tea bags and ditching water bottles, kitchen sponges, polyethylene chopping boards and non-stick saucepans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Methodological concerns&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there are concerns that because microplastics are so prevalent in the environment it is difficult to tease out whether they really are getting into human tissue, or if samples are just contaminated during the process of collecting and analysing them. Lab testing should include “blanks” – control samples of clean water or inert material processed like real samples to detect contamination – but many studies do not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fay Couceiro, professor of environmental pollution at the University of Portsmouth says: “I don’t think that there is any doubt that there are microplastics in us – they are everywhere and we are breathing and eating them daily, so that they are in us is inevitable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think the question raised is more about where in the body they are stored and what quantity there is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Some studies – particularly those based on humans – don’t follow the full standard methodologies used in environmental sampling around blanks, replicates and recovery checks.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With large microplastics, scientists can easily spot particles under a microscope and then fire a laser at them to see if they are plastic. But with nanoplastics, scientists must burn the particle and measure the gases emitted, which is less reliable and still in its infancy as a technique.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This unreliability of testing has made researchers more sceptical about the more alarmist findings. An abstract presented at the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology last year showing microplastics in human reproductive fluids was met with raised eyebrows among scientists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Many previous scary-sounding headlines on microplastics in blood and food have turned out to be measurement errors,” warns Oliver Jones, professor of chemistry at RMIT University, Melbourne, referring to reports that preceded last year’s findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Likewise, separate claims that microplastics had been found in human blood in 2022 were criticised by a US chemist as being “consistent with incidental or accidental contaminations”, in a letter to the Environmental International journal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even Dr Philipp Schwabl, of the Medical University of Vienna, who found the original evidence of microplastics in human bodies is unsure about their health impacts. “The question of how harmful these little foreign plastic bodies truly are remains open to me and thus constitutes a crucial field of environmental biology that remains to be scientifically elucidated,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;‘It is still a serious issue’&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet despite the testing issues, many experts are still convinced microplastics are causing harm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prof Philip Landrigan, a paediatrician and epidemiologist at Boston College in the US, led a recent review into microplastics for the Lancet, and says people should not dismiss the dangers. “The Guardian article is accurate in pointing out that there is work to be done in refining, standardising and harmonising the analytical techniques for examining microplastics in tissue samples,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There is a need especially to distinguish microplastics from lipids [fats]. But the Guardian is wrong in implying that this whole area of science is rubbish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The presence of microplastics in the human body needs to be taken seriously, even if we don’t yet know all the ways in which they may harm health. They cannot be wished away.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Medical University of Vienna recently developed a new imaging technique which can detect plastics without needing to burn up samples. They say it reduces contamination risk and allows scientists to find direct correlations between tissue samples and disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And Dr Matthew Campen, of the University of New Mexico, lead author of the brain study that was challenged in &lt;em&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/em&gt;, said his team had hosted a microplastics conference in the last few days in which “convincing” new evidence had been presented of particles in cerebrospinal fluid. “Our paper is actually very clear on where uncertainties lie and how these may impact the interpretation of results,” he added. “We are 100 per cent confident that nanoplastics are in the brain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prof Lukas Kenner, deputy director of the Department of Pathology at the Medical University of Vienna, says: “The concerns raised are understandable but a blanket dismissal of the entire body of evidence is not scientifically justified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While early studies certainly had methodological limitations, the field has advanced rapidly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There is now good evidence that microplastics can enter and accumulate in the human body, and growing experimental evidence that they are biologically active rather than inert.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, it seems the scientific community is split on the true impact of microplastics and it may be several years before consensus is reached on the harms. The debate over the extent to which they enter and remain in human bodies will be a key part of those discussions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While some fear that plastics could be the modern-day &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2025/02/01/mi5-building-asbestos-terminal-cancer-lawsuit/"&gt;equivalent of asbestos&lt;/a&gt;, lead or tobacco, it may be that the particles are processed or ejected by the body before they do long-term damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prof Christian Dunn, an expert in microplastic pollution at Bangor University in Wales, says: “When it comes to nanoplastics I think we’re still pushing the boundaries as to what we can confidently detect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The extent of how much of this plastic is entering and accumulating in our organs, and the damage this is doing to us, is still up for scientific discovery.”&lt;/p&gt;

The results hint that &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-01274-3" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-01274-3" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;ageing lowers immunity&lt;/a&gt; in unexpected ways, not just by weakening the immune response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study’s authors report that the presence of a specific gene in the heart helped mice to survive virulent infections — but only if the mice were young. For old mice, the gene increased the risk of death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In one case it’s protective. In another case, it actually drives death,” says Andrew Wang, an immunologist at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, who was not involved in the research. The study shows that “the mechanisms that are protective to organs really can differ dramatically”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings about how age affects the body’s ability to endure invasion from pathogens, published in &lt;i&gt;Nature &lt;/i&gt;on 14 January, might be a step towards developing therapies for diseases distinguished by broad immune dysfunction that damages the body, researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Withstanding attack — and defence&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surviving an infection requires the immune system to fight off harmful invaders. But it also requires the body to avoid damage from pathogens and &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-02010-7" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-02010-7" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;overzealous immune cells&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Young individuals often withstand both infection and the immune defences that are unleashed by their bodies to kill off infectious organisms. “But as you get older, your ability to do that reduces,” says Manu Shankar-Hari, an immunologist at the University of Edinburgh, UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02085-w" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-026-00159-x/d41586-026-00159-x_51156772.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;Ageing is linked to inflammation — but only in the industrialized world&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand why this endurance declines over an animal’s lifetime, Janelle Ayres — a co-author of the mouse study and an immunologist at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in San Diego, California — and her colleagues studied a life-threatening condition called &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-02462-x" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-02462-x" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;sepsis&lt;/a&gt;, which occurs when the immune system overreacts to an infection. The resulting immune storm causes organ damage and sometimes death. There are no targeted treatments beyond general antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors injected mice with large doses of bacteria, which caused sepsis in many of the animals. One group included young mice (equivalent to 20–30 years old in humans); mice in the other were older (equivalent to 56–69 years old in humans).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;img src="https://s3.us-east-005.backblazeb2.com/wvmn-s3/2025/10/flu-shot-vaccine-485x370-1-300x229-1.jpg"&gt;
        

    
    &lt;div class="entry-content"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CHARELSTON, W.Va.&lt;/strong&gt; — Kanawha County’s Chief Health Officer said this year’s strain of the flu has turned out to be worse than expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It has been a real butt-kicker as some of the patients have told me. I’m talking some really young, healthy men are telling me they hurt all over and can’t even go to work,” said Dr. Steven Eshenaur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The strain which is spreading rapidly with person to person contact is H3N2. According to Eshenaur it comes with not only aches, pains, and fever, but also stomach pain and nausea issues as well. The spread was so bad in Wetzel County school was moved to remote learning for students through at least Friday at Magnolia High School. At Magnolia, 140 students missed school Monday with flu symptoms. In Ohio a pediatric patient recently died of the strain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A lot of people think, ‘well, it’s just the flu.’ Well the flu can be pretty devastating, especially for those at risk,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Medical experts try to craft a flu vaccine each year to anticipate what will be most effective for protection. Some years are better than others and this year’s vaccine isn’t as effective because of the new viral strain. Despite that, Eshenaur said it’s still highly recommended that everybody get a flu shot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It still does help reduce both the severity and length of illness. More importantly for the elderly population it keeps them out of the hospital because this strain is no joke,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
