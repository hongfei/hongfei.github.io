                Most kids recover from measles. But the virus can be deadly and can erase the immune system's memory.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;The measles outbreak in Texas and New Mexico is now close to 300 reported cases, surpassing the total number of cases in all of the U.S. in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The outbreak&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/03/07/nx-s1-5312107/how-a-measles-outbreak-overwhelmed-a-small-west-texas-town" target="_blank"&gt; is happening in remote, rural areas&lt;/a&gt;. There have been a few isolated &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;cases reported in 13 other states &lt;/a&gt; — not related to the Texas outbreak. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says the nationwide risk remains low and that &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/28/nx-s1-5312088/measles-texas-outbreak-contagious-spread" target="_blank"&gt;vaccination is the key to prevention.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Still, doctors say it's a good time to remember how dangerous and long-lasting the health consequences of measles can be.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Dr. &lt;a href="https://www2.phs.org/providers/alexandria-cvijanovich/2070089" target="_blank"&gt;Alex Cvijanovich&lt;/a&gt; has been a practicing pediatrician for more than 20 years. She says she's still haunted by the memory of a teenage boy she treated at the start of her career in Utah.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The boy had contracted measles as a 7-month-old, when he was too young to be vaccinated. "He got the virus from a child in his neighborhood who was unvaccinated," says Cvijanovich, who now practices in New Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It was a relatively mild case of measles, and the infant recovered. She says he grew up to be a healthy, bright kid — an honor student.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Then in middle school, he started to develop troubling symptoms. "He started getting lost between classes, lost like he couldn't find what class to go to next," Cvijanovich says.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Worried, the teen's parents took him to a series of doctors to figure out what was wrong, until a pediatric neurologist finally suspected a condition called &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK560673/" target="_blank"&gt;subacute sclerosing panencephalitis, or SSPE&lt;/a&gt;. It's a degenerative neurological condition that typically develops seven to 10 years after a measles infection. It is almost always fatal. Cvijanovich was part of the hospital team that confirmed the diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The problem is that there is no treatment for it," she says. "And he basically became more and more incapacitated over time."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Some 18 months after his initial diagnosis, she says, the teenager died.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;SSPE was once considered quite rare. But Dr. Adam Ratner, a pediatric infectious disease specialist in New York City who wrote&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/11/nx-s1-5292478/measles-vaccination-kids-health-disease" target="_blank"&gt; a history of measles,&lt;/a&gt; says data from outbreaks in the U.S. over the past several decades suggests that may not always be the case.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"It turns out that in some age groups, especially in kids under about age 2, it's much more common than we thought," Ratner says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For example, a review of &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/65/2/226/3106340" target="_blank"&gt;measles cases in California&lt;/a&gt; found that, between 1988 and 1991, SSPE cases occurred as frequently as 1 in every 1,367 cases in unvaccinated children under age 5.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Another study that looked at U.S. outbreaks between 1989 and 1991 put the rate of SSPE at roughly &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16235165/" target="_blank"&gt;1 out of every 4,600 &lt;/a&gt;measles cases.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Vaccination prevents not just SSPE, but also other serious complications that measles can cause — including pneumonia and severe brain swelling.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And there's a common consequence from measles infection you might not know of: It can erase your immune memory.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Not only does your brain have a memory, but your immune system has a memory of all the pathogens it's encountered in the past," says &lt;a href="https://genetics.hms.harvard.edu/faculty-staff/stephen-j-elledge" target="_blank"&gt;Stephen Elledge&lt;/a&gt;, a professor in the genetics department at Harvard Medical School who studies how the immune system responds to pathogens.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Elledge says your immune system holds on to those memories, so the next time it encounters a virus, it knows how to fight it. But measles can destroy the cells that retain those memories.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"And when you lose that memory, then you're no longer immune to that particular pathogen," he says. "So the next time you get it, you've got to fight that battle all over again."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;This effect is called immune amnesia. Elledge says it happens to some extent with every measles infection, though its severity varies widely. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"So whenever you get measles, you lose some of your immune memory. And the more severe your case of measles is, the longer it lasts, the more of your immune system is destroyed."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2019/10/31/775081827/measles-virus-may-wipe-out-immune-protection-for-other-diseases" target="_blank"&gt;one study&lt;/a&gt;, Elledge and his colleagues found that unvaccinated children had lost between 11% and 73% of their antibodies, which recognize and neutralize viruses and bacteria.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Other research suggests it can take &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aaa3662" target="_blank"&gt;two to three years&lt;/a&gt; for the immune system to recover. And in the meantime, kids might be left vulnerable to infection from other diseases, including ones they had previously been immune to.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Researchers say immune amnesia helps explain one phenomenon that was documented after the introduction of the measles vaccine in the 1960s: Deaths from other childhood diseases &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2015/05/07/404963436/scientists-crack-a-50-year-old-mystery-about-the-measles-vaccine" target="_blank"&gt;dropped dramatically&lt;/a&gt;. Even deaths from diseases like pneumonia and diarrhea were cut in half.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Ratner says as routine childhood vaccination rates fall, the U.S. is likely to see more and larger measles outbreaks. "There's no doubt that we will in the future see the long-term consequences of measles," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But he says we have a safe and powerful tool to prevent those consequences — vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Oats contain beta-glucan, a type of soluble fibre that helps lower cholesterol levels and supports heart health, says Rob Hobson, a nutritionist and author of &lt;em&gt;Unprocess Your Family Life&lt;/em&gt;. “It forms a gel in the gut that binds to cholesterol, reducing its absorption and helping to remove it from the body.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, while oat milk contains some beta-glucan, whole oats provide a more concentrated source when consumed in porridge or muesli or incorporated in other foods such as pancakes or smoothies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;What are the downsides?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whilst many agree that oat milk is the tastiest plant-based alternative, its nutritional profile leaves much to be desired. Oat milk is low in protein and contains more carbohydrates and added sugars than &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/diet/nutrition/healthiest-animal-milk-cow-horse-goat/"&gt;cow’s milk&lt;/a&gt; and its plant-based competitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A splash of it in a hot drink, or consumed in moderation alongside foods high in protein or fibre, is unlikely to have a big effect. However it has a moderate glycemic index of around 60 (for reference, dairy milk is in the mid-30s) which means it causes a quicker spike in blood sugar compared to other alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oat milk contains added sugars as a result of processing the oats. The sugars are created when enzymes break down oat starches into simple carbohydrates. These pass into the bloodstream as glucose and can raise blood sugar levels. On average, a cup of oat milk contains around seven grams of added sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When consumed in higher volumes (think the daily oat milk latte) it can cause problems, especially for those with diabetes and other sensitivities, Hope explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When I have oat milk in a drink, I tend to have half oat milk and half hot water. Then you’re not having so much because the sugars and calories can add up quickly,” Hope explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, the fortified versions – where extra flavourings, thickeners, nutrients and oils are added in – are ultra-processed and can cause inflammation and bloating. This can disrupt the gut microbiome and metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;How to read an oat milk label&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hobson says that fortified oat milks like Oatly contain added vitamins and minerals that make them a useful swap for cow’s milk. However, for those looking for an option with a minimal ingredient list, he suggests trying Plenish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their organic, unsweetened, gluten-free oat milk contains just water, oats, and sea salt. With 41 calories per 100ml, it is marketed as “preservative-free”, “seed oil-free”, and “UPF-free”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hobson adds: “If you are trying to avoid ultra-processed foods, then you might want to choose oat milks without stabilisers such as gellan gum or guar gum.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both of these are additives that help to thicken the oat milk, improve its shelf life, and keep the ingredients suspended to avoid sediment compounding at the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, it tends to be that some of the cheaper oat milk options have longer ingredient lists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If possible, I’d try to find one that has the basics of oats, water and sea salt and if you’re looking for a fortified version, one which contains vitamin D, B vitamins, calcium, and iodine,” Hobson says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Who should avoid it?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with coeliac disease or severe gluten sensitivities should consider avoiding oat milk as, even though some versions are marked gluten-free, there is still a cross-contamination risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diabetics and those with insulin resistance or other sensitivities might also consider opting for a different alternative due to its added sugar content. And whilst many oat milks are gluten free, those with coeliac disease or sensitivities should still take care as they may be processed in facilities that also handle gluten products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with specific nutrition goals, such those who prioritise a high-protein diet might also consider opting for a different type of milk. “If you rely on milk for protein – whether you do a lot of resistance training, are an older adult, or are a vegan looking for higher-protein options – you may be better off choosing a plant milk such as soya, which has a protein content similar to cow’s milk,” Hobson explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those following a low-carbohydrate diet or on a &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/diet/weight-loss/recipes-to-help-you-lose-weight-after-40/"&gt;weight loss&lt;/a&gt; journey might also opt for a lower-calorie, high protein option or an unsweetened oat milk which better aligns with their goals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because of the low protein content, it is not recommended for children younger than five to solely consume oat milk if they are able to drink dairy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;What about the alternatives?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Nutritionally, I would put oat milk at the bottom of the list, compared to almond, soya, and dairy,” Hope says. “But taste-wise, I’d absolutely put it at the top.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dairy and soy milk both provide good levels of protein – with semi-skimmed cows milk containing 3.6g and soya providing 2.4g per 100ml. They are both also &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/diet/nutrition/calcium-diet/"&gt;rich in calcium&lt;/a&gt; and healthy fats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, almond milk provides a lower-calorie option compared to its competitors with around 22 calories per 100ml. It has the highest calcium level of all the nut-based milks and is high in vitamin E, iron, and fibre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oat milk has the highest glycemic index compared to almond, soy, and dairy milk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Dairy, nutritionally, is going to be the best for us in terms of the micronutrients, the protein, and the calcium,” Hope says. She ranks soya in second place, followed by almond, and then finally oat milk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Can you drink it every day?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As it’s high in carbohydrates and calories, oat milk should be consumed in moderation which means it may not be a wise idea to start every day with a creamy oat milk latte.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Starbucks grande oat latte is the most calorific of the various plant-based options, with around 184 calories, 9.1g of fat, 21g of carbohydrates, 10g of sugar, 3.3g of fibre and just 2.8g of protein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, a grande almond latte is the lowest calorie option at 82, the soya alternative contains a substantial 10.3g of protein, and the coconut option provides a good amount of fibre with 4.8g.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Not everything that we consume needs to be the healthiest thing for us, as long as we know where the food sits in our balanced diet,” Hope says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We don’t want to be mistaken and think that oat milk is a super healthy drink, but it tastes great and I personally love an oat milk matcha. We just need to be aware of how much of it we’re consuming and how regularly.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Is it really better than cow’s milk?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The short answer is no.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dairy milk is naturally rich in B vitamins, iodine, calcium, and is higher in protein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38871080/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; conducted at the University of Minnesota in 2024 found that most plant-based alternatives do not deliver the same level of nutrition as cows milk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A team within the university’s Nutrition Coordinating Centre examined more than 200 plant-based alternatives and compared their nutritional profiles against each other and with cow’s milk.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;A new approach to  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="155126" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; disease treatment could be on the horizon, inspired by a compound found in common herbs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnosic_acid"&gt;Carnosic acid&lt;/a&gt; is found in rosemary and sage and is known for its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties; however, it is unstable in its pure form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now researchers in California have synthesized a stable derivative of the compound, which showed promising results in mouse models of Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mice that were given the stable derivative had boosts in memory, more neuron synapses, reduced inflammation, and more removal of toxic proteins that are linked to Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That covers multiple signs of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimer-s-disease"&gt;Alzheimer's disease&lt;/a&gt;, which can kill off a high proportion of synapses, breaking key neuron communication routes, while memory loss is one of the most noticeable effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_155129" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-155129" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/NeuralDensity.jpg" alt="Mouse brains" class="wp-image-155129 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/NeuralDensity.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/NeuralDensity-600x276.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-155129" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Microscopy images showing an Alzheimer's-like mouse brain (left), and a diAcCA-treated mouse brain (right), with more intense green colors showing more neuronal synapses. (&lt;a href="https://www.scripps.edu/news-and-events/press-room/2025/20250319-lipton-alzheimers.html"&gt;Scripps Research&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We did multiple different tests of memory, and they were all improved with the drug," &lt;a href="https://www.scripps.edu/news-and-events/press-room/2025/20250319-lipton-alzheimers.html"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; neuroscientist Stuart Lipton, from the Scripps Research Institute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It didn't just slow down the decline, it improved virtually back to normal."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the main challenges faced by the researchers was getting carnosic acid into a stable form that would last long enough in the brain to have an effect. After extensive tests, they found a suitable &lt;span&gt;di-acetylated &lt;/span&gt;form (diAcCA).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gut converts diAcCA to carnosic acid before it enters the bloodstream, where they found it has about 20 percent better absorption than pure carnosic acid. Once converted, the carnosic acid reached therapeutic levels in the brain within an hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mice with a form of Alzheimer's were then given diAcCA or a  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-a-placebo" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="102371" data-postid="155126" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;placebo&lt;/a&gt; three times a week for three months. The researchers looked at the effects on brain tissue and how well the mice did on exercises designed to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/this-new-blood-test-identifies-alzheimers-memory-loss-with-90-accuracy"&gt;assess their memory&lt;/a&gt; and ability to learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The diAcCA compound didn't appear to have any toxic effects on the mice treated with it, and excessive buildups of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/we-may-finally-understand-how-the-tangled-proteins-in-dementia-cause-cells-to-die"&gt;proteins known to be signs of Alzheimer's damage&lt;/a&gt; were reduced in their brains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"By combating inflammation and oxidative stress with this diAcCA compound, we actually increased the number of synapses in the brain," &lt;a href="https://www.scripps.edu/news-and-events/press-room/2025/20250319-lipton-alzheimers.html"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Lipton.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We also took down other misfolded or aggregated proteins such as phosphorylated tau and amyloid beta, which are thought to trigger Alzheimer's disease and serve as biomarkers of the disease process."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's all very promising, although we're still at the early stages here.  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/clinical-trials" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73032" data-postid="155126" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; will be needed to confirm that diAcCA has the same effects in human brains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the anti-inflammatory properties of carnosic acid, which have also been recorded in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/cddis2016389"&gt;previous studies&lt;/a&gt;, Lipton and his colleagues are hopeful that this same treatment could be used for other conditions linked to inflammation – from type 2  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="155126" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; to  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IYl" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73029" data-postid="155126" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Parkinson's&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's also potential for diAcCA drugs to be used alongside other &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/latest-alzheimers-drugs-can-add-years-of-independence-to-patient-lives"&gt;treatments for Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; that are now available. As this compound is a modified form of carnosic acid – already known to be safe for consumption – the researchers are hoping new medications can be developed on an accelerated schedule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It could make existing amyloid  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/antibody" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73081" data-postid="155126" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;antibody&lt;/a&gt; treatments work better by taking away or limiting their side effects," &lt;a href="https://www.scripps.edu/news-and-events/press-room/2025/20250319-lipton-alzheimers.html"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Lipton.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3921/14/3/293"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Antioxidants&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because outbreaks primarily affect sub-Saharan Africa, pharmaceutical companies have lacked financial incentives to develop treatments, and the sporadic nature of outbreaks has made  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/clinical-trials" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73032" data-postid="155142" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

(&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebola#/media/File:Ebola_virus_virion.jpg"&gt;CDC/PD&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're really trying to come up with something that was more practical, easier to use, that could be used to help prevent, control, and contain outbreaks," Thomas Geisbert, a virologist at The University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston, who led the &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adw0659"&gt;new study published in &lt;em&gt;Science Advances&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, told AFP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For their experiment, Geisbert and colleagues tested the antiviral Obeldesivir, the oral form of intravenous Remdesivir, originally developed for  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/coronavirus" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73041" data-postid="155142" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Covid-19&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obeldesivir is a "polymerase inhibitor," meaning it blocks an enzyme crucial for viral replication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team infected rhesus and cynomolgus macaques with a high dose of the Makona variant of the Ebola virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A day after exposure, ten monkeys then received an Obeldesivir pill daily for ten days, while three control monkeys received no treatment and died.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obeldesivir protected 80 percent of the cynomolgus macaques and 100 percent of the rhesus macaques, which are biologically closer to humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drug not only cleared the virus from the treated monkeys' blood but also triggered an immune response, helping them develop  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/antibody" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73081" data-postid="155142" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;antibodies&lt;/a&gt; while avoiding organ damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Geisbert explained that while the number of monkeys was relatively small, the study was statistically powerful because they were exposed to an extraordinarily high dose of the virus – roughly 30,000 times the lethal dose for humans. This reduced the need for additional control monkeys, limiting unnecessary animal deaths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researcher, who has worked on Ebola since the 1980s and is credited with discovering the Reston strain, said one of the most exciting aspects of Obeldesivir is its "broad-spectrum" protection, compared to the approved antibody treatments that only work against the Zaire species of Ebola.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"That's a huge advantage," Geisbert said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pharmaceutical maker Gilead is currently advancing Obeldesivir to Phase 2 clinical trials for Marburg virus, a close relative of Ebola.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Geisbert also emphasized the importance of funding from the US National Institutes of Health, amid reports that dozens of grants have been canceled under President Donald Trump's administration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"All these drugs and vaccines that were developed against Ebola and a lot of these exotic  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/virus" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73053" data-postid="155142" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;viruses&lt;/a&gt; and pathogens – 90 percent of the money comes from the US government," he said, adding, "I think the general public would agree we need treatments for Ebola."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;© &lt;a href="terms-and-conditions"&gt;Agence France-Presse&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Simply looking at nature – or even just digital pictures of it – can relieve pain, according to new research which scanned the brains of people receiving electrical shocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nature's many health benefits have been documented by decades of research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 40 years ago, a pioneering study showed that hospitalized patients needed fewer painkillers and recovered quicker when they looked out of a window onto green space rather than a brick wall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Yet until now, the underlying reasons for this effect were unclear," said Maximilian Steininger, a neuroscientist at the University of Vienna and lead author of a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56870-2"&gt;study published in &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is that both nature and pain can be subjective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because people like nature, it could have a  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-a-placebo" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="102371" data-postid="155141" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;placebo&lt;/a&gt; effect. Or what if it is not nature that reduces pain, but city life that increases it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_155158" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-155158" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/Neurologic-pain-signature-642x685.jpg" alt="Neurologic pain signature" class="size-medium wp-image-155158" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/Neurologic-pain-signature-642x685.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/Neurologic-pain-signature-389x415.jpg 389w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/Neurologic-pain-signature-600x640.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/Neurologic-pain-signature.jpg 656w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-155158" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The brain response shows overall brain activity involved in processing the location and intensity of pain. This response was lower when people were exposed to virtual nature scenes compared to urban or indoor scenes. (Max Steininger/University of Vienna)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;To find out more, the researchers recorded the brain activity of 49 volunteers using functional  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/magnetic-resonance-imaging" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73063" data-postid="155141" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;magnetic resonance imaging&lt;/a&gt; (fRMI).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The subjects looked at different images while receiving a series of electric shocks – some more painful than others – on the back of their left hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first scene depicted a lake surrounded by trees blowing in the wind, while the sounds of rustling leaves and birdsong played in the background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the second scene, some urban elements such as buildings, benches and alleyways were added, while city noise intruded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third scene was of an office, with the accompanying drab furniture and whir of work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;'Important practical implications'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not only did the participants report feeling less pain when they looking at the natural landscapes, the  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/magnetic-resonance-imaging" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73063" data-postid="155141" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;fMRI scans&lt;/a&gt; showed there was a difference in their brains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our study is the first to provide evidence from brain scans that this isn't just a placebo effect," Steininger said in a &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1076537"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nature scenes provoked decreased activity in a part of the brain involved in perceiving pain, called nociception. However other areas linked to regulating pain were not significantly affected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers said the results could be because natural environments capture people's attention, diverting them away from the sensation of pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is known in psychology as the "attention restoration theory".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The fact that this pain-relieving effect can be achieved through a virtual nature exposure which is easy to administer has important practical implications," said study co-author Alex Smalley from the UK's Exeter University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also "opens new avenues for research to better understand how nature impacts our minds," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;© &lt;a href="terms-and-conditions"&gt;Agence France-Presse&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY, Calif. (VVNG.com) –&lt;/strong&gt; The San Bernardino County Public Health Department has confirmed four pediatric influenza-related deaths for the 2024-2025 flu season. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Among the deceased children, two did not have any known medical conditions, while the other two had significant underlying health issues. Notably, all four children were unvaccinated against influenza this season.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We extend our sincerest condolences to the families of these children. These fatalities are a reminder that influenza can be a serious and often deadly disease among our most vulnerable populations,” said San Bernardino County Health Officer Dr. Sharon Wang.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The flu season typically spans from November 1 to April 30 each year, with flu-related emergency room visits usually peaking between December and February. This season has seen a concerning 64.6 percent increase in hospitalizations compared to the previous year, the county confirmed in a &lt;a href="https://main.sbcounty.gov/2025/03/13/county-confirms-flu-related-pediatric-deaths/"&gt;written statement.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“To protect yourself and your loved ones, it’s essential to understand flu symptoms, recognize when to seek medical care, and adopt preventive measures,” the county stated.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends an annual flu shot for everyone six months of age and older. Other preventive measures include frequent handwashing, wearing masks in crowded or high-risk environments, avoiding close contact with those who are sick, and regularly disinfecting commonly touched surfaces.&lt;/p&gt;				
				



&lt;p&gt;Pregnant women, children, the elderly, and individuals with chronic conditions such as asthma, diabetes, and heart disease are particularly at risk for severe flu complications, and are urged by the county to get vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Flu symptoms typically include fever, chills, muscle aches, cough, sore throat, runny nose, and fatigue. Children may also experience vomiting and diarrhea.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If you have trouble breathing, persistent chest pain, confusion or bluish lips or face, seek medical care immediately,” the statement read. “If you are at higher risk and develop flu symptoms, contact your healthcare provider right away. Early antiviral treatment can help reduce severe illness.”&lt;/p&gt;

I work a serving job, which requires a lot of moving and I normally walk my dog over a mile daily.   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'[But] I was feeling embarrassed that my clothes didn't fit, or that I didn't like the way I looked. I would still attend social gatherings, but I wasn't as confident as I usually am.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After tolerating her symptoms for a few months, she decided to visit her primary care doctor and was told to get blood tests to rule out &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-84d6f150-00f2-11f0-9713-057e655d193b"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; or other serious health problems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Luckily, they were negative, but that left Adesso still scrambling for answers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Briana Adesso, 31, an elementary special education teacher pictured here before her hypothyroidism diagnosis in August 2022&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;She had gained about 40 pounds in the span of six months between late 2022 to early 2023. Pictured here in April 2023, a month before her diagnosis &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her doctor then took an&lt;span&gt; ultrasound of her thyroid - a butterfly-shaped gland that &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-12744113/Bizarre-symptom-thyroid-cancer.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;produces hormones that regulate metabolism&lt;/a&gt;, growth, and development.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It revealed multiple benign growths on the gland itself which were interfering with hormone production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She was diagnosed with hypothyroidism - or an underactive thyroid - which had caused her metabolism to crash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Metabolism is the body's ability to convert food and drink into energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Having a slow metabolism means the body burns fewer calories at rest, making it easier to gain weight and harder to lose it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The condition is also known to impact appetite and people may experience food cravings and increased calorie intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It can also cause muscle weakness, thinning hair, dry skin, impaired memory function, low moods and changes in blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About five percent of people in the US aged 12 and older experience some degree of hypothyroidism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Eve Bloomgarden, an endocrinologist at Northwestern Medicine explained: 'Hypothyroidism from any cause results in a decrease in energy metabolism, or the basal metabolic rate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Patients often experience a modest amount of weight gain prior to diagnosis because of this metabolic slowing.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Kimberly Bethel from the Trotwood Physician Center in Ohio further added: 'The thyroid’s function is to regulate the metabolism of the body - how fast or slow things go. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It affects everything from the top of the head all the way down to the toes. And we know it affects a person’s weight. If you are a fast metabolizer you will burn more calories, or if you are a slow metabolizer, you’re going to gain weight.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Hypothyroidism can be caused by a multitude of reasons, including an iodine deficiency, pituitary gland disorders such as non-cancerous tumors and thyroiditis (inflammation of the thyroid that can happen after a viral illness or pregnancy). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In addition to thyroid issues, Ms Adesso was also found to be suffering from insulin resistance - a condition in which the body's cells become less responsive to insulin, which can cause weight gain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Following her diagnosis in 2023, she was prescribed Synthroid - a drug regularly used to treat hypothyroidism - and semaglutide - the active ingredient in weight-loss drugs Ozempic and Wegovy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Ms Adesso said she has managed to 50 pounds as of this month. She is pictured here in March 2025&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She also maintained her healthy lifestyle by continuing to work out and eat healthy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The combination of treatments was working, but her insurance stopped paying for the semaglutide. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While her insurance initially covered it, she eventually was forced to pay out of pocket - with a monthly supply of semaglutide typically costing $1,350. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She explained: 'My endocrinologist prescribed me Synthroid and Semaglutide. On top of the medications, I maintain a healthy, well balanced diet and continue to be very active.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Since starting her regimen, Ms Adesso told this website she has managed to lose 50lbs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: 'I am extremely thankful for Semaglutide. There is such a stigma around taking this medicine but it truly helped me so much.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Having both hypothyroidism and insulin resistance made it nearly impossible for me to lose weight, no matter how many diets I went on or the amount of exercise I did. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Unfortunately my insurance stopped covering this medication and I was paying out of pocket for many months, but it truly was such a key factor in my success of losing weight.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 17 Mar 2025 00:52:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipwFBVV95cUxNTGpyTUZaSFdyMVAxR3ZfZTIzc1k0c1FXOHRWcHBNUW5SVXdBNTdYS2hkMzNqbWxIVkJHa0dRUm9WRDY0UWljbFJuQlc3OUhuTEZLemREVVlSdmpTUG9FeUF6OHIwVnJwQmhGdTJnSXd2WWVLMkdyTzVhYkpxYmJTS3l6cFZGblZ3dlhTLWNTSVhUbXhxS1EwbmdYd2QtaVZ3aEJMODUxVdIBrAFBVV95cUxNLVlzZDYtcHBXeUFhNGdER2M2T25wQ3ZJZmNzRVdwa004RDVNZ01mQ2lNWnBvcm5ndWxzTERial9lTEgtd3VVdnkxajBkeV9sSG90bElTMkFwV1Vqa0JETTVKeTVQR2pfWFRSSFdmdVVSRjlKb1N5amMxQWU4RGhqQUVna29IMkpIelJqV0Y4ZVprNnk1YXBmaDMwQUJUdWtoeVhxOXlUWkgyVGhU</guid></item><item><title>Doctors Are Changing Their Advice About Blood Sugar for Older People - InsideHook</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieEFVX3lxTE03aTl5S25oTFFMTEVuVy1pVk1HUE5WdVVWY09RVEFKMnFON0JaTHlaQjhWMTdYYWZRSXgxcnFyWjJRT2ZGOU05WEZGMlpwUWJrMjJ2dl9obFcyR3NQbkZOZXlSZGdzMVdmUm9GQjZyaEdPYUR4X0pTVNIBfkFVX3lxTE1uY29adkRRbDlFZFBXOXY3OE9WQzlxTE5lOWpQcjlpY0lPc2gwQjE0TFhjTVMzN3IxMV83R0tKWndLRTliVHEzTWxjdl9MMWZ3bHlPWDlvUWNydElKMHpQR19VRDg0NkE5OV9ZU1VNNmVvVVVnNkFVeE5QbElPdw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-content"&gt;
							
&lt;p&gt;As we age, is it more important to keep one’s blood sugar levels from getting too high or too low? In a perfect world, the answer would be “both” — but a growing number of doctors are now leaning towards a higher tolerance for higher blood sugar as we grow older.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As the Mayo Clinic and other experts &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hypoglycemia/symptoms-causes/syc-20373685"&gt;have pointed out&lt;/a&gt;, hypoglycemia — when someone’s levels of blood sugar go below the standard range — is a condition that needs to be treated as quickly as possible. In a recent &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/10/health/diabetes-blood-sugar-age.html"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt;, Paula Span explained why doctors working with older Americans are starting to emphasize preventing blood sugar levels from getting too low, even if that means that those same levels could go too high.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dr. Sei Lee of the University of California, San Francisco told the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; that maintaining precise control of one’s blood sugar isn’t as important as one ages. “It was really important when you were 50. Now, it’s less important,” Dr. Lee said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Span points out that medical guidelines on what blood sugar levels are considered “too high” have evolved over the years, with organizations like the American Geriatrics Society and the American Diabetes Association advocating for higher hemoglobin a1c levels for older Americans living with diabetes and other chronic conditions.&lt;/p&gt; 



	




&lt;p&gt;Experts have also observed that trying to control blood sugar too much as patients age can have negative effects on its own. Another expert cited in the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; article, Dr. Joseph G. Ouslander, criticized what he referred to as “the astoundingly high rates of overtreatment of diabetes in older people in general” in &lt;a href="https://agsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jgs.19201"&gt;an editorial&lt;/a&gt; published last year in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of the American Geriatrics Society&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As with managing any chronic condition, finding the right balance here is optimal. But what that right balance might be is very different for someone who’s 40 and someone who’s 80. &lt;/p&gt;

But &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14461221/Im-pharmacist-three-vitamins-tell-avoid.html"&gt;there can be too much&lt;/a&gt; of a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While vitamins are touted as good for you, the body isn't designed to handle excessive vitamin intake.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Humans have evolved to require only small amounts, naturally found in a wide variety of foods, to support cell and organ function, and the body isn't able to quickly eliminate excess vitamins, allowing some to build to dangerous levels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Supplement overdoses can lead to serious complications, including liver and kidney damage, hardening of soft tissues, bleeding, and nerve damage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, because it can take weeks or even months for signs of toxicity from some vitamins to cause symptoms, you may be causing damage without even realizing it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The risk of overdose depends on the base recommendation. For instance, the recommended amount of vitamin A for adult men is 900 micrograms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, taking too much - about three to four times the recommendation - can lead to minor symptoms like a headache or severe complications like brain damage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Iron is essential for producing hemoglobin, which carries oxygen in red blood cells, but taking over 20mg can be toxic&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-large health-ccox mol-style-bold"&gt;Iron&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;Recommended daily dose for adults: 8 milligrams (mg) for men; 18 mg for women&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Iron plays a key role in the production of hemoglobin, the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen throughout the body, but too much, around 20mg or higher, can be toxic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Symptoms of iron toxicity may start out minor and be blamed on something common like the stomach flu and include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, severe iron poisoning can lead to severe complications like liver damage and heart failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The harm becomes even more severe when a person takes too much over a long period of time. Gradually, iron accumulates in the organs, causing potentially fatal damage to the brain and liver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Iron supplement overdose over an extended period of time mimics a natural iron balance disorder called iron overload. This is caused by the body’s regulatory system failing to keep iron levels within healthy limits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over time, an excess of iron can increase one’s risk of arthritis, colon cancer, liver problems, diabetes, and heart failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-large health-ccox mol-style-bold"&gt;Calcium&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;Recommended daily dose for adults 51 and up: 1,000 to 1,200 mg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Adequate calcium is crucial to shoring up the bones and keeping skeletal muscles working properly. Calcium supplements are often recommended to seniors who are at increased risk of deficiency and osteoporosis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Brittle bones make severe breaks and fractures more likely, especially in the hips, spine, risk, and forearm. They’re likely to be painful and require surgery to repair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, it's important to strike the right balance. Taking more than 1,200 mg can lead to hypercalcemia, in which too much calcium is circulating in the blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It can cause a wide range of symptoms from seemingly innocuous nausea and constipation, to more concerning effects like dehydration, confusion and disorientation, muscle and bone pain, high blood pressure, kidney damage, and even coma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Severe cases of vitamin D overdose can lead to kidney failure and abnormal heart rhythm, as well as an unsteady gait, confusion, fatigue, constipation, nausea, bone pain, and muscle weakness&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-large health-ccox mol-style-bold"&gt;Vitamin D&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;Recommended daily dose for adults: 600 International Units (IU)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Vitamin D is often thoughts of as the sunshine vitamin as people can get it from about 15 minutes of being in the sunlight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For those who prefer the shade, however, doctors recommend 600 international units (IU). Taking extremely high doses – around 4,000 IU – over a long period of time can cause vitamin D toxicity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Severe cases can lead to kidney failure and abnormal heart rhythm, as well as an unsteady gait, confusion, fatigue, constipation, nausea, bone pain, and muscle weakness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cases of vitamin D toxicity are rare, with roughly 4,500 cases in the US every year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While sunlight is an excellent source of vitamin D, spending too much time outdoors will not cause vitamin D toxicity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Vitamin D toxicity doesn't occur suddenly and you may be experiencing it without even realizing.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Instead, it occurs when a person takes large doses of supplements over months or years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-large health-ccox mol-style-bold"&gt;Vitamin A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;Recommended daily dose for adults: 900 microgram retinol activity equivalents (mg RAE) for men, 700 mcg RAE for women&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Vitamin A is crucial for vision, immunity and growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But exceeding 3,000 mcg RAE of vitamin A can, over time, cause significant organ damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Vitamin A toxicity leads to hypervitaminosis A. Taking a lot over a short amount of time has been known to cause nausea, dizziness, blurred vision, loss of appetite, and headache.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Chronic over-use causes the liver to malfunction and become enlarged until it fails. High vitamin A levels may also cause weakened bones, increasing the risk of fractures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Pregnant women who take too much vitamin A also risk birth defects in their babies, such as a cleft palate or cleft lip, congenital heart defects, brain malformations, and thyroid problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Pregnant women are generally advised not to exceed 770 mcg RAE per day, which can come from cod liver oil, egg yolks, whole milk, cheese, and beef liver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Too much magnesium can cause diarrhea, low blood pressure, breathing difficulty, irregular heart rhythm, kidney damage, and coma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

It has also been shown to help reduce stress levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Too much magnesium, though, can cause diarrhea, low blood pressure, breathing difficulty, irregular heart rhythm, kidney damage, and coma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In severe cases or if the kidneys aren’t working well, dialysis might be needed to remove the excess magnesium from the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Hypermagnesemia is rare because the kidneys remove excess magnesium. But complications can occur in people with kidney problems who take magnesium-containing medications like laxatives or antacids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People with kidney disease, heart disease, or digestive issues are at higher risk and should avoid magnesium supplements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-large health-ccox mol-style-bold"&gt;Folic acid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;Recommended daily dose for adults: 400 mcg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;Recommended daily dose for pregnant women: at least 600 mcg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Folic acid helps prevent birth defects in a baby’s brain and spine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Folic acid is commonly taken by pregnant women or women trying to conceive as it helps prevent birth defects in a baby’s brain and spine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The mineral plays a crucial role in producing red blood cells in utero and supports the development of the baby’s neural tube into their brain and spinal cord.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Folic acid also works alongside other vitamins such as B12 to control high levels of an amino acid called homocysteine, which has been associated with an increased risk of heart disease, stroke, and other health problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In high amounts, however, folic acid can obscure a deficiency of B12, which can lead to severe nerve damage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When taken in large quantities, folic acid can correct low red blood cell counts, but it does not address potential nerve damage that has gone undiagnosed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Too much folic acid can also irritate the digestive system, causing bloating, gas, and nausea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;National Institutes of Health officials have urged scientists to remove all references to mRNA vaccine technology from their grant applications, two researchers said, in a move that signaled the agency might abandon a promising field of medical research.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p&gt;The mRNA technology is under study at the NIH for prevention and treatment of infectious diseases, including flu and AIDS, and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencefriday.com/segments/pancreatic-cancer-vaccine/"&gt;also cancer&lt;/a&gt;. It was deployed in the development of covid-19 vaccines credited with &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/covid-19/report-covid-19-vaccines-saved-us-115-trillion-3-million-lives"&gt;saving 3 million lives&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S. alone — an accomplishment &lt;a href="https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-operation-warp-speed-vaccine-summit/"&gt;President Donald Trump bragged about&lt;/a&gt; in his first term.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A scientist at a biomedical research center in Philadelphia wrote to a colleague, in an email reviewed by KFF Health News, that a project officer at NIH had “flagged our pending grant as having an mRNA vaccine component.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s still unclear whether mRNA vaccine grants will be canceled,” the scientist added.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;NIH officials also told a senior NIH-funded vaccine scientist in New York state, who does not conduct mRNA vaccine research but described its efficacy in previous grant applications, that all references to mRNA vaccines should be scrubbed from future applications.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Scientists relayed their experiences on the condition of anonymity for fear of professional retaliation by the Trump administration.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A senior official at the National Cancer Institute confirmed that NIH acting Director Matthew Memoli sent an email across the NIH instructing that any grants, contracts, or collaborations involving mRNA vaccines be reported up the chain to Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s office and the White House.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Memoli sent a similar message ahead of the agency canceling other research, such as studies of vaccine hesitancy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Memoli’s email on that topic bluntly stated that NIH was not interested in learning why people shun vaccines or in exploring ways to “improve vaccine interest and commitment.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The National Cancer Institute official, who also spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals, said that “it is reasonable to assume mRNA vaccine work is next.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The official said a similar memo also went out regarding NIH-funded work in South Africa, which the White House has targeted over false claims that the country’s government is persecuting white people. More recently, another one went out regarding all global research collaborations, the official said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Spokespeople for the White House, HHS, and the NIH did not respond to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The NIH, whose latest annual budget was $47 billion, is one of the world’s most critical sources of funding for basic biomedical research. Its mission and programs are under unprecedented scrutiny from Trump’s White House and the Department of Government Efficiency, the Elon Musk-led agency&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;created by a Trump executive order that has directed federal agencies to prepare for widespread layoffs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The NIH is funding at least 130 studies involving the mRNA technology in covid vaccines produced by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna that have been administered to billions of people worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A former government official familiar with internal discussions said that the Trump administration intends to cut some grants for mRNA vaccine research but that the timing is unclear. The person spoke on the condition of anonymity to protect relationships with the administration.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Political conservatives in the U.S. have promulgated conspiracy theories, unsupported by scientific evidence, that the shots and their relatively new technology are dangerous. This has undermined public support for covid vaccinations and mRNA research.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“There will not be any research funded by NIH on mRNA vaccines,” the scientist in New York said in an interview. “MAGA people are convinced that these vaccines have killed and maimed tens of thousands of people. It’s not true, but they believe that.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, hundreds of other vaccine-related studies are in limbo. Kawsar Talaat, a vaccine researcher at the Bloomberg School of Public Health at Johns Hopkins University, has been waiting since the fall for money needed to recruit subjects for a study of an antidiarrheal vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“NIH approved our funding,” she said, “and now we’re waiting, and we don’t know if it’s going forward or going to be killed.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The scientist in Philadelphia signaled that he believes Kennedy, a longtime anti-vaccine activist, is responsible for the NIH’s turn against mRNA research.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Kennedy’s war on vaccines has started,” the scientist told his colleague.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scientist in New York said that it was “ridiculous” to remove mRNA language from the grant applications. But “if my grant is rejected for any reason,” the scientist said, “people in my lab will lose their jobs.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I’ve worked with some of them for 20 years,” the scientist added. “They have children and families. There is a real climate of fear in academia about this now, especially among vaccine scientists.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“My grant does not involve a request for funds to conduct mRNA vaccine experiments,” the scientist said, “so my principal concern was to avoid word-search flags that, at minimum, would lead to delays in any funding.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While tenured research professors at universities generally receive a salary from their institution, the staffers who work in their labs and offices are often paid through NIH grants. The &lt;a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/2023/press-release/"&gt;2023 Nobel Prize&lt;/a&gt; in physiology or medicine was given to two scientists for developing mRNA vaccines, through work that relied on pharmaceutical companies and on NIH scientists working under infectious disease specialist Anthony Fauci.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cassidy.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/cassidy-delivers-floor-speech-in-support-of-rfk-jr-to-be-hhs-secretary/"&gt;According to Sen. Bill Cassidy&lt;/a&gt;, a Louisiana Republican who chairs the chamber’s Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, Kennedy promised during his Senate confirmation process that he would protect “the public health benefit of vaccination” and “work within the current vaccine approval and safety monitoring systems, and not establish parallel systems.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cassidy, a physician, had expressed reservations about confirming Kennedy to the HHS post and challenged his anti-vaccine views during a confirmation hearing. He ended up voting for him, he said, because &lt;a href="https://www.cassidy.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/cassidy-delivers-floor-speech-in-support-of-rfk-jr-to-be-hhs-secretary/"&gt;Kennedy had agreed&lt;/a&gt; to work closely with Cassidy and his committee.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, Kennedy has faced scrutiny in his first weeks in office for his handling of a large measles outbreak among mostly unvaccinated people in Texas that has led to the death of a child, the first U.S. measles death in more than a decade. A patient who tested positive for measles died in New Mexico, but the cause hasn’t been confirmed. Instead of urging vaccination against the disease, an almost surefire way to prevent infection, Kennedy has &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/measles-more-likely-severe-among-malnourished-rfk-says"&gt;blamed malnourishment for the outbreak&lt;/a&gt;, promoted unproven treatments for measles, and falsely claimed &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/video/6369907937112"&gt;in one Fox News interview&lt;/a&gt; that the vaccine is ineffective and even dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cassidy did not respond to a request for comment on the NIH’s potential abandonment of mRNA vaccine research.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As part of the Trump administration’s push to examine spending on mRNA vaccines, health officials are reviewing a $590 million contract for bird flu shots that the Biden administration awarded to Moderna, &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-02-26/trump-administration-orders-bird-flu-shot-review-as-risks-rise&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;source=docs&amp;amp;ust=1742157241275120&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw1ljj05wrVfb8mqwVwTd4ML"&gt;Bloomberg News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-02-26/trump-administration-orders-bird-flu-shot-review-as-risks-rise"&gt; has reported&lt;/a&gt;. Legislation introduced by GOP lawmakers in at least seven states is aimed at &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/mrna-vaccines-trump-boast-under-gop-attacks-legislation/"&gt;banning or limiting mRNA vaccines&lt;/a&gt;. In some cases, the measures would hit doctors who give the injections with criminal penalties, fines, and the possible revocation of their licenses.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        minutes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="articleContainer"&gt;&lt;p&gt;SALT LAKE CITY — One young girl is about to spend her third consecutive birthday at Primary Children's Hospital. Sienna, 4, was born with hypoplastic left heart syndrome and needs an artificial heart and a medical team to keep her alive until a heart transplant is available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sienna is the youngest of three children in her family and she has been in the hospital since early 2023. Her mom said they live 45 minutes away from the hospital — when traffic is good. Family comes to stay with the girl every day — either Sienna's mom, dad or grandparents. Sienna's mom said her upcoming birthday is a difficult milestone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You hope that you know, that's not their life story," Francesca Barton said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the challenges of her long stay, a new cardiac rehabilitation program introduced at Primary Children's Hospital is significantly improving her life right now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Bringing the pizzazz&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jessica Pavlock, an exercise physiologist and cardiac rehab lead, said she met Sienna about six months after the long hospital stay began. The girl was sitting, watching TV and not moving much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Active play wasn't really part of Sienna's day," Pavlock said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slowly, she said, the girl started walking to the end of the hallway, pushing weights and picking things up off the floor. Now, Sienna looks forward to exercises and always wants to go for a run and sing — Pavlock said the nurses have to work to keep up with her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"She doesn't even realize she's working out at this point," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Sienna Barton, 4, pushes a doll in a stroller at Primary Children's Hospital. She is one of the first heart patients to participate in the cardiac rehab program. (Photo: Intermountain Health)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;They bring along a speaker to play music and make it fun — individualizing treatment to each patients' interests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We definitely bring the pizzazz," Pavlock said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you walk past Sienna's room she is having a dance party and singing. Pavlock said she is now active for the majority of each day, as a healthy child would be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Dan Ziebell, a pediatric cardiologist and director of the cardiac rehab program, said cardiac rehab is a medically supervised program to build physical strength in heart patients. For patients like Sienna, he said it is helping prepare her and build strength to help her recover from her eventual heart transplant. Ziebell said the exercise, three times a week, is keeping her from becoming weak due to the hospital stay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our program is very intentional about getting her very active, and as active as she can," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A unique program&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ziebell said the program helps outpatient children learn their limits and can lead to them participating in physical education classes or sports, even amid their various ailments. The program consists of 36 sessions in three months and then patients graduate with the confidence and training to exercise on their own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This program is unique because it is geared toward children, he said, adding that cardiac rehabilitation is mainstream for adult heart patients. Primary Children's is, however, one of the first facilities to adapt the program for young kids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ziebell said about 15 patients are currently involved in the program, in addition to others who have graduated over the last few years. The program is available at both Primary Children's locations in Utah and as a telemedicine program for children who can't easily travel to Utah or Salt Lake counties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The regularly assisted exercise teaches kids how to exercise independently, and hospital data and parent feedback show the program is making a difference, Ziebell said. It lays a foundation for other comprehensive heart programs to grow, and eventually, this process will be the standard of care like it is for adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They need to be kids, despite having a heart condition," he said. "If we're going to promote lifelong health we need to get these kids active very young."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;A health care provider checks Sienna Barton's heart at Primary Children's Hospital. She is one of the first heart patients to participate in the cardiac rehab program. (Photo: Intermountain Health)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pavlock said taking Sienna into the hall requires a "whole squad." They need two nurses to carry the ventricular assistance device, or artificial heart, and her medications in an IV bag. Sienna was one of the first two patients to participate in the program, and they both started on the same day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It not only helps improve their physical health, but their mental health as well because they feel so strong after completing the program that they go out and they're able to do it. They're not scared to exercise anymore. … They're living their lives," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ready for a transplant&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barton wants her family to live together again, but that won't happen until her daughter gets a heart transplant — eliminating the need for an artificial heart — and goes through a recovery process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said Sienna is happy at the hospital but isn't able to interact with many other kids because of the need to keep all of the children there healthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To get her involved in exercise the team uses Taylor Swift, hanging a Bluetooth speaker on the IV pole, and takes her outside to throw rocks in the pond. Barton said they try to help her discover the outdoors, which is limited for Sienna because of the need for staff to help her move.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"One time we found a ladybug, and for months after, they would take her out there to the grassy area, and they would build a house for the ladybug," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barton said the therapy has strengthened her body and kept her from being sedentary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The strength is already there and the fight is already in there, the bite is in there — she's ready. The spiciness is there, and all you need is that new heart and the rest of the body will teach it how to go, teach it how to keep up," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The Barton family poses for a photo. Sienna Barton, 4, is one of the first heart patients at Primary Children's Hospital to participate in the cardiac rehab program. (Photo: Michelle Paul)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because of Sienna's blood type, and how far Salt Lake City is from most of the large population centers she is one of only a few children in the U.S. who has waited for a heart for this long at the highest status of need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barton encouraged people who hear her daughter's story to talk about organ donation with their families now. She said making a decision now means one less decision for a family going through a hard time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She advocated for signing up to be an organ donor in college because of a friend with a heart condition, and now she will always be an advocate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It truly is such an incredible way to remember your little one and remember your loved ones and allow them to live on," Barton said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="kt_disclaimer"&gt;

The first dose is recommended at 12 to 15 months of age, with a second dose at 4 to 6 years. Your healthcare  provider can help you determine if early vaccination is appropriate. “Although measles was declared eliminated in the U.S. in 2000, international travel continues to present a risk. Staying up to date on vaccinations helps protect both individuals and the  broader community,” added Dr. Persse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-3 bYFsJw cuqaEv article-text"&gt;HHD is actively monitoring the situation and urges anyone who develops symptoms of measles to contact their healthcare provider before visiting a medical facility to prevent potential exposure to others.

                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON — The Houston Health Department on Sunday confirmed that an infant in the city has been diagnosed with the &lt;a href="/measles"&gt;measles&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HHD said the unvaccinated child was exposed to the virus during international travel. The child was hospitalized, but has since been discharged and is recovering at home.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Editor's note: Video above is from a KHOU 11 question and answer special on measles posted earlier this month&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officials emphasized that this case is not related to the &lt;a href="/article/news/health/measles/measles-outbreak-texas-2025-update/285-b4558673-e187-4029-b857-b2c2e8d6ac87" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;outbreak in West Texas&lt;/a&gt;, in which there are hundreds of reported cases.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to HHD, this is the city's third case of measles in the city in 2025. In January, two other unrelated cases were reported in Houston.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To prevent the measles from spreading, Houston health officials encourage vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The best way to protect yourself and your loved ones from the measles is through vaccination," said Houston Chief Medical Officer David Persse. "The MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella) vaccine is safe, highly effective, and remains the best defense against this potentially severe disease."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measles is a respiratory virus that can survive in the air for up to two hours. Up to nine out of 10 people who are unvaccinated will get the virus if exposed, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There has been one measles-related death reported in Texas. The patient was a school-aged child who lived in the outbreak area in the South Plains. The child was not vaccinated and had no known underlying conditions.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

Shaker cup in hand, a classmate extolled the virtues of the supplement, promising that a tiny scoop of powder taken daily would make us both “superjacked.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;The unscientific advice fit into a broader &lt;i&gt;Jersey Shore&lt;/i&gt;-mentality of the time. Creatine was an accessory as vital to the lifestyle as tanning beds or wearing two polo shirts at the same time. Culturally, the supplement is only recently shedding that alignment with bro culture, in part because of changing ideas around body image and muscle mass, but also because of a renewed interest online in the benefits of creatine for both physical and cognitive health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;Creatine became popular in the early nineties with the discovery that top Olympics athletes were using the supplement at the Barcelona games. Since that time, it’s been called one of the most researched &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2048496/"&gt;supplements in the world&lt;/a&gt;, with more than 500 peer-reviewed publications evaluating its effects on the body according to PubMed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-ad--base l-media"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;A 2021 review from the &lt;a href="https://jissn.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12970-021-00412-w"&gt;Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition&lt;/a&gt; noted that the use of creatine resulted in less muscle damage, inflammation and muscle soreness in response to training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;We’re also starting to see promising research about creatine and cognitive benefits. A 2023 study pointed toward the supplement’s potential in treating memory loss and even Alzheimer’s (though for the latter, human trials are still forthcoming).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;Fitting creatine into your daily routine is simple and inexpensive. Here is a breakdown of the supplement and why you may want to try it, even if you don’t regularly go to the gym.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;&lt;b&gt;What is creatine and what does it do?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-ad--base l-media"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;Creatine is a substance we all produce naturally. It’s also found in meat and seafood. Supplementing our natural creatine aides in the recovery process for our muscles, helping to increase mass and strength. Practically, that means lifting heavier things for more reps. A 2019 study from the Journal of Clinical Medicine spoke about how the supplement can also assist in maintaining muscle &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6518405/"&gt;as we age&lt;/a&gt;, decreasing the risk of falls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;“It’s something that I like to talk about with my clients because it’s an easy benefit toward their goals, whether that’s body composition or just feeling better in their bodies,” said &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/jeremy.fernandes6/"&gt;Jeremy Fernandes&lt;/a&gt;, a health coach with &lt;a href="https://procoach.app/jeremy-fernandes?fbclid=PAZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAAaZPatIm6IbdrWw3iB-L2nRzJ9SZX_yFgHNETEkrihA2iWhgDnWLCDVGcyo_aem_mJyav96s7Ow5MkLW-tkMNA"&gt;Precision Nutrition&lt;/a&gt;. “It lets us do more high intensity work and add additional volume to that intensity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;While creatine has definitely improved my workouts, I’ve also found it helpful with concentration and brain fog. A review from &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0531556518300263?via%3Dihub"&gt;Experimental Gerontology&lt;/a&gt; touted the supplement’s cognitive benefits, showing improvements in overall memory and potential improvements in brain function during stressful situations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;“There does seem to be some benefit for memory recall in stressful environments,” Fernandes said. “It’s been shown to be specifically helpful in situations that are highly cognitively stressful, or where sleep deprivation is present.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-ad--base l-media"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;The effects of creatine on women’s health are less studied than its impact on men. But a&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7998865/"&gt; 2021 paper&lt;/a&gt; showed use by premenopausal females was effective for improving strength and exercise performance. Many postmenopausal females also experienced benefits, particularly in relation to skeletal muscle size and function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to use creatine&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;Most commercial creatine comes in a powder you can add to water, juice or a shake. When starting out the goal is to saturate your muscles; that’s how you’ll start seeing the most benefits. To do that you can “load” by taking 20 grams a day for a week. If you’re fine waiting a little longer to get results, take three to five grams daily for about a month. The maintenance dose after that is also three to five grams daily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;Compared with many other supplements, it’s affordable. A five-gram dose runs between 35 and 70 cents depending on the brand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-ad--base l-media"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why does creatine (unfairly) get a bad rap?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;Creatine is sometimes conflated with steroids because the supplement has been associated with increased strength and muscle growth. While creatine is effective for gains, it does not produce results anywhere near the rate of testosterone or anabolics. Creatine is also safe to use as long as your kidneys are working fine. The major side effects when starting out are potential gas and bloating, which reduces with use. Most people hesitant to use creatine avoid it because they’re worried about looking bigger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;“The question that comes up often is … ‘Won’t I just gain a bunch of weight, gain a bunch of water or get really bulky?’” says Toronto based trainer and nutrition coach &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/coachmegs.me/"&gt;Megan&lt;/a&gt; Dancey. “But it can aid in attacking our fitness routines a little bit better and get us into an environment where we can then get the results we want.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;Dancy has suggested clients use creatine as part of a supplementation routine. When included in a well-rounded plan, it can have huge benefits toward body composition, recovery and mental alertness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;“If you’re exploring different supplements to help you in your fitness routine, it hits the top of my list along with protein.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-ad--base l-media"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Globe and Mail</author><pubDate>Sun, 16 Mar 2025 19:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiuwFBVV95cUxQYlJYS0tVRVNEemZaZWtFUlJheTV1Tl9oUFJLTXRkS2pvTi1aQkM5eWJsTm50SGpoUi05ZC0zUkhlZHp0WkUyYUN3OWk0NnRuX3BlSEl5N1ZkdXZvMmliRE5NVF9XanA3UjFkbjJJdEMzTFliREdOY0tJS195cklFZmNMQjZCS09Gay1kbTBQWmw3alA3SzU0WTlrb1Z2eGxNa0JVLXJnREhfWnk2Z2Ffbzg2ekFNd2Z1aUZ3</guid></item><item><title>US influencer hospitalized after 'high-protein' carnivore diet leads to this dangerous condition - The Times of India</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carnivore diet, the latest wellness fad of the year, is being enthusiastically tried by weight loss aspirants across all age groups, thanks to its growing popularity among influencers who are vouching for its myriad benefits. Proponents of this eating pattern say it helps them stay alert and energetic. Many claim their skin issues are resolved, courtesy the diet. Considering the diet's high protein appeal, many end up losing pesky pounds, which has added to its followers. Carnivore diet includes meat, poultry, eggs, seafood, fish, and some dairy products. It restricts all vegetables, fruits, grains, legumes, seeds, and nuts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the diet also has a problematic side to it which could land people in trouble. A Dallas-based content creator - Eve Catherine shared her experience in a TikTok video and informed her followers how following carnivore diet landed her in a hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the video, she shared that she was eating two or three eggs for breakfast, high-protein yogurt for lunch, and a New York strip steak for dinner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At first her doctor during her annual check-up noticed high protein levels in her urine. However, she did not think much of it. Soon, she landed in hospital after getting shocker one morning. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I literally woke up one day and I was peeing straight blood,” the 23-year-old influencer recalled. She admitted that she was once “addicted to protein.” She was then put on morphine at the hospital and passed a kidney stone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What went wrong&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What she experienced was due to high protein levels in her body. According to Mayo Clinic, high protein diets can worsen kidney function in people with kidney disease which means the body is not able to filter protein waste products efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A single-patient study published in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition discussed how a patient who followed the diet after coming to know about it from YouTube went through kidney complications. The 68 year-old man lost two-stone while only eating meat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tests performed a year after revealed the earliest stages of forming the painful crystals. Experts said he was at an elevated risk of all three types of major kidney stones - those formed of calcium oxalate, calcium phosphate, and uric acid, and these were now at 'levels consistent with stone growth'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After being convinced by doctors to quit the diet, an examination after one year revealed him to be kidney stone free. Eating foods rich in fibre can help feed good bacteria in the gut, thereby hindering kidney stone formation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other risks of high protein diets include constipation, headaches, foul breath, increased risk of heart disease among others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After facing the consequences of the diet, The Tiktoker couldn't help but say - “the carnivore diet is so stupid."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts have warned about the inflammatory nature of carnivore diet and how it could speed up aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Don’t eat too much protein, OK?” Eve Catherine said. “Don’t neglect your fiber intake.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Pictures courtesy: iStock)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Correct diet can help safeguard against acute kidney injury: Research&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Sun, 16 Mar 2025 18:05:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>Another pet food brand recalls cat food for bird flu risk - WKRC TV Cincinnati</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="index-module_storyColumn__EZ7G" id="js-Story-Content-0"&gt;&lt;p class="StoryTags-module_tagWrapperLine__Jfav"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="StoryText-module_storyText__FWhP"&gt;&lt;p&gt;CINCINNATI (WKRC) - Another pet food brand has issued a recall for cat food due to possible contamination from bird flu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In early March, &lt;a href="https://local12.com/news/nation-world/cat-food-recall-recalls-recalled-over-bird-flu-risk-hpai-h4n1-wild-coast-llc-should-be-discarded-immediately-cincinnati-consumer-dangerous-products-boneless-free-range-chicken-formula-health-risks-transmission-green-label-best-buy-date-raw-public-alert" target="_blank" title="https://local12.com/news/nation-world/cat-food-recall-recalls-recalled-over-bird-flu-risk-hpai-h4n1-wild-coast-llc-should-be-discarded-immediately-cincinnati-consumer-dangerous-products-boneless-free-range-chicken-formula-health-risks-transmission-green-label-best-buy-date-raw-public-alert" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;Wild Coast LLC recalled&lt;/a&gt; batches of their raw cat food for possibly leading to bird flu in pets.

&lt;p&gt;A Peruvian tourist in transit was barred from leaving Juan Santamaría International Airport upon arriving in Costa Rica because he lacked a yellow fever vaccination. Minister of Health Mary Munive clarified the policy amid growing confusion. “He planned a day visit to see a friend before flying onward. Transit passengers staying in the airport are exempt, but leaving—for sightseeing or otherwise—requires the vaccine. He was told, ‘Comply or stay,’ and chose to stay,” Munive said. The rule aims to protect Costa Rica, a tropical nation free of yellow fever, from imported cases.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a similar case, a Paraguayan citizen over 60 arrived to participate in San José’s annual book fair but was denied entry at the counter for lacking a vaccination certificate. “In South America, seniors over 60 are often exempt from the vaccine and don’t receive certificates. Without it, he couldn’t proceed, risking delays,” Munive explained. She noted Costa Rica is refining its rules—mandatory for travelers from Peru, Paraguay, Brazil, and other high-risk nations—amid regional differences.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The incidents spotlight a nationwide yellow fever vaccine shortage, worsened by global supply chain disruptions and rising cases in the Americas (14 reported in 2025 by PAHO/WHO). The Costa Rican Association of Travel Agencies (ACAV) and National Chamber of Tourism (&lt;a href="https://canatur.org/"&gt;Canatur&lt;/a&gt;) urged the Ministry to suspend the decree until doses are available. “The shortage makes compliance impossible, threatening travelers and our $4 billion tourism industry,” said Canatur’s Shirley Calvo. On March 11, 2025, the Ministry launched a &lt;a href="https://ticotimes.net/2025/03/10/costa-rica-fights-yellow-fever-with-border-vaccines-and-digital-records" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;border vaccination campaign &lt;/a&gt;and digital certificate system, but full resolution remains uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Munive stressed adaptability as Costa Rica balances public health and tourism. With thousands of annual visitors from risk zones, clear communication and vaccine access remain critical to avoid further disruptions.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="80" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm89ceu41001b3b724v5utygi@published"&gt;I live next to a nerdy early 30s guy, Kris, and his younger jock boyfriend, Karl. At first, I didn’t think much of them, but over the past few weeks, their relationship has turned into a total soap opera. Karl is this tall, muscular, macho dude. Kris is a great guy, but from what I can overhear, Karl treats him like garbage. They’re constantly arguing, and Karl has started bringing another guy over for loud, obnoxious sex almost every night.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="97" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm89ceu8x001c3b72qsl1s2fn@published"&gt;I have always considered myself straight. But lately … something’s changed. Hearing them has started to turn me on. I know it’s wrong, and I know I shouldn’t be getting involved, but I can’t stop thinking about it. The idea of Karl hearing &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt; with Kris is driving me crazy. I know it’s messed up, but the thought of “cucking” Karl, this super-masculine guy who seems to think he’s untouchable, is weirdly thrilling to me. Kris and I have flirted a few times in the hallway, and I know he likes me. I’m sure he’d be game.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="52" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm89ceudt001d3b72mbhmi6tu@published"&gt;There’s something about Karl’s arrogant confidence, his total dominance, that’s making me feel things I don’t understand. And the idea of getting one over on him by being with Kris is just … I can’t stop thinking about it. The more I hear them, the more obsessed I become with the idea.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="48" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm89ceuir001e3b72rc3kxkic@published"&gt;I know I shouldn’t get involved, but the temptation is overwhelming. What should I do? Is this just some weird fantasy I need to get out of my system, or is there something deeper going on here? I’ve never felt this way before, and it’s freaking me out.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="113" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm89ceuxf001h3b72zdch5evo@published"&gt;You’re right, you should not be getting involved. Inserting yourself (literally) into a soap opera will likely only beget more drama. Given the volatility of the Kris-Karl dynamic, and your suspicion that Karl is mistreating Kris, consider a possible outcome of you having sex with Kris: more mistreatment. Even worse, the scenario you envision is one in which Karl &lt;em&gt;hears&lt;/em&gt; you with Kris, which implies at least the possibility that you want to do this without Karl’s knowledge or consent ahead of time. Do you think someone who is already shitty to his boyfriend will take hearing his boyfriend get railed a wall away in stride? It’s possible, but the risks are great.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="114" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm89cev2a001i3b7248ngc4bo@published"&gt;The fact is that you do not know the terms of these dudes’ arrangement. Whether it seems fair or not, they may have a rule where only Karl gets to have outside sex. They may both need to be present. Maybe Kris isn’t allowed to bottom for anyone besides Karl. You would have to navigate the terms of their openness (if they are in fact open, which seems likely but is also unclear) with both of them in order for this to be ethical. You can’t cuck Karl without Karl’s consent, and if he is into it then you’d kind of be doing him a favor no matter how much you tear into Kris.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="63" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm89cev7a001j3b72yn2xb6ey@published"&gt;I say let this Kris-Karl cuck concept exist as a fantasy. If you’re curious about guys for real, there are plenty of gay couples who would gladly have a straight dude over to plow one or both of them. Go on a hook-up app, label yourself as a straight guy who wants to cuck a gay couple and watch the requests pour in.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="118" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm89cfszr00273b72vjr5xy6v@published"&gt;I am a 26-year-old male. One morning last week, I cut my hand while doing dishes at my girlfriend’s house. It was a small cut, so I called her while she was at work to ask if she had some Band-Aids. She told me they were in the bottom left side drawer of the bathroom vanity. There, on top of the box of Band-Aids, was a tube of vaginal itch cream (Vagisil). I put it back and checked the next day when getting another Band-Aid, and the tube had been turned. I checked the next day and it had been moved again. Same thing the following day. It seemed like she was using it on a daily basis.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="91" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm89cfszr00283b72diejt7ba@published"&gt;This wouldn’t normally be a concern, but after going for years without a case of jock itch, I have had two recent cases. A prescription from my doctor cleared it up, but it got me thinking: Am I “catching” something from her? We are exclusive, so we no longer use condoms. Should I be concerned about catching (I couldn’t think of a better term) something more serious? Is there reason to be alarmed she uses this stuff everyday? If there is a concern, how do I bring it up to her?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="171" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm89cfszs002b3b722mkmsth5@published"&gt;It’s very difficult to say for sure what’s going on in the absence of a known diagnosis for your girlfriend. But here are a few things we do know: Jock itch is absolutely contagious and can be contracted &lt;a href="https://www.webmd.com/men/causes-and-prevent-jock-itch"&gt;via skin-to-skin contact&lt;/a&gt;, including during sex. Jock itch is caused by a fungus (tinea cruris). &lt;a href="https://www.vagisil.com/product/regular-strength-anti-itch-creme"&gt;Vagisil, in its original-recipe form&lt;/a&gt;, is not an antifungal medication. Its main active ingredient is benzocaine, an anesthetic. If your girlfriend has jock itch, Vagisil may alleviate the pain, but it won’t clear it up. However, Vagisil does make &lt;a href="https://www.vagisil.com/products/yeast-infection-treatment"&gt;a line of yeast-infection treatments&lt;/a&gt; that contain miconazole nitrate, an antifungal that &lt;em&gt;is &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a618061.html"&gt;used to treat jock itch&lt;/a&gt; as well. (The fungus that causes yeast infections is Candida, typically Candida albicans. It can also itch and may result in a cottage cheese-like discharge.) My guess is that she’s using the plain, old anti-itch version to alleviate her pain without actually getting rid of the fungus. So the fungus persists and so does pain, which leads to further Vagisil use.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="91" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm89cfszs002c3b72a8z6hcza@published"&gt;So yes, the jock itch may have been transmitted from her to you. But, as you can see, this is something that is cleared up easily. I think it’s quite reasonable to tell your girlfriend, “Look, I had jock itch twice and I noticed that you have been using Vagisil. Do you think maybe you have jock itch, too?” If she isn’t already using an antifungal, then giving her this heads up will help mitigate her pain and allow her body to recover. As her boyfriend, you should be so helpful.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="105" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm89cfszs002d3b72inaz3hzz@published"&gt;Should you be concerned about something more serious? I mean, not based on the fact that your girlfriend may have jock itch alone, but sure, transmission is a possibility with partners. Viruses like HPV and herpes may be dormant or totally asymptomatic. When you’re having sex with someone, there’s always the risk of bacterial infections like syphilis and gonorrhea as well. Even in theoretically monogamous arrangements, sometimes people cheat, which can lead to infection risk. Trust is going to be key here, but I really don’t think a persistent case of jock itch is a good cause to become distrustful. Truly not a big deal.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="56" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm89cfszt002f3b725xuji8kk@published"&gt;I’m a 31-year-old gay man who was recently diagnosed with HSV-1: genital herpes caused by the cold sore virus. I honestly had no idea that you could get genital herpes by receiving oral sex from someone who has ever had a cold sore on their mouth (even if they don’t have one when you hook up).&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="54" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm89cfszt002g3b72uk0mo97g@published"&gt;My doctor told me that I don’t need to “walk around with a red H on my chest” and said that he does not think it’s necessary to tell sexual partners that I have HSV-1. He said that the risk of transmission is very low without symptoms, and that I just got very unlucky.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="44" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm89cfszt002h3b72p8jqnn4a@published"&gt;However, I feel uncomfortable with the idea of not telling someone about this, because there is technically a small risk of transmission. Unlike with HIV, you can’t take medication to prevent getting herpes, and taking herpes antivirals cannot suppress the virus to undetectable levels.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="69" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm89cfszt002i3b72k2p3p58y@published"&gt;I was recently chatting with a guy on Scruff for a couple days. Once the conversation turned towards meeting up, I told him that I had GHSV-1, that the risk of transmission was very low but not zero, and to feel free to read about it and let me know if he had any questions. He flipped out at me and said I wasted his time, and blocked me.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="75" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm89cfszt002j3b72e42b9r2q@published"&gt;I feel pretty down after this experience. Most people already have HSV-1 and have antibodies to it. But I feel like the stigma is too great to not tell this to sexual partners. At the same time, I sincerely doubt that anyone with cold sores on their mouth is telling sexual partners they could give them genital herpes. So, am I just making this way harder on myself than I need to by being honest?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="188" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm89cfszt002m3b72vbnk1mll@published"&gt;There is no real easy answer to this, as your letter suggests. If you think about the man-on-man hook-up app ecosystem, it is &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; rare for people to disclose any kind of herpes upfront, by which I mean in their profiles. It’s probably a bit more common in private chats, but still unusual, at least in my anecdotal experience. I can think of one or two guys who have mentioned it, out of what must be thousands that I’ve talked to through the years. It’s not like HIV in that respect, where there are plenty of guys who note their status in their profiles. Also, while inconvenient, sometimes painful, and occasionally responsible for complications, herpes is nowhere nearly as serious as HIV. You’re right, valacyclovir isn’t a magic bullet (though it does &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14702423/"&gt;significantly reduce the risk of transmission&lt;/a&gt;), but a key difference here is that if you don’t take herpes antiretrovirals, herpes in all likelihood isn’t going to kill you. The same cannot be said for HIV in the vast majority of cases. Herpes stigma is high, but its actual stakes on quality of life are much lower.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="189" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm89cfszt002n3b72xtsgqt41@published"&gt;Given the cultural vibe, you are putting yourself at a disadvantage by being honest (no one said that being ethical is easy!) You say it yourself in your letter: You feel uncomfortable with the idea of not telling someone about your herpes. And so, you should do what you think is right. For a lot of guys, the risk of contracting herpes is implicit and that’s why they don’t talk about it. Group/public sex is a major feature of modern urban gay culture, and in the age of PrEP, this activity is often done without physical barriers like condoms. I’ve never been to a sex party where I’ve heard the guys discussing their HSV or HPV status. It is assumed that possible contraction of these viruses, if it hasn’t happened already, goes with the territory. That doesn’t mean you need to fall into lockstep with the prevailing laissez faire attitudes of gay hook-up culture. You can be different and disclose and shoulder the rejection that may come with it. I bet you’ll encounter guys, unlike your Scruff near miss, who don’t care and will hook up with you anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="72" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm89cfszu002o3b72g83nne3b@published"&gt;Just one thing to keep in mind, though: According to herpes expert Anna Wald, a doctor and professor of medicine and epidemiology at University of Washington School of Medicine, &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2022/05/boyfriend-girlfriend-third-rules-relationship-questions.html"&gt;whom I have interviewed before for this column&lt;/a&gt;, “Transmission from genital HSV-1 is unusual, because genital HSV-1 does not reactivate very often.” So you’d be disclosing a &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; slight amount of risk. If that helps you sleep at night, though, go for it.&lt;/p&gt;

Another cat linked to Savage was diagnosed last month with H5N1, the medical designation for the disease, and had similar symptoms. A third city cat also linked to Savage products likely had bird flu but survived and it’s now too late to test for the infection, officials said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Savage co-founder Audrey Brady said the company was notified of the issue in February. In a statement she said “we are incredibly saddened” by the deaths and added the company issued a recall notice on February 17 after a customer in Colorado reported their cat had fallen ill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The product in question was then sent to the National Veterinary Services Laboratory in Ames, Iowa for virus isolation testing,” she said. “As a precautionary measure for our consumers, we initiated a market withdrawal while awaiting final test results.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Company and city officials said the poultry in question was part of a specific lot, code 11152026.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the current outbreak, bird flu has been detected in 48 flocks of birds across New York state. &lt;a href="https://agriculture.ny.gov/animals/poultry" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Seven of those detections&lt;/a&gt; occurred in live &lt;a href="https://gothamist.com/arts-entertainment/why-does-new-york-city-have-around-70-live-animal-markets" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;poultry markets&lt;/a&gt; in Brooklyn, the Bronx, Queens and Staten Island in March alone, according to the state Department of Agriculture and Markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those infections were reported after &lt;a href="https://gothamist.com/news/gov-hochul-shutters-nyc-downstate-live-bird-markets-due-to-avian-flu" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Gov. Kathy Hochul ordered&lt;/a&gt; several live poultry markets in New York City to shut down temporarily last month, following several previous detections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;City officials urged pet owners to keep cats indoors and to steer dogs clear of any dead animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Caroline Lewis contributed reporting. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Gothamist</author><pubDate>Sun, 16 Mar 2025 15:55:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqwFBVV95cUxQbHIyTmNkR25rVW1ZM0xHT0JMb2YxNUhua0hra2EzWXd6UEZuNUJrOS13eDk1MEVtemdaaVQxSDFSMEFNVVlFanM4Q3RWMnZNNmRBckRONXFVa1FtekJLWDZPb1NUbWNvcHlNc2ZNcjhKUnlJeHBRbk5oak9GOVk5WE5NZklnNTIwUWdOU0ZkZUdsb2pEdU84a25HaFdfUGRpSUlUSVR3UWtIaTA</guid></item><item><title>Flu cases are finally dropping in NY amid particularly nasty season - Gothamist</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimgFBVV95cUxNVlgtaU80UzgyMEtwOFJ3T1ZtSlRyTTdmelVJekwwVnM2c25uYjgweUkwQUdkNkhKRlhKTmk1dk9xamFWQno3M3cyOGdvZkhUQkEtOVh4aDFaSU5XUEpBRVBSN2FFckxaQ3loeGZJOGJSUWdydmllbHdaT09VUmZXUmNnM3JzTEJoblIzR0Q1OFpfWkRwZXFsQmpB?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="streamfield-paragraph rte-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flu season finally appears to be on its way out as cases begin to drop in New York, but it’s been a particularly nasty season and it’s unclear when exactly it will end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New York is not alone. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention categorized the 2024-25 season as the first “&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/2025-week-08.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;high-severity&lt;/a&gt;” flu season in seven years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the week ending March 1, New York labs ran more than 50,000 flu tests and &lt;a href="https://www.health.ny.gov/diseases/communicable/influenza/surveillance/2024-2025/flu_report_current_week.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;44% came back positive&lt;/a&gt;, a 25% decrease from the previous week, according to state Department of Health data. During the same week, 1,442 patients were also hospitalized for the flu, which represented a 23% drop from the previous week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the share of flu tests coming back positive at the beginning of March was still higher than at the same time last year, and the &lt;a href="https://nyshc.health.ny.gov/web/nyapd/new-york-state-flu-tracker" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;number of cases and hospitalizations&lt;/a&gt; has been up this season overall, according to the state data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The funny thing about flu is that it's different every year,” said Stephen Morse, an epidemiologist at Columbia University’s Mailman School of Public Health. “ Usually, it does correspond to holidays and travel, but then sometimes we'll see the flu come up in a peak, go down, and then there'll be another, usually smaller peak.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morse noted that the flu has rebounded after cases dropped off during the early years of the COVID-19 pandemic because people are no longer taking strict precautions around masking and social distancing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New York’s flu season started in mid-October this year and peaked at the end of January, with 54,737 cases in one week. The 2022-2023 flu season’s November peak came close to that figure, but state data shows cases dropped off more quickly than they have this time around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/why-flu-bad-2025-severity-vaccines-immunity-rcna194250" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Some public health experts say&lt;/a&gt; the current strains that are circulating may be to blame for the severity of this year's flu season, since they tend to spread more quickly and cause more severe symptoms than strains in prior years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Ravi Saksena, a pediatrician at South Slope Pediatrics, said at the height of this year’s flu season in January, “ we were surprised when [patients] weren't positive.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said the most important precaution to take to prevent infection is getting a flu shot at the beginning of the season. Although flu vaccines are not 100% effective, “ the shot really helps make sure that the illness is not as prolonged and not as bad,” Saksena said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year’s &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7406a2.htm#:~:text=Effectiveness%20against%20influenza%20A(H3N2,%2C%20U.S.%20Flu%20VE%20network)." rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;flu vaccines&lt;/a&gt; were 32% to 60% effective at preventing people under 18 from getting the flu and 63% to 78% effective at preventing hospitalization, according to data from the CDC. But only about &lt;a href="https://coronavirus.health.ny.gov/covid-19-and-influenza-vaccination-data" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;27% of New Yorkers&lt;/a&gt; got their flu shots this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Saksena said the range of symptoms associated with the flu can vary depending on which strain a patient catches. Symptoms typically include fever, fatigue, body aches, runny nose and sore throat, but can also come with problems such as nausea or vomiting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Antiviral medications for flu are optional, Saksena said. The CDC says they can be beneficial for those who are more vulnerable, including children under 2, adults over 65 and patients with asthma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Gothamist</author><pubDate>Sun, 16 Mar 2025 15:55:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimgFBVV95cUxNVlgtaU80UzgyMEtwOFJ3T1ZtSlRyTTdmelVJekwwVnM2c25uYjgweUkwQUdkNkhKRlhKTmk1dk9xamFWQno3M3cyOGdvZkhUQkEtOVh4aDFaSU5XUEpBRVBSN2FFckxaQ3loeGZJOGJSUWdydmllbHdaT09VUmZXUmNnM3JzTEJoblIzR0Q1OFpfWkRwZXFsQmpB</guid></item><item><title>Food Scientists Have Made Chocolate Healthier – Without Sacrificing Taste! - SciTechDaily</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMingFBVV95cUxONHU3M2dEb21HUWNUdTRzdndQUEJqT2NtRWdLQk8yWkpFeDVyMV9ERWpOWXlrN0tHZng0V1JwMFE5R1IwZ3hDd3BKempZRHpkN2ZnV2EzNy1lODlaYjN5eFRwN2FFSXRSVHFCYVBmZG4yWXVFbkotMzZiUkFqc2lHYURaV0k1WUJURkVRM3ZxUmxZX05EUXZFYy11MzdHQQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SciTechDaily</author><pubDate>Sun, 16 Mar 2025 15:12:21 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMingFBVV95cUxONHU3M2dEb21HUWNUdTRzdndQUEJqT2NtRWdLQk8yWkpFeDVyMV9ERWpOWXlrN0tHZng0V1JwMFE5R1IwZ3hDd3BKempZRHpkN2ZnV2EzNy1lODlaYjN5eFRwN2FFSXRSVHFCYVBmZG4yWXVFbkotMzZiUkFqc2lHYURaV0k1WUJURkVRM3ZxUmxZX05EUXZFYy11MzdHQQ</guid></item><item><title>I had just months to live after cancer diagnosis, the reason I'm still here should instil hope in everyone - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A father-of-one who had just months to live after being diagnosed with America's most common &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-4324d380-fb7f-11ef-866b-07b6fc3248df"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; has been cured thanks to an experimental treatment he received in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/mexico/index.html" id="mol-0ca6d880-fb93-11ef-89c8-4b52ae29f609" class=""&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In May 2023, Allen Rapert, now 62, was diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma — a type of&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13352967/How-does-melanoma-cancer-treatment-vaccine-work.html"&gt; skin cancer&lt;/a&gt; — that affects about 1million people in the US every year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors said the cancer was stage four, with a tennis ball-sized tumor below his eye that had eaten through his skull bone and was growing quickly into his brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They recommended surgery to cut out most of the tissue on the right side of his face, his nose and his right eye ball, which would have left him permanently disfigured.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He would also have had to undergo a course of chemotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Even then, doctors said they were not sure the cancer would be cured — with &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31587382/"&gt;studies suggesting&lt;/a&gt; only six percent of patients live four years or more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Fearing for his life and appearance, Mr Rapert decided — after an online search — to skip the surgery and instead opt for an experimental treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;He went for five rounds of the treatment in Mexico, and was declared cancer-free just seven months after his diagnosis.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pictured above is Allen Rapert, who suffered with a stage four skin cancer that formed a tennis ball-sized tumor under his right eye.

The swelling was said to be a sign the immune system was attacking the tumor&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I feel as though I am on the ground floor of changing cancer treatments forever,' the &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/missouri/index.html" id="mol-c04f2320-fb97-11ef-866b-07b6fc3248df"&gt;Missouri&lt;/a&gt; native told DailyMail.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'When someone's knocking on death's door, and you go from that to, "you're cured," it just doesn't seem medically possible.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mr Rapert was diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma, a type of skin cancer that affects the cells on the outer layer of the skin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is the second most common form of skin cancer behind basal cell carcinoma — which emerges in the deepest layer of the skin — and typically affects fair-skinned individuals, often appearing in frequently sun-exposed areas like the face, ears, neck and hands. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Just five percent of cases are diagnosed at stage four.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mr Rapert said he had symptoms of the cancer for about a year before he was diagnosed, after his right eye started struggling to close properly and had regular infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But it wasn't until he woke up one morning and found the eye had blurred vision that he went to doctors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;His symptoms, along with a lump below his eye prompted testing, which revealed the diagnosis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The cancer was about the size of a ping pong ball when it was first diagnosed, but after it was biopsied it started to grow rapidly, reaching the size of a tennis ball. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After hearing the original recommendations from doctor and wanting to get a second opinion, Mr Rapert sought treatment at the Williams Cancer Institute in California, which uses an experimental two-step method to treat cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the first stage, it uses pulsed electric field ablation — where short, intense pulses of electricity are fired into cancer cells, causing the cells to begin to die.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Then, weakened, the tumor is injected with up to 12 immunotherapy drugs, which help the immune system recognize cancer cells and launch an attack against them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Although it is US-based, the Institute administers its treatments in Mexico as it uses some immunotherapy drugs that are not approved in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mr Rapert was accepted as a patient by the Institute and flown to their center in Cabo in June 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He had three rounds of the treatment over five weeks, with his tumor shrinking by half.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After his first round of the treatment at the center, his face swelled significantly, which the doctors said was a sign his body was responding to the drugs and fighting the cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About a month after his third round of treatment, he was flown to the Institute's center in Mexico City where he had two further rounds of the treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Mr Rapert is pictured above following his cancer treatment, and after being declared cancer free&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In December 2023, just seven months after his initial diagnosis, scans showed his cancer had completely disappeared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He has had four scans a year ever since to check for cancer, and not one has detected a cancer cell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mr Rapert was thrilled and amazed with the results, and organized a cruise trip to the Caribbean to celebrate with his girlfriend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Jason Williams, who has pioneered the new treatment, told DailyMail.com: 'We know that injecting these drugs into tumors works really well. That is my experience and that is how we have used them in studies with mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'So, why is it the case that with humans we test it intravenously? Why are we treating human patients differently?'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In humans, immunotherapy drugs tend to be administered into the blood stream and circulated around the body rather than directly into the tumor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Williams says injecting them into the tumor would make them more effective, however, because it is more likely to show the immune system where the cancer is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Institute told DailyMail.com it has had an upwards of 85 percent success rate in treating advanced stage four cancers using its method.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is the third case of an advanced cancer being cleared by the Institute that DailyMail.com has reported, after a doctor&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13962537/scientist-cured-pancreatic-experimental-treatment.html"&gt; reversed his stage four pancreatic cancer&lt;/a&gt; in six months after being treated at the Institute and a professor &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13988951/florida-mother-terminal-breast-cancer-revolutionary-treatment.html"&gt;reversed her stage four breast cancer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Mr Rapert is pictured above while receiving the treatment.

&lt;p&gt;If you’re looking for a way to feel more energized, focused, and less distracted during the day, the solution might be simpler than you think—&lt;strong&gt;protein&lt;/strong&gt;. Yes, you read that right. Starting your morning with a breakfast packed with 30 grams of protein can completely change how you feel throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-5"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="code-block code-block-2"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="5777932750" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;


&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Why Protein Should Be Part of Your Morning Routine&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We all know that protein plays a critical role in our health. It helps build muscles, repair tissues, and produce essential enzymes and hormones. But did you know that &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/30-grams-of-protein-for-breakfast?fbclid=IwY2xjawJCAFxleHRuA2FlbQIxMAABHaQpE3TKma2VNkvUB4rRRrp62nphOg5TjUPk0SEvYyO3QXJwOrsXtDw7tA_aem_PcL9i5J6lqkFaorD8h3ESA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;protein is especially important for &lt;strong&gt;women&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;? It helps regulate hormones like &lt;strong&gt;estrogen&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;progesterone&lt;/strong&gt;, which are key to balancing mood and sleep cycles. A lack of protein can even disrupt hormonal levels, leading to fatigue, mood swings, and cravings.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Protein supports the body in building and repairing muscles, skin, and organs. It also helps in the production of enzymes and hormones that regulate metabolism and the immune system. Incorporating enough protein into your diet, particularly at breakfast, can ensure that you feel better and stay fuller for longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4788484402" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;How I Upped My Protein Intake&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Like many people, I used to start my day with something light—a boiled egg. But that only gave me 7 grams of protein, which is far from ideal. After realizing how important it was to have a more balanced meal, I decided to switch things up. Here’s how I now make sure to hit 30 grams every morning:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Omelet&lt;/strong&gt; made with three eggs, a cup of &lt;strong&gt;cottage cheese&lt;/strong&gt;, and a side of &lt;strong&gt;avocado&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;tomatoes&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;cucumbers&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Full-fat Greek yogurt&lt;/strong&gt; with flaxseeds, organic berries, and a tablespoon of &lt;strong&gt;almond butter&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;A delicious recipe: &lt;strong&gt;rolled oats&lt;/strong&gt; boiled in unsweetened &lt;strong&gt;almond milk&lt;/strong&gt;, mashed with half a banana, and topped with cinnamon, berries, and &lt;strong&gt;cottage cheese&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Each of these options gives me the protein boost I need to start the day strong. The oats with cottage cheese, although initially unconventional, became a surprise favorite after I tried it. The sweet and salty flavor combination is actually quite delightful!&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The Impact of a Protein-Packed Breakfast&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The results? Nothing short of amazing. From day one, I noticed a boost in &lt;strong&gt;energy&lt;/strong&gt;. No more mid-morning slumps or distractions from hunger. With 30 grams of protein in the morning, I’m fueled for several hours without feeling the urge to snack constantly. Plus, the clarity and &lt;strong&gt;focus&lt;/strong&gt; I’ve experienced at work have been remarkable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4788484402" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Eating a protein-rich breakfast isn’t just about keeping hunger at bay; it also brings a sense of calm into my day. The &lt;strong&gt;peace of mind&lt;/strong&gt; I now have when tackling tasks at work has been transformative. Rather than worrying about when my next snack will be, I can stay present and engaged throughout the morning.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Why Protein is Especially Important for Women&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Protein is crucial for regulating hormones like &lt;strong&gt;estrogen&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;progesterone&lt;/strong&gt;, two hormones that influence everything from mood to sleep. For women, protein can also help balance these hormones, keeping things in check, which is vital for overall well-being. Insufficient protein intake can lead to hormonal imbalances, leaving you feeling fatigued, moody, or even more prone to cravings.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Keeping Protein in Your Routine&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s not just about what you eat at breakfast—it’s about making protein a staple of your routine. By ensuring that you get between &lt;strong&gt;28 and 32 grams of protein&lt;/strong&gt; each morning, your body will benefit from increased &lt;strong&gt;focus&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;energy&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;calm&lt;/strong&gt; that lasts well into the afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4788484402" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Try incorporating 30 grams of protein into your breakfast and see how it transforms your day. From better focus to more energy, this simple change could be just what you need to conquer your mornings!&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

A mostly new cast of guests flock to Thailand’s Koh Samui to stay at the show’s namesake luxury spa and wellness sanctuary. Here, spirituality and a possible whodunnit are served up to loyal fans of the beloved comedy-drama series. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This season begins similarly to others, with plenty of intrigue, leaving behind a string of mysteries about who died and how. The show opened with gunshots and a dead body, this time floating face down in a lotus pond. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;As storylines are introduced, a surprising theme running throughout this season is the frequent mention of lorazepam, a prescription medication used to &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/anxiety-treatment" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;treat anxiety&lt;/a&gt; and certain types of insomnia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Victoria Ratliff, played by Parker Posey, whose Southern drawl brings a distinctive ring to the word “lorazepam,” can’t seem to get through the day without popping these anti-anxiety pills like candy, sometimes downing them with white wine at dinner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her overuse of the pills leaves her slurring her words, zoning out, and dozing off at the dinner table. At one point in episode 4 (which was released on March 9), Victoria’s daughter Piper exclaims, “You don’t have enough lorazepam to get through one week at a wellness spa?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this episode, Victoria’s husband Timothy (played by Jason Isaacs) steps into lorazepam misuse territory to cope with a work-related scandal that could ruin his reputation. While attending a yacht party with their three children, he steals Victoria’s prescription bottle from her bag, drinks a few glasses of what looks like whiskey and becomes incoherent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re wondering about this drug and whether it’s safe for anxiety, read on. We’ll break down how the drug is meant to be used, the main risks, and other ways to manage your anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/drugs/lorazepam-oral-tablet" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;Lorazepam&lt;/a&gt; is the generic name for the prescription medication Ativan. It belongs to a class of drugs called &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/bipolar-disorder/benzodiazepines" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;benzodiazepines&lt;/a&gt;, which also include: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Valium&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Xanax&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Halcion&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Klonopin&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Lorazepam is a commonly prescribed &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/anxiety-drugs" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;medication for anxiety&lt;/a&gt;. It’s also used to treat panic attacks and can be used for insomnia,” said &lt;a href="https://www.providence.org/doctors/psychiatry/ca/santa-monica/david-merrill-1902923410" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;David Merrill&lt;/a&gt;, MD, PhD, a geriatric psychiatrist at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, CA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The drug works by slowing the activity in the brain, which promotes relaxation in the body and a reduction in anxious thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, “the first-line treatment [for anxiety] is typically antidepressants like SSRIs [antidepressants], plus &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/mental-health/talk-therapy/" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;psychotherapy&lt;/a&gt;,” Merrill told Healthline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Something like &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/anxiety/cbt-for-anxiety" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;cognitive behavioral therapy&lt;/a&gt; or mindfulness-based stress reduction — where you get a better understanding of what’s driving your anxieties and how to manage the anxiety when it comes up, versus just popping a pill like is done on a TV show.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.providence.org/doctors/internal-medicine/ca/tustin/victoria-leigh-1619372265" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;Victoria L. Leigh&lt;/a&gt;, DO, FACOI, an internal medicine specialist with Providence St. Joseph Hospital in Orange, CA, said in certain cases, benzodiazepines may be used first, such as with anxiety experienced by cancer patients and hospice or palliative care patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lorazepam may also be used for short-term anxiety related to a medical procedure, she said, such as when people experience panic symptoms in the confined space of an MRI machine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, because benzodiazepines have more severe side effects, including a risk of dependence, SSRIs are often recommended first for generalized anxiety disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Therapy can also benefit people by teaching them to notice internal physiological sensations such as racing heartbeat, shortness of breath, numbness and tingling. These are a normal part of the body’s stress response, said Merrill, not something that is dangerous or harmful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you learn how to counteract those sensations when they come up, whether by taking a deep breath or taking a break from what you are doing, you can keep them from becoming a full-blown panic attack,” Merrill said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some people can manage their anxiety without medication, using therapy alone. However, “with more severe cases of anxiety, we see the best outcomes with a combination of meds and therapy, at least over the short-term,” Merrill noted. “Then sometimes people can taper off the medications when their anxiety is under better control.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;When used as prescribed, lorazepam can cause the following side effects:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;drowsiness&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;dizziness&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;tiredness&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;weakness&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;unsteadiness&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;nausea&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;diarrhea or constipation&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;appetite changes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;restlessness&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;blurred vision&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;changes in sex drive or ability&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;More serious problems, such as life threatening breathing problems, sedation, or coma, can occur if lorazepam is used alongside &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/opioids-and-related-disorders" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;opioid medications&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/pain-relief/codeine-vs-hydrocodone" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;codeine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/pain-relief/oxycodone-vs-oxycontin" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;oxycodone&lt;/a&gt;, and tramadol. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drinking alcohol or using certain illegal drugs alongside lorazepam can also increase these risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Benzodiazepines are generally safe when used as directed,” said Merrill, “but they have the potential to be habit forming, so you can become physiologically or psychologically dependent on them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who are using illegal drugs or other substances should not use lorazepam. People with a history of &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/addiction/alcohol" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;alcohol dependence&lt;/a&gt; or abuse should not use lorazepam unless recommended by their doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Because lorazepam is short-acting, its onset is faster, making &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/mental-health/is-addiction-a-mental-illness" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;addiction&lt;/a&gt; more likely,” Leigh told Healthline. In addition, “withdrawals from this medication are more abrupt than the longer-acting medications in this family.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once dependence occurs, “if lorazepam is stopped suddenly, &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/anxiety/withdraw-from-benzodiazepines/" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;withdrawal symptoms&lt;/a&gt; can lead to seizures, altered [thoughts], and can be fatal,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lorazepam and other benzodiazepines can cause &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/addiction" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;physical dependence&lt;/a&gt; and withdrawal symptoms, even when taken as directed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The severity of withdrawal symptoms depend upon the dose you are taking, how long you’ve been taking the drug, other sedating drugs you are taking, and other factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;agitation&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;poor memory&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;insomnia&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;anxiety&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;panic attacks&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;irritability&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;headache&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;muscle fatigue&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;weakness&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;tremor&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;seizures&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Merrill said other signs of lorazepam dependence include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;needing to fill your prescription early&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;using the drug above the amounts or more often than recommended by your doctor&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;having to use someone else’s pills because you ran out early&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;using the drug alongside alcohol in order to manage your &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/anxiety-symptoms" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;anxiety symptoms&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;neglecting your responsibilities at work or in your personal life&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are experiencing physical dependence or if you had withdrawal symptoms when you tried to stop taking lorazepam, ask your doctor about tapering your dose. Tapering means taking smaller doses over the course of a few or several weeks until you can safely stop the drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many non-medication options have been shown to help relieve anxiety symptoms. Some of these may include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Focusing on &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/anxiety-exercises" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;exercise&lt;/a&gt; can also help to balance the ‘&lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/mental-health/fight-flight-freeze" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;fight or flight&lt;/a&gt;’ nervous system response that drives anxiety-related feelings,” said Leigh. “Reduction in &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/alcohol/effects-on-body" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;alcohol consumption&lt;/a&gt; and focusing on &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/balanced-diet" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;a balanced diet&lt;/a&gt; can also impact the ‘gut-brain axis’ and can improve mental health as well.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This part of the nervous system controls unconscious processes such as breathing, heartbeat and digestion. It’s also in charge of keeping us safe through the body’s fight, flight, fawn and freeze responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Understanding the role of the nervous system really shifts the paradigm from ‘I’m broken,’ to seeing that your symptoms make sense when put into the context of basic biological needs, your past trauma history, and how that gets stored in your body,” said Armstrong, who is based near Washington, D.C.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;When viewed through the lens of the nervous system, anxiety symptoms are a survival response, one that makes sense in the context of the human body and a person’s current and past experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other factors can also contribute to anxiety, such as sleep deprivation, being overstressed or over-caffeinated, suffering from micronutrient deficiencies, or lacking connection to other people and community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In her practice, Armstrong teaches clients two types of tools for managing their anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;First are tools that people can use in the moment if they are feeling anxious or having a panic attack. This includes visual orienting (slowly looking around your space), biting into a lemon, and certain kinds of breathing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;These help people move up what Armstrong refers to as the autonomic nervous system ladder — away from the sympathetic activation response (also known as fight or flight mode) toward a state of calm and connection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other group of tools helps reduce people’s anxiety symptoms long-term. Part of this proactive approach is helping people understand what might be contributing to their anxiety symptoms, including: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;past trauma&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;current &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/stress" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;life stressors&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;lifestyle habits&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;relationships&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;micronutrient deficiencies&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;health conditions (i.e., &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/hyperthyroidism" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;thyroid issues&lt;/a&gt; or hormone imbalance)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once clients have mapped out these factors, Armstrong asks: “What feels meaningful, and what feels accessible for you to take on right now?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Armstrong said there’s a time and a place for the use of anti-anxiety medications, she empowers clients by educating them about how their bodies work and giving them tools to manage their anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This approach can also pave the way for deeper &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/do-i-need-therapy/" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;work with a therapist&lt;/a&gt;, whether it’s talk therapy, &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/mental-health/shadow-work/" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;shadow work&lt;/a&gt;, or somatic parts (aka inner child) work. If the nervous system is well regulated, therapy is often more productive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, “the approach I use gives you an entire new framework for understanding yourself, and navigating your world and your symptoms in a way that is not associated with brokenness,” Armstrong told Healthline. “There’s also more space for compassion and curiosity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Season 3 of the HBO series “The White Lotus,” some characters appear to pop lorazepam like candy. This prescription drug is used to treat anxiety, panic attacks, and insomnia due to anxiety or situational stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies show that benzodiazepines such as lorazepam are effective for treating both the physical and psychological symptoms of anxiety. However, antidepressant SSRIs are more commonly used first because they have a lower risk of severe side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lorazepam carries a risk of dependence and potential for misuse. This drug can also cause life threatening breathing problems, sedation, or coma when used alongside &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/opioids-list" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;opioid pain relievers&lt;/a&gt;, alcohol, or certain illegal drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Healthline</author><pubDate>Sun, 16 Mar 2025 14:20:45 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihwFBVV95cUxNVzRFcDNIMWRWYnZaR094QzBtejU1cGREV1pNSGZldGVSMUZHQ0lCNWhFYzF0ckh6Vk1JZHJjWE1ZemFIWmcwc2RuMlVDY3lHZ2NWV21nMGNldlI4d3JJZEtpbDU5SEV6Mzl4XzJwc29hbmtFUVdHLVkycklWaW9CVjhpRW1jV28</guid></item><item><title>Kolkata Woman Diagnosed With Human Coronavirus HKU1—Symptoms And Risks To Watch Out For - Times Now</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_11eW" id="progressBarContainer_0"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_2F9L _1WiC" id="119078362"&gt;&lt;div class="sBre _3NUG"&gt;&lt;div class="_3lDd"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://static.tnn.in/thumb/msid-119078914,thumbsize-45840,width-1280,height-720,resizemode-75/119078914.jpg" alt="Kolkata Woman Diagnosed With Human Coronavirus HKU1—Symptoms And Risks To Watch Out For" title="Kolkata Woman Diagnosed With Human Coronavirus HKU1—Symptoms And Risks To Watch Out For"&gt;&lt;div class="_39Jh"&gt;&lt;div class="_24EZ"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kolkata Woman Diagnosed With Human Coronavirus HKU1—Symptoms And Risks To Watch Out For (Image Credits: iStock)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class=" _2k5A _1_01"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_3XO4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="_1884"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="_1884"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 45-year-old woman from Garia, Kolkata, has been diagnosed with &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="/topic/human-coronavirus-hku1"&gt;human coronavirus HKU1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; (HCoV-HKU1) and is receiving treatment at a private hospital in South Kolkata. She had been suffering from a fever, cough, and cold for the past 15 days, but doctors say her condition is stable. While this virus is not as well-known as COVID-19, it can still cause respiratory infections. Health experts say there is no need to panic, but it’s important to be aware of the symptoms and risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="_1884"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1884"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What Is Human Coronavirus HKU1?&lt;/h2&gt;Human coronavirus HKU1 (HCoV-HKU1) belongs to the Betacoronavirus family, the same group that includes the SARS and MERS viruses. However, unlike SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19, HKU1 is generally associated with milder respiratory illnesses. The virus primarily affects the upper respiratory tract, causing symptoms similar to the common cold, though it can sometimes lead to more serious lung infections like pneumonia or bronchiolitis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1884"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1884"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Symptoms of Human Coronavirus HKU1&lt;/h2&gt;Most cases of HCoV-HKU1 resemble regular flu-like illnesses and include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1884"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1884"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1884"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Runny nose or nasal

severe cases: shortness of breath, pneumonia, or bronchitis&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1884"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1884"&gt;While mild cases resolve on their own, senior citizens, young children, and those with weakened immune systems may experience more severe complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1884"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1884"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Who Is at Risk?&lt;/h2&gt;Though human coronavirus HKU1 is not as widely discussed as COVID-19, certain groups are more vulnerable to its effects:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1884"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="_1884"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;Senior citizens (above 60).&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="_1884"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1884"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Infants and young children.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1884"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1884"&gt;&lt;li&gt;People with chronic lung diseases such

diabetes or heart disease.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1884"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1884"&gt;For healthy adults, HCoV-HKU1 usually causes mild symptoms similar to a seasonal cold, but those with weakened immune systems may require hospitalization if the infection progresses to pneumonia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1884"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1884"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How Does It Spread?&lt;/h2&gt;Like other respiratory viruses, human coronavirus HKU1 spreads through:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1884"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="_1884"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;Direct contact with infected respiratory droplets (e.g., coughing or sneezing)&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="_1884"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1884"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Touching contaminated surfaces and then touching the face, mouth, or nose&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1884"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1884"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Close contact with an infected person&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1884"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1884"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to Protect Yourself&lt;/h2&gt;While there is no specific vaccine or antiviral treatment for human coronavirus HKU1, following basic hygiene and preventive measures can help reduce the risk of infection:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1884"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1884"&gt;- Wash hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1884"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1884"&gt;- Wear a mask in crowded or high-risk areas&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1884"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1884"&gt;- Avoid close contact with people showing symptoms of respiratory infections&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1884"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1884"&gt;- Sanitize frequently touched surfaces like doorknobs, mobile phones, and countertops&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1884"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1884"&gt;- Cover your mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing to prevent droplet spread&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1884"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1884"&gt;- Boost immunity by eating a balanced diet, staying hydrated, and getting enough rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1884"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1884"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Should You Be Worried?&lt;/h2&gt;Doctors treating the Kolkata patient have assured that her infection is an isolated case and does not indicate an outbreak. While human coronavirus HKU1 is not new, it is rarely tested for because its symptoms closely resemble other seasonal respiratory infections. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1884"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="_1884"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Get &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.timesnownews.com/latest-news"&gt;Latest News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; Live on Times Now along with Breaking News and Top Headlines from &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.timesnownews.com/health"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; and around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times Now</author><pubDate>Sun, 16 Mar 2025 14:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>Deep learning uncovers gene targets and potential drugs to slow brain aging - Medical Xpress</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihAFBVV95cUxOS3E4alR1VWcxRURBY3JhTUJrdkRIdkVRcUpHRGNYNTN2ZG9zUDAwdEtOMFAxVGR2WVNaNDgzY2NZajJSMVBvQVBFYXFjbzk3LWVpZ2JVNWRwSTBqSTlsc01YOG9veGtfZS0tWXh1Z3lPVkZhY3UzUE1CQ0xfd19zWTlGZXM?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="article-byline text-low"&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adr3757" target="_blank"&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; reported in &lt;i&gt;Science Advances&lt;/i&gt;, scientists analyzed MRI data stored at the UK Biobank and identified seven genes responsible for fast biological brain aging and 13 existing drugs that can target those genes.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Slowing the aging process is a powerful strategy to prevent many diseases and enhance longevity. Previous research has suggested that the ability to delay aging by even 2% could result in $7.1 trillion in health care savings in less than half a century. Over the years, it has become evident that the brain aging pattern significantly impacts overall human aging, as it is responsible for the rise in the risk of neurodegeneration and decline in both physical and cognitive health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A crucial parameter in brain health research is the brain age gap (BAG), which is the difference between a person's estimated biological brain age and their chronological age. In other words, the BAG measures how old a person's brain appears on MRI or other brain age measurement techniques compared to their actual age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brain age gap is also a reliable biomarker (or proxy) for studying brain health. A larger BAG is often seen in individuals with brain disorders like Alzheimer's, demyelination, and schizophrenia and is also linked to lower cognitive test scores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the effects of the BAG are well explored, identifying the factors driving the brain's aging process remains a challenge. Genes are known to play a crucial role in shaping how the brain ages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this study, researchers used deep learning models trained on MRI scans, lifestyle data, health records, and genetic information from nearly 39,000 UK Biobank participants—averaging 64 years old, with an equal gender distribution—to pinpoint &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/specific+genes/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;specific genes&lt;/a&gt; that contribute to a widening BAG.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;Their findings uncovered that seven genes (MAPT, TNFSF12, GZMB, SIRPB1, GNLY, NMB, and C1RL) were promising targets for brain aging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 3D-ViT model accurately predicted the biological brain age of the participants by analyzing key signatures in their MRI scans. Researchers used saliency map analysis, a technique that highlights the most influential areas in an image or dataset, to identify the brain regions critical for brain age estimation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings pointed to the lentiform nucleus, a region of the brain responsible for cognition such as attention and working memory, and the posterior limb of the internal capsule, which connects many parts of the brain to the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/cerebral+cortex/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;cerebral cortex&lt;/a&gt;—the brain's outer layer that controls for thinking, memory, and learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By combining insights on specific gene targets, &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/brain+regions/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;brain regions&lt;/a&gt; linked to aging, and existing &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/clinical+trial+data/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;clinical trial data&lt;/a&gt;, the researchers identified 13 drugs and supplements, including hydrocortisone, testosterone, diclofenac, and metformin, that can be repurposed to slow down brain aging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers noted that the genetic basis of aging uncovered in this study can facilitate the development of new drugs to slow brain aging and improve overall health. However, the results of this study were obtained from a population of a specific region. More research needs to be conducted across diverse populations to evaluate the true extent of these findings.&lt;/p&gt;

High cholesterol or hypercholesterolemia is typified by elevated cholesterol levels in the blood - a waxy substance necessary for building cells, hormones and synthesising vitamin D.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, an excess of cholesterol can heighten the risk of cardiovascular diseases including heart disease, heart attacks, and strokes. Yet, embracing a particular fatty fruit could prove transformative, minus any increase to your waistline. This insight emerges from a study that suggests eating an avocado every day for six months can effectively reduce high cholesterol levels.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The researchers noted that this practice decreased cholesterol without causing fat to amass in undesirable areas such as the liver or abdomen. The study was conducted in 2022 and published in the Journal of the American Heart Association, under the leadership of Professor Penny Kris-Etherton from Penn State University.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Professor Kris-Etherton shared her conclusions: "While the avocados did not affect belly fat or weight gain, the study still provides evidence that avocados can be a beneficial addition to a well-balanced diet."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She further remarked: "Incorporating an avocado per day in this study did not cause weight gain and also caused a slight decrease in LDL cholesterol, which are all important findings for better health."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The research is praised as the most comprehensive to date on the health benefits of avocados. In a six-month study with 923 participants, half were tasked with consuming avocados daily while the other half did not.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Those who ate avocados showed reduced levels of LDL cholesterol.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class="in-article-image" data-mod="image" data-orientation="landscape" data-tmdatatrack="inline-widget" data-tmdatatrack-articleid="31211310" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, these findings are disputed by some experts. NutritionFacts.org has pointed out that any decrease in "bad" cholesterol could be attributed to a diminished intake of animal fats, rather than the avocados themselves, as they may not have enough LDL cholesterol to be impactful.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Still, regardless of the controversy, avocados are indisputably packed with nutrients such as folate, magnesium, and phosphorus, crucial for a variety of bodily functions and overall health. Including avocados in a well-rounded diet, combined with healthy lifestyle habits, is advised to obtain their advantages.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To mitigate cholesterol levels, the &lt;a data-content-type="section-topic" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/all-about/nhs"&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt; suggests reducing consumption of items high in saturated fats, such as meat pies, sausages, fatty meats, butter, lard, ghee, cream, and hard cheese, and instead focusing on foods rich in unsaturated fats.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Moreover, the NHS recommends eating more:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;oily fish, such as mackerel and salmon&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;brown rice, bread and pasta&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;nuts and seeds&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;fruits and vegetables&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;In addition, engaging in at least 150 minutes of physical activity per week, quitting smoking, and keeping alcohol consumption within 14 units a week can aid in cholesterol management.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;High cholesterol symptoms&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;High cholesterol itself doesn't cause noticeable symptoms, but it can lead to serious health problems like heart disease and stroke, which do have symptoms like: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;chest pain&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;shortness of breath&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;leg pain&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Other signs of high cholesterol include:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;yellowish fat deposits on the eyelids&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;fatty skin deposits on the hands, elbows, knees, ankles, or around the cornea of the eye. &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;a pale white ring around the coloured part of the eye &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Surrey Live</author><pubDate>Sun, 16 Mar 2025 13:29:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihAFBVV95cUxOY05nWWxuRVlhV0ZyRVQyRVc0WUZITS14RjVQRUZFT2hXOHg2UmpPcF9WbzJLTzJfRzQ3NzNHTDY5NVYyR0hxa29lODZWRXZsLWpyb3hlSVEwZGR4ZDd0Nm5ZcnNUYzMyVkI1YldZUy1ZVUFxWVpfbnczLUhlanE4OHNJMjc</guid></item><item><title>Scientists Discover Potential Ozempic Rival That Could Help People Lose Weight With Less Nausea - Gizmodo</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMixAFBVV95cUxNS0hfQ1JSZ2VfNkktX0s4azJXTlRBazRGc1VWc2xTZmdJODYxZ2tZSXRLWThwc3JSS0ZNYkI0OEVlb2pLWU4yWFlsR2FKWnY1QjZpVlZvSUtRS1R0cG5uNVJCV19UdUJjRUpKeFFjaHU0UkpnNEpsTlRoMGo1dGZUQ25vTVBxelpMOWw4M0tTelpzQzZfYmtZLWc0ZU93QWlNNnpmRXpNamlNVHdyRzQ1OWp0dUNpTmREWDI3MkZQdHB2UFJ0?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content prose dark:prose-invert lg:prose-lg lg:leading-[29px] font-serif max-w-none"&gt;
              
              
              &lt;p&gt;Wegovy, eat your heart out. In a new research paper, scientists say they’ve discovered a naturally occurring hormone that might help people lose weight while avoiding the side effects commonly associated with semaglutide (the active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy) and similar drugs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A team of researchers at Stanford Medicine conducted the study, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08683-y"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; last week in the journal Nature. With the help of artificial intelligence, the team identified a previously unknown peptide that appeared to safely reduce the appetite and weight of mice and miniature pigs without causing nausea or other gastrointestinal symptoms. More studies will be needed to verify the molecule’s safety and effectiveness in people, but the findings provide a tantalizing preview into what could be the future of obesity treatment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The emergence of semaglutide and similar drugs in recent years has been &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/how-ozempic-works-and-whats-still-a-mystery-2000499272"&gt;truly revolutionary&lt;/a&gt; for the field of obesity medicine. These medications, also used for type 2 diabetes, have proven to be far more effective at helping people lose weight than diet and exercise alone, with results ranging from &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/meet-super-ozempic-higher-dose-semaglutide-leads-to-even-greater-weight-loss-in-major-trial-2000551828"&gt;15% to 20%&lt;/a&gt; lost weight in clinical trials. Semaglutide works by mimicking GLP-1, a hormone that helps regulate our appetite and metabolism, among other functions (some drugs like tirzepatide mimic both GLP-1 and other related hormones).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As groundbreaking as these drugs are, they are known to commonly cause annoying GI symptoms, and may rarely cause more severe complications like gastroparesis (stomach paralysis). Scientists have also been working to find and develop newer generation drugs that could provide even greater weight loss or offer other conveniences, such as being available as a pill. In that vein, the Stanford Medicine researchers devised a novel strategy to find their drug candidate.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Many hormones in the body are activated only when their precursors are cleaved by specific enzymes. These precursors are called prohormones, and the family of enzymes that chop them up are called prohormone convertases. The researchers looked at one of these enzymes, prohormone convertase 1/3, which is known to help produce GLP-1. They decided to see if they could find other useful hunger-related hormones naturally produced by the enzyme. To greatly speed up this discovery process, they developed a computer algorithm (nicknamed Peptide Predictor) to narrow the list of potential molecules that fit their criteria.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This screening found an initial batch of 373 prohormones that could yield some 2,700 different peptides (peptides are often the building blocks of larger proteins, but they can have their own distinctive functions in the body). From there, the researchers tested 100 peptides they knew or suspected could affect the brain’s hunger drive (including GLP-1 for comparison). And ultimately, they identified one molecule that appeared to be particularly promising, a 12 amino acid-long peptide called BRINP2-related peptide, or BRP.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The scientists then tested BRP on lab mice and miniature pigs (minipigs are thought to closely resemble people &lt;a href="https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/tox/20/3/20_3_125/_pdf"&gt;metabolically&lt;/a&gt;). They found that a single dose of BRP greatly reduced the appetite of both animals in the short term, sometimes by as much as 50%. And obese mice given BRP significantly lost weight over a two-week span, with most of this weight being stored fat.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Further experiments showed that BRP’s hunger-reducing effects on the brain don’t involve the GLP-1 receptor at all, and it simply didn’t cause the animals to experience the GI symptoms commonly associated with Ozempic-like drugs. The dosed animals also didn’t experience changes to their movement, level of anxious behavior, or water intake, suggesting that BRP can be safely tolerated when taken as a drug.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The receptors targeted by semaglutide are found in the brain but also in the gut, pancreas and other tissues. That’s why Ozempic has widespread effects including slowing the movement of food through the digestive tract and lowering blood sugar levels.” said study senior researcher Katrin Svensson, an assistant professor of pathology at Stanford, in a &lt;a href="https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2025/03/ozempic-rival.html"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; from the university. “In contrast, BRP appears to act specifically in the hypothalamus, which controls appetite and metabolism.”&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The team’s findings are, of course, preliminary at this point. It will take plenty more time and research, including early successful clinical trials in humans, before BRP should be seen as the next big thing in obesity treatment. But the team’s discovery is the latest to suggest that semaglutide has truly sparked a sea change in obesity treatment. There are now dozens of experimental drugs in the pipeline that are threatening to rival or even surpass Ozempic/Wegovy, including &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/meet-super-ozempic-higher-dose-semaglutide-leads-to-even-greater-weight-loss-in-major-trial-2000551828"&gt;different formulations&lt;/a&gt; of semaglutide. For their part, Svensson and her colleagues have already filed patents on BRP, and she has co-founded a company that she hopes will develop the molecule for clinical use.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;No drug comes without side effects, but the future of obesity treatment could someday involve a lot less nausea.&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A dessert for people concerned with their blood sugar should be balanced with protein, fiber and healthy fats.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A Greek yogurt bark is a great choice for better blood sugar, since the Greek yogurt is a good source of protein and healthy fats.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The best way to support a healthy blood sugar is eating balanced meals throughout the day, so try to incorporate treats like yogurt bark into a balanced day of healthy eating.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You can even add nuts to this recipe for added crunch and fiber. Recent research shows that a high-fiber diet may help improve blood sugar control, blood lipids and inflammation—all important health markers for anyone living with diabetes.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Plus, combining a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/gallery/7957893/high-protein-diabetes-friendly-dinner-recipes/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;healthy protein source&lt;/a&gt; (like Greek yogurt) with a carbohydrate-rich food leads to a slower, steadier rise and fall of blood glucose compared to eating carbs alone, which can cause a rapid spike followed by a drastic drop.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Remember that 2-to-1 or 1-to-1 ratio of carbs to protein that Brown recommended? This dessert fits the bill, with 4 grams carbs, 2 grams protein and 1 gram fat per serving.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Chocolate is the perfect final touch to this tasty dessert. “Cocoa found in dark chocolate is a functional food that is high in polyphenols and is associated with reduced insulin resistance,” says Brown. Overall, the ingredients in this bark make for a balanced blend of carbs, protein and fat to support blood sugar control.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-to-look-for-in-a-blood-sugar-friendly-dessert"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What to Look For in a Blood-Sugar-Friendly Dessert &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Many desserts are high in simple carbohydrates, added sugars and saturated fat. These may be fine to eat from time to time for someone without diabetes. However, if you’re living with diabetes, you may benefit from being more intentional with your dessert consumption.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Research shows that combining protein with carbohydrate helps improve blood sugar response,” says &lt;a href="https://victorem.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Jena Brown, RD, CSSD&lt;/a&gt;, a sports dietitian and owner of Victorem Performance Nutrition in Brenham, Texas.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “Look for a 1-to-1 or 2-to-1 ratio of carbohydrate to protein with some added fat when reading food labels or Nutrition Facts,” recommends Brown. Fiber can also be beneficial. “Fiber is a key component in managing blood sugar because it helps maintain and stabilize glucose levels,” says Smolen.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; So, a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/gallery/8061127/low-calorie-diabetes-friendly-desserts/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;blood-sugar-friendly dessert&lt;/a&gt; has a good balance of carbohydrates, protein, fiber and fat. This can help prevent blood sugar spikes from a high-carb, low-fiber and low-protein dessert like cake or &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/chocolate-strawberry-nice-cream-11683637" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;ice cream&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Preventing constant blood sugar spikes is important because having persistently high blood sugars may lead to a number of health complications, including eye disease, nerve damage, gum disease, heart disease, kidney disease and skin infections.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-other-tips-for-balancing-blood-sugar"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Other Tips for Balancing Blood Sugar &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; One of the simplest yet most effective nutrition tips for balancing blood sugar is eating regular meals. Although &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7561431/scary-things-that-could-happen-to-your-body-when-you-skip-meals/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;skipping meals&lt;/a&gt; may be tempting if you’re short on time or trying to lose weight, it can ultimately lead to a blood sugar (and energy level) roller coaster.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Waiting too long between meals can cause big dips in glucose levels,” says Smolen. “These big dips can lead to energy crashes, which is why it’s important to eat balanced meals and snacks throughout the day.” Plus, some research shows that &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/skipping-breakfast-dementia-risk-study-8757557" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;skipping breakfast&lt;/a&gt; is linked with prediabetes.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Both Smolen and Brown recommend eating every three to five hours to avoid major shifts in blood glucose and energy.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When choosing which carbs to eat, Brown also recommends &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8031247/healthy-whole-grains-to-eat-more-fiber/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;looking for whole grains &lt;/a&gt;and fiber-rich foods with at least 3 grams of blood-sugar-balancing fiber per serving.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Of course, healthy blood sugar isn’t just about what you eat. Other lifestyle factors, such as getting regular physical activity and sufficient sleep, can also help maintain healthy blood sugar levels.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-the-bottom-line"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; The Bottom Line &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Have no fear! Eating and enjoying dessert is still possible with diabetes. For a diabetes-friendly dessert, include fiber, protein and fat to prevent blood sugar spikes that may occur after a carb-rich dish. &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/259080/strawberry-chocolate-greek-yogurt-bark/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Strawberry-Chocolate Greek Yogurt Bark&lt;/a&gt; offers a tasty blend of protein-filled yogurt, fiber-packed fruit and polyphenol-rich dark chocolate to satisfy your taste buds and your health.

I had no memory of watching it whatsoever, and I didn't watch many movies either at the time. So it was, it was a bit concerning."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Fraser didn't give it much thought at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was not until a few months before his diagnosis, in May of last year, that he started experiencing "some issues" with his cognition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text-description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, he said he struggled to think deeply and found that his thoughts were unusually shallow and surface level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another major moment that rang the alarm, was an evening spent driving around looking for his teenage daughter, who he mistakenly thought was missing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soon after, Fraser sought medical help for his cognitive issues and was ultimately given the life-changing diagnosis of early-onset Alzheimer's disease at the age of 41.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DON'T MISS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;According to the Daily Mail, only five to ten percent of Alzheimer's cases are diagnosed in individuals under 65. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Charity Dementia UK reports that the average time to diagnosis is 4.4 years for younger people, compared to 2.2 years for those aged 65 and over.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text-description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the overwhelming majority of cases, Alzheimer's disease is not inherited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, faulty genes inherited from parents are much more likely to be a contributing factor in those diagnosed with the condition in their 30s and 40s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In the really rare cases of a person developing Alzheimer’s disease in their 30s and 40s, it’s almost always because of a faulty gene," said the Alzheimer's Society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since his diagnosis, Fraser has noticed other symptoms, which can be challenging to manage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mantis-recommender-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I muddle up things when it comes to everyday scheduling," he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A fog just comes over your brain, and you just can't really focus on things very well, and you're in a haze," adding:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"My brain has had enough."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Express US</author><pubDate>Sun, 16 Mar 2025 13:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijAFBVV95cUxQUXFqNlNqa3VrVW52Sks2NHY4eTBoQTZuSGg2UUVxX182cktuZWF4dktjcXhQY2hDSHJ3REF4cVpSWHBScmY0NUhhbWttN1JDRUtQTnBHYXdrVWE5UlNlVnFPbWZkUEVuS0R6LXRKWVN6cG83dXhxVzk0b2FUclZQZjRUTmRnMVRzUHpkT9IBkgFBVV95cUxQSUN5VU12WDJ4cTZjeHNjajNHM1pOWjViZ3dEeEJ2LS1qeDNhYllwZTlnUHhTckFTZXZpb1MwUjBPY2ZaaHR2UE1jWVdGR0NCdHRWUjQ1cnN1b3Z4Z1FKcGZRUkl5VUI1R0NUZm5NUkVRMHRWcGI5bTd3Y1VzSUg5dENXUjY0VXRQb1M0bkpkRklnUQ</guid></item></channel></rss>
