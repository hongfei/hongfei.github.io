And researchers continue to discover new ways to use focused ultrasound to treat disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A brief history of focused ultrasound&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nibib.nih.gov/science-education/science-topics/ultrasound"&gt;Ultrasound is generated&lt;/a&gt; with a probe containing a material that converts electrical current into vibrations, and vice versa. As ultrasound waves pass through the body, they reflect off the boundaries of different types of tissue. The probe detects these reflections and converts them back into electrical signals that computers can use to create images of those tissues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over 80 years ago, scientists found that focusing these ultrasonic waves into a volume about the size of a grain of rice can &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1085/jgp.26.2.179"&gt;heat up and destroy&lt;/a&gt; brain tissue. This effect is analogous to concentrating sunlight with a magnifying glass to ignite a dry leaf.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early investigators began testing how focused ultrasound could treat neurological disorders, pain, and even  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="178009" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;a href="https://images.theconversation.com/files/696014/original/file-20251013-56-vzexom.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=1000&amp;amp;fit=clip"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" alt="Frontal brain MRI" src="https://images.theconversation.com/files/696014/original/file-20251013-56-vzexom.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=237&amp;amp;fit=clip" srcset="https://images.theconversation.com/files/696014/original/file-20251013-56-vzexom.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=600&amp;amp;h=720&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696014/original/file-20251013-56-vzexom.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=30&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=600&amp;amp;h=720&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696014/original/file-20251013-56-vzexom.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=15&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=600&amp;amp;h=720&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696014/original/file-20251013-56-vzexom.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;h=905&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696014/original/file-20251013-56-vzexom.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=30&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;h=905&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/696014/original/file-20251013-56-vzexom.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=15&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;h=905&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=3 2262w" sizes="(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/magnetic-resonance-imaging" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73063" data-postid="178009" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;MRI&lt;/a&gt; of a patient treated for essential tremor using focused ultrasound, with the targeted part of the brain circled in red. (&lt;a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:MRI-guided_HIFU,_essential_tremor,_10-14_135,_pointed.png"&gt;Jmarchn/Wikimedia Commons&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"&gt;CC BY-SA&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet, despite these early findings, technical hurdles stood in the way of applying focused ultrasound in the clinic. For example, because the skull absorbs ultrasound energy, sending focusing beams with high enough energy to reach damaged brain tissue proved difficult.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1088/0031-9155/61/17/r206"&gt;eventually overcame this problem&lt;/a&gt; by integrating large arrays of ultrasound transducers – the probes that convert between electrical signals and vibrations – with image-based information about skull shape and density. This change allowed researchers to better fine-tune the beams to their targets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is only after scientists made key advances in imaging technology and acoustic physics in recent years that the promise of ultrasound is being realized in the clinic. &lt;a href="https://www.fusfoundation.org/the-technology/indication-development-pipeline/"&gt;Hundreds of clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; aimed at treating dozens of conditions have been completed or are ongoing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/spark-into-space-comp?utm_source=promo_astro"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg" alt="Mid Article Promo Astro" class="alignnone wp-image-177074 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro.jpg 844w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers have found notable success on a condition called &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa1600159"&gt;essential tremor&lt;/a&gt;, which leads to uncontrolled shaking, usually of the hands. Focused ultrasound treatments for essential tremor are now &lt;a href="https://www.fusfoundation.org/diseases-and-conditions/essential-tremor/"&gt;performed routinely at many locations&lt;/a&gt; around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I believe some of the most exciting applications for focused ultrasound include improving drug delivery to the brain, stimulating immune responses against cancer, and treating rare diseases of the central nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Delivering drugs to the brain&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/explainer-what-is-the-blood-brain-barrier-and-how-can-we-overcome-it-75454"&gt;blood-brain barrier&lt;/a&gt; is evolution's exquisite solution to keeping noxious substances away from this most critical organ. The blood-brain barrier is comprised of very tightly connected cells lining the inside of blood vessels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It only allows certain types of molecules to enter the brain, protecting against pathogens and toxins. However, the blood-brain barrier is problematic when it comes to treating disease because it blocks therapies from reaching their intended target.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 20 years ago, pioneering studies determined that sending low-intensity pulses of focused ultrasound could &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1148/radiol.2202001804"&gt;temporarily open the blood-brain barrier&lt;/a&gt; by causing microbubbles in blood vessels to oscillate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This oscillation pushes and pulls on the surrounding vessel walls, briefly opening tiny pores that allow drugs in the bloodstream to penetrate into the brain. Critically, the blood-brain barrier opens only where the focused ultrasound is applied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Focused ultrasound can allow drugs to reach targeted areas of the brain.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;After many years of testing the safety of this technique and improving control of ultrasound energy, researchers have developed several devices using focused ultrasound to open the blood-brain barrier for treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/clinical-trials" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73032" data-postid="178009" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; testing the ability of these devices to deliver drugs to the brain to treat conditions like &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/biomedicines12061230"&gt;glioblastoma&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/scitranslmed.abj4011"&gt;brain metastases&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.addr.2022.114583"&gt;Alzheimer's disease&lt;/a&gt; are underway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In parallel, there has been significant progress in developing gene therapies for numerous brain diseases. &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/boyer-lectures-gene-therapy-is-still-in-its-infancy-but-the-future-looks-promising-104558"&gt;Gene therapy&lt;/a&gt; involves fixing or replacing faulty genetic material to treat a specific disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Applying gene therapy to the brain is especially challenging because such therapies typically do not cross the blood-brain barrier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Animal studies have shown that using focused ultrasound to open the blood-brain barrier can &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.aay1344"&gt;facilitate the delivery of gene therapies&lt;/a&gt; to their intended targets in the brain, opening doors to testing this technique in people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Stimulating immune responses against cancer&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/anti-cancer-car-t-therapy-reengineers-t-cells-to-kill-tumors-and-researchers-are-expanding-the-limited-types-of-cancer-it-can-target-196471"&gt;Cancer immunotherapy&lt;/a&gt; instructs the patient's own immune system to fight the disease. However, many patients – especially those afflicted with breast cancer, pancreatic cancer, and glioblastoma – have tumors that are &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41392-024-01979-x"&gt;immunologically "cold,"&lt;/a&gt; meaning they are unresponsive to traditional immunotherapies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers have learned that focused ultrasound can destroy solid tumors in ways that allow the immune system to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.7150/thno.92089"&gt;better recognize and destroy cancer cells&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-ultrasound-helmet-reaches-deep-inside-the-brain-without-surgery"&gt;New Ultrasound Helmet Reaches Deep Inside The Brain Without Surgery&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One way focused ultrasound does this is by turning tumors into debris that then literally flows to the lymph nodes. Once immune cells in the lymph nodes encounter this debris, they can initiate an immune response specifically against the cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inspired by these breakthroughs, the University of Virginia started the world's first &lt;a href="https://med.virginia.edu/uva-focused-ultrasound-cancer-immunotherapy-center/"&gt;focused ultrasound immuno-oncology center&lt;/a&gt; in 2022 to support research in this area and push the most promising approaches to the clinic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, my colleagues are &lt;a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06472661"&gt;running a clinical trial&lt;/a&gt; at the center to test the use of focused ultrasound and immunotherapy to treat patients with &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/how-cancer-cells-can-become-immortal-research-finds-a-mutated-gene-that-helps-melanoma-defeat-the-normal-limits-on-repeated-replication-194234"&gt;advanced melanoma&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Treating rare diseases with focused ultrasound&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research on focused ultrasound has primarily focused on the most devastating and prevalent diseases, such as cancer and Alzheimer's disease. However, I believe that further developments in, and increased use of, focused ultrasound in the clinic will eventually benefit patients with rare diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One rare disease of particular interest for my lab is &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/SVIN.123.001140"&gt;cerebral cavernous malformation, or CCM&lt;/a&gt;. CCMs are lesions in the brain that occur when the cells that make up blood vessels undergo uncontrolled growth. While uncommon, when these lesions grow and hemorrhage, they can cause &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jamaneurol.2017.0439"&gt;debilitating neurological symptoms&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most common treatment for CCM is surgical removal of the brain lesions; however, some CCMs are located in brain areas that are difficult to access, creating a risk of side effects. Radiation is another treatment option, but it, too, can lead to serious adverse effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We found that using focused ultrasound to open the blood-brain barrier can &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jconrel.2025.113861"&gt;improve drug delivery to CCMs&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, we also observed that focused ultrasound treatment itself could &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41551-025-01390-z"&gt;stop CCMs from growing&lt;/a&gt; in mice, even without administering a drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While we don't yet understand how focused ultrasound is stabilizing CCMs, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/25424823251343789"&gt;abundant research on the safety&lt;/a&gt; of using this technique in patients treated for other conditions has allowed neurosurgeons to begin designing clinical trials testing the use of this technique on people with CCM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With further research and advancements, I am hopeful that focused ultrasound can become a viable treatment option for many devastating rare diseases.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/262622/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

Despite being so easy and accessible, walking is often underrated. You don’t need fancy gear, a gym membership, or a strict routine, just comfy shoes and a bit of motivation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s always a bit of confusion about when to walk, before meals, right after, or later in the day?

"For people with diabetes or prediabetes, this habit can significantly lower post-meal glucose and even reduce HbA1c over time," he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;He discourages walking immediately after meals. "Walking immediately after finishing a meal (within 0–5 min) is still beneficial, but some people may feel discomfort or bloating, especially after a heavy meal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;So, what's the right time?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Start 10–15 minutes after eating," says the doctor. "This timing coincides with the period when blood glucose levels begin to rise as the meal is being digested and glucose is entering the bloodstream," he explains. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"10–20 minutes of light to moderate walking (at 3–4 km/hour pace) is usually enough to blunt the glucose spike. A longer 30-minute walk can provide additional benefits, especially after carbohydrate-rich meals," he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;But, wait, are you walking the right way?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walking is one of the simplest exercises, but surprisingly, a few common mistakes can really sabotage its benefits. First off, walking too slowly or without purpose won’t get your heart rate up enough to boost fitness or burn calories. It’s okay to stroll, but adding a bit of pace or some arm movement makes a difference. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, ignoring posture can cause neck, back, or shoulder strain — stand tall, engage your core, and swing your arms naturally. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another mistake is skipping consistency; walking once in a while won’t do much, so make it a regular habit, even if it’s just 15 minutes a day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wrong footwear is a sneaky culprit too — shoes that don’t support your feet can lead to pain or injuries, which kills motivation. Also, walking on the same route all the time can get boring and reduce effort; mix it up with different paths, trails, or slight inclines to challenge your body. Finally, forgetting hydration or ignoring body signals can make walking uncomfortable or even risky, especially in hot weather. Walking is amazing, but doing it smartly is what really delivers results!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Fri, 17 Oct 2025 03:46:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>研究表明，这种常见的早晨习惯无声地损害动脉；可使心脏死亡风险增加87 ％ -印度时报</title><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/this-common-morning-habit-is-silently-damaging-arteries-can-increase-heart-death-risk-by-87-says-study/articleshow/124619416.cms</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;p&gt;How we start our mornings has a lot to do with how the rest of the day is going to go. From picking up mobile phones after waking up, to struggling to get that one cup of coffee, all morning rituals matter. At first, these might seem harmless but medical professionals are now concerned about how morning habits contribute to clogged arteries, which harm our cardiovascular health. One of the habits, as research points out, is skipping breakfast&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;For years, the breakfast meal has been hailed as vital. But with busy lives, increasing numbers of people are skipping breakfast altogether or consuming things on the go, (which is also pretty harmful) ,pushing back the morning meal in the guise of intermittent fasting, weight management, or time pressures. Research now indicates this practice is potentially much worse than it looks, especially for cardiovascular and arterial health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Clear your arteries: 7 tips for preventing heart blockages naturally&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;How it influences the health of arteries&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arteries transport oxygen-carrying blood from the heart to all cells throughout the body. Over time, it may become constricted because of the buildup of plaque, known as atherosclerosis. When this occurs gradually and silently, it raises the threat of heart attacks and strokes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Skipping breakfast also sets off a sequence of physiological events that can hasten the process. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies indicate that individuals who usually skip breakfast are likely to have higher levels of LDL (bad) cholesterol, increased blood pressure, and increased insulin resistance. All these three factors combined raise the risk of arterial plaque formation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the body is starved of nutrients in the morning, it compensates by releasing stress hormones such as cortisol. This surge of hormones raises inflammation, which is central to the hardening of arteries. Furthermore, individuals who eat breakfast skip meals later in the day, gobbling high-calorie or processed foods that increase triglyceride levels and put pressure on the vascular system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent analysis from the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0735109717393178" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;PESA (Progression of Early Subclinical Atherosclerosis) s&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;tudy looked at how breakfast habits relate to the early stages of artery disease. Researchers identified three breakfast patterns among participants:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;High-energy breakfast (&amp;gt;20% of total daily calories) – 27% of participants&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Low-energy breakfast (5–20% of total daily calories) – 70%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Skipping breakfast (&amp;lt;5% of total daily calories) – 3%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings showed that people who skipped breakfast had a significantly higher risk of developing atherosclerosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Research that shows the risk&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A report in the Journal of the&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cardiosmart.org/news/2019/5/skipping-breakfast-nearly-doubles-risk-for-heart-related-death" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;American College of Cardiology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; found adults who skipped breakfast were 87% more likely to die of cardiovascular disease than those who regularly consumed it. A different study conducted in Spain revealed individuals who routinely skipped breakfast had thicker walls in their carotid arteries, a primary indicator of nascent atherosclerosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts believe this connection is not just about what one eats, but WHEN one eats. The body follows a circadian rhythm, and eating in alignment with that rhythm helps regulate metabolism and blood sugar levels. Skipping breakfast disrupts this rhythm, forcing the body into a stress state that promotes fat storage and inflammation — both harmful to arterial health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why symptoms often go unnoticed&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most troubling aspect of this condition is that it advances stealthily. Atherosclerosis becomes established over a long period of years, and frequently decades, with no apparent symptoms until a dramatic event occurs. Preliminary symptoms such as minor fatigue, dizziness, or shortness of breath are usually attributed to normal fatigue. When the individual develops chest pain or heart attack, the disease is well established.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blood tests, lipid profile testing, and imaging scans such as carotid ultrasound are the only dependable methods to diagnose changes within arteries early. Physicians also stress the need to monitor blood sugar and blood pressure levels since both are highly correlated with vascular health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to keep your arteries healthy&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The solution starts with returning balance to the morning routine. Having a healthy breakfast regulates metabolism and enhances steady energy levels. Nutritionists suggest incorporating foods high in fiber, antioxidants, and healthy fats — like oats, nuts, seeds, fruits, and whole grains. These reduce LDL cholesterol and guard the inner wall of blood vessels. In all this, hydration is equally important, water helps in flushing out toxins from the body, and regulates all processes of the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just as important is steering clear of processed breakfast foods filled with added sugars or trans fats. These are likely to trigger a blood sugar spike and inspire inflammation, which negates the whole idea of an early morning meal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="57"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This silent damage caused by skipping breakfast, reminds us that heart health is fragile, and depends on what we do, how we do, and what we eat. As much as it is important watch our weight, it is equally important to set the tone for the day and not neglect any meal, especially breakfast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="59"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/4-everyday-drinks-that-can-help-prevent-artery-plaque-and-improve-blood-flow/articleshow/124518536.cms" rel="noopener" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Read: 4 everyday drinks that can help prevent artery plaque, and improve blood flow&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Fri, 17 Oct 2025 03:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimgJBVV95cUxOS0ZMd1ZfQmtjZ0VjS3E3YjRvZ1JzbEh5ZGM5QmlvQVRmMGJRSXdOODBLX29FZ1BiZ3h3SEZ0WGdaVU5JUVdOOHZjajNGSFIxM2UxNkp3OTFwRm01RUNjMFEtQl9fMWlXU25BWW5pajFNenRFV0h0cFU1S2NkMUN0NUZ0TkwtWmNUbGswQ3UzSVpsUzRieENGeHZmaVVGLXdabFplMUtYUTI5WHdkSk4wVGFIU1ZoeF9OY3hFRlZYbXdlMVVKRzJiaFpRNVRUUVVrNWtDTXpTU05NZnhFbkNKbGlnZGFzUk9IWTVxelpqR09HNlJGalc1OE9zclNpZWNTcjdYSVdZb0lRRkxDNGp1WW5Ta1UxSy1fMWc</guid></item><item><title>两名前麦克莱恩临床医生正在用一种新模式--《波士顿环球报》来应对儿童强迫症</title><link>https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/10/17/lifestyle/mclean-clinicians-childhood-ocd/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="body | gutter_16--desktop gutter_16--tablet paywalled_content

If your kid is afraid to go to school, terrified of germs, or trapped in a world constrained by fear, it can feel like eternity. Trust me; I remember.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“A child’s brain is a sponge. What OCD does, what anxiety does, is it robs a child of the chance to really experience the world on their own terms. We want to help them change their relationship with the OCD. We’re not going to make it go away; we’re going to help the child, parents, school, everybody, respond to these emotions in a different way that’s more productive,” Potter says.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;My experience mirrors the typical trajectory. About 1 in 5 cases begins by age 10, with upticks around puberty and young adulthood. OCD isn’t caused by parenting, Potter says. It reflects a sensitive brain alarm system, partly genetic, shaped by environmental and developmental changes. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“Genetics contributes 40 to 50 percent of the risk of OCD; the genetic contribution appears to be higher in childhood-onset than in adult-onset disease,” she says.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;And while awareness has grown, treatment delays are still common: Many kids still go years before an accurate diagnosis. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“With early recognition and evidence-based care, OCD is highly treatable,” Potter says. In honor of all those kids who used to struggle in silence — and those who still do — here’s what to know about OCD.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;What OCD is: &lt;/b&gt;OCD is diagnosed when intrusive thoughts, images, or urges cause anxiety. As a result, the sufferer feels compelled to perform actions or mental rituals to get relief, so much so that it disrupts life, Potter says. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Obsessions are persistent, intrusive thoughts, images, or urges that cause distress (like my fixation on ear lumps). Compulsions are repetitive behaviors or mental rituals to reduce distress or prevent something bad from happening. They can be behavioral and visible — like hand-washing or checking — or invisible, like counting or praying. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Sometimes, compulsions are related to a fear (like checking a stove to make sure you turned it off so the house doesn’t burn down); other times, they aren’t logical (walking on a certain side of the road to keep your parents safe). Most of all, these obsessions or compulsions consume time, often more than an hour per day. They’re exhausting.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;And, saddest of all, many kids “know behaviors are hurting their lives or are distressed by them, but they still feel unable to stop. Shame is common and delays asking for help,” Potter says.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;There are lots of OCD strains: fear of contamination; needing things to be perfectly symmetrical; relationship doubts with checking and reassurance; and existential worries, such as rumination about death or mortality.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;What OCD isn’t:&lt;/b&gt; Lots of people have daily rituals, like tapping a can of Diet Coke before opening it or lighting a candle when walking into a room. The difference? These behaviors are grounding, and they’re optional. If you can’t do them for some reason — let’s say you’re out of matches — you can move on. With OCD, functioning stalls until the behavior is complete.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“It’s exhausting, not because the person wants to think this way, but because the OCD is directing them. It’s like having mental pop-up ads. Our minds usually click them away quickly and without much thought, but in OCD, the pop-ups stick around and start taking over, and even if you do what they say and click them away, they come back,” Potter says.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;How it’s treated&lt;/b&gt;: The good news is, OCD is highly treatable. The gold standard is exposure and response prevention. This is a specialized form of cognitive behavioral therapy that re-trains the brain’s alarm system by facing triggers (or exposures) and by resisting the corresponding ritual (response prevention).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Here’s an example: For a long time, I avoided walking up flights of stairs, because it would make my heart race, which I’d then obsess over. My heart was definitely about to explode. So my therapist made me walk up and down several flights, creating the very symptoms I avoided — and realize that, no, my heart wasn’t going to collapse. With ERP, Potter says, more than 70 percent of kids improve significantly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Medication also helps. It won’t erase the OCD; instead, think of it as a way to turn down the noise and reduce symptom intensity, making therapy more fruitful. SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) are the most commonly prescribed medications for OCD. I take Prozac.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;What parents can do&lt;/b&gt;: For support, Potter recommends resources including the International OCD Foundation and Anxiety and Depression Association of America.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;You can also try to separate your child from the OCD by externalizing it: “This is OCD talking, not you.” Some kids find it helpful to give it a name.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“We’ve had kids give it the funniest names. They’ll call it Broccoli. My favorite was Miggy, after amygdala, our limbic fear system,” Potter says. “The idea is externalizing the OCD. OCD is trying to tell you what to do and trying to say that, if you don’t do this, then your day is going to be bad or a bad outcome is going to happen. But this is OCD: You don’t always need to listen to OCD.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Notice, name, and respond deliberately. “When OCD tries to run the show, pause before problem-solving or directing. Lead with empathy: notice and name what your child is feeling, reflect it with your words and body language, and then gently pivot to action by coaching one tiny step toward what they’re avoiding,” she says.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Most of all, don’t accommodate the OCD. This might seem counterintuitive: You don’t want your kid to be upset; neither do their teachers or friends. But accommodation can backfire in the long run.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“Parents often buffer distress by answering reassurance questions, assisting in avoidance behaviors, or creating work-arounds. It helps in the moment but grows OCD over time because it takes away the opportunity for kids to learn that, yes, they can really handle a challenging situation,” Potter says.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“We are ‘nice’ by trying to reduce distress in the moment, but the ‘kind’ thing to do is to show kids we believe in them and know they can handle it. There’s a concept in schools [that] moved from helicopter parenting to lawnmower parenting, where the urge is to clear the path for our kids. But that deprives them of the chance to build muscles and see that they can handle and get through the muck.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;As psychologists Alex Jordan and Ben Levett &lt;a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/10/14/opinion/student-anxiety-schools-accommodation/?p1=BGSearch_Advanced_Results" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/10/14/opinion/student-anxiety-schools-accommodation/?p1=BGSearch_Advanced_Results"&gt;wrote recently&lt;/a&gt; in the Globe: “Anxiety feeds on avoidance,” they wrote. “When students take on what they’d rather avoid, they learn that worst-case scenarios rarely materialize, that discomfort is survivable, and that anxiety diminishes with practice.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Finally, praise their efforts. When your kid takes a step away from an OCD behavior and tolerates uncertainty, name it out loud: “You felt the urge and still chose bravery,” Potter says.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;How a kid can explain OCD to their friends&lt;/b&gt;: I wished I’d had a way to explain what was going on in my brain when I was younger. My mind felt like a CD that kept skipping. People couldn’t really relate.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Here’s what Potter suggests.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Younger kids could say, “Sometimes my brain gets stuck on worries. It tells me I have to check or repeat things to feel safe. I’m learning how to ignore those false alarms so my brain can calm down.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Teens could say, “I have OCD, so my brain sends false alarms. I feel like I have to do things a certain way to calm down. I’m practicing not doing the rituals so I can retrain my brain.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;If you’re dealing with friends or family who just don’t quite get it? Try this: “Everyone gets random thoughts. Mine sometimes get stuck and feel important even when they aren’t. I’m learning to face them without rituals so I can get my freedom back.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;And for anyone currently struggling? Take it from me: You really can get your freedom back, and you will. This illness is part of you, but it doesn’t define you.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="tagline_hr | border_foreground border_half gutter_20_28--mobile

    &lt;p&gt;Magnesium supplements are everywhere – lined up on pharmacy shelves and promoted on wellness blogs and &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@dra_says/video/7399633468839185696?lang=en"&gt;social media&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe you have a friend or family member who swears a daily tablet will help everything, from better sleep to alleviating muscle cramps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But do you really need one? Or it is just marketing hype?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What is magnesium and why do we need it?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Magnesium is an essential metal the body needs to make and operate more than 300 different enzymes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Magnesium-HealthProfessional/#:%7E:text=consumer%20fact%20sheet.-,Introduction,L%20%5B1%2C5%5D."&gt;enzymes&lt;/a&gt; build protein, and regulate muscle and nerve function, help in the release of energy from our food, and help to maintain blood function. The body doesn’t produce magnesium so we need to get it from external sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.eatforhealth.gov.au/nutrient-reference-values/nutrients/magnesium"&gt;government&lt;/a&gt; recommends a daily magnesium dose of 310–420 mg  a day for adults and 30–410 mg  for children, depending on age and sex. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is easily met through a good diet. Foods &lt;a href="https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/foods-high-in-magnesium"&gt;rich in magnesium&lt;/a&gt; include nuts and seeds, whole grains, seafood, meat, legumes and green leafy vegetables. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can even get some of your magnesium needs met through &lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/170271/nutrients"&gt;dark chocolate&lt;/a&gt;. It has 146 mg per 100 g of chocolate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;How do I know if I’m deficient?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Magnesium-HealthProfessional/"&gt;at risk of experiencing magnesium deficiency&lt;/a&gt; include people with restricted diets, gastrointestinal problems such as Crohn’s and coeliac diseases, type 2 diabetes, and alcohol dependence. Older adults are also more likely to be deficient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will only need a magnesium supplement if you &lt;a href="https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/magnesium-deficiency"&gt;show signs of low magnesium&lt;/a&gt;. One of the most common signs is muscle spasms and twitches. Other symptoms to look out for include low appetite, nausea and vomiting, or your heart beating abnormally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Magnesium deficiency can be properly diagnosed by a blood test ordered by your doctor. If you need this test, it’s covered by &lt;a href="https://www9.health.gov.au/mbs/search.cfm?q=magnesium&amp;amp;sopt=S"&gt;Medicare&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What conditions can it help?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Commercially available magnesium supplements have been promoted to prevent muscle cramps, manage insomnia and help with migraines. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While magnesium deficiency is linked to &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Magnesium-HealthProfessional/"&gt;muscle cramps&lt;/a&gt;, the cause of most muscle cramps is &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD009402.pub3"&gt;unknown&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the current evidence does not demonstrate that magnesium supplements can prevent muscle cramps in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD009402.pub3"&gt;older adults&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="align-center "&gt;
            
            &lt;figcaption&gt;
              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;Magnesium supplements come in different brands and doses.&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;span class="source"&gt;Nial Wheate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is conflicting data as to whether the use of magnesium helps with sleep. One study reported magnesium was able to reduce the time for a person to fall asleep by &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12906-024-04721-w"&gt;17.4 minutes&lt;/a&gt; while others didn’t &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.59317"&gt;show&lt;/a&gt; an &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/postgradmedj-2020-139319"&gt;effect&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s10072-024-07794-0"&gt;migraines&lt;/a&gt;, the most recent research suggests taking 122-600 mg of magnesium supplements daily for 4–24 weeks may decrease their frequency and severity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Are magnesium supplements safe?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Magnesium supplements are generally well tolerated. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, they can cause gastrointestinal discomfort such as nausea, abdominal cramping and &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Magnesium-HealthProfessional/"&gt;diarrhoea&lt;/a&gt;. Magnesium causes diarrhoea by drawing water into the intestine and stimulating movement in the &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Magnesium-HealthProfessional/"&gt;gut&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is possible to take too much magnesium and you can &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/food-nutrition/magnesium-overdose-whats-the-likelihood"&gt;overdose&lt;/a&gt; on it. Very large doses, around &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/323349#likelihood-of-an-overdose"&gt;5,000 mg per day&lt;/a&gt;, can lead to magnesium toxicity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the research investigating the clinical use of magnesium focuses on magnesium in &lt;a href="https://www.nmi.health/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/NMJ_Magnesium_A-Review-of-Clinical-Use-and-Efficacy.pdf"&gt;oral&lt;/a&gt; formulations. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What other formulations are available?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As magnesium is a small metal ion, it can &lt;a href="https://www.jle.com/fr/revues/mrh/e-docs/permeation_of_topically_applied_magnesium_ions_through_human_skin_is_facilitated_by_hair_follicles_307878/article.phtml"&gt;pass through skin&lt;/a&gt; – but not easily. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Magnesium bath salts, patches and topical cream-based formulations may be able to raise your blood magnesium levels to some extent. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But due to the amount needed each day, tablets and foods are a better source. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Things to watch out for when taking magnesium&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Commercially available magnesium products can vary widely in dose, formulation and cost. Magnesium supplements have between 150 to 350 mg of the metal per tablet. Your required dose will depend on your age and sex, and whether you have any underlying health problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Magnesium supplements sometimes contain other vitamins and minerals, such as vitamins C and D, and the metals calcium, chromium and manganese. So it’s important to consider the total quantities if you’re taking other vitamins and supplements.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many magnesium supplements also include vitamin B6. While this vitamin is important for supporting the immune system, high intakes can it can cause serious &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/too-much-vitamin-b6-can-be-toxic-3-symptoms-to-watch-out-for-260400"&gt;health issues&lt;/a&gt;. If you’re already taking a B6 supplement, a magnesium supplement that also includes it can put you at risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-react-class="Tweet" data-react-props='{"tweetId":"1940661205221154954"}'&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What if you’re considering supplements?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you think you might be deficient in magnesium, speak to your doctor who can order a blood test. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you suffer from migraines, cramps, or poor sleep, talk to your doctor or pharmacist who can advise on and monitor the underlying cause. It may be that a change in lifestyle or an alternative treatment may be more appropriate for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you do decide to take a magnesium supplement, check you won’t be taking too much of any other vitamin or mineral. A pharmacist can help select a supplement that suits you best.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

For example, people might worry someone like parents or housemates could find their pills. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Homelessness and domestic violence can make it difficult to take oral PrEP every day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;An injection which lasts for months offers convenience and discretion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;HIV is a virus that damages the cells in the immune system and weakens the body's ability to fight everyday infections and diseases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;It can be caught during unprotected sex or through sharing needles.

According to one new study, the so-called "dopamine detox" trend doesn't have a whole lot of merit. And not only that, but it's come to overshadow a handful of other practices that not only manage dopamine better, but have longer-lasting effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;4 activities that will actually give you a better 'dopamine detox' than avoiding screens:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Dopamine Detox" has become a hot online trend for overcoming the ills of screen addiction, all with a deceptively simple premise: Taking breaks from screens or even just "raw-dogging" flights with no screens of any kind can "detox" your brain from dopamine, the neurotransmitter that governs pleasure, reward, and motivatio,n and which is heavily involved in addiction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seems reasonable enough, right? You avoid the thing you're addicted to, the addictive mechanism is cut off, and you're "detoxed" from its effects. But the &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/what-is-a-dopamine-detox-and-do-i-need-one-254813" rel="nofollow"&gt;science so far &lt;/a&gt;says there's really not much of anything to this. (Note: This research pertains to adults. Kids are a whole other ball of wax when it comes to the impacts of screens!)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For starters, dopamine is a necessary neurotransmitter we actually need to function, not some poison that needs shedding. But the idea of "detoxing" from dopamine is alluring, especially because when people try it, they do usually notice changes, especially negative ones like craving the very screens they've just given up!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That mechanism is very real. But there's a major distinction missing from all this viral discourse: Scientists say it's not so much that we're getting MORE dopamine that is the problem, but rather that we're getting dopamine hits so OFTEN and so QUICKLY. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It basically overwhelms the system, which is why scientists say replacing "fast dopamine" with one (or all) of these four "slow dopamine" activities will not only help ease screentime overstimulation but also yield lasting, more complete results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/self/toyoake-japanese-city-limits-screen-time-2-hours-day"&gt;Welcome To Toyoake, A Japanese City Where Screen Time Is Limited To 2 Hours A Day&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;1. Exercise&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="media media--type-image media--view-mode-default"&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.yourtango.com/sites/default/files/image_blog/2025-10/four-activities-that-dopamine-detox-better-than-avoiding-screens-exercise.png" alt="woman hiking" title="four activities that dopamine detox better than avoiding screens exercise" class="img-fluid" typeof="foaf:Image" decoding="async"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-credit field--type-string field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;Alena Ozerova | Canva Pro&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Right, not everyone's idea of a fun hobby. But it can be as simple as just going for a regular walk. No need to become an Olympic powerlifter. But physical exercise not only helps &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8301978/" rel="nofollow"&gt;boost and manage dopamine&lt;/a&gt;, but also levels of norepinephrine and serotonin, too, much like antidepressants do. The difference, again, is that it does so in natural doses in a natural rhythm rather than the bombardment that doomscrolling provides.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;2. Creative projects&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="media media--type-image media--view-mode-default"&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.yourtango.com/sites/default/files/image_blog/2025-10/four-activities-that-dopamine-detox-better-than-avoiding-screens-exercise-creative.png" alt="man painting a picture" title="four activities that dopamine detox better than avoiding screens creative" class="img-fluid" typeof="foaf:Image" decoding="async"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-credit field--type-string field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;Mehmet Turgut Kirkgoz | Pexels | Canva Pro&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether it's painting, gardening, knitting, or bonsai trimming, creative projects and dopamine have a beneficial push-pull relationship. Creative projects provide &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4718590/" rel="nofollow"&gt;pleasure that releases dopamine&lt;/a&gt;, and creativity is enhanced by that release. So not only will sitting down to draw make your brain feel better, but your drawing will, in turn, improve, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;3. Face-to-face interaction&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="media media--type-image media--view-mode-default"&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.yourtango.com/sites/default/files/image_blog/2025-10/four-activities-that-dopamine-detox-better-than-avoiding-screens-face-to-face.png" alt="book club discussion" title="four activities that dopamine detox better than avoiding screens face to face" class="img-fluid" typeof="foaf:Image" decoding="async"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-credit field--type-string field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;ferrantraite | Getty Images Signature | Canva Pro&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not to be all "touch grass" about it, but go touch grass. Science has long known that &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2889690/" rel="nofollow"&gt;face-to-face interactions &lt;/a&gt;tell the brain to release dopamine, giving us all kinds of positive benefits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But much like with creative projects, it has a knock-on effect. It makes us want to go out and interact even more. If you're the introverted, socially anxious type, gritting your teeth and stepping outside your comfort zone that first time just might be the key to coming out of your shell long-term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/self/test-reveals-screen-time-out-of-control"&gt;This Simple 3-Step Test Reveals If Your Screen Time Has Gotten A Little Out Of Control&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;4.

			&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/parkinsons-disease"&gt;Parkinson's disease&lt;/a&gt; progresses, harmful protein clumps build up in the brain, blocking communications between neurons and killing them off – but what if we could prevent these clusters from forming?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers led by a team from the University of Bath in the UK have achieved just that in a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caenorhabditis_elegans"&gt;basic worm model&lt;/a&gt; of  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IYl" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73029" data-postid="176557" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Parkinson's&lt;/a&gt;. They engineered a peptide, a small amino acid chain, to essentially keep a protein called alpha-synuclein locked in its healthy shape. This &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_folding"&gt;prevented the misfolding&lt;/a&gt; that leads to clumps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/parkinsons-discovery-suggests-we-could-have-an-fda-approved-treatment-already"&gt;potential treatment&lt;/a&gt; checks several important boxes: it's durable, and it can survive inside cells without causing any toxic side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/parkinsons-disease-could-be-ignited-by-burned-out-brain-cells"&gt;Parkinson's Disease Could Be Ignited by Burned-Out Brain Cells&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This opens an exciting path towards new therapies for Parkinson's and related diseases, where treatment options remain extremely limited," &lt;a href="https://www.bath.ac.uk/announcements/bath-scientists-design-peptide-switch-that-keeps-parkinsons-protein-in-its-healthy-form/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; biochemist Jody Mason, from the University of Bath.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study follows on from &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.xcrp.2023.101563"&gt;previous work&lt;/a&gt; by some of the same researchers, which identified part of the alpha-synuclein protein that may stop it building to dangerous levels. This key part or fragment acts like a guide for the protein to follow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_176560" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-176560" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/ProteinDiagram.jpg" alt="Peptide and protein diagram" class="wp-image-176560 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/ProteinDiagram.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/ProteinDiagram-560x415.jpg 560w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/ProteinDiagram-600x445.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-176560" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The team used a shortened peptide to make sure alpha-synuclein proteins behaved. (Meade et al., &lt;em&gt;JACS Au&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;That fragment was then cut down into the smallest possible size to form the new peptide tested here. The researchers also added extra stability to their peptide molecule, using chemical structures called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactam"&gt;lactam bridges&lt;/a&gt; to stop it from breaking down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crucially, the peptide created by the researchers can patrol cells and prevent misfolding without interfering with the normal, healthy job that alpha-synuclein is there for: regulating neurotransmitter signaling chemicals &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/dopamine-doesnt-work-in-our-brains-quite-the-way-we-thought"&gt;such as dopamine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our work shows that it is possible to rationally design small peptides that not only prevent harmful protein aggregation but also function inside living systems," &lt;a href="https://www.bath.ac.uk/announcements/bath-scientists-design-peptide-switch-that-keeps-parkinsons-protein-in-its-healthy-form/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Mason.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part of the challenge of finding effective &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/parkinsons-discovery-suggests-we-could-already-have-an-fda-approved-treatment"&gt;treatments for Parkinson's&lt;/a&gt;, and other diseases like it, is that it can be difficult to disentangle the causes of the condition from the consequences – are alpha-synuclein protein clumps appearing because of the effects of Parkinson's, for example, or helping to drive its progression?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With that in mind, the treatment outlined here seems preventative. It could eventually be used to stop proteins from building up in the brains of people &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/men-have-higher-risk-of-parkinsons-and-we-may-finally-know-why"&gt;at risk of developing Parkinson's&lt;/a&gt;, rather than breaking up existing protein clumps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/spark-into-space-comp?utm_source=promo_astro"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg" alt="Astronaut in space, with text overlay" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-177074" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro.jpg 844w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;There's a lot of progress to be made – including figuring out the best way to deliver these peptides into the body (which will be significantly more difficult for humans than it is with worms) – but the early signs from this research are positive ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also want to explore using similar techniques for related conditions, including Lewy body dementia and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimer-s-disease"&gt;Alzheimer's disease&lt;/a&gt; – which are characterized by dangerous protein clumps of their own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"To make progress towards a cure for all forms of dementia, we need research focused on developing a broad range of treatments that can slow, stop and ultimately reverse these diseases," &lt;a href="https://www.bath.ac.uk/announcements/bath-scientists-design-peptide-switch-that-keeps-parkinsons-protein-in-its-healthy-form/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Julia Dudley, the head of research at  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="176557" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; Research UK, which helped fund this study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Although this is early research in an animal model, it's exciting to see that this new molecule can prevent the build-up of misfolded alpha-synuclein."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1021/jacsau.5c00694"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Journal of the American Chemical Society&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

The second, &lt;a class="link" href="https://publichealth.lacounty.gov/phcommon/public/media/mediapubdetail.cfm?unit=media&amp;amp;ou=ph&amp;amp;prog=media&amp;amp;cur=cur&amp;amp;prid=5160&amp;amp;row=25&amp;amp;start=1" target="_blank"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; Thursday, was in a Los Angeles County resident. Both patients had to be hospitalized but are now recovering at home, health officials said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While the overall risk of ... exposure to the public remains low, we are taking this very seriously,” Long Beach Mayor Rex Richardson said in a statement. “This underscores the importance of continued surveillance, early response and vaccination.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This type of mpox is different  from the one that spawned &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-10-07/mpx-cases-decline-los-angeles"&gt;a global outbreak&lt;/a&gt; in 2022, which is known as “Clade II.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clade I is potentially even more concerning, however, because it may cause more severe illness and spread more easily, “including through close personal contact,” such as massage or cuddling, in addition to sex, the L.A. County Department of Public Health said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The identification of cases of Clade I mpox, which may cause more severe illness than the more-common Clade II, is concerning,” L.A. County health officer Dr. Muntu Davis said in a statement Thursday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The California Department of Public Health said last year that Clade I has historically caused more severe illness than Clade II, but &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/OPA/Pages/NR24-036.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;added&lt;/a&gt; that “recent infections from Clade I mpox may not be as clinically severe as in previous outbreaks, especially when cases have access to quality medical care.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mpox, formerly known as monkeypox, is primarily spread through close, intimate contact, such as through body fluids, sores, shared bedding or shared clothing, as well as kissing, coughing and sneezing, health officials say. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tell-tale symptoms “include rash or unusual sores that look like pimples or pus-filled blisters on the face, body and genitals, fever, chills, headache, muscle aches or swelling of lymph nodes,” the L.A. County Department of Public Health said. Other symptoms can include a sore throat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Anyone who develops an unexplained rash or lesions should avoid sex and intimate contact and seek medical evaluation as soon as possible,” the Long Beach Department of Health and Human Services said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People should get tested if they have symptoms, officials said. Those who have symptoms should also avoid sex or close contact. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clade II mpox generally causes mild-to-moderate illness and has been circulating at low levels throughout the United States since 2022, according to the L.A. County Department of Public Health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There have been 118 cases of Clade II mpox reported to the L.A. County Department of Public Health so far this year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before this week, there had been a total of six &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/monkeypox/situation-summary/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;cases&lt;/a&gt; of Clade I mpox in the U.S. — all among people who had recently traveled to areas where this type of mpox is circulating, namely central and eastern Africa. None of those cases was  linked to each other, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC says there have been more than &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/monkeypox/situation-summary/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;40,000 cases of Clade I mpox&lt;/a&gt; in central and eastern Africa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, one of the countries with confirmed cases, multiple modes of Clade I mpox transmission have been documented, including “contact with infected dead or live wild animals” and “household contact often involving crowded households,” in addition to sexual contact, &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/monkeypox/outbreaks/2023/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;according to&lt;/a&gt; the CDC. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="enhancement" data-click="enhancement" data-align-center&gt;&lt;figure class="figure m-0"&gt; &lt;picture&gt;    &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/39e6c30/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3120x2700+0+0/resize/320x277!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F89%2F83%2F12f7c7ad4d50b31d1a759006e608%2Fmpox-africa-aug2024.png 320w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c88c932/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3120x2700+0+0/resize/568x491!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F89%2F83%2F12f7c7ad4d50b31d1a759006e608%2Fmpox-africa-aug2024.png 568w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/fbbd947/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3120x2700+0+0/resize/768x664!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F89%2F83%2F12f7c7ad4d50b31d1a759006e608%2Fmpox-africa-aug2024.png 768w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f574188/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3120x2700+0+0/resize/1024x886!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F89%2F83%2F12f7c7ad4d50b31d1a759006e608%2Fmpox-africa-aug2024.png 1024w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/2851685/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3120x2700+0+0/resize/1200x1038!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F89%2F83%2F12f7c7ad4d50b31d1a759006e608%2Fmpox-africa-aug2024.png 1200w" sizes="100vw"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;       &lt;img class="image" alt="Countries in central and eastern Africa that have reported Clade I mpox cases since 2024." srcset="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/cdd6d31/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3120x2700+0+0/resize/320x277!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F89%2F83%2F12f7c7ad4d50b31d1a759006e608%2Fmpox-africa-aug2024.png 320w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d1ecbf0/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3120x2700+0+0/resize/568x491!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F89%2F83%2F12f7c7ad4d50b31d1a759006e608%2Fmpox-africa-aug2024.png 568w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a2fbbeb/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3120x2700+0+0/resize/768x664!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F89%2F83%2F12f7c7ad4d50b31d1a759006e608%2Fmpox-africa-aug2024.png 768w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ff2fda8/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3120x2700+0+0/resize/1024x886!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F89%2F83%2F12f7c7ad4d50b31d1a759006e608%2Fmpox-africa-aug2024.png 1024w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0a6a305/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3120x2700+0+0/resize/1200x1038!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F89%2F83%2F12f7c7ad4d50b31d1a759006e608%2Fmpox-africa-aug2024.png 1200w" sizes="100vw" src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0a6a305/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3120x2700+0+0/resize/1200x1038!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F89%2F83%2F12f7c7ad4d50b31d1a759006e608%2Fmpox-africa-aug2024.png" decoding="async" loading="lazy"&gt;   &lt;/picture&gt;   &lt;div class="figure-content"&gt;   &lt;p class="figure-caption"&gt;These countries in central and eastern Africa have reported Clade I mpox cases since 2024. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="figure-credit"&gt;(U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The risk to the general U.S. population in the U.S. from Clade I mpox is considered “low,” the CDC says. The agency classifies the risk to gay and bisexual men who have sex with more than one partner as “low to moderate.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Travel-associated cases of Clade I mpox have also been found in a number of other regions globally, including Asia, Australia, Europe and South America. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first Clade I mpox case in the U.S. was &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/s1116-california-first-clade.html" target="_blank"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; 11 months ago — in someone in California who had traveled to Africa and received care in San Mateo County, according to the CDC and &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/OPA/Pages/NR24-036.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;California Department of Public Health&lt;/a&gt;. That person had mild illness, the San Mateo County health department &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.smcgov.org/ceo/news/san-mateo-county-health-responds-new-mpox-strain" target="_blank"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; at the time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people who are infected get better within two to four weeks, the Long Beach Department of Health and Human Services said, “but antiviral treatments may be considered for individuals with or at risk of developing severe illness.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two-dose Jynneos &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/monkeypox/vaccines/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;vaccine&lt;/a&gt; is also available to help prevent the spread of mpox. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who only got one dose can get their second doses “no matter how long it’s been since the first dose,” the L.A. County Department of Public Health said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaccines are widely available, and can be found at pharmacies like Walgreens and CVS. People can look up locations to get vaccinated through the vaccine’s manufacturer, &lt;a class="link" href="https://links-1.govdelivery.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fempoweredagainstmpox.com%2F%3Futm_content=%26utm_medium=email%26utm_name=%26utm_source=govdelivery%26utm_term=%23locator-map/1/01000199ee69436e-f5d64ed8-741e-4092-b7a9-57396cb267d8-000000/tA7ggaQrerUoABOTVMH8kqdw1N0C9Q35BAxTw78Y0eo=427" target="_blank"&gt;Bavarian Nordic&lt;/a&gt;.

                                        &lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (AP) — Two Californians diagnosed with mpox may be the first U.S. cases resulting from the local spread of a different version of the virus, health officials said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Long Beach Department of Health and Human Services this week confirmed the first case through testing at a state lab. Los Angeles County health officials on Thursday reported a second, similar case. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The risk to the public is low, officials say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are not the U.S. first cases of what is known as clade I mpox. But all six previous cases were among international travelers who were believed to have been infected abroad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both infected people in California were hospitalized, and they are now recovering at home. Officials declined to give other details. But “at this point in our investigations, we have not identified any association between the two cases,” Long Beach health department acting public affairs officer Jennifer Ann Gonzalez said.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;Long Beach is located in Los Angeles County but has its own city health department. Investigators there say they have not found a close contact who traveled abroad, nor have they confirmed additional cases. A few of the person’s close contacts have been given a vaccine, said Nora Balanji, the Long Beach department’s communicable disease coordinator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We don’t have any proof that there has been ongoing community transmission,” she said. “It’s something we’re looking into. That’s something we’re concerned about.”&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/africa-mpox-outbreak-who-f1c5d501223ccf3b53c6d9a2727d5c8a"&gt;Mpox&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — also known as monkeypox — is a rare disease caused by infection with a virus that is in the same family as the one that causes smallpox. It is endemic in parts of Africa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Milder symptoms can include fever, chills and body aches. In more serious cases, people can develop lesions on the face, hands, chest and genitals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One version of the virus — called clade II — was the source of an international health crisis in 2022, when infections escalated in dozens of countries, mostly among men who have sex with men. At one point, the U.S. &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/monkeypox-public-health-emergency-us-f336fc99abd57f0866a38b578d5bb44c"&gt;was averaging&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; close to 500 cases per day.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;The infections were rarely fatal, but many people suffered painful skin lesions for weeks. Those outbreaks waned &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/monkeypox-health-medication-public-313a2781a28f6b17230843432a609118"&gt;later that year&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, thanks in part to the Jynneos vaccine made by Bavarian Nordic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other version — known as clade I — likewise can spread through sex, but also through other forms of contact. In Africa it has infected a broader range of people, including children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A newer form of the clade I virus has been widely transmitted in eastern and central Africa. The World Health Organization declared the situation a public health emergency, but last month it said the problem &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/mpox-health-world-health-organization-c39dea7fa56622eaab680bcb2ad7eeec"&gt;had waned enough&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; that it was no longer an international emergency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, “it’s concerning if this virus has come here and now is starting to be transmitted from person to person,” said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious diseases expert at Vanderbilt University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case report comes amid a federal government shutdown and the layoffs of hundreds of employees at the Atlanta-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — the agency that usually would be involved in responding. &lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;Balanji said a few CDC experts have been available to talk to her department about the situation. But Schaffner noted that “the longer the shutdown, the more impaired public health responses are to any outbreaks.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A U.S. Department of Health and Human Services spokesperson referred questions to local health officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;___&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="optimizelyHubpeekId" class="optimizelyHubpeekClass"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

    &lt;p&gt;The demand for protein has soared as 61% of consumers in the U.S. increased their protein intake last year, according to new research from Minnesota-based food corporation &lt;a href="https://www.cargill.com/doc/1432277049818/the-2025-protein-profile.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Cargill&lt;/a&gt;. And social media influencers and brands alike are taking note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're seeing that influencers, fitness professionals – they're all encouraging more protein after lifting," said Yasi Ansari, a clinical dietician at UCLA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The protein boom&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Protein is now a $114 billion industry and growing, &lt;a href="https://store.mintel.com/report/us-proteins-and-protein-alternatives-market-report" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;according to Mintel&lt;/a&gt;, a global market intelligence company. The number of high protein shakes and drinks on the market rose by 122% from 2020 to 2024, Innova Market Insights &lt;a href="https://www.innovamarketinsights.com/trends/protein-beverages-trends-global-market-overview/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;, noting that Gen Z is driving most of the online chatter around the beverages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chains like &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/starbucks-protein-lattes-cold-foam-menu-september-29/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;Starbucks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, Dutch Bros, Smoothie King and others recently introduced protein-packed options and add-ons to their menus. PepsiCo CEO Ramon Laguarta also said protein would be a big focus for the company, telling investors in July that "consumers are adopting protein solutions in the diet at a pace that was not the case in a few months back, a few years back."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Protein, an essential nutrient, certainly has health benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It's the building block of your bones, muscles and other organs, and getting enough is crucial for keeping your body working properly," Christine Byrne, a registered dietitian and owner of &lt;a href="https://rubyoaknutrition.com/about/christine/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Ruby Oak Nutrition&lt;/a&gt;, said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ansari noted it also helps to build enzymes, support hormone health and provide a structural component to hair, skin and nails.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But "today's wellness culture tends to overestimate the amount of protein most people actually need," Byrne said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ideally the source of your protein is whole foods, instead of powders and supplements, registered dietitian Helen Tieu said.&lt;/p&gt;

A total of 23 protein powders and shakes were tested as part of their &lt;a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/lead/protein-powders-and-shakes-contain-high-levels-of-lead-a4206364640/?EXTKEY=M5ANXO" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;investigation&lt;/a&gt;, which determined that more than two-thirds of the products contained unsafe levels of lead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For people who are able to reach their protein targets from whole foods, protein powders and supplements are not necessary," Tieu said. "Limit protein powder intake to an occasional use when necessary. Whole foods also provide more nutrients and keep us full for longer, compared to an isolated protein powder supplement."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For some people — including those with certain medical conditions or competitive athletes — protein supplements can be more crucial, Byrne said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Although I'd caveat that this generally isn't the case for everyday exercisers, even those who hit the gym or the trail daily," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How much protein is really needed in a diet?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For growing children and adolescents, protein provides the building blocks for muscle, bones, skin and hormones. Getting enough protein is also essential for older adults. It can help preserve strength, maintain bone density and reduce the risk of age-related injury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Government guidelines suggest most adults aim for about 0.8 grams per kilogram of body weight. For example, someone who weighs 150 lbs would need about 54 grams of protein — this is what's in about 6 ounces of cooked chicken breast, Byrne said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We want to look for high quality sources," Ansari said. "So those are generally speaking animal protein. Now another way to do this is by combining beans and grains and making it a full meal."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Byrne said you can calculate your estimated protein needs by consuming 0.36 grams of protein per pound of bodyweight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That calculation is an oversimplification, and many people need more protein than this. But the idea that you need to slam a protein shake before and after every workout just to meet your needs and reach your goals is totally wrong," she said.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High-protein foods&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;"To boost protein intake from whole foods, make sure to include protein at every meal, and aim for a minimum of 20 grams per meal to boost muscle protein synthesis," Tieu suggests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some protein-rich foods include: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Meats, with options like chicken and turkey leaner than beef&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fish and seafood, like tuna, salmon, shrimp and scallops&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Greek yogurt and &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/social-media-health-trends-experts/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;cottage cheese&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Eggs, or egg whites for less cholesterol&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Milk or soy milk&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tofu and tempeh&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Beans, lentils, chickpeas and edamame&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Whole grains&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Megan Meyer, a science communication consultant with a doctorate in nutritional immunology, said she aims to have both snacks and meals that include protein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Some of my favorite protein-rich snacks include Greek yogurt, cottage cheese, a handful of nuts, meat sticks and hard-boiled eggs," she said. "My go-to proteins for meals include lean meats like chicken breast, canned tuna, beans, lentils and tofu."&lt;/p&gt;

Her initial daily targets were 1,200 calories, at least 50 grams of &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/dietitian-tip-fiber-high-protein-diet-rcna214084" target="_blank"&gt;protein&lt;/a&gt; and low levels of carbs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-56d6be" class="body-graf"&gt;“He went over the foods I like, what I should take out and what I added back in eventually,” she says. At first, she stopped eating carbs like pasta and bread, then later she modified the way she added them back in. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-77c6cc" class="body-graf"&gt;“Part of my Italian culture is that pasta would be your main dish,” she says. “Instead of having pasta four or five times a week, I would have a small portion as a side dish.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-8035c9" class="body-graf"&gt;Instead of frying, she now grills, steams, broils or uses an air fryer. She switched to vegan butter. “There were a lot of little changes in my food and how I prepared it,” she says. “You don’t realize it, but with just one tablespoon of regular butter, you’re adding all these extra fats.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-156fd8" class="body-graf"&gt;She eats smaller meals throughout the day to make sure her blood-sugar levels stay even. In a typical day, she might have:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul id="anchor-837822" class="break-above body-ul body-list-el"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Breakfast: &lt;/strong&gt;A protein shake with a heaping tablespoon of peanut butter, plus supplements — collagen, MCT oil, vitamin D, vitamin C, a multivitamin, a &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/food/10-good-prebiotic-foods-add-your-grocery-list-today-t216012" target="_blank"&gt;prebiotic&lt;/a&gt; and a&lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/probiotic-foods-rcna30830" target="_blank"&gt; probiotic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mid-morning snack: &lt;/strong&gt;Almonds.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lunch: &lt;/strong&gt;Salad with tuna or another type of fish.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Afternoon snack: &lt;/strong&gt;Yogurt or a piece of fruit.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dinner: &lt;/strong&gt;Grilled chicken, steamed vegetables and another side.

And they told me there was a good chance I would have another stroke within six months, but that has never happened,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-76a11f" class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;She connects with support, and builds her confidence&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-03e03d" class="body-graf"&gt;Szalay weighs herself every week, on Saturday mornings: “I had a huge group text with family, friends and colleagues. That support system was &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/walking-saved-al-rokers-life-5-mindset-motivation-tips-rcna186157" target="_blank"&gt;key to motivating me&lt;/a&gt;. Every week I would get on the scale and tell them what I lost and what I weighed. I would get claps and hearts, and that’s what kept me going. Everyone needs a support system. You can’t do it alone.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-96f767" class="body-graf"&gt;As she started to lose the weight, her confidence grew. “I still relied on that support system, but it started to transfer over to me. I felt like I could do this. I’m confident now that I can do this on my own,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-8e1661" class="body-graf"&gt;That confidence gave her a sense of purpose. “I wake up and say, ‘What can I accomplish today?' There are goals I strive for. Before, I was waking up, doing the same routine, going to school and teaching. Now I feel like I have a purpose,” she says.”I would like to be an inspiration to others as that one woman on the beach was an inspiration to me.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>TODAY.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 16 Oct 2025 19:35:15 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiuwFBVV95cUxOZ0Zkd1dYSWR1b0E1Z1NEZF93WV9mcjZidUhla2M3NlM4SnZpZlFDWUg0d2R0QXdISEJVS01kRTI2VGh0NFZ5U1E2SE5VUFhoc2ZXRE9VeEdCQS1mc3Z2YXllclVfaTZvaTBHNG9uQlJzV1RXQzlpWnBPcndsVThWVndkZm9Qc050akUyWWR4dXdSakhrczdROGt0SXVYRmJyM2JTWFBHVmJoZHZsWTVGdlZzQlZub1dwbVFn0gFUQVVfeXFMT3ExUDNRMURsU240dDQ0ME1mTFhHb1RrU09rQko3ZkJzc19HLXNRMzZha1hncExkN01xYXo4bzcwN2VvUHM3c1VDVU82NXQ3VW85R3hf</guid></item><item><title>缺失的蛋白质可能是恢复老化血细胞活力的关键- Medical Xpress</title><link>https://medicalxpress.com/news/2025-10-protein-key-rejuvenating-aging-blood.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="mt-4 article-main"&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;As our hair goes gray and our muscles weaken with age, our immune system also changes. In particular, the stem cells that become blood or immune cells can develop mutations, potentially leading to cancers or other dysfunctions.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                &lt;p class="w-100 my-4 d-print-none"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;  
                                         
										

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Researchers at the University of Illinois Chicago have discovered an important cellular mechanism that drives this aging: the lack of a protein called platelet factor 4, whose levels decrease with age, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1182/blood.2024027432" target="_blank"&gt;they report&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;i&gt;Blood&lt;/i&gt;. What's more, adding this protein to old blood cells reversed these signs of aging, which points to a promising therapeutic target for preventing or improving age-related disorders in the blood and immune systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hematopoietic stem cells, also known as &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/blood+stem+cells/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;blood stem cells&lt;/a&gt;, are a special type of cell that live in the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/bone+marrow/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;bone marrow&lt;/a&gt; and can develop into the ever-important blood and immune cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our hematopoietic stem cells are very rare," said UIC's Sandra Pinho, associate professor of pharmacology and regenerative medicine in the College of Medicine. "We call them the Holy Grail of the immune system."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a young body, hematopoietic stem cells can easily generate both major groups of blood cells: myeloid cells, which include some immune cells, as well as &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/red+blood+cells/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;red blood cells&lt;/a&gt; that transport oxygen; and lymphoid cells, which include the T and B cells that protect us from infections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as the body ages, the hematopoietic stem cells are more inclined to become myeloid cells and make fewer and fewer lymphoid cells. This, in turn, changes how aging people's immune systems act.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;"That's one of the reasons why, normally, older individuals are not used as donors for &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/bone+marrow+transplantation/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;bone marrow transplantation&lt;/a&gt;, because their stem cells are not as potent," Pinho said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In mice and in human bone marrow samples, Pinho and her colleagues discovered that platelet factor 4 is heavily involved in this aging process. In young mice and people, platelet factor 4 acts as a messenger, telling hematopoietic stem cells, especially the ones that generate myeloid cells, to stop multiplying and preventing them from proliferating out of control. With age, the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/immune+cells/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;immune cells&lt;/a&gt; produce less platelet factor 4, allowing them to proliferate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"When stem cells start to divide more often than they should, and if their proliferation is not regulated, they can accumulate mutations over time," said Pinho. In humans, these mutations can lead to inflammation, increase the risk of blood cancers, and even contribute to cardiovascular disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But incredibly, the scientists found that supplying platelet factor 4 to older mice undid signs of aging in their &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/hematopoietic+stem+cells/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;hematopoietic stem cells&lt;/a&gt;. They gave the animals a blood infusion of platelet factor 4 every day for over a month and found that their immune and blood cells appeared and acted much younger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same was true when the researchers added the protein to older human &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/stem+cells/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;stem cells&lt;/a&gt; in experiments in the lab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It rejuvenated the aging of the blood system," Pinho said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though the effect was strong, &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/platelet/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;platelet&lt;/a&gt; factor 4 won't be a silver bullet that reverses the aging of all tissues and prolongs the lifespan of elderly human patients alone, Pinho said. But it could be a component of other rejuvenation methods to positively affect age-related diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It's clear evidence that it's possible to reverse, intrinsically, certain age-associated disorders," Pinho said.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reprinted with Permission from &lt;a href="https://www.worldatlarge.news/2025/10/16/well-exercised-mice-passed-natural-fitness-to-their-male-offspring-but-not-through-dna/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;World at Large&lt;/a&gt;…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if there were a way that didn’t involve CRISPR to give your offspring a natural talent for athletics?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well that’s totally possible as it turns out, because scientists just demonstrated it in mice, and it didn’t even involve so-called “good genes”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It involved a modern and exciting field of genetic biology called epigenetics: a term that refers to adaptations to genetic expression in response to life stressors. Here, the actual nature of the DNA doesn’t change, but adaptations packaged in the similarly important RNA made their way into sperm cells, the embryo, and the offspring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story of this fascinating innovation begins in Nanjing University, where lead investigator on the study Xin Yin used to notice during his time as an undergraduate that the children of athletes seemed to possess a natural talent for sports. The reproductive biologist didn’t really see the sense in it; certainly, genes coding for larger lung volume would increase a child’s ability to run, but what could explain having a ‘knack’ for what takes months and years of training to master? There’s no gene that codes for having a knack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pgs-dpg-flex" data-pgs-partner-id="good-news-network"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This curiosity led Yin to launch a research project with a fellow reproductive biologist at Nanjing to see whether a male mouse’s mastery of treadmill running could somehow imprint onto his offspring. Together with his co-authors, Yin subjected male mice to treadmill work everyday for 2 weeks before breeding them with female mice who did not exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413125003882?__cf_chl_tk=c9kzXKQan2ZWc25o1TcSWXzB3pZpaNuh5vWUUE9PO90-1760620819-1.0.1.1-AGlOF8TRukCrycqrwbGjDW3zJDLMWW0AOlYzUgfqVzE#sec3" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;they found&lt;/a&gt; was remarkable. The mice thusly born possessed more oxidative muscle fibers, could run for longer on treadmills, and were more resistant to weight gain from a high-fat diet, than the offspring of sedentary male and female mice. During the study period, Yin and his team sequenced the microRNA snippets in the sperm cells and the fertilized egg, and after observing the significant athletic adaptations, went back to see what might be causing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exercise boosts the levels of a protein called PGC-1 alpha in muscle cells, where it activates genes that build more mitochondria, the organelles responsible for cellular energy and metabolism. PGC-1A is suppressed by another protein called NCoR1. In the exercised mice, sperm-bound microRNAs which proliferate under conditions of exercise target, once inside the mouse embryo, NCoR1. In effect, these RNAs released a natural, cellular brake on the development of metabolic power and muscle function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A true breakthrough&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To triple check whether or not classic genetic transfer was behind this adaptation for countering NCoR1, the researchers looked through 10 of the microRNAs that seemed most likely confer the exercise benefits, selected one in particular, and injected it into embryos fertilized by untrained fathers. Just that action alone, a single, non-DNA molecule, was enough to reproduce the endurance benefits seen in trained fathers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biologists &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/well-exercised-male-mice-appear-pass-fitness-their-male-offspring?utm_source=sfmc&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_content=alert&amp;amp;utm_campaign=DailyLatestNews&amp;amp;et_rid=545277073&amp;amp;et_cid=5754571"&gt;commenting&lt;/a&gt; on the study to &lt;em&gt;Science Magazine &lt;/em&gt;said they were “surprised” that a single RNA could have such an impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that in mind, and to investigate whether similar effects were at work in humans, the team collected sperm from 8 men who trained regularly and 24 others who didn’t. An examination revealed that the equivalents of 7 of the 10 miRNAs seen in the mouse model were elevated in the sperm of trained men.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s the first study to show that RNA can pass down the benefits of exercise, commented Colin Conine, an epigeneticist at the University of Pennsylvania, who was not involved in the work but who called it “really a novel paradigm”. It probably suggests that the lifestyle choices of fathers need to be looked at with more scrutiny than in the past, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Caveats included that the endurance/exercise benefit was only seen in male offspring, suggesting the sperm microRNAs only make it through the paternal germline. Grandchildren never received the benefit their parents did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yin’s study couldn’t go so far as to investigate the mechanism behind the transfer: why and how did exercise affect sperm? How did the microRNAs pass through the blood-testes barrier? How did they reach the epididymis, the tubes where sperm cells mature? They had time and data to present two hypotheses: that exercise codes for the creation of small-extracellular vesicles which themselves have the capacity to bring microRNA through the testes-blood barrier, or that within the blanket hormonal response of exercise, steroids and thyroid hormones may alter microRNA expression in sperm directly, without relying on the blood stream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors are now extremely curious to know what other effects microRNAs packaged in sperm cells are having on the father’s offspring. &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WaL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Using a genome-wide epigenetic analysis, scientists identified four key methylation sites—ATE1, SERPINB9P1, CHST11, and FOXP1—linked to maltreatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Changes in FOXP1 were especially important, correlating with reduced gray matter in brain regions tied to emotion and memory. These findings highlight how early trauma imprints itself on both biology and behavior, paving the way for early detection and trauma-informed care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Epigenetic Evidence:&lt;/strong&gt; Four DNA methylation sites were identified as biological markers of child maltreatment.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FOXP1’s Role:&lt;/strong&gt; Hypermethylation of FOXP1 was associated with brain changes in regions involved in emotional and social processing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Predictive Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; A methylation risk score (MRS) successfully distinguished individuals with a history of maltreatment.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Fukui&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Child maltreatment, which includes abuse and neglect, is one of the most serious public health concerns worldwide. These adversities leave a lasting impact on the emotional well-being, memory, and social development of affected individuals. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem, however, reaches far beyond its psychological impact, affecting the brain and biological processes through genetic changes, which have remained unclear until now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-113417"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/epigenetics-child-abuse-neurosience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/epigenetics-child-abuse-neurosience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/epigenetics-child-abuse-neurosience-770x514.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/epigenetics-child-abuse-neurosience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/epigenetics-child-abuse-neurosience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/epigenetics-child-abuse-neurosience-293x196.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/epigenetics-child-abuse-neurosience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/epigenetics-child-abuse-neurosience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain and DNA." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/epigenetics-child-abuse-neurosience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/epigenetics-child-abuse-neurosience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/epigenetics-child-abuse-neurosience-770x514.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/epigenetics-child-abuse-neurosience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/epigenetics-child-abuse-neurosience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/epigenetics-child-abuse-neurosience-293x196.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/epigenetics-child-abuse-neurosience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;While the researchers identified four different sites, the site FOXP1 was particularly significant as it acts as a “master switch” for the genes involved in brain development. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent study led by Senior Asst. Professor Shota Nishitani and Professor Akemi Tomoda from the Research Center for Child Mental Development at University of Fukui, Japan, in collaboration with Professor Masataka Nagao from the Department of Forensic Medicine, Graduate School of Biomedical and Health Sciences, Hiroshima University, Japan, reveals that child maltreatment leaves measurable biological “scars” on children’s DNA, leading to long-term alterations in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings of the study were published in Molecular Psychiatry on September 16, 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their research builds on earlier findings from Prof. Tomoda’s group, which had revealed that child maltreatment can alter DNA. Unlike previous studies that focused on specific candidate genes, this current work employed a broader genome-wide approach, revealing novel molecular markers and directly linking them to brain structure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Briefly, the researchers conducted a detailed analysis of the epigenome (a set of chemical “switches” on our DNA that regulate gene activity) across three different groups to identify biological markers linked to childhood maltreatment as trauma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants included those in judicial autopsy cases, as well as toddlers and adolescents who had undergone protective interventions, with the adolescents also undergoing brain MRI scans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We identified four DNA methylation sites that were consistently associated with child maltreatment, namely ATE1, SERPINB9P1, CHST11, and FOXP1,” explains lead author, Senior Asst. Professor Nishitani.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DNA methylation sites are key players in genetic regulation, as they can regulate the gene expressions without changing the underlying DNA sequence. While the researchers identified four different sites, the site &lt;em&gt;FOXP1&lt;/em&gt; was particularly significant as it acts as a “master switch” for the genes involved in brain development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that hypermethylation of &lt;em&gt;FOXP1&lt;/em&gt; was linked to changes in gray matter volume in the orbitofrontal cortex, cingulate gyrus, and occipital fusiform gyrus of the brain regions which are responsible for emotional regulation, memory retrieval, and social cognition. This highlights the biological link between early trauma, brain development, and later mental health outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Childhood trauma is not only a painful psychological experience but also leaves lasting biological marks at the molecular and brain levels,” explains Prof. Tomoda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By identifying these epigenetic markers, we hope to develop new tools that can enable the detection and support of at-risk children as early as possible.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To use their discovery for predictive analysis, the researchers created a methylation risk score (MRS) using the four identified DNA methylation sites. The score could successfully distinguish individuals with and without a history of maltreatment using external data independent of their own, suggesting its potential as an objective screening tool for identifying childhood trauma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The significance of this discovery extends to multiple fields, including healthcare, forensic medicine, and public health policies. In healthcare, these biomarkers could help improve early diagnosis and personalized trauma-informed treatment approaches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While in forensics, it could help support investigations and support child welfare. Furthermore, the screening tools may also drive preventive care, reducing the long-term societal impact of maltreatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With these implications, the study also reflects the mission of the Division of Developmental Support Research at the University of Fukui, which integrates neuroscience, clinical practice, and community-based approaches to promote resilience and well-being for children and families.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The center is dedicated to advancing the science and practice of child development and mental health, and focuses on early detection, intervention, and prevention of developmental and mental health issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Childhood should be a time of safety and growth,” emphasizes Prof. Tomoda. “Understanding how childhood trauma affects us biologically can lead to better strategies for prevention, treatment, and support, helping break the cycle of maltreatment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Key Questions Answered:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq wp-block-yoast-faq-block"&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1760636820772"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;Q: How does child maltreatment affect the brain biologically?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;A: It causes changes in DNA methylation, especially in genes like FOXP1, which influence brain development and emotional regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1760636838686"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;Q: Which brain regions are most affected by these genetic changes associated with child abuse?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;A: The orbitofrontal cortex, cingulate gyrus, and occipital fusiform gyrus—areas linked to emotion, memory, and social cognition—show measurable gray matter alterations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1760636855518"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;Q: Why is this discovery important for mental health and child welfare?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;A: It provides biological evidence of trauma’s long-term effects and could lead to new diagnostic tools for early intervention and prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this genetics, neurodevelopment, and mental health research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#0a79796165626527614a6b6e247f276c7f617f63246b6924607a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Yuuka Kawamoto&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://u-fukui.ac.jp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Fukui&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Yuuka Kawamoto – University of Fukui&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41380-025-03236-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Multi-epigenome-wide analyses and meta-analysis of child maltreatment in judicial autopsies and intervened children and adolescents&lt;/a&gt;” by Masataka Nagao et al. &lt;em&gt;Molecular Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Multi-epigenome-wide analyses and meta-analysis of child maltreatment in judicial autopsies and intervened children and adolescents&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Child maltreatment (CM) is associated with adverse physical, psychological, and neurodevelopmental outcomes later in life. Epigenetic modifications, particularly DNA methylation, have been proposed as potential mechanisms underlying these long-term effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To identify robust CM-associated methylation signatures, we conducted epigenome-wide analyses across three independent cohorts: judicial autopsy cases (CM:11, Controls:7), toddlers shortly after social intervention (CM:36, Controls:49), and adolescents who underwent brain MRI (CM:61, Controls:62).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each cohort was analyzed separately, followed by a meta-analysis to identify common methylation sites associated with CM exposure. The meta-analysis identified four significant CpG sites located within the &lt;em&gt;ATE1&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;SERPINB9P1&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;CHST11&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;FOXP1&lt;/em&gt; genes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among these, methylation of &lt;em&gt;FOXP1&lt;/em&gt; was consistently associated with structural brain alterations, including increased gray matter volume (GMV) in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFrC) and middle/posterior cingulate gyrus (MPCG), and decreased GMV in the occipital fusiform gyrus (OFuG).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These brain regions are implicated in emotional regulation, memory retrieval, and social cognition, suggesting a potential neurobiological mechanism linking CM to later psychopathology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, methylation risk scores (MRS) derived from these four CpGs successfully discriminated individuals who experienced early-life adversity in an independent validation dataset, achieving an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.672, highlighting their potential utility as biomarkers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gene ontology and pathway analyses revealed enrichment of cholinergic and glutamatergic synaptic transmission pathways, supporting their involvement in traumatic memory formation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our findings provide novel insights into the epigenetic mechanisms underlying CM and identify potential biomarkers for early detection, prevention, and therapeutic intervention, ultimately contributing to breaking the intergenerational cycle of maltreatment.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Thu, 16 Oct 2025 17:59:07 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMic0FVX3lxTE1KMWlEbzROblB4VF9UckdHT2tPV2ctNGYyelpLbi1kWk9ieDBhYURLandaSXlvT3E2NFBtSFpjMWhjeld4SG0xdmRuWm9yaTBqMGFwdlNneDZPZUoxUUw3UFYzcElRSzk4ZUFCTktaUEJpeVE</guid></item><item><title>根据新的定义，现在有数量惊人的美国人被认为是肥胖的- Gizmodo</title><link>https://gizmodo.com/a-staggering-number-of-americans-are-now-considered-obese-under-new-definition-2000673086</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content prose dark:prose-invert lg:prose-xl "&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If you’ve ever wondered, even briefly, whether you have obesity, you might want to double-check right about now. New research suggests that over two-thirds of Americans are considered obese under criteria released this year—well above the obesity rate based on the older standard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers at Mass General Brigham examined health records from a large, diverse sample of Americans. They found that nearly 70% of people met the new criteria for obesity, which takes into account other measurements besides body mass index. Those only classified as obese under this new definition still had a higher overall risk of health problems than nonobese people, suggesting the expanded criteria can help doctors better catch these issues before they worsen, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“Our findings suggest that the new obesity definition effectively stratified individuals at high-risk of organ dysfunction and long-term complications,” the authors wrote in their paper, &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2840138"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; Wednesday in JAMA Network Open.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Beyond BMI&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;In January 2025, a large group of obesity experts around the world backed by the Lancet &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/say-bye-to-just-bmi-experts-call-for-a-major-shift-in-how-we-measure-obesity-2000549992"&gt;pushed&lt;/a&gt; for a dramatic change in how doctors diagnose the condition. It was the culmination of a long-running movement by some doctors and patients to think beyond BMI. Their newly devised criteria, &lt;a href="http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2213858724003164"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in a report that same month, was endorsed by many health- and obesity-related organizations, including the American Heart Association in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;BMI is calculated using a person’s weight and height. And traditionally, obesity is defined as having a BMI of 30 and over. The updated definition doesn’t entirely abandon BMI but rather calls for doctors to use other bodily measurements, either alongside BMI or in place of it. These other measurements are waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio, waist-to-height ratio, and the DEXA scan (a test that directly measures a person’s bone density and body fat).&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The criteria authors argued that their new definition makes it easier for doctors to determine when someone has excess body fat, one of the main reasons why obesity can negatively affect health. They also stated their criteria can better capture cases of clinical obesity—obesity especially likely to be harmful and raise the risk of other serious health problems—than the old BMI-only system. But the researchers say theirs is the first study to comprehensively examine the implications of applying this criteria in the real world.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;Hidden obesity&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers examined data from the All of Us program, a long-running federal initiative to collect detailed health information from a diverse group of Americans. All told, they looked at the long-term health outcomes of over 300,000 American adults.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Under the old criteria, 42.9% of people in the sample were considered obese, a percentage in line with the national obesity rate &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db508.htm"&gt;tracked&lt;/a&gt; by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (a smidge over 40%). But under the new criteria, the percentage of obese people rose to 68.6%, including 36.1% who were considered clinically obese.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Nearly all the people who met the old standard of obesity continued to be included under the new framework of using BMI plus another measurement. And just about all the extra new cases of obesity involved people who appeared to have “normal” BMI but had elevated levels of the other measurements. Importantly, people with less stereotypical obesity were still more likely to have organ dysfunction and a later risk of diabetes than people not classified as obese under the new definition. That said, people with classic obesity still seemed to have a higher risk of these health problems than people with obesity who had a normal BMI.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The results indicate that this new criteria isn’t excluding people who would have been diagnosed obese in the past—a finding supported by other &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/bmi-is-actually-pretty-accurate-at-measuring-american-obesity-study-finds-2000594382"&gt;recent research&lt;/a&gt;. Moreover, it should help doctors identify people with hidden excess body fat and obesity, the researchers say. Ideally, this earlier detection can then help doctors prevent or better manage people’s obesity-related complications like diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“Identifying excess body fat is very important as we’re finding that even people with a normal BMI but with abdominal fat accumulation are at increased health risk,” said co-lead author Lindsay Fourman, an endocrinologist at MGB’s Department of Medicine, in a &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2025-10-adults-definition-obesity.html"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; from the hospital. “Body composition matters—it’s not just pounds on a scale.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If widely adopted, this new system could pose some unique wrinkles of its own, though. The authors note that about a quarter of people with clinical obesity in the study wouldn’t be eligible for newer obesity medications like GLP-1 therapy, for instance. And while clinical trials have found that these drugs are substantially effective for people with classical obesity, it’s an open question as to how beneficial they would be for people who don’t fit the traditional standard of obesity.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“Thus, implementation of the new framework may have significant ramifications for patients, including existing GLP1RA users, and creates a compelling need to evaluate use of antiobesity medications within this redefined target population,” the authors wrote.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes! This meal plan is meant to serve as inspiration. It doesn’t need to be followed exactly to reap the benefits. When choosing recipes, we made sure to check the calories, fiber, protein and sodium to align with the parameters of this plan and be within our sodium limits. If you’re making a recipe swap, it may be helpful to choose a recipe with similar calories, fiber, protein and sodium levels. For more inspiration, check out these delicious &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipes/22762/nutrient-focused-diets/high-protein/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;high-protein recipes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_2-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Definitely, it’s fine to eat the same breakfast or lunch every day. The breakfasts range from 318 to 421 calories while the lunches span 395 to 479 calories. These ranges are fairly close, though if you’re closely monitoring your calories or other nutrients, like protein, you may want to adjust a snack or two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_3-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We no longer provide modifications for 1,200-calorie days in our meal plans. The 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans suggests that limiting calories to 1,200 per day is too low for most people to meet their nutritional needs, plus it’s unsustainable for long-term health and well-being.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_4-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many plant and animal sources of protein that can be included every day. Animal sources of protein include foods such as beef, chicken, fish, eggs, pork and turkey. Plant sources of protein can include foods like nuts and nut butters, seeds and seed butters, beans, lentils, legumes and even vegetables!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_161-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Though factors like family history and genetics can play a role in developing insulin resistance, there are steps you can take to reduce the risk. Nutrition strategies are beneficial, like aiming for regular meals and snacks to promote stable blood sugar levels and prevent eating too much, which could be caused by skipping meals. Opting for a high-fiber, high-protein diet, cutting back on &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8047875/what-are-refined-carbs/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;refined low-fiber carbohydrates&lt;/a&gt; (such as white flour), and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/67340/how-to-cut-back-on-sneaky-added-sugars/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;reducing added sugars&lt;/a&gt; can also help. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_162-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_163-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While all these strategies can benefit your blood sugar levels, one lifestyle intervention is “probably the best way to combat insulin resistance,” and it’s exercise.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Physical activity improves insulin resistance by making the body more sensitive to insulin. It helps move glucose out of the blood and into the muscles for energy, lowering blood sugar levels. Work up to an ideal goal of 150 minutes a week of moderate-intensity exercise, such as a brisk walk.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; If that seems like a daunting goal, don’t fret.

Since then, that number has stuck. But the study had limitations, with researchers only looking at the affect creatine had on muscular performance, while women, older adults or vegans – who don't get creatine from their regular diet – weren't accounted for either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="piano-paywall-container" data-node-id="11" class="piano-container"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-node-id="13" class="body_content_break_3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="14" class="css-m281hg emevuu60"&gt;'Five grams per day is a great start, but it’s optimised for skeletal muscle only,' Dr Darren Candow, who authored the aforementioned narrative review, said on a &lt;em data-node-id="14.1"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICsO-EHI_vM&amp;amp;t=1s" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICsO-EHI_vM&amp;amp;t=1s" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="FoundMyFitness" data-node-id="14.1.0" class="body-link css-1d8p8n5 emevuu60"&gt;FoundMyFitness&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;podcast.&lt;em data-node-id="14.3"&gt;&lt;/em&gt; 'If you want full-body benefits – bone, brain, immune, anti-inflammatory – you’ll need more.' He also highlighted how studies that highlight creatine's ability to improve brain function, reduce oxidative stress and even support neuroplasticity used more than 5g.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;section data-node-id="16" data-lazy-id="P0-12"&gt;&lt;h2 title="How Much Creatine Do We Need?

So, if you weigh 70kg, a more optimal amount to take is 7g per day. The review suggests that could even rise to 0.14g per kilo of body weight when taking into account bone benefits in healthy older adults, while the minimum required for brain function is 4g per day – though that figure should be increased during acute stress, such as when sleep deprived, to as much as 20g. &lt;br data-node-id="18.1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-node-id="19" class="body_content_break_5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="20" class="css-m281hg emevuu60"&gt;'At 10 grams per day, you’re not just topping off &lt;a href="https://www.menshealth.com/uk/nutrition/a61931768/how-much-muscle-can-i-gain-on-creatine/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.menshealth.com/uk/nutrition/a61931768/how-much-muscle-can-i-gain-on-creatine/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="muscle creatine" data-node-id="20.1" class="body-link css-1d8p8n5 emevuu60"&gt;muscle creatine&lt;/a&gt;: you’re potentially reaching the bone, brain, and other tissues that are often overlooked,' Dr Candow said. 'The lowest effective dose for bone strength was 8g daily; 5g didn’t move the needle.

Having graduated from Cardiff University in 2020, and later obtaining his NCTJ qualification, Ryan started his career as a Trainee News Writer for sports titles &lt;em&gt;Golf Monthly&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Cycling Weekly&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Rugby World&lt;/em&gt; before progressing to Staff Writer and subsequently Senior Writer with football magazine &lt;em&gt;FourFourTwo&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During his two-and-a-half years there he wrote news stories for the website and features for the magazine, while he also interviewed names such as Les Ferdinand, Ally McCoist, Jamie Redknapp and Antonio Rudiger, among many others. His standout memory, though, came when getting the opportunity to speak to then-Plymouth Argyle manager Steven Schumacher as the club won League One in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having grown up a keen footballer and playing for his boyhood side until the age of 16, Ryan got the opportunity to represent Northern Ireland national futsal team eight times, scoring three goals against England, Scotland and Gibraltar. Now past his peak, Ryan prefers to mix weightlifting with running – he achieved a marathon PB of 3:31:49 at Manchester in April 2025, but credits the heat for failing to get below the coveted 3:30 mark…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="b0500eea-dfba-49eb-855b-73fd687f3a06"&gt;Eye injuries related to pickleball have increased at an "alarming rate" as the sport's popularity has exploded in the United States, a new study finds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More and more people in the U.S. are taking up pickleball as a leisure activity, with &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://sfia.org/resources/sfias-topline-participation-report-shows-247-1-million-americans-were-active-in-2024/#:~:text=For%20the%20fourth%20consecutive%20year,increase%20from%20three%20years%20ago." target="_blank" data-url="https://sfia.org/resources/sfias-topline-participation-report-shows-247-1-million-americans-were-active-in-2024/#:~:text=For%20the%20fourth%20consecutive%20year,increase%20from%20three%20years%20ago." referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;recent estimates suggesting&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that 19.8 million people participated in the sport in 2024, up about 45% from 2023 and 311% from 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-seasonal" href="" data-url="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="b0500eea-dfba-49eb-855b-73fd687f3a06-2" class="paywall" aria-hidden="true"&gt;Now, in a study published Thursday (Oct. 16) in the journal &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://media.jamanetwork.com/embargoed-articles/?_articles=1e0dd5c86e#" target="_blank" data-url="https://media.jamanetwork.com/embargoed-articles/?_articles=1e0dd5c86e#" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;JAMA Ophthalmology&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, three eye doctors found that this uptick in people playing the paddle sport has triggered a rise in related eye injuries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mid-article-leaderboard" class="ad-unit sm:hidden block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="45bce1f7-1510-4eba-9987-f7deb6790bfe"&gt;For this study, they turned to the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS), a government-funded database that documents consumer product-related injuries. &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cpsc.gov/Research--Statistics/NEISS-Injury-Data/Neiss-Frequently-Asked-Questions" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.cpsc.gov/Research--Statistics/NEISS-Injury-Data/Neiss-Frequently-Asked-Questions" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;NEISS primarily gathers its data&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from samplings of about 100 hospitals with emergency departments (EDs), which are selected as a representative snapshot of the more than 5,000 U.S. hospitals with EDs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team focused on data gathered between the start of 2005 and the end of 2024. The search turned up a total of 2,472 pickleball-related injuries to any part of the body, including 73 eye injuries. Those numbers suggest that there were about 137,470 total injuries and 3,110 eye injuries nationwide across that timeframe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notably, no pickleball-related eye injuries were reported prior to 2014, and 88% of the eye injuries reported took place between 2022 and 2024. The results suggest the rate of eye injuries increased by about 405 cases per year from 2021 to 2024, the authors calculated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 70% of all the eye injuries were reported in players ages 50 years or older, which may hint that older age groups are more vulnerable to these types of injuries due to changes in muscle mass, bone density or balance, the researchers speculated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-TJSvqkHRbs6WLusQuodPyV" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-TJSvqkHRbs6WLusQuodPyV slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In cases where the cause of injury was known, the most common mechanism was getting hit with the ball, followed by falling or getting hit with a paddle. Periocular lacerations — cuts to the area immediately around the eyeball — made up the highest proportion of reported injuries. Other minor injuries included scratches to the cornea, the clear window at the front of the eye; inflammation to the iris, the colored part of the eye; and periocular contusions, better known as black eyes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More serious injuries that could threaten a person's eyesight included hyphema, where blood pools in front of the eye; orbital fracture; retinal detachment; and globe trauma, in which the wall of the eyeball is ruptured, typically by blunt force.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study authors noted that recent surveys suggest the uptick in pickleball participation is being driven by an "influx of casual players," as opposed to "core players" who play more than eight times a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Although the increase in ocular injuries may simply reflect the increasing number of players, it is also possible that casual players are more susceptible to injury due to limited experience, unfamiliarity with the game, or lower level of physical fitness," the researchers suggested. But more data are needed to confirm that suspicion, they said in their report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="f8ab6b75-1609-47c2-808c-733c44dafb31"&gt;Notably, because the NEISS data are pulled from just a sample of EDs, they may not be completely representative of the nation as a whole, the authors added. The study also didn't capture patients who may have sought care at outpatient clinics, rather than the ED. But nonetheless, the data point to a potentially "alarming" trend, the researchers concluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Currently, no official guidelines exist regarding eye protection in pickleball," they added. The American Academy of Ophthalmology recommends that pickleball players &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.aao.org/eye-health/glasses-contacts/pickleball-eye-protection-black-eye" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.aao.org/eye-health/glasses-contacts/pickleball-eye-protection-black-eye" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;wear protective eye gear&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; during games, but this precaution is not mandated or promoted by pickleball organizations, the study authors noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Increasing awareness for age-specific risk factors and establishing standardized recommendations for eye protection may help reduce injury rates and prevent vision loss," they wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mb-6" id="f17749c4-5893-47f6-9f9d-ea69e780883e"&gt;

AIDS is considered one of the worst epidemics in human history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The number of AIDS-related deaths has steadily decreased over the years, thanks to awareness campaigns, education and prevention, but people are still dying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-vendor-cmp-id="c43449" data-lang-code="en" data-id="74359583" class="embed dw-widget"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;More than 800 antibodies tested against HIV&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research team, led by Florian Klein, Director of the Institute of Virology in Cologne, examined blood samples from 32 people. They were all infected with HIV, but had developed a particularly strong and broadly effective antibody response against the virus, on their own — without any medical intervention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The researchers tested more than 800 different antibodies from these blood samples for their ability to neutralize HIV.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of them, named 04_A06, stood out. The antibody blocks a site where the virus binds to cells when it infects a person. It therefore prevents HIV from entering the body's cells. When the virus enters a cell, it reprograms the cell to reproduce the virus, and that weakens the immune system in the long-term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Antibodies in &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/immune-system/t-66950642"&gt;the human immune system&lt;/a&gt; are produced by B lymphocytes, or B cells.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When B cells detect pathogens, they become plasma cells that release antibodies, such as the 04_A06 antibody discovered by the Cologne researchers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The researchers decoded this process, or "blueprint," for the 04_A06 antibody in the hope that they could reproduced it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"You use the genetic blueprint of the antibody, transfer it to a cell line in the laboratory and use another cell and tell it: Please produce this antibody," Klein told DW.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="placeholder-image master_landscape big"&gt;&lt;img data-format="MASTER_LANDSCAPE" data-id="69157342" data-url="https://static.dw.com/image/69157342_${formatId}.jpg" data-aspect-ratio="16/9" alt="Person doing an HIV self-test at home; no face visible, just hands, arms, legs and a table with the self-test equipment on it"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="img-caption"&gt;Home testing kits: It's been possible for a while now to test your blood for HIV&lt;small class="copyright"&gt;Image: ALICE/BSIP/IMAGO&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Antibody 04_A06: HIV treatment and prevention&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In experiments with mice that had been infected with HIV, the 04_A06 antibody was seen to neutralize most HIV infections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In total, the researchers ran experiments with almost 340 variants of HIV, including those that were resistant to other antibodies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"HIV has a high genetic diversity, the viruses are all quite different," said Klein. "That's what makes HIV so difficult to treat."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the 04_A06 antibody neutralized 98% of the HIV variants they tested.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The researchers said the 04_A06 antibody may be able to help people who are already infected with HIV — because it blocks the virus' access to cells.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It attaches itself to the envelope protein of the virus, so the virus can no longer infect the target cell," said Klein. In addition, viruses blocked by 04_A06 were better recognized and actively eliminated by the body's immune system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The researchers hope that 04_A06 could also prevent HIV infections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The antibody intercepts viruses before they can infect cells and multiply in the body," said Klein.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, the newly discovered antibody could act as a passive immunization. An active immunization would be a vaccine that enables the body to produce antibodies itself. But there is no HIV vaccine as yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-vendor-cmp-id="c44391" data-lang-code="en" data-id="68339716" class="embed dw-widget"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The state of HIV vaccine development and medication&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Studies into an HIV &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/vaccines-and-vaccination/t-73605776"&gt;vaccine&lt;/a&gt; based on mRNA technology are ongoing. Researchers aim to stimulate an immune response with a protein taken from the HIV envelope. That is the virus' outer coat, which, like the one of the virus that causes &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/covid-19/t-62123668"&gt;COVID-19&lt;/a&gt;, has protein spikes embedded in it that enable the virus to attach itself to cells and infect them. However, this method has so far only been tested for one HIV variant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Klein said it will be a challenge to induce the body's own production of potent and broadly neutralizing antibodies with an active vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="placeholder-image master_landscape big"&gt;&lt;img data-format="MASTER_LANDSCAPE" data-id="70324847" data-url="https://static.dw.com/image/70324847_${formatId}.jpg" data-aspect-ratio="16/9" alt="Hands holding a vial of lenacapavir "&gt;&lt;figcaption class="img-caption"&gt;HIV prevention with "depot" function: Lenacapavir is now also approved in the EU&lt;small class="copyright"&gt;Image: Nardus Engelbrecht/AP/picture alliance&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Various medicines are offered as pills or injections as a prophylactic measure against HIV infection. And they are very successful. However, the tablets usually have to be taken daily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are long-acting, injectable prophylaxis drugs, such as &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/miracle-hiv-drug-lenacapavir-approved-amid-drastic-us-health-budget-cuts/a-73023089"&gt;lenacapavir&lt;/a&gt; or cabotegravir, that create a "depot" function in the body. The depot allows the body to release the active ingredient slowly. And that means you only need two injections per year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Klein said the idea behind antibody prophylaxis with 04_A06 was, "that you [could] do without tablets, because you would have a more than 90% chance of preventing an infection." An antibody prophylaxis using 04_A06 would have to be taken approximately every six months, much like lenacapavir.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span data-slot-id="Article_InContent-1" class="rich-text-ad"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Alternatives to the 04_A06 antibody&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Researchers have found other broadly &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/hiv-cure-research-progress-2025/a-71445979"&gt;neutralizing antibodies against HIV&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Alexandra Trkola, Director of the Institute of Medical Virology at the University of Zurich said, "04_A06 is definitely an extraordinarily potent representative of this group."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The antibody's potency determines how many — or how few — of the antibodies are needed to create a strong effect. This is important if the Cologne discovery is to become a drug that is administered by injection, for example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Potency also determines how often you would need an injection. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Theoretically, 04_A06 alone achieves an efficacy that is otherwise only achieved in antibody combinations," said Trkola, who was not part of the research in Cologne.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it will probably be a while before 04_A06 becomes a drug, said Christoph Spinner, Head of Infectiology at the &lt;em&gt;Klinikum rechts der Isar&lt;/em&gt; at the Technical University of Munich (TUM).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Cologne study has so far only involved laboratory data, said Spinner, who was also not involved in the research. "So, the effectiveness cannot be directly transferred to real life."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further studies on the dosage, people's tolerance to it and its efficacy would need to follow, he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trkola agreed it was not yet possible to predict whether the antibody would prove its efficacy in clinical use but added that the signs were "definitely promising."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The article was originally published in German and translated into English.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;div class="intro"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's something fascinating about watching someone in their seventies navigate a smartphone with more ease than their middle-aged children. Or the grandfather who picks up conversational Spanish just because.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These signs of something deeper—a kind of mental resilience that has less to do with luck and more to do with how you approach everyday life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. Learning new things for no practical reason&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My neighbor is 73 and just started learning to play piano. Not because she needs to, not because anyone's watching. She heard something that made her curious and went for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When older adults take on genuinely new skills—woodworking, astronomy, a language—their brains show increased activity in &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8151174/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;memory networks&lt;/a&gt; that usually quiet down with age. The trick is that it has to be *new*. Doing the same crossword format you've done for twenty years doesn't cut it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. Actually wanting to hear what younger people think&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some septuagenarians talk to their kids and grandkids out of obligation. Others are genuinely curious what a 25-year-old thinks about dating apps or the housing market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That curiosity across generations keeps something important flexible in the brain. Research shows that older adults with &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/bonds-that-transcend-age" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;age-diverse friendships&lt;/a&gt; do better on tests of mental agility. You're literally exercising your ability to see from different angles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3. Figuring out tech without having a meltdown&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look, nobody loves it when their bank changes the app interface again. The difference is in how you respond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sharp 70-somethings treat confusing technology like a puzzle rather than a personal insult. They poke around, ask questions, maybe get frustrated but keep going. That willingness to experiment matters. &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S266703212300001X" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Technology use&lt;/a&gt; in older adults tracks with better executive function—your ability to plan, focus, and juggle tasks. The tech itself is less important than the mindset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4. Being willing to be wrong&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know someone who spent decades convinced butter was terrible for you, then read new research and just... changed her mind. No drama, no doubling down. Just "huh, I guess I was wrong about that."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people get more rigid in their thinking as they age. But being able to update your beliefs when you learn something new? That's a sign your brain is still operating at a high level. The willingness to be wrong keeps your mind loose in ways that matter for everything else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;5. Getting randomly curious about weird topics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You're at dinner and someone mentions how octopuses think, and instead of politely nodding you actually want to know more. Or you hear about some historical event and find yourself Googling it later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That instinct to follow curiosity—even when it's impractical—predicts how well your brain ages. The 70-year-olds who are still wondering "why" and "how" about random things are keeping neural pathways active. Curiosity isn't just nice to have; it's doing actual work in your brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;6. Doing things that feel a little awkward&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people's comfort zones shrink over time. Fewer new restaurants, fewer unfamiliar places, fewer situations where you might look foolish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cognitively sharp ones lean the other way. Travel somewhere you don't speak the language. Try a cuisine that seems bizarre. Go to a lecture on something you know nothing about. These novel experiences create what's called &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrn.2017.45" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;neuroplasticity&lt;/a&gt;—your brain forming new connections. Mild discomfort is actually good for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;7. Reading or watching things that make you think hard&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's entertainment that washes over you, and there's stuff that makes your brain work. Long articles about evolution or economics. Documentaries where you can't check your phone. Books that require real attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you regularly engage with complex ideas, you're building something called crystallized intelligence. Unlike other cognitive abilities that fade, this one can actually get stronger if you keep challenging it. The catch is you have to actually challenge it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;8. Still giving a damn about what happens next&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one's subtle. It's not about forced optimism. It's about maintaining real interest in the future—what your grandkids will do with their lives, how technology might change things, plans you want to make for next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When older adults keep that forward-looking mindset, they perform better on cognitive tests. It's like your brain needs something to reach toward. The moment someone decides the interesting part is over, things start to slide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Final thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of this guarantees anything—genetics matter, and brains are complicated. But these habits definitely stack the deck in your favor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What strikes me most is how simple these things are. Not expensive supplements or complicated programs. Just staying curious, staying open, refusing to let your world get smaller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 70-year-olds with unusually sharp minds aren't doing anything mysterious. They're just still interested. Still learning. Still reaching for what they don't understand yet. That reaching might be the whole game.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;span class="editor-note__prefix"&gt;EDITOR’S NOTE:&lt;/span&gt;  The podcast Chasing Life With Dr. Sanjay Gupta explores the medical science behind some of life’s mysteries big and small. You can listen to episodes &lt;a href="https://swap.fm/l/cldw101425" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgsjybhb001w27nn22wic507@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;(CNN) — &lt;/strong&gt;Nobody ever wants to hear they have cancer, but when it strikes a young person, the news is perhaps even more devastating because everything about the future they were imagining and working toward is thrown into question.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgslcanv00023b6nzwrrpv0l@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Unfortunately, early-onset cancer —  disease   in people younger than 50 years old — is being &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/16/health/early-onset-cancer-increase"&gt;diagnosed more frequently&lt;/a&gt;, according to &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12082829/" target="_blank"&gt;various&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2808381" target="_blank"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt;. And among early-onset cancers, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/01/health/colorectal-cancer-statistics-2023-report/index.html"&gt;colorectal cancer&lt;/a&gt; hovers near the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9177054/" target="_blank"&gt;top of the list&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgslcanv00033b6ngkk7j59e@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It was shocking to see that a young person — perfectly fit and healthy, no risk factors, no family history — could be diagnosed with Stage 4 disease. And then it just became more and more common, which is also distressing,” Dr. Kimmie Ng told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta recently on his podcast, Chasing Life.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgslcanv00043b6n5fd9epcq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Ng, a gastrointestinal oncologist and associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, has been treating patients for two decades at Boston’s Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, where she is the founding director of the Young-Onset Colorectal Cancer Center, one of the nation’s first centers that treat younger adults with the disease.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgslcanv00053b6n08193x21@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The incidence of both colon and rectal cancer has been increasing by about 2% per year in younger people since the mid-1990s, Ng said, noting that it’s happening to both men and women, not just across the United States but globally, too.&lt;s&gt;&lt;/s&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgskb62a000t3b6nje3v4pkn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s difficult to receive a cancer diagnosis no matter what age you are, but younger people face really different challenges,” Ng said. “Eighty percent have children under the age of 18. They’re also caring for elderly parents. They’re in the midst of their careers. Some people are still getting education. Some people are still planning to expand their families.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgsldczr00083b6n83to3p0s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/html-embed/instances/cmgsleds8000c3b6nyfqbzhlu@published" class="html-embed" data-editable="settings" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
     
&lt;/p&gt;


    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgsl8im600003b6nijt494s8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Early-onset colorectal cancer is already the leading cause of cancer-related death in the US in men &lt;a href="https://acsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.3322/caac.21820" target="_blank"&gt;younger than age 50&lt;/a&gt;, and if the trend continues, Ng said, it will become the leading cause of cancer death in women under 50 by 2030. (After breast cancer, colorectal cancer is the second leading cause in younger women now.)
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgslfz5u000i3b6nmwz8l2f3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            She points out, however, that in absolute numbers, these cancer cases in younger people are “still quite small,” noting “it is still relatively rare to develop any of these cancers at a really young age.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgslfz5u000j3b6nl4glc8b1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Across all ages, colorectal cancer cases and related deaths in the US have been declining for decades, Ng said, attributing that success to improvements in treatment and public health efforts to promote screening. “But that benefit has not been seen in people under the age of 50,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgskfvcs000w3b6nvhwrbjt3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In 2021, the &lt;a href="https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/colorectal-cancer-screening" target="_blank"&gt;US Preventive Services Task Force&lt;/a&gt;, an independent board of medical experts, lowered the recommended age to start screening for colorectal cancer in asymptomatic people of average risk from 50 years old to 45.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgslgr1j000m3b6n3rbftqrw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But Ng doubts the panel will lower the age again soon, noting not only the relatively small absolute numbers but also other factors that go into implementing a successful screening program, such as cost and the risks associated with screening, including bleeding, sedation complications and false positives.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgslgr1j000n3b6n1ceizw7v@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Instead, Ng believes the focus should be on figuring out why this surge in early-onset colorectal cancer is happening. “What are the risk factors?” she said. “Who is at risk, and can we tailor that high-risk 30-year-old for earlier screening?”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgslgr1j000o3b6njtzj3tsr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Also important: More people need to &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/04/health/colorectal-cancer-screening-trend"&gt;get screened. &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgslgr1j000p3b6n10fitjoy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There was this effort to get 80% of the population screened in the United States, but we haven’t yet reached that goal,” Ng said. “And so it is really important that we continue public health efforts to really advocate that screening can be lifesaving and it really needs to be done.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgsljzg600163b6nsiagyw7y@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            What do you need to know about early-onset colorectal cancer? Ng shares five things that matter.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgslhgz0000s3b6nh47huqrw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Many types of cancer are rising among young people around the world, Ng told CNN via email, but cancers of the digestive system are rising most rapidly. That includes colorectal cancer, pancreatic cancer, gastric cancer and biliary tract cancer.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgslhgz0000t3b6nvycd9rku@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Early detection is critical. And knowing the &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/latest-news/signs-and-symptoms-of-colon-cancer.html" target="_blank"&gt;red-flag symptoms&lt;/a&gt; associated with colorectal cancer is essential, Ng said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgslv5yj00283b6nxjjgldfk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “For young people … the most predominant presenting symptom is seeing blood in the stool. For example, if you see blood that’s actually mixed into the stool rather than sitting on top of it or in the toilet bowl or just on the toilet paper. If it’s mixed in the stool, that’s perhaps a little bit more concerning and a little bit more characteristic of a malignant cause.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgslhgz0000u3b6nq49ed9g4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Unintentional weight loss is another red-flag symptom, Ng added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgslhgz0000v3b6nha2rywh1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Other common symptoms include prolonged changes in bowel habits, such as new diarrhea or new constipation, thinner stools and abdominal pain. In addition, fatigue could indicate anemia or low red blood cell counts.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgslhgz0000w3b6ni18asc8y@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            No matter how uncomfortable these conversations might be, Ng said it is crucial to discuss any changes in bowel habits with your doctor.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgslkh1p00193b6n656r92az@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            With each generation, the risk has gone up, Ng observed.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgslkh1p001a3b6n5tdrfuio@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The increase in young-onset cancers is generational, with every generation after 1950 experiencing rising incidence,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgslkh1p001b3b6nruu4qs8y@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “For example, someone born in 1990 now has &amp;gt;4x (greater than four times) the risk of developing rectal cancer and &amp;gt;2x (greater than two times) the risk of developing colon cancer compared to a similarly-aged person who was born in 1950.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgslkh1p001c3b6nuw0f32nm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “When we see these … effects, what it usually suggests is that there’s some environmental exposure or exposures that have happened recently that are contributing to that rise,” Ng told Gupta on the podcast. “So, the big question now is what are these things that are actually leading to this increasing incidence in young people?”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgslkh1p001d3b6nfnity0i6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Researchers have been trying to pinpoint the drivers of   this unsettling trend.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgslkh1p001e3b6n1hqqeiza@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The cause of the rising rates of young-onset cancers is thought to be due to environmental factors,” Ng said, noting that our genes could not have changed so much in 30 years to be the culprit.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgslkh1p001f3b6np01m5oe4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Environmental factors might include obesity, sedentary behavior, and diets that are high in red meat, processed foods, added sugar and sugar-sweetened beverages.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgslkh1p001g3b6n3wd5wn8a@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The leading hypothesis has been obesity,” Ng told Gupta, adding that the obesity rates   in the US, which “have been skyrocketing in recent decades,” seem to parallel the rise in young-onset gastrointestinal    cancers, which include colorectal cancer. Obesity increases body-wide &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/11/health/colon-cancer-omega-6-ultraprocessed-food-wellness"&gt;inflammation, which can set the stage&lt;/a&gt; for precancerous changes.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgslkh1p001h3b6nakdsnuqt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Nevertheless, Ng said, most younger colorectal cancer patients she and her colleagues are seeing are not obese. “Many are marathon runners, they’re triathletes, they’re eating really healthy, they eat organic — and yet they’re still being diagnosed with young-onset   colorectal cancer.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgslkh1p001i3b6nau8ln0ni@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The influence of other environmental factors are still being studied, Ng said, citing &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/24/health/microplastics-food-packaging-study-wellness"&gt;microplastics&lt;/a&gt; as one example. Exposure to toxins and diet in the first decade of life can also &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40691977/" target="_blank"&gt;affect the microbiome&lt;/a&gt;, allowing certain cancer-promoting microbes to take hold.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgslkh1p001j3b6nm0lfi7py@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We are still in our infancy in understanding whether those are true risk factors, whether there is a link and actually how do they actually lead to cancer, in terms of these biological mechanisms.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgslkh1p001l3b6n613u45f7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Most cases of early-onset cancer are not explained by a heritable factor, but Ng said those diagnosed with any cancer at a young age have a higher chance of being diagnosed with a hereditary syndrome, such as &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/lynch-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20374714" target="_blank"&gt;Lynch syndrome&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/familial-adenomatous-polyposis" target="_blank"&gt;familial adenomatous polyposis&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgslkh1p001m3b6n6aeyqr3r@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “All young patients diagnosed with cancer should undergo familial genetic testing,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgslkh1p001n3b6n4zsqbe94@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It is also important to know your family history of cancer, Ng said. “If there is a family history, then an individual may be eligible for cancer screening, or eligible to start cancer screening at a younger age, and this could be life-saving,” she noted.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgslkh1p001p3b6n56h02ekz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If you have been diagnosed with any cancer, being young has its advantages, Ng said. Younger patients tend to be healthier, for one. They are more likely to withstand higher doses and more cycles of chemotherapy compared with older patients, and they can undergo surgery and radiation more often as well.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgslkh1p001q3b6nzp913lcl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Nevertheless, Ng, said, “their survival   is not necessarily better than that of an older patient with cancer.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgslkh1p001r3b6nad16lo7l@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            She noted that for colorectal cancer, “the very youngest patients” — those younger than age 35 — “seem to have shorter survival.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgslkh1p001t3b6n2huyrhl8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Ng  reiterated the importance of screening at the appropriate age for your level of risk: 45 if you are of average risk, and earlier if you have a family history.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgslkh1p001u3b6nyv3lag3e@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            She also stressed how crucial it is to put embarrassment and stigma aside and to reach out to your doctor, and even a family member, if you are having unusual symptoms, like those mentioned above.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgslkh1p001v3b6ngk18h03k@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s so important that we try to normalize these conversations,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgslkh1p001w3b6n33gdl0xz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            She added she also would like to see physicians routinely and systematically ask their patients two questions: “‘Are you having blood in the stool? Are you having a change in your bowel habits?’ so that these symptoms can come to light.” Especially because many people are reluctant to bring them up themselves.

ROACH: I am a 64-year-old male who is a lifelong endurance athlete. For the past 15 years, my primary activities are cycling and swimming. I work out around 10 hours a week now, so it’s nothing really excessive. But I always push myself to the edge of what’s a comfortable pace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-1" data-gaid="inarticle-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="5ETYQWKB5FEXPIUFP6NLWMNX6I"&gt;My lifelong cardio exercise enthusiasm has resulted in my pulse being low. My resting pulse is 47-48 bpm, and at times, it will go even lower. Normally this is a sign of good health, but now that I’m older, I wonder if this is too much of a good thing. My blood pressure is not especially low (136/76 mm Hg), and I am in otherwise very good health. Is a low pulse a concern now that I’m a senior citizen? -- B.L.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-2" data-gaid="inarticle-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="YK3AGU7ZIZGPJNWG7YO3OITAYM"&gt;ANSWER: You are exactly right that a slow heart rate in an athlete is normally the sign of a healthy heart. However, you are also right that too slow of a heart rate, especially in older people, can be a problem. The most critical issue is the presence of symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-3" data-gaid="inarticle-3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="NQ77K2QFUVHJPICKNT6TM2XXLY"&gt;For many people, the symptoms can be subtle. They notice that they get tired a little more easily, which they will often believe is due to being older. (As a side note, is 64 really a senior citizen? Sixty-four seems younger the older I get.) Lightheadedness, feeling like you are going to faint, and actually fainting are more likely to bring a person to see their doctor to make the diagnosis. This will often bring about a recommendation to treat the slow heart rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-4" data-gaid="inarticle-4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="KZARPG46YJFRPIREA4S3J3ACDM"&gt;For an athlete like you, another critical issue is your heart’s ability to exercise at a high level. You probably know what your times are for cycling and swimming, and if you find that you aren’t able to meet these times with the same effort, this could be a sign that your heart is affected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-5" data-gaid="inarticle-5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="RTCGXH5JSFEZBPTSXBYU3OB4KM"&gt;When the pulse is very low, in the low 30s or slower, most experts will recommend treatment even if a person isn’t noticing symptoms. It’s likely they will feel better after treatment (which is almost always a permanent pacemaker) and only realize afterward how affected they really were.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-6" data-gaid="inarticle-6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="GFTB2Z6A2VFVBP56VZDQK7SKBQ"&gt;So, if you aren’t having symptoms and are performing near your usual level, I wouldn’t worry too much, and I don’t recommend that you reduce your exercise. An electrocardiogram (EKG) to be sure that there is not something else going on (like heart block), as well as thyroid blood tests, would probably be prudent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-7" data-gaid="inarticle-7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-enter:CKO4P4ZQQVGLJG2F6XF7ROMKAI" data-fusion-component="CKO4P4ZQQVGLJG2F6XF7ROMKAI"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-exit:CKO4P4ZQQVGLJG2F6XF7ROMKAI" data-fusion-component="CKO4P4ZQQVGLJG2F6XF7ROMKAI"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-8" class="middleParagraph" data-gaid="inarticle-8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="KVF24K3KTZDAFKOSBLDSBTYRO4"&gt;DEAR DR. ROACH: How often should adults get a tetanus booster? -- A.T.B.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-9" data-gaid="inarticle-9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="F54RPT5KQNAOTGK4PVSWHYLPZE"&gt;ANSWER: Adults who completed the primary series for tetanus and diphtheria should get a booster dose every 10 years. For a person who has a minor wound without contamination from dirt, they should only get the vaccine if they had it more than 10 years ago or if it is unknown whether they had the complete series.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-10" data-gaid="inarticle-10"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="RYXFPLLUMFARHDLO36HIHM3JDE"&gt;A person with a tetanus-prone wound, or any wound that isn’t both minor and clean, should get a tetanus booster if they haven’t had one in five years, as long as they completed the primary series. People who are not known to have had the primary vaccine get both a tetanus booster and human tetanus immune globulin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-11" data-gaid="inarticle-11"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="X74J4OXTCBEAZAXCR3IRZSHLUQ"&gt;I can’t emphasize enough how important it is to be up-to-date with your tetanus vaccine. Tetanus is often called the “unforgivable” disease because it is much better to prevent than it is to treat. In a country with a working health care system, nobody should get tetanus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-12" data-gaid="inarticle-12"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="LZRU77OJG5GO7G7H7BQWJAMDJI"&gt;In adults, tetanus is combined with diphtheria (“Td”) or with diphtheria and pertussis (“Tdap”).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-13" data-gaid="inarticle-13"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="GQQTVV5TKBCAXLQ2RP5L7PHGFA"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dr. Roach regrets that he is unable to answer individual letters, but will incorporate them in the column whenever possible.
