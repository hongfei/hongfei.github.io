&lt;p&gt;Jacqueline Mills is used to seeing spots — but this one was different.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The 32-year-old public school teacher rushed to a dermatologist after a small mark suddenly appeared on her right cheek, the threat of skin cancer weighing on her mind.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But instead of a diagnosis, Mills got dismissed. “They were worried about me getting a scar on my face and not wanting to test it,” she told The Post. “That’s when I sought a second opinion.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Melanoma is on the rise among young women, including survivors like Jackie Mills. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Jacqueline Mills&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s a good thing she did. Tests at Mount Sinai revealed the spot was stage zero melanoma, a deadly form of skin cancer that’s been rising rapidly in young adults, especially women.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Known for spreading quickly throughout the body, melanoma can become life-threatening in as little as six weeks if left untreated.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Mole patrol&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With a family history of melanoma, Mills was no stranger to skin checks and gets a full-body scan from her dermatologist once a year.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;While she’s “covered with spots,” the mark on her cheek stood out when it began to change and grow rapidly. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The first thing I noticed was that there was some discoloration, one side of it was lighter than the other side, ” Mills said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“What really set me off was that the borders were very jagged and irregular. The shape was also strange, it wasn’t a perfect circle,” she added. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;A brown, irregularly shaped spot with jagged edges appeared on Mills’ cheek.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Those are classic red flags for skin cancer, said &lt;a href="https://profiles.mountsinai.org/jesse-miller-lewin" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Dr. Jesse Miller Lewin&lt;/a&gt;, vice chair of surgical operations and system chief of the Division of Dermatologic and Cosmetic Surgery at Mount Sinai Health System.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He told The Post that one easy way to remember the warning signs is to follow the ABCDEs of melanoma:&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt; is for asymmetry: Cancerous moles tend to be misshapen.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B&lt;/strong&gt; is for border: Melanomas often have jagged, uneven edges.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;C&lt;/strong&gt; is for color: Look out for lesions that are more than one color or shade.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;D&lt;/strong&gt; is for diameter: Spots larger than 6 mm (about the size of a pencil eraser) are a concern.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;E&lt;/strong&gt; is for evolution: Changes in a mole’s size, shape or color can signal danger.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“A history of change or “evolution” of an existing pigmented lesion is the most predictive sign of melanoma among all the ABCDE criteria,” Lewin said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;No moles? That doesn’t mean you’re off the hook. Most melanomas appear as brand-new spots on previously clear, healthy skin. The cancer can develop anywhere, including the eyes, scalp, nails, feet and even inside the mouth.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Face to face with cancer&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Melanoma may be one of the deadliest skin cancers. However, if caught early, it’s highly treatable.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Melanoma signs include changes in the size, shape or color of a mole or new skin growth. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Pixel-Shot – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;





&lt;p&gt;When diagnosed at stage zero, the five-year survival rate is over 99%. But once it spreads to distant organs and body parts, like the lungs or bones, that number nosedives to just 35%, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/melanoma-skin-cancer/detection-diagnosis-staging/survival-rates-for-melanoma-skin-cancer-by-stage.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;American Cancer Society&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It was a blessing and a curse that this was on my face,” Mills said. “It made it harder to remove, and I do have a scar, but I think it’s why I noticed the changes so quickly and they caught it at stage zero.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I think if this spot was in a different part of my body, I wouldn’t have noticed how quickly it was changing and it could have been a very different outcome for me,” she added. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Within weeks of her diagnosis, Mills underwent Mohs surgery at Mount Sinai. The highly technical procedure involves removing skin in layers, examining each under a microscope until all the cancer cells are gone while preserving as much healthy tissue as possible.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Dr. Jesse Lewin removed Mills’ melanoma with minimal scarring. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Mount Sinai&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Melanoma has cells that can be visible on slides under the microscope extending beyond what you can be see with the naked eye,” Lewin said. “If cells are left behind the melanoma can get deeper or spread to lymph nodes.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Though the original spot was tiny — no bigger than the top of a push pin — by the time Lewin was done removing the cancer, Mills had a wound about the size of a quarter on her face.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-pullquote"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You look at your skin every day. If you sense something is wrong, no one is going to judge you for going to the doctor and having it looked at.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Jacqueline Mills&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It took about a year for the wound to fully heal and the scar to fade. To minimize it, she turned to laser treatments and silicone scar cream.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;“Now most people can’t even really tell that I have a scar,” Mills said. “The only people that know are the people that knew me at the time, it’s healed really, really nicely.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Scan it, spot it, stop it&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now 34 and cancer-free, Mills sees the dermatologist twice a year and uses advanced technologies like the Vectra scan to monitor any changes in her skin.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“When you get a full body yearly scan, you’re relying on your dermatologist to record and remember your moles and your spots from the year before,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Vectra WB360 scan, by contrast, is a 3D whole-body imaging system with more than 40 cameras that can document all of your freckles, moles and other growths in a matter of minutes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The Vectra body scanner at Mount Sinai is the only device of its kind in New York City.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;





&lt;p&gt;“If you’re someone with a skin type that has a lot of spots, this is a really good option because it’s an added layer of protection,” Mills said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Now you can have the doctor’s eyes and a computerized scan of your entire body, which can measure the size and the pigment and the type of spots that you have and compare them from year to year,” she added. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you’re average risk for skin cancer, get a full head-to-toe check by a dermatologist once a year, according to Lewin. But if you’ve got a history, he recommends going twice.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But you don’t have to wait for your annual appointment to stay on top of your skin.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Doctors are an important tool, but you are your first line of defense when it comes to dermatology,” Mills said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Doctors recommend that people regularly conduct self-exams for melanoma. &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“You look at your skin every day. If you sense something is wrong, no one is going to judge you for going to the doctor and having it looked at,” she added. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you run into a dismissive provider like Mills did, don’t back down.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Hesitation when it comes to melanoma could be the difference between a simple removal and getting chemotherapy, because that’s how quickly it moves and how deadly it is,” Mills said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Lewin echoed her warning.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Trust your gut — if a lesion on your skin is new or changing and you are concerned, see a dermatologist,” he said. “If you remain concerned after seeing one doctor, get a second opinion. Because [Mills] did that, it saved her life.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;If you’ve had melanoma before, you are more likely to develop it again.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The dark side of sun kissed&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Melanoma makes up just 1% of all skin cancers, but it causes the vast majority of skin cancer deaths, according to the ACS.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;In 2025, the &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/melanoma-skin-cancer/about/key-statistics.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;group estimates&lt;/a&gt; that about 104,960 new melanomas will be diagnosed in the US, and roughly 8,430 Americans will die from it. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While melanoma risk increases with age, &lt;a href="https://meetings.asco.org/abstracts-presentations/112435" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;studies show&lt;/a&gt; that rates among children, adolescents and young adults have increased by more than 250% over the past four decades. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Soaking up UV rays — whether from the sun or tanning beds — is a major risk factor for melanoma. Having a lot of moles or lighter skin, hair or eyes increases your chances, too.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Your odds also go up if you have a weakened immune system or a family history of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;

But new research suggests that hidden deep within the body’s cellular processes, there may be a crucial trigger point – one that could be changed, paused, or even reversed. The process in question is necrosis, a form of uncontrolled cell death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study by researchers from University College London (&lt;a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;UCL&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href="https://www.linkgevity.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;LinkGevity&lt;/a&gt;, and the European Space Agency (&lt;a href="https://www.esa.int" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;ESA&lt;/a&gt;) places necrosis at the center of &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/organ-aging-can-predict-diseases-decades-in-advance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;aging&lt;/a&gt; and disease. The paper suggests that necrosis might not just be a consequence of damage. It might be a cause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-necrosis-may-be-the-trigger-of-aging"&gt;Necrosis may be the trigger of aging&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Necrosis is a chaotic form of cell death caused by stress, infection, or injury. Unlike controlled cell death, it damages nearby tissues and triggers inflammation. The study suggests necrosis is not just a final event but an active driver of aging and chronic &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/healthy-aging-how-some-people-live-past-100-years/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Nobody really likes talking about death, even cell death, which is perhaps why the physiology of death is so poorly understood. And in a way necrosis is death,” noted Dr. Keith Siew from the UCL Centre for Kidney &amp;amp; Bladder Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If enough cells die, then tissues die, then we die. The question is what would happen if we could pause or stop necrosis.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chaotic-cell-death-spreads-damage"&gt;Chaotic cell death spreads damage&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cells are the building blocks of all living organisms. Their death is &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/daily-doctor-recommended-regimen-that-could-slow-aging/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;natural&lt;/a&gt; and necessary, but only when it happens in a regulated way. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In healthy systems, cells are replaced in a clean and controlled fashion. This process, known as apoptosis, helps organs regenerate and stay functional.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Necrosis is different. It happens without order or purpose. When it occurs, cells rupture and spill their contents into surrounding tissue. This creates inflammation, spreads damage, and accelerates aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Necrosis remains one of the last frontiers in medicine – a common thread across &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/universal-rule-of-biology-sai-proposed-to-explain-aging-and-how-to-control-it/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;aging&lt;/a&gt;, disease, space biology, and scientific progress itself,” said Dr. Carina Kern, lead author of the study and CEO of LinkGevity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-calcium-imbalance-causes-cell-collapse"&gt;Calcium imbalance causes cell collapse&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the heart of necrosis is calcium, a mineral that helps regulate cell function. Normally, cells maintain much higher calcium levels outside their membranes than inside. This gradient helps control vital activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;a href="https://cff2.earth.com/uploads/2025/06/08111129/necrosis_pausing-cell-death_anti-aging-study_credit-Linkgevity_1m.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://cff2.earth.com/uploads/2025/06/08111137/necrosis_pausing-cell-death_anti-aging-study_credit-Linkgevity_1s.webp" alt="Illustration of a healthy cell (left) alongside a cell that has been affected by necrosis (right).

Click image to enlarge. Credit: LinkGevity&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;When calcium floods in, the cell collapses, spills toxins, and triggers harmful inflammation. “When cells die, it’s not always a peaceful process for the neighbors,” Dr. Siew noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-toxic-cell-death-links-diseases"&gt;Toxic cell death links diseases&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Necrosis triggers a domino &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/random-dna-mutations-shape-biological-aging/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;effect&lt;/a&gt;. As toxic materials spread, nearby cells are affected. This leads to more cell death, more inflammation, and a growing spiral of decline. Over time, the body becomes less able to repair itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study draws connections between necrosis and several chronic conditions. These include Alzheimer’s, heart disease, and kidney failure. These diseases are often seen as unrelated, but researchers argue they share a common thread: necrosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Necrosis has been hiding in plain sight. As a final stage of cell death, it’s been largely overlooked. But mounting evidence shows it’s far more than an endpoint. It’s a central mechanism through which systemic degeneration not only arises but also spreads,” noted Dr. Kern. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That makes it a critical point of convergence across many diseases. If we can target necrosis, we could unlock entirely new ways to treat conditions ranging from kidney failure to cardiac disease, neuro-degeneration, and even aging itself.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-cell-death-harms-kidneys-as-we-age"&gt;Cell death harms kidneys as we age&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among all the organs affected by necrosis, the kidneys may suffer the most. They filter blood, regulate fluid levels, and support other systems. As people age, these functions often falter. Nearly half of those over 75 show signs of kidney disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study highlights how necrosis lies at the center of this decline. Stressors such as low oxygen, oxidative stress, and toxin buildup all lead to necrosis in kidney tissues. Once it begins, it fuels a feedback loop that becomes hard to stop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“With kidney disease, there’s no one underlying reason that the kidneys fail. It could be a lack of oxygen, inflammation, oxidative stress, a build-up of toxins, and so on,” Dr. Siew explained&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“All of these stressors eventually lead to necrosis, which initiates a positive feedback loop that spirals out of control, leading to kidney failure. We can’t stop all of these stressors, but if you could intervene at the point of necrosis, you’d effectively achieve the same result.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-aging-in-space"&gt;Aging in space&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The implications of necrosis extend far beyond Earth. In space, astronauts face conditions that mimic and accelerate aging. Low gravity and cosmic radiation stress the body. Muscles waste away, bones weaken, and organs begin to fail more quickly than on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2024, Dr. Siew worked on a study that identified the human kidney as a major vulnerability during spaceflight. Necrosis appeared to play a central role. The body’s inability to manage stress in space could threaten the success of long-term missions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Damian Bailey is a professor of physiology and biochemistry at the &lt;a href="https://www.southwales.ac.uk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of South Wales&lt;/a&gt; and Chair of the ESA Life Sciences Working Group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Targeting necrosis offers potential to not only transform longevity on Earth but also push the frontiers of space exploration,” noted Professor Bailey. “In space, the same factors that cause aging on Earth are made worse by cosmic radiation and microgravity – speeding up degeneration dramatically.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-stopping-cell-death-to-support-healing"&gt;Stopping cell death to support healing&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Necrosis in vital organs triggers damage cycles that slow healing and reduce recovery capacity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In many age-related diseases – affecting diverse organs such as the lungs, kidneys, liver, brain, and cardiovascular system – relentless cascades of necrosis fuel the progression of disease,” explained Dr. Kern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is often alongside impaired healing that leads to fibrosis, inflammation and damaged cells. Each cascade triggers and amplifies the next.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If we could prevent necrosis, even temporarily, we would be shutting down these destructive cycles at their source, enabling normal physiological processes and cell division to resume – and potentially even allowing for regeneration.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41388-025-03431-y" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Oncogene&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 09 Jun 2025 09:17:12 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipAFBVV95cUxOcWkydlNIWllwN0FhWmxvTms0a09uYS1Xa2dDWGRDVnh4eEh2dGJHNERqZ1U0TzI4ZHZ1ZmxzamQ2aVo3RXJRekF0MVJiOGQ0ZExhYlVmOFpMZWN2NWF5bkRVenlHWEpqZmdFdjAtNWdKZi1uX1NHMjQ1WGZReDVMbGJ4ZGVzcXlRWVh3aE1OYVRHODZmbEg3aEpRa3M2QWZJdHBtcQ</guid></item><item><title>鸡胸肉有多健康？ -《纽约时报》 | How Healthy Is Chicken Breast? - The New York Times</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikAFBVV95cUxQMGM1d0VzaVowU3V3NFV0amFWejMzcjB0enptVC1hdFFhVk1zTEdZTEc4ZmJLRTVYcFN5d0dEY2ZtXzY1eUktOHlfSi0zLVNmTDh1YlZkQ3RYV1ZRV25jUjc1V3ROeWlab2xuV0JJODJ6bTdIbXdyQ3E0blM1Vm9lOE1xcVljUlAycmwzYUZYZXk?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-0"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;All cuts of chicken are great for you, but on a number of metrics, the humble breast takes top prize. Along with containing nutrients that are involved in repairing the body’s tissues, building immunity and boosting energy, chicken breast is lower in saturated fat than thighs, legs and wings, making it a smart choice for people concerned about their heart health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Here are a few ways that chicken breast benefits your body, along with some recipes from &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/68861692-nyt-cooking/465934-chicken-breast-recipes" title=""&gt;New York Times Cooking&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;h2 class="css-1u37br4 eoo0vm40" id="link-26284069"&gt;It’s one of the best food sources of protein.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;On a per-calorie basis, there aren’t many whole foods richer in protein than chicken breast. “You’d have to eat protein powder to get more protein,” said Dave Bridges, a biochemist and associate professor of nutritional sciences at the University of Michigan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;There are no carbohydrates and little fat in chicken breast, especially if you remove the skin, said Heidi Silver, the director of the Diet, Body Composition and Metabolism Core at Vanderbilt University. One &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/331960/nutrients" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;3.5-ounce serving&lt;/a&gt; of boneless, skinless chicken breast contains about 160 calories and 32 grams of protein. That’s almost half the &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/09/well/eat/protein-fact-check.html" title=""&gt;recommended daily amount&lt;/a&gt; for the average 185-pound adult. (Some research suggests that people who do regular strength or endurance training may benefit from consuming &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/04/25/well/eat/protein-meal-guide.html" title=""&gt;more protein per day&lt;/a&gt;.) In comparison, a similar serving of &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/175168/nutrients" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;farmed Atlantic salmon&lt;/a&gt; contains about 206 calories and 22 grams of protein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;In addition to building muscle, &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/30/well/eat/protein-age.html" title=""&gt;protein&lt;/a&gt; is essential for repairing cells, making antibodies that fight disease and producing the enzymes that keep systems running. “The entire body is built from protein,” Dr. Silver said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-kbghgg"&gt;&lt;div class="css-121kum4"&gt;&lt;p class="css-171quhb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-asuuk5"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-7axq9l" data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true" class="css-1b5b8u1"&gt;&lt;path fill="currentColor" fill-rule="evenodd" d="M2.5 12a9.5 9.5 0 1 1 19 0 9.5 9.5 0 0 1-19 0Zm8.5 1.75v-7.5h2v7.5h-2Zm0 2v2h2v-2h-2Z" clip-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;div data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript-message" class="css-6yo1no"&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;We are having trouble retrieving the article content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dv1kvn" id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

&lt;p&gt;Benjamin Han, a geriatrician and addiction medicine specialist at the University of California-San Diego, tells his students a cautionary tale about a 76-year-old patient who, like many older people, struggled with insomnia.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p&gt;“She had problems falling asleep, and she’d wake up in the middle of the night,” he said. “So her daughter brought her some sleep gummies” — edible cannabis candies.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“She tried a gummy after dinner and waited half an hour,” Han said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Feeling no effects, she took another gummy, then one more — a total of four over several hours.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Han advises patients who are trying cannabis to “start low; go slow,” beginning with products that contain just 1 or 2.5 milligrams of tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, the psychoactive ingredient that many cannabis products contain. Each of the four gummies this patient took, however, contained 10 milligrams.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The woman started experiencing intense anxiety and heart palpitations. A young person might have shrugged off such symptoms, but this patient had high blood pressure and atrial fibrillation, a heart arrhythmia. Frightened, she went to an emergency room.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Lab tests and a cardiac work-up determined the woman wasn’t having a heart attack, and the staff sent her home. Her only lingering symptom was embarrassment, Han said. But what if she’d grown dizzy or lightheaded and was hurt in a fall? He said he has had patients injured in falls or while driving after using cannabis. What if the cannabis had interacted with the prescription drugs she took?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“As a geriatrician, it gives me pause,” Han said. “Our brains are more sensitive to psychoactive substances as we age.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thirty-nine states and the District of Columbia now &lt;a href="https://www.ncsl.org/health/state-medical-cannabis-laws"&gt;allow cannabis use&lt;/a&gt; for medical reasons, and in 24 of those states, as well as the district, &lt;a href="https://covercannabis.com/blog/where-is-marijuana-legal/#:~:text=Which%20States%20Have%20Legalized%20Recreational,nearly%20half%20of%20the%20country."&gt;recreational use&lt;/a&gt; is also legal. As older adults’ use climbs, “the benefits are still unclear,” Han said. “But we’re seeing more evidence of potential harms.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A wave of recent research points to reasons for concern for older users, with cannabis-related emergency room visits and hospitalizations rising, and a Canadian study finding an association between such acute care and subsequent dementia. Older people are more apt than younger ones to try cannabis for therapeutic reasons: to relieve chronic pain, insomnia, or mental health issues, though evidence of its effectiveness in addressing those conditions remains thin, experts said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In an &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/10.1001/jamainternmed.2025.1156?guestAccessKey=6fb7097a-4590-4b78-b8a5-b21f5b00def4&amp;amp;utm_source=For_The_Media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;amp;utm_term=060225"&gt;analysis of national survey data&lt;/a&gt; published June 2 in the medical journal JAMA, Han and his colleagues reported that “current” cannabis use (defined as use within the previous month) had jumped among adults age 65 or older to 7% of respondents in 2023, from 4.8% in 2021. In 2005, he pointed out, fewer than 1% of older adults reported using cannabis in the previous year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What’s driving the increase? Experts cite the steady march of state legalization — use by older people is highest in those states — while surveys show that the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8440375/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;perceived risk&lt;/a&gt; of cannabis use has declined. One national survey found that a growing &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37566411/"&gt;proportion of American adults — 44% in 2021 — erroneously thought&lt;/a&gt; it safer to smoke cannabis daily than cigarettes. The authors of the study, in JAMA Network Open, noted that “these views do not reflect the existing science on cannabis and tobacco smoke.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The cannabis industry also markets its products to older adults. The Trulieve chain gives a 10% discount, both in stores and online, to those it calls “wisdom” customers, 55 or older. Rise Dispensaries ran a yearlong cannabis education and empowerment program for two senior centers in Paterson, New Jersey, including field trips to its dispensary.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The industry has many satisfied older customers. Liz Logan, 67, a freelance writer in Bronxville, New York, had grappled with sleep problems and anxiety for years, but the conditions grew particularly debilitating two years ago, as her husband was dying of Parkinson’s disease. “I’d frequently be awake until 5 or 6 in the morning,” she said. “It makes you crazy.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Looking online for edible cannabis products, Logan found that gummies containing cannabidiol, known as CBD, alone didn’t help, but those with 10 milligrams of THC did the trick without noticeable side effects. “I don’t worry about sleep anymore,” she said. “I’ve solved a lifelong problem.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But studies in the United States and Canada, which &lt;a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/programs/engaging-cannabis-legalization-regulation-canada-taking-stock-progress/document.html"&gt;legalized nonmedical cannabis&lt;/a&gt; use for adults nationally in 2018, show climbing rates of cannabis-related health care use among older people, both in &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2820100"&gt;outpatient settings&lt;/a&gt; and in hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In California, for instance, cannabis-related &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36622838/"&gt;emergency room visits&lt;/a&gt; by those 65 or older rose, to 395 per 100,000 visits in 2019 from about 21 in 2005. In Ontario, acute care (meaning emergency visits or hospital admissions) resulting from cannabis use increased fivefold in middle-aged adults from 2008 to 2021, and more than &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40227745/"&gt;26 times among those 65 and up&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s not reflective of everyone who’s using cannabis,” cautioned Daniel Myran, an investigator at the Bruyère Health Research Institute in Ottawa and lead author of the Ontario study. “It’s capturing people with more severe patterns.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But since other studies have shown &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39112780/"&gt;increased cardiac risk&lt;/a&gt; among some cannabis users with heart disease or diabetes, “there’s a number of warning signals,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For example, a disturbing proportion of older veterans who currently use cannabis &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2833976"&gt;screen positive for cannabis use disorder&lt;/a&gt;, a recent JAMA Network Open study found.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As with other substance use disorders, such patients “can tolerate high amounts,” said the lead author, Vira Pravosud, a cannabis researcher at the Northern California Institute for Research and Education. “They continue using even if it interferes with their social or work or family obligations” and may experience withdrawal if they stop.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Among 4,500 older veterans (with an average age of 73) seeking care at Department of Veterans Affairs health facilities, &lt;a href="https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250519/Study-reveals-high-rates-of-cannabis-use-disorder-in-older-US-veterans.aspx"&gt;researchers found&lt;/a&gt; that more than 10% had reported cannabis use within the previous 30 days. Of those, 36% fit the criteria for mild, moderate, or severe &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9590423/#:~:text=DSM-5%20CUD%20criteria%20include,6)%20social%2C%20occupational%2C%20or"&gt;cannabis use disorder&lt;/a&gt;, as established in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;VA patients differ from the general population, Pravosud noted. They are much more likely to report substance misuse and have “higher rates of chronic diseases and disabilities, and mental health conditions like PTSD” that could lead to self-medication, she said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Current VA policies don’t require clinicians to ask patients about cannabis use. Pravosud thinks that they should.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Moreover, “there’s increasing evidence of a potential effect on memory and cognition,” said Myran, citing his team’s study of Ontario patients with cannabis-related conditions going to emergency departments or being admitted to hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Compared with others of the same age and sex who were seeking care for other reasons, &lt;a href="https://www.medpagetoday.com/neurology/dementia/115116"&gt;research shows&lt;/a&gt; these patients (ages 45 to 105) had 1.5 times the risk of a dementia diagnosis within five years, and 3.9 times the risk of that for the general population.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even after adjusting for chronic health conditions and sociodemographic factors, those seeking acute care resulting from cannabis use had a 23% &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40227745/"&gt;higher dementia risk&lt;/a&gt; than patients with noncannabis-related ailments, and a 72% higher risk than the general population.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;None of these studies were randomized clinical trials, the researchers pointed out; they were observational and could not ascertain causality. Some cannabis research doesn’t specify whether users are smoking, vaping, ingesting or rubbing topical cannabis on aching joints; other studies lack relevant demographic information.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s very frustrating that we’re not able to provide more individual guidance on safer modes of consumption, and on amounts of use that seem lower-risk,” Myran said. “It just highlights that the rapid expansion of regular cannabis use in North America is outpacing our knowledge.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Still, given the health vulnerabilities of older people, and the far greater potency of current cannabis products compared with the weed of their youth, he and other researchers urge caution.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If you view cannabis as a medicine, you should be open to the idea that there are groups who probably shouldn’t use it and that there are potential adverse effects from it,” he said. “Because that is true of all medicines.”&lt;/p&gt;

Some come with hidden chemicals your skin won't thank you for. Choose wisely, read the label, and protect your skin the right way," Dr. Alok Chopra wrote in the caption.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In the video, Dr. Chopra warns, "Your sunscreen could be silently harming your hormones. Most commercial &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/regular-sunscreens-not-working-here-s-why-gel-sunscreens-are-better-plus-best-options-to-try-101744110723536.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="sunscreens"&gt;sunscreens&lt;/a&gt; are loaded with endocrine disruptors and cancer-causing chemicals. When you apply them to your skin, they get absorbed into your bloodstream. So, before buying sunscreen, you must read the ingredients carefully."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sharing a list of harmful ingredients, he adds, "If you see oxybenzone, methoxycinnamate, or avobenzone, do not buy it. These are endocrine disruptors, meaning they interfere with your body's hormone balance. Also, if the label says 'fragrance,' avoid it. That one word can hide a cocktail of chemicals like phthalates and parabens, both known to disrupt hormones and linked to long-term health risks."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Which sunscreens are safer and better for your skin&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Chopra recommends opting for mineral-based sunscreens with ingredients like zinc oxide or titanium dioxide. "These sit on top of the skin rather than getting absorbed into your bloodstream. The newer formulations are lightweight, fast-absorbing, and offer a natural matte finish, without the white cast."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He further emphasises the importance of choosing the right face sunscreen, saying, "When it comes to facial sunscreens, it's even more important to choose wisely. Facial skin is thinner, more absorbent, and often exposed daily. That means any toxins in your sunscreen have a quicker path into your bloodstream. Many commercial face sunscreens are marketed as lightweight or non-greasy, but they still contain the same &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/heres-how-harmful-chemicals-in-plastic-up-risk-of-postpartum-depression-101617597854709.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="harmful chemicals"&gt;harmful chemicals&lt;/a&gt;. Instead, look for mineral sunscreens labelled 'non-comedogenic', which means they won't clog your pores. They should also be free from fragrance, parabens, and silicones."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Remember this: What you put on your skin can harm your gut just as much as what you put into your mouth. Choose consciously, your hormone health depends on it," Dr Chopra concludes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This article is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.

            When Ayva Peña got a phone at age 10, her interest in skin care skyrocketed.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmblkxdh700023j6n3rujwgyo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            At first, she bonded over it with her mother, Giselle Peña. Together, they would have spa days with face masks and take occasional shopping trips to try out new products. But when the Rhode Island mother found a $300 anti-aging face cream in Ayva’s medicine drawer, it gave her pause.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmblkxdh700033j6n9rchvn4s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I got very upset. … She’s 15 years old,” Peña said. “It says it makes your skin ageless, improves fine lines, wrinkles and firmness. I was like, ‘This is not for you, girl.’”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmblkxdh700043j6nbjsc85wj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Peña is among a growing number of parents &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/12/style/tweens-skin-care-wellness"&gt;concerned&lt;/a&gt; about how content on social media platforms is influencing children and teens into trying out elaborate, often age-inappropriate skin care products. Now, a &lt;a href="https://news.northwestern.edu/stories/2025/06/tiktok-teen-skin-care-routines-are-harmful/?fj=1#tab-panel1" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published Monday in the journal Pediatrics may confirm those parents’ worries.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmblkxdh700053j6nykq6b0w9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            After analyzing beauty routines from 100 TikTok videos by content creators ages 7 through 18, researchers found an average of 11 potentially irritating active ingredients among their regimens, many of which carry a risk of developing skin allergies and increased sun sensitivity. Only a quarter of the lengthy product lists contained sunscreens, however.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmblkxdh700063j6nou29ljul@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The majority of (children) featured in these videos didn’t have any visible acne. They had perfect, clear skin,” said Dr. Molly Hales, the first study author and a board-certified dermatologist in the department of dermatology at Northwestern University’s Feinberg School of Medicine. “For many of them, the harms probably outweigh any potential benefits.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmblkxdh700073j6nyh9hfu7e@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Between the dozens of daily serums, moisturizers, toners and cleansers featured in the videos, the average routine was six steps long, costing about $168 — with some more than $500 — for one month’s worth of product, according to the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmblkxdh700083j6ngr5gntc3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “When you have kids waking up at 5:30 in the morning on a school day to have enough time to layer on these complicated regimens, I think it becomes less about health and more (about) pursuing an idea of beauty that is unrealistic and problematic,” said Hales, who is also a postdoctoral research fellow at Feinberg. The findings raise serious ethical questions about how social media content influences young people in their everyday lives, she added
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmblkxdh700093j6nkn69iu8p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A TikTok spokesperson, noting that this type of content is “common across all media,” said the platform is only for users ages 13 and older, and any creators suspected to be under 13 are removed. Additionally, they said that TikTok works with third-party doctors and experts in adolescent development to implement safeguarding policies.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmblkxdh7000a3j6nue36falx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Most of the studied skin care routines lacked a form of sunscreen but contained products that could increase sun sensitivity and risk of skin cancer, the authors found.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmblkxdh7000b3j6nb4fc59vp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Common active ingredients found in recommended skin products were alpha hydroxy acids or AHAs, mild chemical exfoliants that help remove top layers of skin cells, Hales said. While they have the intended effect of evening skin tone and creating a more youthful appearance, they are known to make the skin more vulnerable to the sun’s ultraviolet rays.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmblkxdh7000c3j6nsbtow180@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I would recommend daily sunscreen use for all ages and regimens, but especially for those using these (AHAs),” Hales said. “It’s a necessary step to prevent permanent skin damage.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmblkxdh7000d3j6n426hne1d@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Those AHAs, as well as vitamin-based ingredients such as niacinamide, are also considered potential irritants, carrying side effects such as redness and dryness, especially with overuse.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmblkxdh7000e3j6n4vwfv49j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “In many cases, the girls may not have realized they were applying the same active ingredient again and again, which just increases the risk of irritation,” said Dr. Tara Lagu, senior study author and adjunct lecturer of medicine and medical social sciences at Feinberg.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmblkxdh7000f3j6n3897q6yd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            More than half the products contained fragrance — a common cause of allergic contact dermatitis — and 20 other inactive ingredients that are known allergens, according to the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmblkxdh7000g3j6nucebr1xy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Misinformation is a big issue on social media, but especially for these content creators younger than 18,” said Dr. Sonal Shah, a board-certified dermatologist in Cleveland and director of pediatric dermatology at University Hospitals Rainbow Babies &amp;amp; Children’s Hospital. Shah was not involved in the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmblkxdh7000h3j6nkop7rdt7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “These are sources that perhaps don’t have a scientific background and are not well read in the science behind a lot of these products, how they work, or what risks they carry,” Shah said, adding that there are board-certified dermatologists on TikTok that could offer more credible advice.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmblkxdh7000i3j6nxoujsmys@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Other concerning trends Shah has seen in her practice, but were not mentioned in the study, include mechanical exfoliants, such as scrubbing wands or cleansers containing plastic microbeads, which are often too rough for facial skin.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmblkxdh7000j3j6n1kj15vhk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The study also noted that many of the creators were offering tips relevant to those with lighter complexions, which may exclude the unique skin care considerations of darker complexions while perpetuating harmful ideals of “brighter” skin associated with whiteness.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmblkxdh7000k3j6nlh2encw5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Both Shah and Hales recommend children under 18 who are not dealing with acne use a gentle cleanser with no active ingredients, paired with a fragrance-free moisturizer and a daily mineral sunscreen.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmblkxdh7000l3j6ngbqx6v7r@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In general, children will not benefit from anti-aging products that promise to boost skin elasticity or eliminate fine lines, Shah said. In these young ages, collagen production is at the highest it will ever be.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmblkxdh7000m3j6nvwnu447l@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As children reach puberty, however, they may produce more acne-causing hormones. In those cases, Shah recommends adding an over-the-counter product with salicylic acid or a low percentage of benzoyl peroxide.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmblkxdh7000n3j6n199byr74@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Their skin care does not have to be complicated and does not have to be very expensive,” Shah said. Parents “can talk to a board-certified dermatologist or pediatric dermatologist if there are skin concerns that are significant or don’t respond to over-the-counter treatment.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmblkxdh7000o3j6n4mscjgvj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Ultimately, if parents are concerned about their child’s skin care regimen, they should talk about it, said Jennifer Harriger, a professor of psychology at Pepperdine University who studies childhood development, in a statement.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmblkxdh7000p3j6nlhc57676@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I think that it is always best to have open conversations with children about the messages they see on social media as well as their own intentions behind purchasing particular skincare products,” said Harriger, who was not involved in the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmblkxdh7000q3j6nygov5upo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s also important to keep an open mind, understanding the social dimension of youth beauty and wellness content, Hales said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmblkxdh7000r3j6nrb2ee095@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “These videos show a kind of playful self-expression that’s very appealing to this age group,” Hales said. “These are girls who are just starting to develop their own sense of independent identity, how they present (themselves) in the world, their gender identity, and in many cases what it means to be a girl in our society.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

It certainly wouldn’t be something that the young mother, who was eight months pregnant with twins at the time, would have recalled 25 years later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But today, in an exclusive interview with the Daily Mail, Kalafus remembers that childish fumble as the moment she knew, on a cellular level, that her fears that something was terribly wrong with her were well-founded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She explained: ‘It was like being stabbed. I nearly hit the ceiling because I was in such pain.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A few days later she was diagnosed with an aggressive form of breast &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-7bae9640-42f7-11f0-b8b3-4d00d0342359"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;. The fact that the diagnosis was a vindication of sorts, brought no satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Kalafus had been raising concerns over what she felt certain were abnormal symptoms throughout her pregnancy only to have them repeatedly overlooked by her doctor who, she claims, dismissed them as the baseless fears of a ‘hysterical woman.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now 56, Kalafus is chronicling her story in her new memoir, ‘Flood,’ published by Woodhall Press. She believes patients who can sense something wrong in their own bodies often know better than medical professionals in whom they place their trust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pictured: Christine Kalafus, now 56, was diagnosed with an aggressive form of breast cancer two days before she was forced to deliver her twins early&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pictured: Kalafus shows off her large baby bump in December 2000 — a few weeks before she her life-threatening diagnosis of triple-negative intra-ductal carcinoma&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Kalafus became pregnant in the Spring of 2000, a year after her husband, Greg, confessed he'd had an affair with another woman. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She explained that they were determined to save their marriage and put the infidelity behind them so when she conceived twins she hoped it would be a fresh start. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;However, when Kalafus was five-and-a-half months pregnant, she began experiencing an unpleasant sensation like someone was sticking pins or fine needles into her right breast.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She touched the breast and felt a hard, walnut-size lump.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The discovery rang alarm bells in her head. ‘I immediately thought of my paternal grandmother who died of breast cancer at 35 when I was ten,’ she said. ‘Then I reassured myself that I was only 31 so it’s unlikely to be that.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She decided to mention it during a routine check-up three days later with her OBGYN — for whom she uses the pseudonym Dr Robb in her book — who had delivered her first child in 1996.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She saw Dr Robb every three weeks because she was carrying twins and there was an elevated risk to the pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But according to Kalafus, her doctor seemed more interested in measuring the size of her stomach than listening to the concerns she was raising about her breast. He looked at the lump, she said, and touched it lightly before concluding, ‘It’s nothing. It's just a clogged milk duct.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Looking back Kalafus, a writer based in Connecticut, recognizes the blind faith she placed in the medic simply because he was the authority figure in the room. She doubted herself, not him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I saw his framed diplomas on the wall and didn’t question him,’ she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She didn’t remember lactating until she had given birth to her first child but she reasoned that perhaps she was ‘starting early’ because this time she was having twins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The doctor sent her away without giving any advice on how to deal with the clogged duct.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But, three weeks later, and still troubled by the persistent symptom, she asked about the lump once more. Again, the doctor dismissed her concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to Kalafus she raised the matter at her three subsequent consultations, to no avail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said she started to produce colostrum (the earliest nutrient-dense version of breast milk) which, she thought, backed up his diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In mid-November, Dr. Robb agreed to measure the lump. He noted that it was bigger, but still insisted it was a clogged milk duct that they should ‘just keep an eye on.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘He was like a stuck record,’ she said, adding that she felt belittled and patronized. Kalafus said, ‘I felt like a little child.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pictured: Kalafus' identical twins Parker and Spencer at 18 months old. They were born by C-section on January 4, 2001 — the same day that their mom underwent a lumpectomy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pictured: Kalafus and her twins when they were ten months. She was still recovering from her intensive seven-month chemotherapy and radiation treatment&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Yet, it bothered her that this pregnancy felt so different from her first, and she wasn’t convinced that the difference could be put down to the fact that she was expecting twins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She didn’t share her worries with her husband, Greg, who was also 56. She said, ‘I’m not someone who likes to make people worry unnecessarily and so I muscled through myself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Besides, we were both busy at work, running a household with a young child and managing the bills.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But the agony that she experienced when her young son accidentally elbowed her that day was something she just couldn’t brush off. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She booked the first available appointment with Dr. Robb, and by January 2, 2001 she was sitting in his consulting room once more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Unbelievably, her words still fell on deaf ears. While Kalafus told the obstetrician what had happened, he shuffled paperwork and appeared to listen only half-heartedly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Little wonder that Kalafus felt desperate and unheard. Thankfully, there was a nurse in the room who seemed far more engaged in Kalafus’s story than the doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Kalafus was leaving when the nurse called her back. There was a general surgeon’s office over the road, she explained, and they had managed to squeeze her in for an appointment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She was seen right away, and the surgeon performed a needle biopsy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Robb called that night after dinner. He had received the results. ‘He didn’t even say “Hello,”’ Kalafus says. ‘He said the tests were positive for cancer.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pictured: Christine, then 33, with her three sons, twins Parker and Spencer, 17 months and their older brother, Trevor, six, in 2002&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Barely pausing for breath, the doctor told her that the babies would have to ‘come out,’ adding, ‘We don’t know where else it might be.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Both Kalafus and her husband, Greg, were left to absorb the shocking news overnight before driving to the hospital the next morning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There, the nervous mother-to-be underwent a battery of routine tests such as pre-surgery blood work – and learned that the lump that had started all those weeks ago the size of a nut, had grown to the size of a golf ball.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the absence of an oncologist because everything had happened so quickly, it was left to Dr. Robb to deliver the news.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said she needed an immediate C-section ahead of a lumpectomy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Spencer and Parker were born on January 4 – at 37 weeks they were considered full term for twins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But there was no time for Kalafus to bathe in any post-birth relief or bond with newborn babies. They were taken away to the baby unit before she could even hold them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile their mother, who had undergone the caesarian under an epidural was now administered a general anesthetic for the lumpectomy which followed immediately on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When she came round after the two-hour surgery Kalafus had a ‘giant crater’ in her chest where the lump had once been.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The tumor was taken for a biopsy in case the cancer had spread. Mercifully, it hadn’t.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She was reunited with her twins and their older brother in her hospital room when, woozy from the anesthetic, she became confused when the babies were wheeled inside in their lucite bassinets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'But, when mom put them in my arms, I could smell that new baby smell and realized they were mine.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pictured: Kalafus met her newborns just a few hours after having breast cancer surgery. At first she was too woozy to realize they belonged to her&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pictured: Kalafus today. She has undergone annual mammograms since contracting breast cancer at the age of just 31. Thankfully, it had not metastasized&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Kalafus was discharged with the newborns — who were a healthy weight — four days later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Then, around a week after that, out of an abundance of caution, doctors took a number of lymph nodes from under her armpit as a pre-emptive measure to ensure the disease had not metastasized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Kalafus later found out that she had triple-negative intra-ductal carcinoma – a particularly aggressive cancer that is not responsive to hormone therapies, often diagnosed at a young age and prone to reoccurring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile Spencer and Parker were watched by her mother and aunts. They came to the family's historic house — nicknamed 'The Witch House' as a reference to its sharply pointed center gable resembling a witch's hat — while she underwent more testing and then chemotherapy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘They did a miraculous job, but I felt robbed of bonding time with my twins,’ Kalafus said, adding, ‘it was supposed to be one of the happiest times of our lives, but Greg and I were terrified about the future.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She recalled her oncologist said he wanted to get her to point that she got to see her children graduate high school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As difficult as that was to hear, Kalafus said: ‘I actually thought it was one of the most insensitive things I'd ever heard. I wasn’t just a mother, but an individual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Not only that, but I was also only 31 years old.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A six-month course of chemotherapy began in early February and her hair started to fall out after the first treatment. Next, she had 30 sessions of radiation on consecutive days of the week, with Sunday off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;With the toxic drugs flooding her system there was no question of her breast-feeding the twins as she’d done Trevor. In fact, her illness, and its treatment, impacted every part of those first few precious months with her newborns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pictured: Kalafus. Recalling her cancer treatment after her twins were born, she said, ‘it was supposed to be one of the happiest times of our lives, but Greg and I were terrified about the future’ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pictured: The so-called 'Witch House' in Connecticut where Kalafus lived with her family at the time she was pregnant with the twins and later had cancer treatment&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I was often too weak from the treatment to pick them up,’ she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She and Greg sat Trevor down to tell him what was happening. ‘We said, “Mommy needs medication to make feel her better,” and he accepted that.’ The little boy even helped her shave her head to neaten things up after most of her hair had gone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now aged 24 and 29, her sons are wholly relieved their mother, who still has mammograms every year, has not suffered a recurrence of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to Kalafus, Dr Robb — whom she didn’t challenge directly — never once expressed any remorse for his inaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said she didn’t think of taking legal action against him, partly because of the cost. ‘Nor am I a great believer in blaming people who make mistakes,' she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Instead, today Kalafus advocates for women — especially expectant mothers — to stand up for themselves in the face of medical arrogance or indifference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: ‘It's one thing for the grocery clerk not to believe you when you say the zucchini is bad, but it's another thing for a doctor to dismiss you. One is just an annoyance. The other is a possible death sentence.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

                                            minutes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="articleContainer"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weight loss: it's as simple as eating less and exercising more, right?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No. It really isn't. If losing weight takes forever but you gain weight seemingly overnight, you might actually have health problems that are thwarting your efforts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Angie Ehrenzweig is a good example of how necessary it is to overcome health problems first. Yes, she lost 100 pounds in one year — but the weight came off very slowly at first. When she showed up at &lt;a href="https://utcountyhealth.com/2-for-1-weight-loss?UTM_source=100lbs-June25" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;Health Utah&lt;/a&gt;, she was struggling with fibromyalgia, extreme fatigue, insulin resistance, depression, systemic inflammation and metabolic syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After work, she had so little energy left that she would go home and sit in her recliner the rest of the evening. She could no longer go on hikes with her friends or spend quality time with her husband and children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Her first appointment and scan&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;At her first appointment, Dr. Whit Roberts, D.C. of &lt;a href="https://utcountyhealth.com/2-for-1-weight-loss?UTM_source=100lbs-June25" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;Health Utah&lt;/a&gt; ran a specialized scan on her body. The scan is a non-invasive functional state assessment of the body which provides an immediate overview of the patient's physiology, stress, fatigue, risk factors, and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roberts was immediately able to see many physiological challenges Angie was dealing with.  Reporting her impressions of the scan Angie said, "I was blown away. I couldn't believe how much information I got and how much I learned about my health. I doubt I would have learned more with 20 blood tests and an MRI."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior to every appointment at Health Utah, patients fill out a proprietary questionnaire that can identify additional health problems that contribute to stubborn weight. The questionnaire is the result of Roberts' 28 years of experience and research. There is almost always a perfect correlation between the results of the scan and the questionnaire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roberts uses both of these to guide him through a 40-minute consultation and evaluation. Why so long? Roberts says, "The art of reviewing someone's health history is almost completely lost to medicine these days. If a test or image can't show a problem, doctors often ignore the patient's symptoms. This is really too bad. A wealth of information can be derived from listening to the patient. It simply takes a while to hear and see everything the patient has to share."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Armed with all the information he needed, Roberts prescribed a protocol of health care and weight loss for Angie. Fortunately, most of the time, his protocols can address everything he identifies in the scan, the questionnaire and the consultation. This was the case with Angie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt; Photo: Health Utah&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the time she had finished her care, she no longer suffered with the debilitating pain from fibromyalgia or struggled with crippling exhaustion. Her depression was gone. The inflammation all over her body and swelling in her legs were gone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These were signs that the more serious health concerns of insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome were resolved. Without resolving health issues first, such as insulin resistance, weight loss is very difficult. This is why Angie lost relatively little weight in the beginning of her program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is the program?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;How Roberts and his team at Health Utah addressed all of Angie's conditions is beyond the scope of this article. However, Roberts explained some of the protocols that can be employed for one of her conditions, that of insulin resistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"With insulin resistance, receptors on the outside of every cell literally change shape and no longer allow insulin to attach. This is a problem since glucose, which fuels the cell, can only enter the cell if insulin attaches," Roberts says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With insulin resistance, the sugar that is supposed to enter the cells, instead stays in the bloodstream where it causes damage. In an effort to prevent this damage, the body takes the excess sugar and stores it as fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is why you gain weight and have a hard time losing weight with insulin resistance. It's also why you have to resolve it before you spend thousands of dollars and hours of effort to lose weight," Roberts continues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are many different causes of insulin resistance such as smoking and other lifestyle choices, poor diet, stress, toxins and metabolic disorders. As such there are many ways to address it. To address toxins, for example, Roberts and his team use herbs that upregulate phase one and phase two detoxification of the liver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Supplements are also often used to keep blood sugars and insulin levels from spiking in response to food and/or stress. For certain metabolic disorders, increasing the production of the enzyme AMP can help. AMP kinase, for example, can help to resensitize insulin receptors to insulin. "We do this through the use of infrared red light and heat therapy. Since the inflammatory responses of the body can increase the production and release of stress chemicals, the use of inflammation-lowering herbs can mitigate stress," Roberts says. This is also done by identifying and removing foods that are inflammatory from the diet. Roberts also recommends occasional fasting. If you can go longer periods of time with low levels of sugar and insulin in your blood, your receptors tend to become more receptive to insulin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;First steps&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roberts and his staff set aside over an hour for testing, evaluation and consultation. To discourage reserving a time and then not showing up, a small fee of $59 is collected prior to the appointment. Your first step then is to either call (801) 609-3478 or visit &lt;a href="https://utcountyhealth.com/2-for-1-weight-loss?UTM_source=100lbs-June25" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;Health Utah&lt;/a&gt; today to schedule your testing, evaluation and consultation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Special offer&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In any health or weight loss journey, it is essential to have the help of family and friends. In a British study, researchers found that both men and women had almost twice as much success losing weight when they did it with a partner. So Health Utah is offering this, their most popular weight loss package, for $59 for two people.  You and a friend can get tested, receive a 17-page report, take the proprietary survey and get a consultation with Dr. Roberts. The scan alone is normally $300 for one person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Call  (801) 609-3478 or visit &lt;a href="https://utcountyhealth.com/2-for-1-weight-loss?UTM_source=100lbs-June25" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;Health Utah&lt;/a&gt; today to schedule your appointment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The opinions and conclusions expressed in this article are the sponsor's own and do not reflect the views or opinions of KSL.com.

This &lt;a href="/topic/breakthrough"&gt;breakthrough&lt;/a&gt; offers hope for treating the increasing rates of the disease, especially among young people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study conducted by the Cancer Research UK Scotland Centre and the &lt;a href="/topic/university-of-edinburgh"&gt;University of Edinburgh&lt;/a&gt; revealed that a critical step in aggressive bowel cancer involves cells losing their original identity, a process known as cellular plasticity. Researchers found that the disease spreads when colonic cells begin to resemble squamous cells, which form skin, or muscle cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bowel cancer is the second most common cause of cancer deaths in the UK. It claims the lives of 16,800 people in Britain, including 1,700 in Scotland, every year and is increasingly being diagnosed in younger people internationally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="article-im-prompt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent study by the American Cancer Society published in &lt;em&gt;The Lancet Oncology&lt;/em&gt; showed early-onset bowel cancer rates in adults aged 25-49 are rising in 27 of 50 countries studied, and increasing faster in young women in Scotland and England than in young men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scotland is disproportionately affected with around 4,000 people diagnosed each year overall, according to Cancer Research UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-ii" class="sc-looa6c-0 cPCVUJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest study found bowel cancer cells can adapt to resemble skin cells, which can tolerate much harsher day-to-day conditions due to their role and position protecting the outside of the body, and also muscle cells, both of which are more “robust”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 hmmOgn sc-482ou5-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="2" class="sc-482ou5-0 hoqMLc"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/01/06/12/06084509-52691c3a-1b44-43b0-99a6-c40cc53989c9.jpg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/01/06/12/06084509-52691c3a-1b44-43b0-99a6-c40cc53989c9.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/01/06/12/06084509-52691c3a-1b44-43b0-99a6-c40cc53989c9.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="The study also examined a gene called Atrx which was already associated with aggressive forms of bowel cancer" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-482ou5-1 kJMYuf" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-189956"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 bpFomM hgzWpY"&gt;The study also examined a gene called Atrx which was already associated with aggressive forms of bowel cancer&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 CXMrn"&gt; (Alamy/PA)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cellular plasticity was found to be an important element in bowel cancer metastasis – when it spreads and becomes harder to treat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers hope identifying this and preventing it could help make current treatments more effective and stop the disease from spreading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also examined a particular &lt;a href="/topic/gene"&gt;gene&lt;/a&gt; called Atrx which was already associated with aggressive forms of bowel cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using mice and human tissue samples, researchers found the loss of this gene resulted in increased metastatic tumours which spread from the bowel to the liver, lymph nodes and the diaphragm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Key to the ability of these cells to spread is that they shed their identity of colonic cells and resembled squamous cells which form skin, or cells that resemble muscle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper, “Loss Of Colonic Fidelity Enables Multilineage Plasticity And Metastasis”, is published in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;. The research received funding from the Medical Research Council and the European Research Council.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Kevin Myant, of the Institute of Genetics and Cancer at the University of Edinburgh and the Cancer Research UK Scotland Centre, said: “With more and more younger people being diagnosed with bowel cancer, it’s vital we understand how this disease grows and develops.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our research has discovered one way that aggressive bowel cancer is able to spread is by ‘shapeshifting’ to resemble skin or muscle cells rather than bowel cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This finding will hopefully allow us to develop new treatments to stop these cells changing and prevent the cancer spreading, when it becomes much harder to treat.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lead researcher Dr Patrizia Cammareri said: “Skin cells can tolerate much harsher day-to-day conditions than other types of cells – due to their role and position protecting the outside of the body – so this may be a strategy to help the bowel cancer cells become more robust and enable them to spread around the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Metastasis is a leading cause of cancer death and a key focus for cancer research, so this finding could be pivotal in halting the progression of aggressive cancer and providing better outcomes for patients.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-iii" class="sc-looa6c-0 cPCVUJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cancer Research UK director of research, Dr Catherine Elliott, said: “Diagnosing and treating cancer early and preventing spread to other parts of the body offers the best chance of a positive outcome for patients so research like this, which could lead to new ways to stop that spread, offers great hope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Bowel cancer is of increasing concern globally, which is why we invested £5.5m to the CRC-STARS initiative (Colorectal Cancer – Stratification of Therapies through Adaptive Responses) jointly led by our Cancer Research UK Scotland Institute, which will bring together more than 40 bowel cancer experts, including researchers who worked on this project, to find new and kinder ways to tackle this disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Sun, 08 Jun 2025 22:56:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikwFBVV95cUxNVl96SUVuaXJoVHNhZUtZekRRMFhnRFhubVNBQ3FHR3RwVUlGU3BHWUl1d2U5R3d5SVV1ZWRuLVAydXp1aHdXc2hsNGM2WWx4S2xpbFM0T0FuWTNFbXlZU2hUa0ZNaHYxMjJpbGNvVVNBbUdJeGRyUEFWNkdaeEZxZnN3LWFYZTBYOWpBVlFlREV0Zlk</guid></item><item><title>奥克兰公司警告说，人们在罗切斯特山医疗办公室接触过麻疹-底特律新闻 | People were exposed to measles at a Rochester Hills medical office, Oakland Co. warns - The Detroit News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi0wFBVV95cUxPR0ZzOFNYQmVqeG5fNXdodmZscHlISXREMXJTdkpTTEp3VS1SNkF5VzBGYTM2RTdsWFpMTW01OWJ4aUUxcHFheW1zaktyMGVkOWFjM3ptRXhOanplWUpCd25fZmlwUF9Pb3FTZllWcmN1SFZaM09VdFlKZW92c2l2UEY2U2xjZG9Ld3o1SUo4RnVoRzNwbFhYQk5yUUp2Y2hjRGdtcnZvdVAzOE95VjJ1elA4S2JZc3RtWVRET29LN0NIMVpYaTQwLUZ3eV9fZENJWWtn?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gnt_ar_b"&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;People who visited a Rochester Hills medical office building last week may have been exposed to measles, the Oakland County Health Division warned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Anyone who visited the medical office building at 3950 South Rochester Road between 8 a.m. and 7:30 p.m. on June 3 may have been exposed, the division said in a Friday press release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;People who are considered high-risk — such as pregnant women, unvaccinated children under 5 and people with weakened immune systems — can seek immune globulin treatment, which is effective if administered within six days of exposure, the health division said.

The state health department is monitoring for spread of the virus in the eastern Upper Peninsula, where people with measles may have exposed others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Nationwide, there have been 1,168 measles cases in the U.S. so far in 2025, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which updated its figures on June 6. There have been three confirmed deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Measles is a highly contagious disease that is spread through the air. The virus can live in the air for up to two hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Symptoms of measles include high fever, coughing, a runny nose, conjunctivitis, a splotchy red rash and tiny white spots in the mouth. They typically take seven to 14 days to appear, but could take up to 21 days after exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Measles is easily preventable with a vaccine, but vaccination rates have declined in Michigan and the U.S., particularly since the coronavirus pandemic. &lt;a href="/story/news/local/michigan/2025/04/24/michigan-headed-toward-worst-year-for-measles-in-decades-chief-medical-exec-says/83214966007/" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;During an April interview&lt;/a&gt;, Michigan's Chief Medical Executive Dr. Natasha Bagdasarian said misinformation and disinformation about the vaccines and a dearth of public health resources also are factors contributing to the uptick in measles cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The number of cases nationwide this year marks a vast increase &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;compared to recent years&lt;/a&gt;, CDC data shows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"I think it's really unfortunate that we also are seeing a lack of, or change in, federal guidance and attitude around communicable diseases, at the same time that all of this is happening," Bagdasarian said in April.

                                            minutes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="articleContainer"&gt;&lt;p&gt;LONDON — Novo Nordisk's popular weight-loss and diabetes drugs Wegovy and Ozempic may in very rare cases cause a serious eye condition that can lead to vision loss, the European Medicines Agency's safety committee said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the past, studies in Type 2 diabetes patients have linked Ozempic to the condition called non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy. But this is the first time a regulator has confirmed the side effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The condition may affect up to 1 in 10,000 people taking semaglutide, the active ingredient in Wegovy and Ozempic, as well as in Novo's other diabetes drug Rybelsus, for at least one year, the regulator said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The eye condition is the second-most common cause of blindness due to optic nerve damage, after glaucoma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This has been reported as a potential risk for some time, so I think the clinical community is relatively aware of it. I don't see this as making any major difference to prescribing patterns," said Barclays analyst Emily Field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S.-listed shares of the Danish drugmaker were up nearly 2.5% in early trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The safety agency, which started its review in December, has asked Novo to add the eye condition as a side effect of very rare frequency in the product information accompanying drugs that contain semaglutide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Novo said it would work with the safety agency to update the labels, adding clinical trials and after-market studies did not suggest a reasonable possibility that the drugs caused the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The "benefit-risk profile of semaglutide remains favorable," the company said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Novo has recently faced investor concerns that it is losing its first-mover advantage in the highly competitive obesity treatment market, leading the company to oust CEO Lars Fruergaard Jorgensen in May.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wegovy and Eli Lilly's Zepbound currently dominate the weight-loss drug market, potentially worth about $150 billion by the next decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The European Medicines Agency's safety committee said several large studies in Type 2 diabetes patients have suggested that use of Novo's drugs could raise the risk of developing the eye condition by twofold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study of nearly 350,000 diabetes patients published in March showed that the risk of developing the eye condition more than doubled after two years of treatment with Ozempic, compared to patients taking medicines from other classes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on whether the Food and Drug Administration was conducting a probe into the side effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contributing:&lt;/strong&gt; Manas Mishra&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="kt_disclaimer"&gt;

Drawing on data from more than 4,200 young adults in China, the research provides a detailed look at how family income, neighborhood adversity, and regional economic conditions relate to memory, personality traits, mental health, and brain imaging markers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings highlight that while early-life circumstances matter, socioeconomic conditions during adolescence and early adulthood may have a stronger influence on cognitive function and mental well-being. The study also identifies specific brain regions and functional networks that may help explain how socioeconomic experiences shape behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Socioeconomic status is widely known to influence a person’s physical and mental health. Lower status is linked to a range of conditions, including heart disease, depression, anxiety, and cognitive decline. But researchers have struggled to untangle the effects of different types of disadvantage—such as low family income, unsafe neighborhoods, or poor regional infrastructure—and to determine whether timing matters, for instance, whether early-life disadvantage has different effects than experiences later in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Complicating matters further, socioeconomic status is a broad and multidimensional concept. It includes not just income, but also education, occupation, social environment, and access to resources, all of which tend to be intertwined. This makes it difficult to determine which specific aspects of disadvantage are most influential—and when they matter most.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To address this complexity, the researchers behind the new study set out to isolate the effects of different socioeconomic factors and time periods. Their goal was to determine how family, neighborhood, and regional economic conditions during childhood and adolescence shape adult brain and behavioral traits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research used data from the Chinese Imaging Genetics (CHIMGEN) study, a large, nationwide investigation of healthy Chinese Han young adults aged 18 to 30. From an initial pool of more than 7,000 individuals, the researchers focused on 4,228 participants who had complete data on brain imaging, behavioral traits, and socioeconomic background. These participants were drawn from 30 different research centers across China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To capture socioeconomic conditions, the researchers collected information on 16 different indicators, including parental education and occupation, household income, family financial crises, neighborhood safety, and provincial-level resources like hospital beds and GDP. Each of these indicators was assessed for two life stages: early (ages 0–10) and late (ages 10+). This allowed the team to examine both the average effects of socioeconomic status over time and the distinct effects of early vs. later exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using statistical factor analysis, they grouped the 16 indicators into four broad dimensions of socioeconomic experience: family socioeconomic status, family adversity, neighborhood adversity, and provincial resources. Participants also completed a battery of tests assessing cognitive abilities, personality traits, and emotional well-being. In addition, they underwent advanced brain imaging, including MRI scans that measured brain structure and functional connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that different socioeconomic dimensions were linked to different aspects of brain and behavior. Family socioeconomic status—measured by income, parental education, and home resources—was strongly associated with cognitive performance and brain structure. In contrast, family adversity (such as unemployment or financial crisis) and neighborhood adversity (such as exposure to violence) were more strongly related to personality and emotional traits like neuroticism, impulsivity, and depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These associations were not uniform across time. While both early and later-life socioeconomic factors showed links to brain and behavioral outcomes, the researchers found that late-stage experiences had particularly strong and unique effects. For example, higher family income and education during adolescence and early adulthood were linked to better memory and more open-minded personality traits, even after accounting for early-life conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In terms of brain structure, higher family socioeconomic status was associated with greater volume in regions such as the cerebellum—linked to working memory—and lower volume in the medial prefrontal cortex, a region involved in self-reflection and social cognition. The researchers also found changes in white matter integrity and functional connectivity within key networks involved in executive function and attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, individuals with higher family socioeconomic status showed stronger functional connectivity in sensorimotor networks and weaker connectivity in default mode and frontoparietal networks. These differences in brain connectivity appeared to mediate the relationship between socioeconomic status and behavioral traits such as openness to experience and verbal memory performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, the study also explored how changes in socioeconomic conditions over time—so-called “mobility effects”—relate to behavior. While these mobile-specific effects were not found in brain structure or connectivity, they did appear in behavior. For example, individuals who moved into more disadvantaged neighborhoods over time tended to show higher levels of neuroticism and impulsivity and lower levels of extraversion, suggesting that worsening social environments can negatively affect personality development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To better understand how the brain might be involved in translating socioeconomic experiences into behavior, the researchers conducted mediation analyses. They found that changes in specific brain regions and networks helped explain some of the behavioral effects of socioeconomic status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, volume in a brain region that includes both the supplementary motor area and medial prefrontal cortex mediated the link between family socioeconomic status and verbal memory. Similarly, functional connectivity in the left frontoparietal network helped explain the association between higher socioeconomic status and greater openness to experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings point to possible neurobiological pathways through which socioeconomic factors influence cognition and personality, offering insights that could inform early interventions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the study is large and comprehensive, it has several limitations. One issue is that the socioeconomic data were based on participants’ recall, which may be less reliable for early childhood. The data were also cross-sectional, meaning they capture a single point in time rather than tracking changes across development. This limits the ability to draw firm conclusions about causality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another limitation is that the brain imaging data, while extensive, focused on specific types of structural and functional markers. Other brain mechanisms, such as neurotransmitter activity or fine-grained network dynamics, may also be involved in the links between socioeconomic experience and mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite these limitations, the study provides a more nuanced picture of how different types of socioeconomic disadvantage at different points in life influence the brain and behavior. It suggests that while early life matters, adolescence and young adulthood remain critical windows for improving life conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41593-025-01882-w" target="_blank"&gt;Distinct effects of early-stage and late-stage socioeconomic factors on brain and behavioral traits&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Qiang Xu, Su Lui, Yuan Ji, Jingliang Cheng, Long Jiang Zhang, Bing Zhang, Wenzhen Zhu, Zuojun Geng, Guangbin Cui, Quan Zhang, Weihua Liao, Yongqiang Yu, Hui Zhang, Bo Gao, Xiaojun Xu, Tong Han, Zhenwei Yao, Wen Qin, Feng Liu, Meng Liang, Jilian Fu, Jiayuan Xu, Peng Zhang, Wei Li, Dapeng Shi, Caihong Wang, Jia-Hong Gao, Zhihan Yan, Feng Chen, Jiance Li, Jing Zhang, Dawei Wang, Wen Shen, Yanwei Miao, Junfang Xian, Meiyun Wang, Zhaoxiang Ye, Xiaochu Zhang, Xi-Nian Zuo, Kai Xu, Shijun Qiu, Chunshui Yu, and The CHIMGEN Consortium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Sun, 08 Jun 2025 20:12:30 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinAFBVV95cUxOZEx4MkhiTlc4OUpjYWJzd2ZkcTFOWXJCR29EdzFZYWlXdHI5ZndPLW1VQURYMjRMWk9pUGlvQ0dRamdyMFpnWm95TVBaSHVnNzE3dGlBNEtRWXpJalNwQU85djE3MVg1SUE4X2d3b2NVMHMzSnpjV2w3RVF0elJubDBUcEdFV3JRX1pQTVJkMlppNGIxZTE3Nk9XZkw</guid></item><item><title>来自我们古老亲戚的200万年前的蛀牙揭示了人类进化的秘密-对话 | 2-million year-old pitted teeth from our ancient relatives reveal secrets about human evolution - The Conversation</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiygFBVV95cUxQNmpMNk1uS3ZzTkJrdEJGblBhaWdWOG5uTkdxOENha1c4WFBwS24tU2E3VVVnR3QybTBGdFdfT25HWUJEVV84eHVoSkxvbGNKTmV1eENlcldaWVFoRkkwNTU5V2d0XzZXekhJWDJpMVBwdUdsVGt3X0thcDZPVVdBeG9mWVl6N3dTQ3luNVlpbHB3MFNrZlZnLXpOVU1aZ1dQUFBzdnRUMmhCNmFNRmZ6RVlhNV91OHVkSEZiWXZGWEJfSzFEMXZtcEhB?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="grid-ten large-grid-nine grid-last content-body content entry-content instapaper_body inline-promos" itemprop="articleBody"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The enamel that forms the outer layer of our teeth might seem like an unlikely place to find clues about evolution. But it tells us more than you’d think about the relationships between our fossil ancestors and relatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047248425000569?via%3Dihub"&gt;our new study&lt;/a&gt;, published in the Journal of Human Evolution, we highlight a different aspect of enamel. In fact, we highlight its absence. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specifically, we show that tiny, shallow pits in fossil teeth may not be signs of malnutrition or disease. Instead, they may carry surprising evolutionary significance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might be wondering why this matters. Well, for people like me who try to figure out how humans evolved and how all our ancestors and relatives were related to each other, teeth are very important. And having a new marker to look out for on fossil teeth could give us a new tool to help fit together our family tree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Uniform, circular and shallow&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These pits were first identified in the South African species &lt;em&gt;Paranthropus robustus&lt;/em&gt;, a close relative of our own genus &lt;em&gt;Homo&lt;/em&gt;. They are highly consistent in shape and size: uniform, circular and shallow. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initially, we thought the pits might be unique to &lt;em&gt;P. robustus&lt;/em&gt;. But our latest research shows this kind of pitting also occurs in other &lt;em&gt;Paranthropus&lt;/em&gt; species in eastern Africa. We even found it in some &lt;em&gt;Australopithecus&lt;/em&gt; individuals, a genus that may have given rise to both &lt;em&gt;Homo&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Paranthropus&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="align-center zoomable"&gt;

            &lt;figcaption&gt;
              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;Uniform, circular and shallow pitting on teeth may be a previously undetected clue about evolutionary relationships.&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The enamel pits have commonly been assumed to be defects resulting from stresses such as illness or malnutrition during childhood. However, their remarkable consistency across species, time and geography suggests these enamel pits may be something more interesting. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pitting is subtle, regularly spaced, and often clustered in specific regions of the tooth crown. It appears without any other signs of damage or abnormality. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Two million years of evolution&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We looked at fossil teeth from hominins (humans and our closest extinct relatives) from the Omo Valley in Ethiopia, where we can see traces of more than two million years of human evolution, as well as comparisons with sites in southern Africa (Drimolen, Swartkrans and Kromdraai).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Omo collection includes teeth attributed to &lt;em&gt;Paranthropus&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Australopithecus&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Homo&lt;/em&gt;, the three most recent and well-known hominin genera. This allowed us to track the telltale pitting across different branches of our evolutionary tree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What we found was unexpected. The uniform pitting appears regularly in both eastern and southern Africa &lt;em&gt;Paranthropus&lt;/em&gt;, and also in the earliest eastern African &lt;em&gt;Australopithecus&lt;/em&gt; teeth dating back around 3 million years. But among southern Africa &lt;em&gt;Australopithecus&lt;/em&gt; and our own genus, &lt;em&gt;Homo&lt;/em&gt;, the uniform pitting was notably absent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;A defect … or just a trait?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the uniform pitting were caused by stress or disease, we might expect it to correlate with tooth size and enamel thickness, and to affect both front and back teeth. But it doesn’t. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s more, stress-related defects typically form horizontal bands. They usually affect all teeth developing at the time of the stress, but this is not what we see with this pitting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="align-center zoomable"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://images.theconversation.com/files/672726/original/file-20250606-62-lzlgu2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=1000&amp;amp;fit=clip"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;figcaption&gt;
              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;The uniform, even nature of the pitting suggests a genetic origin rather than environmental factors such as malnutrition or disease.&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;a class="source" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047248425000569?via%3Dihub"&gt;Towle et al. / Journal of Human Evolution&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We think this pitting probably has a developmental and genetic origin. It may have emerged as a byproduct of changes in how enamel was formed in these species. It might even have some unknown functional purpose. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any case, we suggest these uniform, circular pits should be viewed as a trait rather than a defect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;A modern comparison&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further support for the idea of a genetic origin comes from comparisons with a rare condition in humans today called amelogenesis imperfecta, which affects enamel formation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About one in 1,000 people today have amelogenesis imperfecta. By contrast, the uniform pitting we have seen appears in up to half of &lt;em&gt;Paranthropus&lt;/em&gt; individuals. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although it likely has a genetic basis, we argue the even pitting is too common to be considered a harmful disorder. What’s more, it persisted at similar frequencies for millions of years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;A new evolutionary marker&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this uniform pitting really does have a genetic origin, we may be able to use it to trace evolutionary relationships. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We already use subtle tooth features such as enamel thickness, cusp shape, and wear patterns to help identify species. The uniform pitting may be an additional diagnostic tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, our findings support the idea that &lt;em&gt;Paranthropus&lt;/em&gt; is a “monophyletic group”, meaning all its species descend from a (relatively) recent common ancestor, rather than evolving seperatly from different &lt;em&gt;Australopithecus&lt;/em&gt; taxa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we did not find this pitting in the southern Africa species &lt;em&gt;Australopithecus africanus&lt;/em&gt;, despite a large sample of more than 500 teeth. However, it does appear in the earliest Omo &lt;em&gt;Australopithecus&lt;/em&gt; specimens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So perhaps the pitting could also help pinpoint from where &lt;em&gt;Paranthropus&lt;/em&gt; branched off on its own evolutionary path.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;An intriguing case&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One especially intriguing case is &lt;em&gt;Homo floresiensis&lt;/em&gt;, the so-called “hobbit” species from Indonesia. Based on published images, their teeth appear to show similar pitting. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If confirmed, this could suggest an evolutionary history more closely tied to earlier &lt;em&gt;Australopithecus&lt;/em&gt; species than to &lt;em&gt;Homo&lt;/em&gt;. However, &lt;em&gt;H. floresiensis&lt;/em&gt; also shows potential skeletal and dental pathologies, so more research is needed before drawing such conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More research is also needed to fully understand the processes behind the uniform pitting before it can be used routinely in taxonomic work. But our research shows it is likely a heritable characteristic, one not found in any living primates studied to date, nor in our own genus &lt;em&gt;Homo&lt;/em&gt; (rare cases of amelogenesis imperfecta aside). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As such, it offers an exciting new tool for exploring evolutionary relationships among fossil hominins.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

          &lt;h3&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was an accountant in my previous life (before 6 years studying meteorology and then a 20-year career in it), so you’d think I would have planned this out better. I had a decent salary for much of my meteorology career, and had a good retirement plan, including an employer match of up to 10% of my salary. However, my depression (and maybe some neurological/brain issues) got the better of me, and I had to retire 2 1/2 years before I intended to, right before the COVID-19 pandemic started in March 2020. So we had that to deal with, a $35K loss of income (went on Social Security/Medicare and started to take retirement income from my 401(k)). My husband stepped up and got a great job to almost make up the difference, even while starting dialysis at the same time. That brings us to now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m a gay man who has been with the same guy (Ken) for 25+ years. We tied the knot as soon as Maryland voters approved same-sex marriage in 2013. Now, it’s 2025, and a different time. But politics is only a small part of what we are concerned about right now, and our concerns go even beyond my husband’s (Ken) End-Stage-Kidney-Disease (ESKD). Three months ago, he developed a hearing problem as a side effect from necessary and extended antibiotics use. We seem to have the hearing loss under control now, fortunately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, he now is suddenly losing his sight. This started with his right eye a couple of weeks ago, and now his left eye is &lt;strong&gt;also &lt;/strong&gt;giving him similar problems. Unlike the hearing, there is no known cause for this loss of eyesight. Another thing … it’s next to impossible to get timely appointments with any specialists these days, even with something I would consider an emergency! Until now, he’s persevered working full-time with a good salary, but he just can’t cope with all the physical issues he’s experiencing now. He likely will have to go out on SSDI which, beside being &lt;strong&gt;very difficult&lt;/strong&gt; to apply for, is a pittance. We will lose about $65K in income, and we still have a mortgage. He has some money put away for retirement, but that wasn’t going to be touched for about 7 more years!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;What Are We Looking For? ADVICE!&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our main concerns are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;How do we navigate applying for SSDI, especially with the current regime? &lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Are these places that take your house “as is”, legit? Hopefully we won’t have to go that route, but I’m currently not even close to being sure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It feels like a million questions that I have, and I’m at my wits’ end regarding being supportive of him and us. The one thing I know is that I have to take care of myself to be able to take care of him. That’s no easy feat with my depression default setting :-/.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s about it for now and, as you might imagine, the current state of the U.S. is not helping at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ozempic might shrink waistlines, but it seems to bulge another body part.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a recent &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Ozempic/comments/1kjj9gi/increased_size_anybody_else_notice_men_only/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Reddit thread&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/06/07/lifestyle/ozempic-penis-male-users-reveal-shocking-change-to-their-genitalia-after-injecting-weight-loss-shot/"&gt;male Ozempic users&lt;/a&gt; claimed that the weight-loss drugs helped their penises grow. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I recently measured myself down there and noticed I gained about one inch,” a person proudly shared on the forum.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Although there hasn’t been enough research done on the correlation between &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/06/06/health/ozempic-users-twice-as-likely-to-develop-debilitating-condition/"&gt;semaglutide&lt;/a&gt; and men’s genitalia measurements — the &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2023/12/30/health/men-stunned-as-size-of-average-penis-is-revealed-and-its-smaller-than-you-think/"&gt;average penis size&lt;/a&gt; is continuing to rise, and some experts think &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/06/03/lifestyle/ozempic-fans-flock-to-most-unhealthy-bottled-drink/"&gt;Ozempic&lt;/a&gt; might actually have something to do with it. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The average penis has grown nearly 10% from 5.17 inches to 5.63 between 2022 and 2024 in the UK, according to &lt;a href="https://www.diabetes.co.uk/news/2024/jun/average-penis-size-in-the-uk-has-risen-due-to-ozempic-data-suggests.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;diabetes.co&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And they’re not the only ones seeing this increase.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;The data also revealed that Venezuelan men experienced a massive increase from 1.42 inches to 6.67 inches, within those two years. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dr. Richard Viney, a consultant urological surgeon at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham, thinks Ozempic and similar drugs could be to blame.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Men’s penises shorten as they get older (due to) increasing body fat and increasing prostate size drawing the penis back into the body,” he told diabetes.co.&lt;/p&gt;

885px"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Dr. Richard Viney thinks weight-loss drugs, like Ozempic could be to blame for increased penis size.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Christopher Sadowski&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It is theoretically possible that new drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy, which are used to treat diabetes and obesity, respectively and can cause people to lose weight, could also be a factor. As men lose weight, their penises appear larger.”&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;However, in 2023, research published in the World Journal of Men’s Health revealed that the &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/02/23/lifestyle/does-size-matter-age-old-penis-debate-finally-settled-in-groundbreaking-study/"&gt;average size of what a guy is packing&lt;/a&gt; has grown 24% over nearly 30 years.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And that sort of increase has health experts concerned — especially because even two years ago, they couldn’t put their finger on what the cause of it is. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Speculation around weight loss drugs being the culprit is possible — but the Ozempic trend is recent, and this growth for men has clearly been going on for some time now. &lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;“Any overall change in development is concerning, because our reproductive system is one of the most important pieces of human biology,” Dr. Michael Eisenberg, the study’s author, told Stanford Medicine’s blog Scope.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If we’re seeing this fast of a change, it means that something powerful is happening to our bodies.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Other possible causes could be chemical exposure from pesticides or hygiene products, Eisenberg hypothesized, which can disrupt the hormone-regulating endocrine system.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Time will only tell if Ozempic or other lifestyle factors are to blame for well-endowed men. &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/02/23/lifestyle/does-size-matter-age-old-penis-debate-finally-settled-in-groundbreaking-study/#"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I had used a rudimentary web-based calculator nearly a decade ago, which said my time would be up in 2031 — now just six years away! I was hoping an app combining AI and statistical modeling to predict my personal life expectancy would buy me more time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-subscribe-cta" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="AEMLPUF2PRC7ZJU6KMYTWMXX64" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;It did!

(The web-based tool I used previously asked four questions — about birth date, body mass index, smoking and mental health status.) There are, of course, other life expectancy calculators — the Social Security Administration provides one, as do such insurance companies as John Hancock and Northwest Mutual. But Death Clock AI is a giant step ahead with its reliance on artificial intelligence, which is fed by user data and trained on more than 1,200 life expectancy studies, allowing for a more personalized prediction of a death date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="6G3NBZKBA5GDBJZ24XMKS7URI4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;As such, the app highlights both the promise and the perils of AI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="CHMWCZCFSVFHZC2NXB4PC23ZEE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Although the specific date of death is obviously not intended to be accurate — the app’s disclaimer says it’s “for fun only” — it does tie your personal habits to your likelihood of living into old age and tells you what lifestyle changes might buy you more time. Thus Death Clock AI’s motto: “Know your date. Change your fate.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="2FKU263DSJCGVMAWQFMZZDOG3A" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;After responding to 29 questions — including how much of the day I spend sitting, whether I get at least seven hours of sleep a night and whether I get all my recommended cancer screenings — I had my answer. A darkly humorous “Save the Date” card suggested I plan my end-of-life celebration for April 17, 2042, but I also learned the most likely ways I would die: sleep disorders, cardiovascular disease or cancer, in that order. Of course, cancer and heart disease are the two big killers in the United States. But I was surprised by how harmful sleep issues are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="MPLY55QXDNCK3IQLUNPGMZDCRQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;I was glad to get 17 more years instead of the measly six, even though I knew the Save the Date stuff is just marketing. Company  founder and CEO Brent Franson is candid about the app’s real value, which is providing a better understanding of how lifestyle changes can affect our longevity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ZEMBHBQHSNH65G35XKPPCT6XFI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;For instance, I saw that if I ate more fruits and vegetables, slept better and exercised more, I could extend my life expectancy an additional five years for a total of 22. (It’s a whole other question as to whether I’d want to live into my 90s, recalling my mother’s complaint that to be among the last of her friends and family living is no fun.) Taking up smoking or eating more fast food would mean I’d be planning an earlier farewell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="KEVVUXUKBRBHNJTMNBR5BUGHZA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But don’t we already know that smoking is bad and that exercise and broccoli are good? Yes, but seeing your own possible expiration date is a powerful in-your-face message that shows you the effect of your habits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="H2PBCA236JEBNPMHNO5X3GPXHY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;I asked Franson, 42, what his own quiz had told him. He learned that he’d die at age 78, which is about the usual life expectancy of a White male in the United States. On the one hand, he said, “I consider myself pretty healthy. I’m 42 and pretty active. I think I eat pretty well. I mostly don’t drink.” But, he added, his &lt;a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/a1c-test/about/pac-20384643*:*:text=The*20A1C*20test*20also*20is,with*20sugar,*20also*20called*20glycated__;I34lJSUlJSUlJQ!!M9LbjjnYNg9jBDflsQ!Bbjld59t4Ofw37dgvvkGrkc1oxJbUQHyhK-6fj2oRtq-wTJoihlYsXo-XQgIosch8aZZMyOlw2Uyy_-XfT0$" target="_blank"&gt;A1C, &lt;/a&gt;a test that shows the average blood sugar level over the past two to three months, is “a bit high” and his cholesterol number and blood pressure are also problematically high, suggesting that his heart health could be a concern going forward. The app, he said, “is making me aware of this in no uncertain terms. … I’ve got to take that really seriously.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="WALB6LRRKVHF7ON4CIKRTC42AA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;I had a similar reaction. I know how poorly I sleep, and I know how important a good night’s sleep is. But when my results showed I’m most likely to die because of a sleep disorder, I had an “aha” moment. Knowing that improving my sleep would remove my top death threat just might motivate me to do something about it, such as keeping to a regular schedule, avoiding large meals before bedtime, getting rid of screens in my bedroom and limiting naps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="M4RRJ6S3BZDSTDQ2LGWWKPCS3E" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;I asked &lt;a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6yBF6RzgN0__;!!M9LbjjnYNg9jBDflsQ!Bbjld59t4Ofw37dgvvkGrkc1oxJbUQHyhK-6fj2oRtq-wTJoihlYsXo-XQgIosch8aZZMyOlw2UyLfJxYh4$" target="_blank"&gt;Arthur Caplan&lt;/a&gt;, a bioethicist at NYU, for his opinion on the Death Clock AI. Caplan, 75, told me the app predicted he has 14 more years. But he cautioned that many other factors also influence lifespan, including our genes, which help determine our risk for certain diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="55FOEFXDUFBFRE6TLTU7S52XII" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In fact, Caplan said, “the majority of your lifespan is driven by your parents’ income, your educational level, whether you have a job, whether you live downstream from polluting chemical refineries or a radioactive plant that’s dumping something into your water.” Most of these factors are impossible to alter, so the app doesn’t ask about them. The point, Franson said, is “to ask about things that people can change.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="W567YK4B6FE5FFEZNHMWQ7JIJU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Other experts agree that there are concerns about an app offering up a death date, including harmful effects on mental health and financial planning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="DCLIHKHAVBBQZEA56IUUHXLOTY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Ryan Zabrowski, a financial planner, said: “One of the greatest concerns for retirees is the risk of outliving their money. A tool like a Death Clock AI could empower people to make smarter, more informed financial decisions.” Unless, of course, the prediction is wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="QQMXXE5XKBFBLFXRCUSQISWFRQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Still, getting a reminder that we have some control over our health in a way that may affect longevity is important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="4OY2FJGQZ5HFXIC64K433LSENU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Experts caution that anyone entering personal data into an app should be careful. The final, optional step in the Death Clock AI app is a free trial of its Longevity Plan ($39 a year), which will allow you to upload lots of your personal health data for customized help. But the app’s privacy policy says the information you provide could be shared with business partners (security consultants, analytics providers, payment processors) and with advertisers, marketers and data brokers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="RMOVBJAINNF53AJPYZ53NF3NS4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Franson says his company is not selling the data and is instead focused on the subscription business model. He added, “I think ultimately the business model needs to evolve because some people don’t like paying for subscriptions,” suggesting the company might develop partnerships to market such recommended products as vitamins or sleep trackers, which is a common practice. Still, when it comes to privacy, the devil can be in the details. The company’s privacy policy reads in part:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="FH3RP5L25ZBGPGB6XKGD2YPSRY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“All of your Personal Data that we collect may be transferred to a third party if we undergo a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy … in which that third party assumes control of our business (in whole or part).” So buyer beware.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="2ITQ63TEVJBLJFQRXF4L75O3GU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;As I was finishing up this column, I was curious what the Social Security Administration’s tool, which uses two questions (age and sex), would say about my life expectancy.

&lt;p&gt;It’s never too late to start eating better to prevent dementia, according a new analysis of research involving 90,000 adults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People over the age of 45 who followed a dietary pattern known as the MIND diet were “significantly” less likely to develop Alzheimer’s disease or related forms of dementia, said the University of Hawaii scientists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/mind-diet-cognitive-performance-rush-university/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;MIND diet&lt;/a&gt; stands for Mediterranean Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay, and was developed by the late Martha Clare Morris, ScD, a Rush University nutritional epidemiologist. It combines the traditional Mediterranean diet with the blood pressure-lowering DASH diet (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It includes proven ‘brain-healthy’ foods such as leafy green vegetables, berries, nuts, fish, and olive oil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study found that the MIND diet had a stronger and more consistent risk reduction relationship with dementia than other ‘healthy’ diets for the majority of racial groups in the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pgs-dpg-flex" data-pgs-partner-id="good-news-network"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants who improved their adherence to the diet the most over time showed the greatest pattern of risk reduction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, participants who scored higher for MIND adherence at the start of the study had a 9% lower risk of dementia, with an even greater reduction, of around 13%, among those who identified as African American, Latino or White.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The beneficial relationship was seen similarly among younger and older groups, which suggests that there are benefits to adopting the diet at any age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DIET TO THE RESCUE&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a title="Type 2 Diabetes Patients Who Stick to Low-Carb Diet May Be Able to Stop Taking Medication: Study" href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/type-2-diabetes-patients-who-stick-to-low-carb-diet-may-be-able-to-stop-taking-medication-study/" rel="bookmark"&gt;Type 2 Diabetes Patients Who Stick to Low-Carb Diet May Be Able to Stop Taking Medication: Study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our study findings confirm that healthy dietary patterns in mid to late life, and their improvement over time. may prevent Alzheimer’s and related dementias,”&lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1084804" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt; said Dr. Song-Yi Park&lt;/a&gt;, Associate Professor at the University of Hawaii at Manoa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This suggests that it is never too late to adopt a healthy diet to prevent dementia.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Park and her colleagues analyzed data from more than 90,000 American adults who provided information about their diet, starting in the 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The participants were between 45- and 75-years-old at the outset, and more than 21,000 developed Alzheimer’s or related dementias in the years that followed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results also showed that people who improved their adherence to MIND over 10 years—including those who didn’t follow the diet closely at first—had a 25% lower risk of dementia compared to those whose adherence declined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GOOD ADVICE&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Park said that trend was consistent across different ages and racial groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the protective relationship between a healthy diet and dementia was not as apparent among Asian Americans and even less so for Native Hawaiians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A tailored approach may be needed when evaluating different subpopulations’ diet quality,” said Park, who added that further studies could help clarify those patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Park presented&lt;a href="https://nutrition2025.eventscribe.net/index.asp?presTarget=3036452" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt; the findings&lt;/a&gt; at the annual meeting of the American Society for Nutrition in Orlando, Florida, on June 2.&lt;/p&gt;

While a cup of milk is an excellent source of calcium, the mineral is also abundant in yogurt, tofu, canned fish and fortified nondairy milk. Surprisingly, even leafy greens and broccoli contribute small amounts of calcium to the diet.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; However, if your intake of these calcium-rich foods is low, you may have been advised to take a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-calcium-supplements-8737741" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;calcium supplement&lt;/a&gt; to meet your daily needs and support bone health.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Getting enough calcium in the day goes beyond maintaining strong bones and teeth. “Calcium also plays an important role in blood clotting, helping muscles to contract and regulating heart rhythms and nerve functions,” says &lt;a href="https://www.agingwellnutrition.ca/about" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Kristen Hruschak, RD&lt;/a&gt;, founder of Aging Well Nutrition Services. The majority of calcium is stored in bones, and the body constantly pulls from and restocks its calcium stores to support these vital functions and maintain balance, she explains. Luckily, you can help your body replenish its calcium stores through dietary changes and supplementation. But to get the most out of your calcium supplement, it’s important to time it right. Keep reading to learn how to maximize absorption of your calcium supplement.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The natural aging process diminishes our body’s ability to absorb calcium. Hruschak explains that calcium absorption in the intestines heavily depends on the presence of the active form of vitamin D, called calcitriol.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Our kidneys play a pivotal role in converting vitamin D into calcitriol. However, as we age, the kidneys may become less efficient at this process, resulting in reduced calcium absorption and an increased risk of bone loss.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Consequently, older adults need more calcium than other adult populations to prevent calcium deficiency and maintain bone health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; During menopause, estrogen levels drop, which is a problem for your bones. The hormone plays a crucial role in maintaining bone density and strength by enhancing calcium absorption, promoting bone formation and inhibiting bone breakdown.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; With lower estrogen levels, you may experience bone loss and an increased risk of osteoporosis.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; If you are in perimenopause or menopause, make sure you’re getting enough &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7944074/foods-with-more-calcium-than-milk/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;calcium in your diet&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While browsing the store shelves, you’ll find a wide selection of calcium supplements available in various forms. Some of the most common forms include calcium carbonate, calcium citrate, calcium gluconate and calcium lactate.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Among the options, Hruschak says that calcium citrate, lactate and gluconate are more easily absorbed and tend to be more well tolerated compared to calcium carbonate. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-optimal-timing-for-calcium-supplement-intake"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Optimal Timing for Calcium Supplement Intake &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Timing with Meals &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Pairing your calcium supplement with or without a meal impacts how well it’s absorbed—and how effective it is. Calcium citrate, lactate and gluconate are well-absorbed at any time of day and can be taken with or without food, says Hruschak. On the other hand, if you’re using calcium carbonate, take it with food or immediately after eating to improve absorption.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Doing so also reduces the likelihood of gastrointestinal side effects, like gas, bloating or constipation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; However, the types of foods you eat can also impact calcium absorption. For example, phytates are plant compounds found in bran, nuts, whole grains, dried beans and seeds that can bind to calcium and make the mineral difficult absorb, explains Hruschak.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Similarly, oxalates found in rhubarb, spinach, nuts and teas can do the same.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Soaking dried beans and cooking these foods can minimize their interference—or you can take your calcium supplement separately from meals high in these foods. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Timing Away from Medications &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Certain medications can also interfere with calcium absorption. Notably, glucocorticoids, such as prednisone, can reduce calcium absorption.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; It’s generally recommended to take calcium supplements two to four hours apart from these medications for optimal absorption, says Hruschak. Other medications that may negatively interact with calcium supplements include lithium, quinolone antibiotics, dolutegravir and levothyroxine.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; If you’re taking both calcium and one of these meds, talk to your health care provider about whether you need to monitor your calcium levels.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Taking Calcium Supplements with Other Nutrients &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To get the most out of your calcium supplement, take it in combination with vitamin D, magnesium and vitamin K. It’s already been established that vitamin D is a powerful duo with calcium—they’re like leading actors in a (bone-strengthening) film. Magnesium plays a supporting role—it helps activate vitamin D.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; We also can’t forget vitamin K, which has a role of its own in the mix. Vitamin K (specifically vitamin K2) activates proteins needed for bone mineralization.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; This process also helps prevent blood vessel calcification, which is linked to cardiovascular disease.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Getting enough &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/2058503/vitamin-d-foods/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;vitamin D&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/magnesium-benefits-8656021" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;magnesium&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/foods-rich-in-vitamin-k-8635254" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;vitamin K&lt;/a&gt; from your diet, along with calcium, can greatly benefit bone and overall health.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When it comes to maximizing the absorption of calcium supplements, Hruschak recommends the following:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take no more than 500 to 600 milligrams of calcium at once. Smaller doses are easier to absorb. Space supplements at least four hours apart.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pair calcium supplements with vitamin D supplements for better absorption.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Although calcium citrate, lactate and gluconate are typically well absorbed whether taken with a meal or not, there’s an added perk to taking calcium and vitamin D together with a meal. That’s because dietary fat from your food boosts the absorption of vitamin D. The result? Better calcium absorption.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoid high-oxalate and high-phytate foods, as well as &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8009784/how-much-caffeine-is-too-much/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;high doses of caffeine&lt;/a&gt; at the time of taking calcium supplements.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-our-expert-take"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Our Expert Take &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To get the most out of your calcium supplement, think about the dose and the foods you take it with, as well as medications you’re on. While you can take calcium citrate, lactate and gluconate with or without a meal and at varying times of day, you’ll get the most out of your calcium supplement if you take it with food, especially foods that contain vitamin D, and make sure you get enough magnesium and vitamin K in your diet. If you’re taking a calcium supplement, check in with your health care provider for any guidance specific to your health needs.

She cited a study from John's Hopkins University that said even "mild loss can double your chances of dementia."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Backman also gave some suggestions on how to prevent dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Early intervention with a hearing aid or treating loss with a hearing aid helps you to be part of the community again, go out and socialize," she said. "When people can't hear they kind of don't go to restaurants anymore, can't hear when they go get their prescription and causes social isolation."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to reports from the National Institutes of Health, hearing aids can reduce the rate of cognitive decline in elderly adults by nearly 50 percent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you are struggling to hear the TV, if you are at a dinner with your loved ones and you can't hear what anyone is saying, you're just kind of sitting back laughing when they laugh..."

The study found that people with more anxious-depressive symptoms are less responsive to moments when they feel confident, which may prevent them from building a more accurate and positive overall belief in their capabilities. Interestingly, these individuals still responded normally to external feedback, suggesting that the underconfidence stems from how they integrate their own confidence experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers conducted the study to better understand how people with anxious-depression symptoms form beliefs about their own abilities—a process known as metacognition. Although earlier studies had shown a link between depression, anxiety, and underconfidence, they had not clarified the mechanisms behind this bias. The key question was whether these individuals misinterpret their moment-to-moment confidence, ignore successes, or overweight negative feedback.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Previous work has shown that people with subclinical anxiety and depression symptoms can have unreasonably low self-beliefs in their abilities despite being able to perform as well as others. We wanted to study how such self-beliefs are maintained despite evidence to the contrary, as this can help provide insight into how we can potentially mitigate such low self-beliefs,” said study author Sucharit Katyal, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Copenhagen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To investigate, the researchers ran two large experiments with a total of over 500 participants recruited online. They measured two types of confidence: “local” confidence, or how sure participants were in their decisions on individual trials, and “global” confidence, which referred to how well they thought they were performing across a block of trials. They also manipulated feedback during tasks to test how participants updated their global confidence based on either internal cues (local confidence) or external evaluations (feedback).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants completed perception and memory tasks in a gamified setting. In the perception task, they judged which type of fruit appeared more often on the screen. In the memory task, they identified which fruit had been in a previous array. After each decision, they rated their confidence in that choice. Occasionally, they received feedback from a fictional “auditor” about whether their choice had been correct. At the end of each block, participants estimated how many answers they thought they had gotten right—this was the global self-performance estimate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers designed feedback blocks where correct responses were more or less likely to be followed by positive feedback, allowing them to manipulate participants’ perceived success independently of actual performance. This setup mimicked real-life scenarios where a person may receive more encouragement or criticism, regardless of how well they are doing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both experiments showed that feedback had a strong influence on global confidence. Participants who received mostly positive feedback in a block felt more confident about their performance, even though their accuracy had not changed. Those who received mostly negative feedback felt less confident. This demonstrated that global confidence could be shifted without altering task performance. Interestingly, these effects even carried over to new blocks without feedback and sometimes across different tasks, suggesting that feedback had a lasting influence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when the researchers looked at how local confidence influenced global confidence, a striking pattern emerged. People with higher anxious-depression symptoms were less likely to let moments of high confidence improve their overall self-assessment. While they still reported how confident they felt on individual trials, they didn’t seem to take that into account when judging how well they had performed overall. This blunted sensitivity to high confidence seemed to maintain their global underconfidence, even when their performance was good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To better understand this pattern, the researchers used computational modeling. They tested different models that could explain how people with anxious-depression symptoms update their beliefs about themselves. One model suggested they might ignore their own local confidence; another suggested they might respond more strongly to negative feedback; a third proposed a general bias to rate themselves lower regardless of experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results pointed clearly to the first model. The best-fitting explanation was that people with anxious-depression symptoms failed to incorporate their high-confidence experiences into their broader self-beliefs. They were not more affected by negative feedback than others, nor did they show a general tendency to underestimate themselves across the board. The problem appeared specific to the internal learning process—how they used their own confidence signals to build a bigger picture of their abilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We had expected that people with low self-beliefs would be disproportionately sensitive to negative feedback, but we did not find this to be the case,” Katyal told PsyPost. “Instead, they were more sensitive to only their own past low confidence when they did the task.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test whether these effects extended beyond the task itself, the researchers also looked at participants’ self-beliefs in a separate task. They asked participants to rate how well a set of positive and negative adjectives described them. Those who had received mostly negative feedback during the earlier tasks were more likely to endorse negative self-descriptions afterward. This suggests that the effects of skewed feedback and internal confidence processing may shape how people view themselves more broadly, not just within a specific task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We also found that receiving negative feedback, even on an online gamified type task, can hamper people’s more global self-esteem – not just related to cognitive task performance but how they feel about themselves more generally,” Katyal said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings help explain why people with anxiety and depression often hold negative views of their competence and may avoid new challenges—even when they have the skills to succeed. Their global underconfidence may persist not because they perform poorly or receive too much criticism, but because they do not fully recognize or internalize the moments when they feel capable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also suggests that feedback interventions could help. Because people with anxious-depressive symptoms responded normally to external feedback, well-calibrated positive reinforcement might help shift their global confidence in a more accurate direction. The effects of feedback were strong, extended across domains, and even influenced broader self-beliefs, making it a promising tool for future interventions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Some people hold unreasonably low self-beliefs in their abilities despite performing well, sometimes known commonly as the ‘imposter syndrome.’ Here, we find that such low self-beliefs are maintained by underconfident people due to reduced sensitivity to past situations when they had high confidence on performing tasks of those abilities and higher sensitivity to situations when they had low confidence,” Katyal told PsyPost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“However, underconfident people were not differentially sensitive to past instances of positive and negative feedback about their abilities. This implies that it can be helpful for people with low self-beliefs to rely on external feedback from peers who can give them accurate assessment of their abilities and not rely solely on their internal self-assessments.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the study has limitations. Although the sample included individuals with elevated symptoms, it did not include people with formal clinical diagnoses. Future research is needed to confirm whether these findings apply to clinical populations. Additionally, while feedback helped shift confidence in the short term, it is unclear how long these changes last or how best to sustain them. More work is needed to explore how feedback-based interventions could be designed to produce lasting improvements in self-beliefs and mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The study was conducted on large online participant samples, so it needs to be replicated in other populations to be globally applicable,” Katyal said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-57040-0" target="_blank"&gt;Distorted learning from local metacognition supports transdiagnostic underconfidence&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Sucharit Katyal, Quentin JM Huys, Raymond J.

            Newly awake, the 19-year-old could see his surroundings but couldn’t move or speak, and he didn’t know why.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbi9zrtc00083b6mbu7fp70j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He thought, “‘My God, what do I do?’” Jalal, now 39, said of that moment in 2005. “I tried to call my mom (and) dad, but no words would emerge from my throat. … I had this ominous presence of a monster, and it lifted my legs up and down.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbi9zrtc00093b6mah0dfjee@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It strangled me, trying to kill me. And I was 100% sure that I was going to die,” Jalal added. “It literally feels like all the evil of the universe is condensed into a bubble, and it’s in your bedroom.”&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

            This type of hallucination is a hallmark for many people with sleep paralysis.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbi9zrtc000b3b6mes14bth0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It occurs during transitions into or out of rapid eye movement, or REM, sleep, similar to a traffic jam at a busy intersection — your brain, awake and alert, and body, still asleep and immobilized, collide momentarily, said Dr. Matthew P. Walker, director of the Center for Human Sleep Science at the University of California, Berkeley, via email.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbi9zrtc000c3b6mwob9ktp9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/12148-sleep-basics" target="_blank"&gt;Following deep sleep&lt;/a&gt;, REM sleep is &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/22/health/sleeping-more-in-winter-research-wellness"&gt;the next critical phase&lt;/a&gt; of sleep cycles, characterized by more dreaming that’s also extra vivid and lifelike, and by faster heart rate and breathing. It’s essential for memory, concentration, mood regulation and immune function.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbi9zrtc000d3b6mc8r96aag@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Jalal’s experiences propelled him to study this phenomenon around the world. He aimed to discover the cause of sleep paralysis, he said, and why some people with the diagnosis “have these powerful encounters where it feels like evil of epic proportions.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbi9zrtc000e3b6m3ai1mgdh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He has since earned a doctorate in psychiatry and is now a researcher in Harvard University’s psychology department and a leading expert on sleep paralysis. He also treats patients struggling with it.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbi9zrtc000f3b6momfz4lfo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            An estimated 30% of people worldwide experience at least one episode of sleep paralysis in their lifetime, according to &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/21974-sleep-paralysis" target="_blank"&gt;the Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;. How many of those people have recurring and impairing sleep paralysis isn’t clear, but the percentage is likely low, Jalal said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbi9zrtc000g3b6m2v4tko8d@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Here’s what else you should know about sleep paralysis and how it can be managed.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2 class="subheader inline-placeholder subheader-elevate vossi-subheader vossi-subheader--size-h2" data-editable="text" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/subheader/instances/cmbi9zs8e00173b6m4a62t4zw@published" data-component-name="subheader" id="the-science-and-symptoms-of-sleep-paralysis" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
        The science and symptoms of sleep paralysis
&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbi9zrtc000h3b6m8ua5hdxm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In REM sleep, our bodies are paralyzed so we don’t act out our dreams and risk hurting ourselves or others, Jalal said. Sleep paralysis episodes are usually only a few minutes long but can last up to 20 minutes, according to the Cleveland Clinic.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbi9zrtc000i3b6m7itud2o5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            During sleep paralysis, however, “we regain consciousness before the muscles regain their freedom from REM-induced paralysis,” said Walker, who is also a professor of neuroscience and psychology at the University of California, Berkeley
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbi9zrtc000j3b6m8pnodcns@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            About 40% of people with sleep paralysis have visual, auditory or tactile hallucinations, such as pressure on one’s chest or feeling out of body, Jalal said. For about 90% of those individuals, the illusions are terrifying. They can include ghosts or cat- or alien-like creatures, and their actions can be as innocuous as simply approaching them or as nefarious as molesting or trying to kill them.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbi9zrtc000k3b6mbh286t00@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In Jalal’s academic travels, he discovered the contents and interpretations of hallucinations, views on what causes sleep paralysis, and episode frequency and duration can all also have a cultural basis.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;People living in Egypt and Italy, for example, would often see witches and evil genies, hold them responsible and think they could die from sleep paralysis, Jalal said. People in Denmark, Poland and parts of the United States, on the other hand, have less supernatural or exotic explanations and less fear.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbi9zrtc000l3b6m1ug82sts@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Why do we see these monsters? Is it the dreaming imagery … that’s spilling over into conscious awareness?” Jalal said. “My answer to that is, according to my research, no, not exactly. But it’s part of it.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbi9zrtc000m3b6m6yklgrjj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When you’re aware yet paralyzed and confused, your natural reaction is to escape that situation. Your brain is bombarding your body with signals to move, but your body can’t return any feedback.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbi9zrtc000n3b6m1pu627yq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Jalal’s theory, in short, is that your brain says, “to hell with it” and concocts a story it thinks your body must be facing to be experiencing such bizarre symptoms.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbi9zrtc000o3b6mnrrzx5yj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The reduced activity in your prefrontal cortex — responsible for reason and logic — also contributes to hallucinations becoming “extremely realistic and emotionally charged, amplified by an overly active amygdala, the brain’s emotional alarm center,” Walker said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

        Causes and risk factors of sleep paralysis
&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbi9zrtc000p3b6m8vjg62ea@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Though scientists know that wake-sleep glitch is what’s happening during a sleep paralysis episode, they’re not entirely sure why. But there are several factors that can increase the risk of fragmented sleep and sleep paralysis.  &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbi9zrtc000q3b6mhlyznz1d@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Those factors include stress and related conditions &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/07/health/anxiety-mental-health-depression-screening-prevention-health-wellness"&gt;such as anxiety&lt;/a&gt;, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), bipolar disorder and panic disorder, experts said. Much of Jalal’s sleep paralysis occurred when he was in school. Now when he has an episode once or twice per year, it’s usually during a high-stress period, he said. (Once you’ve experienced sleep paralysis, you can be conscious of that during an episode but still feel afraid.)
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbi9zrtc000r3b6mn70ih65u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Other common contributors are sleep deprivation, jet lag, an irregular sleep schedule, sleep disorders such as narcolepsy, and genetic factors, Walker and Jalal said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbi9zrtc000s3b6mdplkpjrv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/06/28/health/biden-sleep-apnea-cpap-machine-wellness"&gt;Obstructive sleep apnea&lt;/a&gt;, substance use disorder and some medications — &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/17/health/adhd-adult-treatments-study-wellness"&gt;such as those&lt;/a&gt; for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder — can also raise risk, according to the Cleveland Clinic.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbi9zrtc000t3b6mzcgrovxg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As scary as sleep paralysis may sound, it’s not actually dangerous, experts said.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;But depending on how recurring it is, sleep paralysis can be a sign of an underlying sleep disorder, Jalal said.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbi9zrtc000u3b6mdmi1fded@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Regular episodes can also lead to anxiety around sleep and then avoidance of sleep, Jalal said. This pattern can interfere with your daily energy and ability to function. And if you often have frightening hallucinations, that can lead to anxiety or trauma-like symptoms.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbi9zrtc000v3b6mvh7jdztb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Sleep paralysis can be significantly alleviated with several practices or treatments, Walker said — starting with &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/05/26/health/sleep-hygiene-tips-wellness"&gt;healthy sleep habits&lt;/a&gt;, for one. That includes seven to nine hours of restful sleep nightly.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbi9zrtc000w3b6mnocwgg2j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Maintaining a sleep schedule consistent in quality and quantity “acts like tuning your internal clock, reducing the chance of disruptive wake-sleep overlaps — much like ensuring all parts of an orchestra are synchronized for perfect harmony,” Walker said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbi9zrtc000x3b6m5qp4c41m@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Also prioritize stress management, by using, for example, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/26/health/meditation-tips-beginners-dan-harris-wellness"&gt;mindfulness&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/06/11/health/progressive-muscle-relaxation-mindfulness-wellness/index.html"&gt;relaxation exercises&lt;/a&gt;, Walker said. Therapies can relieve certain underlying issues triggering sleep paralysis, including &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/27/health/cbt-cognitive-behavioral-therapy-wellness"&gt;cognitive behavioral therapy&lt;/a&gt;, especially the version for &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/03/11/health/insomnia-what-to-do-wellness"&gt;people with insomnia&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbi9zrtc000y3b6ml0lnw6mf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In more serious situations, medications are sometimes used, Walker said. Those include SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) or tricyclic antidepressants that can help manage a smooth flow between sleep stages or even reduce the REM phase of sleep.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbi9zrtc000z3b6mqzxnrs0q@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Generally, boosting the brain’s serotonin levels somehow compensates for the loss of the REM phase, Jalal said. But rarely, long-term antidepressant use has been linked with &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3792373/" target="_blank"&gt;REM sleep behavior disorder&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbi9zrtc00103b6mvdydvtml@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            While the aforementioned treatments can help reduce the frequency or length of sleep paralysis episodes, there isn’t yet a gold-standard treatment that can stop an episode once it’s happening.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbi9zrtc00113b6mmu9pog2m@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Jalal has been trying to officially create one over the past decade, though, and it’s self-inspired. Called meditation relaxation therapy, the treatment reduced sleep paralysis by 50% after eight weeks for six people with narcolepsy, compared with a control group of four participants, found a small pilot study &lt;a href="https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/meditation-relaxation-therapy-may-offer-escape-from-the-terror-of-sleep-paralysis" target="_blank"&gt;Jalal published in 2020&lt;/a&gt;. He currently has another study of the same treatment with more participants underway at Harvard. And the steps of Jalal’s therapy are as follows:
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbi9zrtc00123b6mcq9xr5s7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Cognitively reappraise the meaning of the attack. &lt;/strong&gt;Close your eyes and remind yourself that your experience is common and you won’t die from it.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbi9zrtc00133b6mbdrjpcq6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Emotionally distance yourself from it. &lt;/strong&gt;Tell yourself that since your brain is just playing tricks on you, there’s no reason for you to be scared or risk the situation getting worse because of your own negative expectations.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbi9zrtc00143b6mmid5cohj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Focus on something positive. &lt;/strong&gt;Whether it’s praying or imagining a loved one’s face, this refocusing can make thoughts more pleasant rather than monstrous.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbi9zrtc00153b6mjw4vxnhg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Relax your muscles and don’t move. &lt;/strong&gt;Some experts say trying to slightly move your fingers or toes one by one may help you come out of an episode sooner. But Jalal’s fourth step advises against this movement since you’d still be sending signals to paralyzed muscles and maybe triggering hallucinations.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbi9zrtc00163b6m80qc9ddw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Viewing your own biology in a more objective way by learning more about the scientific basis of sleep paralysis is also helpful, Jalal said.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="96" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmblip9qo001k3b761rgc6qlu@published"&gt;I am a gay man who is not out to my very conservative Southern family.  My younger sister is getting married in a month. Each time I have been to a family event in the last few years (since I graduated college) everyone has tried to set me up with an eligible friend’s daughter, niece, or granddaughter, etc. I have a friend, “Desiree,” with whom I am very close. Would it be permissible to ask her to accompany me and act as my beard so I don’t have to deal with the deluge of offers from match-making-minded relatives?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="125" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmblip9qp001n3b768a9drggj@published"&gt;Being gay in Trump’s America, particularly this iteration of it, is hard enough, so I completely understand your desire to make things easier on yourself. As ideal as it would be for everyone to be out without reservation or qualification, it’s just not the reality. This matter is complicated by family bonds, which many of us want to hold onto irrespective of the politics they hold. I don’t think it’s right to judge you for remaining closeted to your family; this is a decision you’re actively making and right now, it’s what you feel you have to do. I don’t envy you. Negotiating your personhood for the sake of continuing a relationship with people that you care about is such a brutal burden to bear.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="184" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmblip9qp001o3b76oc4kpcjg@published"&gt;With that said, I think your reasons for roping Desiree into this are on the slight side. I understand how it fits in with the bigger picture of the deception you feel is required in order to be around your family, but at minimum, I wouldn’t present this to her as an opportunity to act as your shield for having to field offers for partners. While those are annoying and insulting, they are microaggressions. The real thrust of this ask is that you aren’t out to your family for good reasons, and bringing a date along with you would help you manage that. That’s another thing: Don’t ask Desiree to be your “beard.” “Date” suffices. To family, you don’t have to elaborate much on why she is with you—the compulsory heterosexuality that your family operates under will do its work and allow them to make the association that the woman with you is something of a romantic prospect if not a proper partner. Figure out how to keep things vague if people do ask about the nature of said partnership (“We’re taking things slowly”).&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="85" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmblip9qq001p3b76p12k2ghs@published"&gt;Of course, none of this matters if Desiree isn’t down to indulge this charade. If she isn’t aware of the situation, explain it to her. Let her ask questions and set boundaries. Your request could be interpreted as insulting or burdensome so be prepared for her to say no, and do not hold it against her if she does. If she agrees to it, you should make the trip/experience as comfortable as possible and get her some kind of nice present as a thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="47" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmblip9qq001r3b767jceohvp@published"&gt;I am dreading the onset of summer because hot weather makes my balls smell and my wife refuses to give me blow jobs (which I love) when that happens. I’ve tried lots of deodorants, but they all just barely mask the odor. What can I do about this?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="85" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmblip9qr001u3b76gmxs8cfu@published"&gt;Not to laugh at your wife’s olfactory pain or your no-blowjob-having  misery, but the contrast between straight problems and queer ones rarely fails to amuse me. So prized is male B.O. within many gay circles that there are guys that would actually pay to luxuriate in your ball smell. The ranker the better. But since, “Get yourself a piggy cocksucker,” isn’t very realistic advice, this is just a stray observation with no real practical application. People are different and isn’t that interesting? And … scene.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="186" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmblip9qr001v3b76o4cbq3jg@published"&gt;Besides deodorants there are a few things to try here. Removing your ball/pubic hair may help, as odor tends to cling to it. Probably not an ideal solution but it could do the trick—you may have to choose between blowjobs and pubes. You could also experiment with baby/other powders. They sometimes are more effective than straight up deodorant. Could washing prior to sex help? It might. Maybe your odor can withstand mere bar soap but if you haven’t tried, seems like a no-brainer. Also you can time sex so that it occurs when you smell the best. So: not after a long day at work and/or the gym, but perhaps in the morning (again, after a rinse)? You should also keep in mind that there are &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/i-can-smell-myself-through-my-pants#in-males"&gt;a few conditions&lt;/a&gt; that may contribute to genital odor, like balanitis, non-gonococcal urethritis, and yeast infections. Certain medications and even diet can make your crotch reek. It might be none of the above, but just to be sure all is in order, I’d visit a doctor to inquire if I were you—a GP or even dermatologist may be most useful.&lt;/p&gt;

Providing pleasure in this way, especially to someone who really enjoys it, can be extremely gratifying. It can make you feel powerful—because you are. Not only do you have the ability to make someone feel good with your mouth, you could also make them feel really bad by changing things slightly and, for example, bearing your teeth. That is, someone who allows you this kind of access to his dick is making himself vulnerable. I love that aspect of it, and I love when his moans, sighs, and words express as much. Part of what’s fun about having sex with men, especially those who present as masculine, is unwrapping them to get to the gooey middle.&lt;/p&gt;

  



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="179" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbliose0001f3b76xoc3tumi@published"&gt;Mechanically, giving blowjobs can be unpleasant for some people. Not everyone has trained away their gag reflex. The receiver may be particular or even demanding and request a depth that is uncomfortable or impossible for the giver. Sometimes the requested tempo is too fast for the receiver. All of this can really underscore the &lt;em&gt;job&lt;/em&gt; in blow job, and while effort is not a bad thing in bed, feeling like you’ve been assigned work can dampen the mood. Good oral tops will try to make their blower as comfortable as possible. Some will nonetheless have requirements (or at least strong preferences) in terms of speed, depth, and amount of friction that may create a challenge. The best guys to suck, though, are those who simply love getting head in virtually whatever form it comes—the real connoisseurs. That’s the best type of partner to show you the joy of giving head. You may find one by sheer luck or at least take the temperature if you’re looking for partners on apps. Ultimately, I think this will make all the difference.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="126" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbliosgy001g3b76xgyw5i33@published"&gt;Do know, though, that regardless of what your partner requests, you have plenty of agency. Suck on the dick in a way that feels right to you in terms of pacing, positioning, and pressure. Don’t do anything that makes you physically (or mentally) uncomfortable. Ask your partner if you can just savor him and do that. Don’t be afraid to fantasize during the act if it gets you more into the mood. In my opinion, giving head is borderline meditative and benefits from you staying in the moment, but there’s nothing wrong with using a bit of mental imagery when needed. Giving head isn’t for everyone, and you aren’t under any obligation to love it. But it’s at least worth a shot. (Or a few shots.)&lt;/p&gt;

            Newly awake, the 19-year-old could see his surroundings but couldn’t move or speak, and he didn’t know why.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            He thought, “‘My God, what do I do?’” Jalal, now 39, said of that moment in 2005. “I tried to call my mom (and) dad, but no words would emerge from my throat. … I had this ominous presence of a monster, and it lifted my legs up and down.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “It strangled me, trying to kill me. And I was 100% sure that I was going to die,” Jalal added. “It literally feels like all the evil of the universe is condensed into a bubble, and it’s in your bedroom.”&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

            This type of hallucination is a hallmark for many people with sleep paralysis.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbi9zrtc000b3b6mes14bth0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It occurs during transitions into or out of rapid eye movement, or REM, sleep, similar to a traffic jam at a busy intersection — your brain, awake and alert, and body, still asleep and immobilized, collide momentarily, said Dr. Matthew P. Walker, director of the Center for Human Sleep Science at the University of California, Berkeley, via email.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/12148-sleep-basics" target="_blank"&gt;Following deep sleep&lt;/a&gt;, REM sleep is &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/22/health/sleeping-more-in-winter-research-wellness"&gt;the next critical phase&lt;/a&gt; of sleep cycles, characterized by more dreaming that’s also extra vivid and lifelike, and by faster heart rate and breathing. It’s essential for memory, concentration, mood regulation and immune function.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbi9zrtc000d3b6mc8r96aag@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Jalal’s experiences propelled him to study this phenomenon around the world. He aimed to discover the cause of sleep paralysis, he said, and why some people with the diagnosis “have these powerful encounters where it feels like evil of epic proportions.”

            He has since earned a doctorate in psychiatry and is now a researcher in Harvard University’s psychology department and a leading expert on sleep paralysis. He also treats patients struggling with it.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            An estimated 30% of people worldwide experience at least one episode of sleep paralysis in their lifetime, according to &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/21974-sleep-paralysis" target="_blank"&gt;the Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;. How many of those people have recurring and impairing sleep paralysis isn’t clear, but the percentage is likely low, Jalal said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbi9zrtc000g3b6m2v4tko8d@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Here’s what else you should know about sleep paralysis and how it can be managed.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2 class="subheader inline-placeholder subheader-elevate vossi-subheader vossi-subheader--size-h2" data-editable="text" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/subheader/instances/cmbi9zs8e00173b6m4a62t4zw@published" data-component-name="subheader" id="the-science-and-symptoms-of-sleep-paralysis" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
        The science and symptoms of sleep paralysis
&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbi9zrtc000h3b6m8ua5hdxm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In REM sleep, our bodies are paralyzed so we don’t act out our dreams and risk hurting ourselves or others, Jalal said. Sleep paralysis episodes are usually only a few minutes long but can last up to 20 minutes, according to the Cleveland Clinic.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbi9zrtc000i3b6m7itud2o5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            During sleep paralysis, however, “we regain consciousness before the muscles regain their freedom from REM-induced paralysis,” said Walker, who is also a professor of neuroscience and psychology at the University of California, Berkeley
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbi9zrtc000j3b6m8pnodcns@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            About 40% of people with sleep paralysis have visual, auditory or tactile hallucinations, such as pressure on one’s chest or feeling out of body, Jalal said. For about 90% of those individuals, the illusions are terrifying. They can include ghosts or cat- or alien-like creatures, and their actions can be as innocuous as simply approaching them or as nefarious as molesting or trying to kill them.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbi9zrtc000k3b6mbh286t00@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In Jalal’s academic travels, he discovered the contents and interpretations of hallucinations, views on what causes sleep paralysis, and episode frequency and duration can all also have a cultural basis.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;People living in Egypt and Italy, for example, would often see witches and evil genies, hold them responsible and think they could die from sleep paralysis, Jalal said. People in Denmark, Poland and parts of the United States, on the other hand, have less supernatural or exotic explanations and less fear.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbi9zrtc000l3b6m1ug82sts@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Why do we see these monsters? Is it the dreaming imagery … that’s spilling over into conscious awareness?” Jalal said. “My answer to that is, according to my research, no, not exactly. But it’s part of it.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbi9zrtc000m3b6m6yklgrjj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When you’re aware yet paralyzed and confused, your natural reaction is to escape that situation. Your brain is bombarding your body with signals to move, but your body can’t return any feedback.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbi9zrtc000n3b6m1pu627yq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Jalal’s theory, in short, is that your brain says, “to hell with it” and concocts a story it thinks your body must be facing to be experiencing such bizarre symptoms.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbi9zrtc000o3b6mnrrzx5yj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The reduced activity in your prefrontal cortex — responsible for reason and logic — also contributes to hallucinations becoming “extremely realistic and emotionally charged, amplified by an overly active amygdala, the brain’s emotional alarm center,” Walker said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2 class="subheader inline-placeholder subheader-elevate vossi-subheader vossi-subheader--size-h2" data-editable="text" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/subheader/instances/cmbi9zs9n00183b6m123zg7ik@published" data-component-name="subheader" id="causes-and-risk-factors-of-sleep-paralysis" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
        Causes and risk factors of sleep paralysis
&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbi9zrtc000p3b6m8vjg62ea@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Though scientists know that wake-sleep glitch is what’s happening during a sleep paralysis episode, they’re not entirely sure why. But there are several factors that can increase the risk of fragmented sleep and sleep paralysis.  &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbi9zrtc000q3b6mhlyznz1d@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Those factors include stress and related conditions &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/07/health/anxiety-mental-health-depression-screening-prevention-health-wellness"&gt;such as anxiety&lt;/a&gt;, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), bipolar disorder and panic disorder, experts said. Much of Jalal’s sleep paralysis occurred when he was in school. Now when he has an episode once or twice per year, it’s usually during a high-stress period, he said. (Once you’ve experienced sleep paralysis, you can be conscious of that during an episode but still feel afraid.)
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbi9zrtc000r3b6mn70ih65u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Other common contributors are sleep deprivation, jet lag, an irregular sleep schedule, sleep disorders such as narcolepsy, and genetic factors, Walker and Jalal said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbi9zrtc000s3b6mdplkpjrv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/06/28/health/biden-sleep-apnea-cpap-machine-wellness"&gt;Obstructive sleep apnea&lt;/a&gt;, substance use disorder and some medications — &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/17/health/adhd-adult-treatments-study-wellness"&gt;such as those&lt;/a&gt; for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder — can also raise risk, according to the Cleveland Clinic.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbi9zrtc000t3b6mzcgrovxg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As scary as sleep paralysis may sound, it’s not actually dangerous, experts said.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;But depending on how recurring it is, sleep paralysis can be a sign of an underlying sleep disorder, Jalal said.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbi9zrtc000u3b6mdmi1fded@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Regular episodes can also lead to anxiety around sleep and then avoidance of sleep, Jalal said. This pattern can interfere with your daily energy and ability to function. And if you often have frightening hallucinations, that can lead to anxiety or trauma-like symptoms.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbi9zrtc000v3b6mvh7jdztb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Sleep paralysis can be significantly alleviated with several practices or treatments, Walker said — starting with &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/05/26/health/sleep-hygiene-tips-wellness"&gt;healthy sleep habits&lt;/a&gt;, for one. That includes seven to nine hours of restful sleep nightly.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbi9zrtc000w3b6mnocwgg2j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Maintaining a sleep schedule consistent in quality and quantity “acts like tuning your internal clock, reducing the chance of disruptive wake-sleep overlaps — much like ensuring all parts of an orchestra are synchronized for perfect harmony,” Walker said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbi9zrtc000x3b6m5qp4c41m@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Also prioritize stress management, by using, for example, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/26/health/meditation-tips-beginners-dan-harris-wellness"&gt;mindfulness&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/06/11/health/progressive-muscle-relaxation-mindfulness-wellness/index.html"&gt;relaxation exercises&lt;/a&gt;, Walker said. Therapies can relieve certain underlying issues triggering sleep paralysis, including &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/27/health/cbt-cognitive-behavioral-therapy-wellness"&gt;cognitive behavioral therapy&lt;/a&gt;, especially the version for &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/03/11/health/insomnia-what-to-do-wellness"&gt;people with insomnia&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbi9zrtc000y3b6ml0lnw6mf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In more serious situations, medications are sometimes used, Walker said. Those include SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) or tricyclic antidepressants that can help manage a smooth flow between sleep stages or even reduce the REM phase of sleep.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbi9zrtc000z3b6mqzxnrs0q@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Generally, boosting the brain’s serotonin levels somehow compensates for the loss of the REM phase, Jalal said. But rarely, long-term antidepressant use has been linked with &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3792373/" target="_blank"&gt;REM sleep behavior disorder&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbi9zrtc00103b6mvdydvtml@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            While the aforementioned treatments can help reduce the frequency or length of sleep paralysis episodes, there isn’t yet a gold-standard treatment that can stop an episode once it’s happening.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbi9zrtc00113b6mmu9pog2m@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Jalal has been trying to officially create one over the past decade, though, and it’s self-inspired. Called meditation relaxation therapy, the treatment reduced sleep paralysis by 50% after eight weeks for six people with narcolepsy, compared with a control group of four participants, found a small pilot study &lt;a href="https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/meditation-relaxation-therapy-may-offer-escape-from-the-terror-of-sleep-paralysis" target="_blank"&gt;Jalal published in 2020&lt;/a&gt;. He currently has another study of the same treatment with more participants underway at Harvard. And the steps of Jalal’s therapy are as follows:
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbi9zrtc00123b6mcq9xr5s7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Cognitively reappraise the meaning of the attack. &lt;/strong&gt;Close your eyes and remind yourself that your experience is common and you won’t die from it.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbi9zrtc00133b6mbdrjpcq6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Emotionally distance yourself from it. &lt;/strong&gt;Tell yourself that since your brain is just playing tricks on you, there’s no reason for you to be scared or risk the situation getting worse because of your own negative expectations.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbi9zrtc00143b6mmid5cohj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Focus on something positive. &lt;/strong&gt;Whether it’s praying or imagining a loved one’s face, this refocusing can make thoughts more pleasant rather than monstrous.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbi9zrtc00153b6mjw4vxnhg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Relax your muscles and don’t move. &lt;/strong&gt;Some experts say trying to slightly move your fingers or toes one by one may help you come out of an episode sooner. But Jalal’s fourth step advises against this movement since you’d still be sending signals to paralyzed muscles and maybe triggering hallucinations.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbi9zrtc00163b6m80qc9ddw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Viewing your own biology in a more objective way by learning more about the scientific basis of sleep paralysis is also helpful, Jalal said.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

I’ve spent my entire career writing triumphant stories about athletes overcoming illness and adversity, only to reach the home stretch struggling to find a similar triumph in a story about me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s not easy. Now I know what all those subjects of all those feel-good stories understood about the truth behind my positive prose. Degenerative disease sucks beyond any inspirational adjective. Incurable illness stinks beyond any hopeful headline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve got Parkinson’s, and it hurts to even say it. I’m still mobile, still active, I don’t have the trademark tremors that distinguish the famously afflicted Michael J. Fox or the late Muhammad Ali but, damn it, I’ve got it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was diagnosed four years ago after complaining of weakness in my right arm. That weakness has disappeared, but it’s a constant struggle to keep everything else from slowly going to hell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every day it feels like I’ve just run a marathon. I move well, my balance is fine, but I’m always tight, always creaking. The amount of medication required to keep me active is so immense, my pills come in gallon jugs and I spend entire Dodger games trying to discreetly swallow them in the press box.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I move slower now. My fiancee Roxana qualifies for sainthood because whenever we go out, she must patiently wait for me to get dressed, which takes forever and is accompanied by the unholy sounds of struggle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don’t smile as much now. It’s harder to smile when afflicted with the trademark Parkinson’s masked face. When I FaceTime with my darling Daisy, I worry she won’t see past my dour expression and never know how much her granddaddy loves her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until now, my condition has only been known to my family. Not even my bosses knew. I didn’t look like Parky, I didn’t act like Parky, so why should I publicly reveal something so personal and embarrassing?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yeah, I was embarrassed. I felt humiliated in a way that made no sense and total sense. To me, Parkinson’s implies frailty, Parkinson’s implies weakness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But let me tell you, a 72-year-old woman pounding the living hell out of a punching bag ain’t weak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And that’s why I’m writing about this today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If my boxing classmates can have the strength to sweat through their tremors and wallop through their fears, then I can certainly have the strength to celebrate them without worrying what sort of light it casts on me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m proud to be one of them, and the purpose of this column is to reflect that pride and perhaps make it easier for other folks afflicted with Parkinson’s to come out swinging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="enhancement" data-click="enhancement" data-align-center-expanded&gt;&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;

  &lt;p class="figure-credit"&gt;(Robert Gauthier / Los Angeles Times)&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officially, Parkinson’s is a neurodegenerative disease impacting both motor and non-motor systems. Translated, the brain slowly stops producing dopamine, which is crucial for movement, and the loss of this neuro-transmitter affects everything from your stride to your speech.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roughly one million people in the United States have it, and there’s no cure for it, and it generally gets worse as one gets older. As Michael J. Fox himself once said, it’s the gift that keeps on taking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You don’t die from it, but it can be hard to live with it, yet there is one thing that unquestionably helps slow its progression. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exercise. Movement. Pull your achy body off the couch every day and work those quivering muscles, stretch those tight joints, perhaps join one of the many Parkinson’s programs in town that involve everything from dancing to hiking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For people living with Parkinson’s disease, regular exercise can reduce symptoms, help treatments work better and potentially even slow the disease progression,” Rachel Dolhun, principal medical advisor at the Michael J. Fox Foundation, wrote in an e-mail. “For some, exercise can look like participating in boxing classes. For others, it’s water aerobics, dancing or playing pickleball. Just remember that any type of and amount of exercise can positively support your journey.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re like me and you just want to punch Parky in the face, boxing works best. The 83 tough souls who t pay $179 a month to battle in the Kaizen Kinetics program agree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I hit the bag really hard like I’m hitting Parkinson’s,” said Rich Pumilia, 66, a lawyer from Monrovia. “Hitting it back for what it’s doing to me.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I became aware of Jody Hould’s program, which she leads with the help of husband Tom, son Zac and Anthony Rutherford, shortly after I was diagnosed. I kept seeing their pamphlets in doctors offices and rehab centers. At the time, they were part of the popular Parkinson’s-battling Rock Steady Boxing program that has several locations through southern California. By the time I worked up the courage to fully face my illness and call the number on the pamphlet two years ago, Kaizen had become an independent program with a similar focus on boxing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;”Boxing is balancing, posture, turning, pivoting, extension, range of motion, using your core, everything that’s important to fighting the disease,” said Hould, who started the program nine years ago in memory of her late mother, Julie, who died of complications from Parkinson’s. “Plus, it’s fun to punch something.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hould and her team run a fast-moving program, barking out a series of punches and kicks while offering gentle reminders to those who hook when they should jab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Parkinson’s doesn’t take any vacations, it doesn’t take any days off, we have to be on top of our game, we have to be proactive in our fight,” Hould said. “Not only is it good for the spirit, it’s good for the mind.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it can be tough on the ego, as I quickly learned when a frail white-haired woman out-punched me one day while screaming at the bag. Another time an aging man with tremors and shuffled steps pounded the bag so hard it skidded into my feet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I once showed up with a cut on my left hand and informed Hould that I would not be boxing that day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You still have your right hand, don’t you?” she said. “So you box one-handed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="enhancement" data-click="enhancement" data-align-center-expanded&gt;&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;

Every exercise and maneuver are seemingly designed to do something I now have difficulty doing. Sometimes it hurts. Sometimes you want to be anywhere else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it works. It can’t kill Parky, but it can quiet him. Hould never promises a cure, but she sees some relief in those who join the battle. There was one boxer who eventually abandoned her walker. Others have seen a reduction in their tremors. Throughout the windowless gym there is real hope that this disease can be slowed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pumilia is convinced his condition has improved after attending classes for eight weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When I was diagnosed, my doctor said you have five good years left before your life is going to be impacted,” said Pumilia. “Now my doctor is basically saying, ‘I don’t know what you’re doing, but keep doing it.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sharon Michaud, 65, a retired insurance executive who has also come to class for eight years, agrees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Without a doubt, it’s helped me,” said Michaud, who is noticeable in the class because she moves like a gymnast. “With Parkinson’s it’s easy to get into a funk and get depressed. You come here and it’s nice to know there are other people like you. I’m amazed more people don’t know there’s places like this out here.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe this story will shed some light on that. Maybe this story will inform a closeted Parkinson’s patient about programs like Kaizen Kinetics and empower them to pick up the phone and join.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you decide to come to Monrovia, I’ll be the breathless guy in the back still unable to deliver a knockout punch but continually inspired by fellow fighters to keep trading blows with my hardest of truths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I leave that gym sweaty and sore but uplifted with the reminder that I am blessed to still lead a wonderful active life filled with family and friends and work and travel and so, so much hope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have Parkinson’s. But, by God, it doesn’t have me.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;     &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Los Angeles Times</author><pubDate>Sun, 08 Jun 2025 15:49:59 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikAFBVV95cUxOaXNXajFrX2lRVURhb3pnTDNjSGQyNGdJUlg5OUhqWlpSalhvNW9ELVlzUFZpWUtjTGQxVlVOdENISXd5OE1vcGNTR3JYQlBoZ1lkTS1hQzc3SmEtbmpQenV4V2xrZnZSMXN0ZDhnWGpONHdiM1dFX1A5Qy1zNm5RbDFsQ1RqTV9JLUM3YmVUbzc</guid></item><item><title>拒绝死亡，从死里复活6次的男人--印度时报 | The man who refused to die, and came back from his death 6 times - Times of India</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The world is full of stories that make us question what we think we know about life and death. In some corners of the globe, some stories come to life in the form of people whose experiences can’t be explained by science or logic. Ismail Azizi, a man from Tanzania, is one such story. His life has become a powerful symbol of mystery, fear, and isolation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a recent documentary by Afrimax English via Nairaland, Azizi has reportedly died and come back to life six times. Each time he was declared medically dead, he came back alive and breathing under circumstances that left doctors and his local community stunned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;But instead of being known for surviving the impossible, Azizi has been pushed away, feared by his own neighbours, and even rejected by his family. His life now is one of complete isolation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Azizi’s first death reportedly followed a serious workplace accident. He was pronounced dead, placed in a morgue, and preparations for his burial began. But before the funeral, he woke up and walked out. “They took me to the morgue, but I woke up feeling very cold,” he told Afrimax. “Fortunately, the morgue wasn’t closed, and I walked out. When my family saw me, they ran away because they thought I was a ghost.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later, after a battle with malaria and another death declaration, Azizi once again revived, and this time as his family prepared to place him in a coffin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;From there, the incidents became even more shocking. After a car crash, a snakebite, a fall into a toilet pit, and even being burned in his own home by fearful neighbors, Azizi was declared dead again and again. In one case, his body remained in a morgue for three days before he shocked mourners by coming back to life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Azizi has never harmed anyone, locals grew suspicious, linking his returns to dark magic or supernatural forces. Some even accused him of witchcraft, setting his home on fire in fear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now living alone in a run-down house, Azizi supports himself through small farming, cooking, and cleaning. According to Afrimax, he is viewed as either cursed or immortal, and no longer receives support from his community or family. Despite everything, Azizi remains peaceful, but tired.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;His story may sound like a miracle, but for Azizi, it’s a lonely existence. “Every time I died and came back, my body felt strange,” he said. “People started treating me as if I were a witch.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Sun, 08 Jun 2025 15:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi2AFBVV95cUxPUkV4TzBsQlcydGdVY0dUTnpYZDJUSWpObmk0WktTVk51ZTFJVXlHbmpoWFJMR1pZZzM4RXB3OVBxc0xyV2Z3LW5BVmk5R1ZodFY3aGdheC1OWW1OMHlLbTFHVEpIazJRZXVvdzEwcVFJNDdqZ0FWYjBsVEpUUWlhUWxuRjRiM0hjb0RGaUxFcE5rcmpFZVhHTzdadFBoTnItOFJna1FlcWphQnNCUzRfLWwzWkVqYjRybDctUy1VWEZMdVhuNlpteTllbGJOZG5GMWVSN3dFZ2fSAd4BQVVfeXFMTmMwUjdRcUdDRTdxNlNMZi1WVU5UaUh6U0ZxcUZHZUppbGFJcGxnYmI5TFhubE9HUDFpSy1rcXY1YnRhQkI5TzZFbDdNNmhPRGRBOXZuelJySktsTURHU1lNYlJETmdpa2Rra2NBOHRBeWJBVjRHd2p4MjlGemtRMjBMVUNqMVhiMFFWeVJBeTFuVm5MbHRiTF9LdERoaGVpanp5T09ydkhjaDZseW5QU1ZEakNEc0dKLU02UjBwSU0yclh2TWVkczNQelNkZTNjUE9RSGRrMzRhV1Bodk9B</guid></item><item><title>新研究显示，这种饮食可以将您的痴呆风险降低高达25% - SciTechDaily | This Diet Could Reduce Your Risk of Dementia by up to 25%, New Study Reveals - SciTechDaily</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiogFBVV95cUxPS3JWRnlSaUFCTElxMWFlTUVLTnJRWEpJV09aYWlsLVRWNEg4MTRWRmtoSFk4SmpHWU9EUzFyUFNOd1lQQW1hdFdvNG5Bei1IVGlNZFBCQlZUNG9IM2g2MEhsMWFRNWJQRGpBdm9ORjNLaC1nck52Q1dPQ3lmZkVHTzdMaUhZZFFFWTZQS1RxanRka3pUMXRZdE8yVHRaMUJUWXc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SciTechDaily</author><pubDate>Sun, 08 Jun 2025 15:08:05 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiogFBVV95cUxPS3JWRnlSaUFCTElxMWFlTUVLTnJRWEpJV09aYWlsLVRWNEg4MTRWRmtoSFk4SmpHWU9EUzFyUFNOd1lQQW1hdFdvNG5Bei1IVGlNZFBCQlZUNG9IM2g2MEhsMWFRNWJQRGpBdm9ORjNLaC1nck52Q1dPQ3lmZkVHTzdMaUhZZFFFWTZQS1RxanRka3pUMXRZdE8yVHRaMUJUWXc</guid></item><item><title>2025年按国家和性别分列的吸烟率-视觉资本家 | Smoking Rates by Country and Gender in 2025 - Visual Capitalist</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigwFBVV95cUxQRThTaVB5UmNoUTlXVnk3alBQVlIwRm9OOUxUd2hnbGVlbEo3dWZOSk82bFZhcjl5Z2c1cTZtY0hzTkYtbktnaE8xY0V1bWxaQlJGNDUwT19EQTUwWlpMcTgyY2thN3N3WmhqamdwdW9hMmwzZ3Z2VFkwS2szZmN5QnNHQQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Visual Capitalist</author><pubDate>Sun, 08 Jun 2025 14:39:53 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigwFBVV95cUxQRThTaVB5UmNoUTlXVnk3alBQVlIwRm9OOUxUd2hnbGVlbEo3dWZOSk82bFZhcjl5Z2c1cTZtY0hzTkYtbktnaE8xY0V1bWxaQlJGNDUwT19EQTUwWlpMcTgyY2thN3N3WmhqamdwdW9hMmwzZ3Z2VFkwS2szZmN5QnNHQQ</guid></item><item><title>科学家发现了一种可以逆转2型糖尿病的细胞“开关” - Earth.com | Scientists identify a cellular 'switch' that could reverse type 2 diabetes - Earth.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiswFBVV95cUxNalpvMWpQeUtQTHAtbW1oazVKTWdWRERjU3RiYWQ2ajNyWmpZa2JRWVNXWm0yM2NuNDdjeGQ5bWhiX1ZYc0JGVlkyNVJuaFd6MzMwN1pmS0gzRXNDWGNNR3ZxMGY4Nm0tWi1rQUx1M1VNV2FRbkVBQjdneHIwWmxLamJZcFYxUVpoYl91d1NTU3RtVkl1RnVGU0xpZUx0V2FjXzFOTHJvT2NNT1FseVlCMzRqSQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page_content__AwOj6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Type 2 diabetes has affected millions across the world, with countless people experiencing daily blood sugar fluctuations and other health complications. Many individuals struggle with insulin resistance, which makes blood glucose levels hard to manage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://experts.umich.edu/5839-emily-walker" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Emily M. Walker&lt;/a&gt;, Ph.D, a research assistant professor of internal medicine at the University of Michigan, along with colleagues at &lt;a href="https://www.michiganmedicine.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Michigan Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, studied the root causes behind faulty energy production in mitochondria that ultimately affect insulin production, resulting in diabetes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They reported that halting a stress response inside cells may restore normal function, paving the way for treatments that could help reverse this metabolic disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-understanding-mitochondria-the-basics"&gt;Understanding mitochondria – the basics&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mitochondria are essential organelles found in most eukaryotic cells, often referred to as the “powerhouses” of the cell. They generate adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the molecule that fuels nearly every cellular activity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/fueling-the-mind-new-map-reveals-where-the-brain-gets-its-energy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;energy production&lt;/a&gt;, mitochondria also play crucial roles in regulating cell metabolism, calcium signaling, and even programmed cell death (apoptosis).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Structurally, mitochondria have a distinctive double-membrane design, with an outer membrane that encloses the organelle and a highly folded inner membrane that forms structures called cristae. These folds increase the surface area available for chemical reactions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mitochondria also possess their own DNA, which allows them to produce some of their own proteins and replicate independently of the cell’s nucleus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-role-of-mitochondria-in-diabetes"&gt;Role of mitochondria in diabetes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mitochondria hold a central spot in human biology because they &lt;a href="https://www.genome.gov/genetics-glossary/Mitochondria" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;convert nutrients into energy&lt;/a&gt;. When this conversion goes wrong, it can trigger a stress response that leads to poor insulin regulation and elevated blood sugar. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people with diabetes have experienced this shortfall, but the steps leading up to it were less defined until now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We wanted to determine which pathways are important for maintaining proper &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/damaged-mitochondria-recycled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;mitochondrial function&lt;/a&gt;,” said Walker. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers identified a stress response that emerges from damaged mitochondria. By interrupting this stress response with a compound known as &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30674674/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;ISRIB&lt;/a&gt;, their results showed a marked improvement in blood sugar handling in mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-insulin-producing-β-cells"&gt;Insulin-producing β-cells&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10046343/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;β-cell&lt;/a&gt; in the pancreas is responsible for releasing insulin, the hormone that regulates blood sugar. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These cells need high energy output from mitochondria to carry out their job. Weak energy conversion can disrupt insulin release, fueling the symptoms associated with &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/about/about-type-2-diabetes.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1104343" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;earlier work&lt;/a&gt; pointed to mitochondrial problems in diabetic patients, but more clarity was needed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new observations suggest that damaged mitochondria trigger changes in gene activity, steering β-cells into a less mature condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-stressed-mitochondria-and-diabetes"&gt;Stressed mitochondria and diabetes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investigators have also tested the same phenomenon in tissues like liver cells and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/brown-adipose-tissue" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;brown adipocytes&lt;/a&gt;. The liver is a vital organ for glucose management, while brown adipocytes help regulate body temperature. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In each case, the same mitochondrial stress response emerged, pushing cells away from their main functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We haven’t tested all possible cell types. Losing your β-cells is the most direct path to getting type 2 diabetes,” said &lt;a href="https://www.michiganmedicine.org/profile/104/scott-soleimanpour" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Scott A. Soleimanpour, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, director of the Michigan Diabetes Research Center and senior author of the study. He noted the wide-ranging nature of diabetes in body systems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blocking the damaging stress response opens up intriguing therapeutic angles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Restoring normal operation in cells that have not yet died offers a chance to shift type 2 &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/sugary-drinks-linked-to-millions-of-diabetes-and-heart-disease-cases/"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; management away from just mitigating symptoms. By preserving the identity of β-cells, the overall insulin balance can improve significantly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many drugs now in use either target blood sugar directly or boost insulin output. A drug that protects β-cells by hindering the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/mitochondria-cells-batteries-leaking-causes-inflammation-diseases/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;cellular stress response&lt;/a&gt; could complement existing approaches and lead to fewer side effects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts also continue to analyze how reversing cellular distress might apply to other chronic conditions that share similar mitochondrial problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-spotlight-on-daily-management"&gt;Spotlight on daily management&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the study focused on laboratory models, findings that reestablish &lt;a href="https://diabetes.org/health-wellness/medication/insulin-basics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;insulin&lt;/a&gt; production stand out in a field searching for long-term solutions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/type-2-diabetes-heightens-alzheimers-risk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt; is heavily influenced by lifestyle choices, but some people still experience complications even with diet and exercise. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A pharmaceutical that turns back the clock on β-cell health may help individuals who have not had success with current treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mounting evidence shows that &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/mitochondria-fling-dna-into-our-brain-cells-making-us-age-faster/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;cellular energy mishaps&lt;/a&gt; are closely linked to insulin resistance. The body responds to irregular energy signals by reprogramming cells, which sets off a chain reaction. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers now have a better handle on why &lt;a href="https://diabetesresearchcenter.wustl.edu/items/metabolic-tissue-function-core/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;metabolic tissues&lt;/a&gt; lose their maturity and how reversing that shift might stabilize blood sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-next-steps-and-future-hopes"&gt;Next steps and future hopes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Efforts are underway to further map out the exact interactions between mitochondria and the nucleus. Learning how cells translate stress signals into changes in gene function could unearth additional treatment paths. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists also plan to test ISRIB-like drugs in human tissue samples, aiming for more options in real-world clinical settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In-depth genetic analyses may shed light on the subtler triggers behind &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/global-diabetes-rate-has-doubled-reaching-over-800-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt;. Tests on how lifestyle factors and genetic predisposition interact with mitochondrial maintenance could expand the scope of these findings. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For many people, new insights on restoring healthier β-cell operation are a welcome boost to ongoing research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers behind this project are optimistic that therapies designed to preserve β-cell integrity may alter the direction of diabetes care. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By easing the damage to mitochondrial systems, those who struggle with type 2 diabetes may find their condition more manageable in the years ahead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adf2034" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Sun, 08 Jun 2025 14:09:05 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiswFBVV95cUxNalpvMWpQeUtQTHAtbW1oazVKTWdWRERjU3RiYWQ2ajNyWmpZa2JRWVNXWm0yM2NuNDdjeGQ5bWhiX1ZYc0JGVlkyNVJuaFd6MzMwN1pmS0gzRXNDWGNNR3ZxMGY4Nm0tWi1rQUx1M1VNV2FRbkVBQjdneHIwWmxLamJZcFYxUVpoYl91d1NTU3RtVkl1RnVGU0xpZUx0V2FjXzFOTHJvT2NNT1FseVlCMzRqSQ</guid></item></channel></rss>
