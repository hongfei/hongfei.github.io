Chan School of Public Health and provide the clearest evidence to date linking radioactive contamination in Coldwater Creek, a tributary of the Missouri River north of St. Louis, to long-term cancer risks in nearby residents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Our research indicates that the communities around North St. Louis appear to have had excess cancer from exposure to the contaminated Coldwater Creek,' said Marc Weisskopf, professor of environmental epidemiology and physiology at Harvard and corresponding author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Weisskopf's team found that individuals who lived within one kilometer of the creek as children between the 1940s and 1960s were significantly more likely to develop cancer later in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They believe the cancer is a result of ionizing radiation exposure from the creekbed, soil, and water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The source of the contamination dates back to one of the darkest and most secretive chapters in US history: the Manhattan Project, the clandestine federal initiative that developed the world's first &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/nuclear-weapons/index.html" id="mol-30067a40-6779-11f0-8c8d-27754c6a0193"&gt;nuclear weapons&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mallinckrodt Chemical Works, operating in downtown St. Louis, was responsible for processing uranium used in the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in 1945. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But after the war, barrels of radioactive waste were moved to open-air storage sites near Coldwater Creek, where they remained for years, exposed to rain, wind, and runoff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Generations of families played in Coldwater Creek which has resulted in thousands of people developing life-threatening cancers and other illnesses Pictured: A 1980s picture of a boy using a rope swing to jump into Coldwater Creek&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The radioactive waste from the plant was kept for years in barrels next to Coldwater Creek. Barrels full of waste were piled on top of one another&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above map shows the cancer rate per 100,000 residents in each Missouri county between 2017 and 2021. The rate in St Louis County is 458 per 100,000 people in that four-year period&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Those toxins, including uranium and thorium, leached into the soil and water, contaminating the surrounding environment and putting thousands at risk, especially children, who played in the creek, dug in the dirt, and breathed in radioactive dust kicked up during gardening or construction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now, decades later, the health toll is becoming undeniable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Harvard study, based on a cohort of 4,209 individuals who lived in the Greater St. Louis area between 1958 and 1972, found that 24% reported having cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Among those living closest to the creek, that number rose to 30%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Our study found that children in the 1940s to 1960s who lived near Coldwater Creek… had a 44% higher risk of cancer compared to those living further than 20 kilometers away,' said co-author Michael Leung, a postdoctoral fellow at Harvard's Department of Environmental Health, to &lt;a class="class" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/higher-cancer-rates-linked-wwii-radioactive-waste-midwestern-creek"&gt;Fox News.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The types of cancer reported include leukemia, thyroid, breast, and colon cancers are consistent with illnesses linked to radiation exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For many in North St. Louis County, the revelation is both vindicating and heartbreaking. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Families who grew up splashing in Coldwater Creek or building homes nearby have lost loved ones to aggressive cancers - often with no explanation, until now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Coldwater Creek (pictured) is labeled as one of the most polluted waterways in the US.

St. Louis activists have been fighting for years to get government compensation for people with cancer and other serious illnesses potentially connected to Manhattan Project nuclear contamination&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We hope these findings will support public health measures for affected communities, as well as ongoing efforts to remediate the creek,' Leung said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While nuclear workers had direct exposure, people who live near contamination sites worry about uncertainty. Many who grew up in the area weren't told about the risks for decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2007, Chapman and Karen Nickel were so concerned about cancer and other unusual illnesses in their St. Louis County neighborhoods that they formed Just Moms STL.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2019, the federal Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry issued a report that found people who regularly played in Coldwater Creek as children from the 1960s to the 1990s may have a slight increased risk of bone cancer, lung cancer and leukemia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The agency determined that those exposed daily to the creek starting in the 2000s, when cleanup began, could have a small increased risk of lung cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The government's sloppy handling of nuclear contamination over decades has understandably made people doubt official promises that conditions are safe now, said Arjun Makhijani, a nuclear expert and president of the Institute for Energy and Environmental Research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'There is zero trust,' he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption mol-para-with-font"&gt;Susie Gaffney poses for a photo along Coldwater Creek near where she used to live. The creek was contaminated when nuclear waste from the Manhattan Project flowed into the waterway. St. Louis played an important role in the country's effort to build the first nuclear weapon&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption mol-para-with-font"&gt;Jim Gaffney sits with fellow activists while discussing nuclear contamination. Gaffney, now in his 60s, grew up in the 1960s playing in Coldwater Creek. His childhood home backed onto it&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2007, Karen Nickel, left, and Dawn Chapman were so concerned about cancer and other unusual illnesses in their St. Louis County neighborhoods that they formed Just Moms STL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People in the St. Louis area are concerned that more illnesses are caused by the contamination and some are pushing for legislation to compensate those who are sick. Others have sued those responsible for the waste.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Several people with serious illnesses, or whose loved ones are sick, met recently at Nickel's house.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Jim Gaffney, now in his 60s, grew up in the 1960s playing in Coldwater Creek - his childhood home backed up to the waterway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I was always in the creek,' Gaffney said. 'Told not to, but we had seven kids. Mom couldn't watch us all. We just thought it was fun. We built mudslides and everything. I'm sure I got exposed.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He and his wife, Susie, loved the neighborhood so much that when they got married, they moved into a home there. Their children grew up playing in a park that backs to the creek, Susie Gaffney said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We had no warnings. We had no fears,' she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Jim Gaffney was diagnosed with Stage 4 Hodgkin lymphoma in 1981 and given little chance to survive. A bone-marrow transplant saved his life, but the toll of the radiation, chemotherapy and the disease has been enormous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption mol-para-with-font"&gt;Senator Josh Hawley, R-Mo spoke about  the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act during a news conference on Capitol Hill in Washington last September&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption mol-para-with-font"&gt;A member of the Navajo Nation holds holds a banner during a news conference about the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act on Capitol Hill in Washington&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A duck is seen swimming in the Coldwater Creek in Florissant, Missouri&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Now I've got hypertension, heart failure, I've had at least five bladder tumors removed since ´95. I'm still here, but it's not been easy,' he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Gaffneys' son Joe has battled thyroid cancer since 1998 when he was 18.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Tricia Byrnes swam in Weldon Spring quarries as a teenager.

The good news is that it’s reversible. &lt;a class="read-more-main-single read-more-main" href="https://collive.com/sweet-danger-soda-found-to-alter-your-gut-and-immune-health/"&gt;Full Story&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;div class="post_text"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By Israel News Network Group&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The consumption of soft drinks, supplemented with white sugar, alters the DNA of gut bacteria and affects the host immune system, according to the findings of a new study published in the journal Nature Communications by researchers at the Technion Institute in Haifa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news? The effects are reversible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gut bacteria are important members of the microbial community within our body, i.e., the microbiome. These bacteria, which have co-evolved with humans for generations, are so essential to human health in general and to the development of the immune system in particular that we cannot function without them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The human gut is constantly influenced by changes in the environment. To keep up, the gut bacteria must adapt quickly. They do this through a process called functional plasticity, which allows them to change their behavior and functions in response to factors like nearby microbes, our health status, and what we eat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A previous study by Professor &lt;strong&gt;Naama Geva-Zatorsky&lt;/strong&gt; and her team discovered that one way gut bacteria adapt to environmental changes is through DNA inversions—rapid genetic switches that help them respond and defend themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In their current study, the researchers investigated how these DNA inversions occur in response to dietary factors. They found that consuming soft drinks, which contain white sugar, can alter the DNA of gut bacteria and, in turn, impact the host’s immune system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers studied the effects of consuming different dietary components on the DNA inversion profile of these bacteria, in vitro, in mice, and humans. They discovered that white sugar consumption causes DNA inversions in these bacteria, which led to changes in inflammatory markers of the immune system, including ones in T-cell populations, cytokine secretion, and gut permeability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news is that these effects are reversible; once mice stopped consuming white sugar, the bacterial DNA inversion state reverted, and the immune system’s state returned to normal.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;

In some cases it can be deadly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Chikungunya is not a disease that is widely known, but it has been detected and transmitted in 119 countries globally, putting 5.6 billion people at risk," said the WHO's Diana Rojas Alvarez.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/mysterious-fatal-disease-x-outbreak-in-congo-still-cant-be-explained?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;Mysterious Fatal 'Disease X' Outbreak in Congo Still Can't Be Explained&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She recalled how from 2004 to 2005, a major chikungunya epidemic swept across the Indian Ocean, hitting small island territories before spreading globally and affecting almost half a million people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Today, WHO is seeing the same pattern emerge: since the beginning of 2025, Reunion, Mayotte, and Mauritius have all reported major chikungunya outbreaks.

Doctors have wondered for decades whether that extra body heat is simply coincidence or a clue to something deeper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new trove of data suggests the two feelings march together far more often than chance would allow. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spotting depression early can save months of struggle, and an everyday thermometer to measure your body temperature might become part of that early-warning kit, according to a fascinating study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-depression-and-body-temperature"&gt;Depression and body temperature&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A team of researchers – led by a team at the University of California, San Francisco (&lt;a href="https://www.ucsf.edu/"&gt;UCSF&lt;/a&gt;) and partners in 106 countries – studied seven months of depression scores and body temperature readings from more than 20,000 volunteers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the second month of analysis, a very clear pattern emerged: higher depression scores meant higher body temperatures. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants used household thermometers once a day and wore smart rings that sampled skin temperature thousands of times during each 24-hour cycle. The design captured both single snapshots and continuous streams, giving the study unusual breadth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each notch upward on the depression survey paired with a small rise in temperature – often less than one degree Fahrenheit – but the match held across climates, ages, and seasons. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That consistency lifts the evidence from this study above many previous lab experiments that relied on a few dozen college students at a time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-a-slight-rise-means"&gt;What a slight rise means&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A healthy core hovers near 98.6 °F, yet the body drifts up and down around that mark as metabolism revs or relaxes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this study, people reporting milder symptoms stayed close to the textbook average, while those with heavier moods sat just a hair warmer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The differences averaged less than one degree, and that alone won’t trigger an alarm. But across populations, it points to a biological shift that shadows emotional pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The investigators also compared the daily swing – called &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37640270/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;diurnal amplitude&lt;/a&gt; – between daytime peaks and nighttime lows. Smaller swings lined up with stronger depression scores. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trend scraped just below statistical significance, yet it matched hints from earlier controlled trials, suggesting timing may matter as much as the absolute reading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-nighttime-signal"&gt;The nighttime signal&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cooler evenings help the brain drift into &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/deep-sleep-clears-toxic-waste-from-the-brain/"&gt;deep sleep&lt;/a&gt;. Volunteers who scored high for depression did not shed heat as smoothly after sundown. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their temperature curves looked flatter, which may echo trouble in the internal clock that guides hormone release and sleep architecture. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chronic &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/rare-gene-explains-why-some-people-can-thrive-on-less-sleep/"&gt;short sleep&lt;/a&gt; is itself a risk factor for mood disorders, so a sluggish drop in temperature could add weight to an already heavy cycle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Circadian researchers have long noted that light exposure, meal timing, and exercise &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/feeling-groggy-a-simple-trick-can-transform-your-mornings/"&gt;reset the clock&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This new work pushes body temperature onto that list, raising the chance that adjusting thermal cues might nudge sleep and mood back into sync.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-depression-likes-warm-temperatures"&gt;Depression likes warm temperatures&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keeping core temperature in check is a full-time job. &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/syncing-brain-muscle-circadian-rhythms-slows-aging/"&gt;Muscles&lt;/a&gt;, the liver, and even the brain churn out heat, while blood flow to the skin and sweating carry it away. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3079864/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Stress hormones&lt;/a&gt;, low-grade inflammation, and shifts in neurotransmitters – all common in depression – can clog sweat glands and narrow tiny blood vessels near the surface. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Electrodermal readings, which track microscopic bursts of sweat, often register on the low end for people with depression, hinting at weaker cooling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A persistent half-degree rise may feel harmless, but over weeks it tweaks heart rate, muddles energy levels, and chips away at &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/deep-sleep-how-slow-waves-boost-memory-formation/"&gt;restorative sleep&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That steady drag can deepen emotional lows, creating a loop in which feeling down slows cooling and inadequate cooling worsens the mood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-heating-up-to-cool-down"&gt;Heating up to cool down&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Ironically, heating people up actually can lead to rebound body temperature lowering that lasts longer than simply cooling people down directly, as through an ice bath,” said &lt;a href="https://profiles.ucsf.edu/ashley.mason" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Ashley Mason&lt;/a&gt;, PhD, the study’s lead author and associate professor of psychiatry at &lt;a href="https://weill.ucsf.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;UCSF Weill Institute for Neurosciences&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What if we can track the body temperature of people with depression to time heat-based treatments well?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK6310/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Whole-body hyperthermia&lt;/a&gt;, for instance, asks a patient to relax under infrared lamps until core temperature climbs several degrees. A single session in one small trial lifted mood for weeks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Saunas, hot yoga, and long soaks in a 104 °F tub appear to provoke a similar rebound: the body overshoots on cooling afterward, leaving core temperature slightly lower for hours. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If timing that surge and crash lines up with individual temperature curves, it could become an affordable add-on to standard care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-taming-the-heat"&gt;Taming the heat&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“To our knowledge, this is the largest study to date to examine the association between body temperature – assessed using both self-report methods and wearable sensors – and &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/is-depression-contagious-couples-may-share-it-through-kissing/"&gt;depressive symptoms&lt;/a&gt; in a geographically broad sample,” Mason concluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Given the climbing rates of depression in the United States, we’re excited by the possibilities of a new avenue for treatment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roughly one-third of patients feel little relief after trying two &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/drugs-targeting-gut-cells-not-brain-cells-are-better-at-treating-depression-and-anxiety/"&gt;antidepressant drugs&lt;/a&gt;, and weekly talk therapy remains out of reach for many because of cost or distance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thermal protocols demand little gear beyond heaters, benches, or tubs already found in fitness centers. Insurance rarely covers such sessions today, but wider evidence may nudge payers to rethink that stance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, consumer wearables have plunged in price, making continuous temperature tracking a realistic self-care tool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-depression-temperature-and-the-future-0"&gt;Depression, temperature, and the future&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next step is simple in plan, tricky in practice: deliberately adjust body temperature, then watch mood move in real time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trials will compare saunas, heated vests, and water immersion to learn which triggers the most durable cooling. Researchers will also test whether syncing heat exposure with each person’s unique temperature rhythm improves results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No one expects warmth alone to overhaul depression treatment, yet it could offer relief to people who prefer non-drug options or need something to bridge long gaps between counseling visits. Because the approach is low-tech, it might reach rural clinics that struggle to hire mental-health specialists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, keeping an eye on the thermometer when low mood lingers could provide an early hint that the system is off balance. A small rise, coupled with persistent sadness or fatigue, may be reason enough to talk with a clinician.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full study was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-51567-w" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Scientific Reports&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 23 Jul 2025 00:44:23 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijwFBVV95cUxQeWUzcEZPNWhBZHpwQkk4bTJQbER2aHlsa0dIaWFBTU9ZRUgzSklWZDE4d0pqYlN2Q0pDS2xXU3ByS0xiVmxoZmhkWGJaLWJwTjFTYWJJWDFTMFI5TFlNdWFRbUhuTmhXWlFMTlVyRFNCQlI4OGVNbzZjRkJEcm0yNzJoYTJRSEttYnZwallnbw</guid></item><item><title>你可以热爱动物，但仍然吃肉-这就是为什么你的大脑必须屏蔽同理心才能做到这一点- VegOut | You can love animals and still eat meat—here’s why your brain has to block out empathy to do it - VegOut</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiyAFBVV95cUxQTGw2elU5bWhHRGFBLXlFZHlzX1RKMEI1azdHR1BEbkFyLTk0aWFiTDBSTlF0R3ZGMFpUM080dFE0YUV6bVBMSmVKbS1jdDNDcEJtN083azl0V0dtY05YMkdDdG55QWJ2NEN3SnZ2UTNidVBUM1huODJyQ202VlhwMkcyaUJnbGd5QzRqWXJLbHRGTDR3R0N6RThsQXk3N3JIUXFySTlHNUc5cF9OOVNYQlgzTTdzMmd6YjAxOTFNVFZRa1pyY2R6TQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page__content mt-4"&gt;
							&lt;p data-start="348" data-end="716"&gt;It’s a familiar scene: a doting pet parent lovingly feeding their rescue dog a bowl of grain-free kibble—then later that evening, slicing into a filet mignon with equal satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="348" data-end="716"&gt;Or the proud “chicken mom” who goes viral for knitting sweaters for her backyard hens…while ordering spicy wings from Uber Eats. These aren’t outliers—they’re all of us, to some degree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="718" data-end="1094"&gt;You can love animals and still eat meat. Most people do. But here’s the kicker: to make that coexistence feel emotionally okay, your brain actually has to step in and silence parts of itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="718" data-end="1094"&gt;It’s not hypocrisy so much as psychology. And once you understand what’s going on under the hood—neurologically and culturally—you can start to untangle the behaviors from the beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="1096" data-end="1150"&gt;The empathy switch: how your brain mutes discomfort&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1152" data-end="1469"&gt;Let’s start with the science. According to a 2016 study in &lt;em data-start="1211" data-end="1221"&gt;Appetite&lt;/em&gt;, the brain regions associated with &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/what-rat-empathy-may-reveal-about-human-compassion/?.com"&gt;empathy and moral decision-making&lt;/a&gt;—like the anterior cingulate cortex and the insula—light up when people see animals suffering. But when that animal is labeled “food”? Activity in those areas drops significantly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1471" data-end="1672"&gt;In other words, when we categorize a cow as “burger” instead of “being,” our brain turns down the emotional volume. Researchers call this &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_disengagement?.com"&gt;“moral disengagement,”&lt;/a&gt; and it’s a built-in feature, not a flaw.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1674" data-end="2070"&gt;This psychological distancing isn’t just theoretical—it’s measurable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1674" data-end="2070"&gt;A 2010 fMRI study published in &lt;em data-start="707" data-end="717"&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt; found that vegetarians and vegans exhibited &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0010847&amp;amp;.com"&gt;greater activation in empathy-related brain regions&lt;/a&gt;, such as the anterior cingulate cortex and inferior frontal gyrus, compared to omnivores when shown images of animal suffering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1674" data-end="2070"&gt;This suggests that frequent meat consumption may dull certain neural responses related to empathy, helping reduce cognitive dissonance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1674" data-end="2070"&gt;This doesn’t mean meat-eaters are cruel—it means their brains are doing what they must to avoid daily moral conflict.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2072" data-end="2206"&gt;Think of it like closing a window on a cold night. It doesn’t mean the air isn’t out there. You’ve just made it easier not to feel it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="2208" data-end="2247"&gt;Carnism: the invisible belief system&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2249" data-end="2485"&gt;Psychologist Melanie Joy coined the term &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnism?.com"&gt;“carnism”&lt;/a&gt; to describe the ideology that conditions us to eat certain animals while caring for others. It’s the unspoken rules that say it’s normal to love dogs, protect whales, and barbecue pigs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2487" data-end="2522"&gt;Carnism operates in three key ways:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol data-start="2524" data-end="2836"&gt;
&lt;li data-start="2524" data-end="2615"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2527" data-end="2615"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="2527" data-end="2544"&gt;Justification&lt;/strong&gt;: “Humans have always eaten meat,” “It’s natural,” or “It’s necessary.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-start="2616" data-end="2734"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2619" data-end="2734"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="2619" data-end="2635"&gt;Invisibility&lt;/strong&gt;: Animal agriculture is hidden behind euphemisms (“pork” instead of “pig”) and sanitized packaging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-start="2735" data-end="2836"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2738" data-end="2836"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="2738" data-end="2754"&gt;Dissociation&lt;/strong&gt;: We’re trained not to connect the steak to the steer, or the nugget to the chick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2838" data-end="3015"&gt;These mechanisms don’t exist to make us bad people—they help us function in a culture where meat is normalized. But if we start to name them, we can also start to question them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="3017" data-end="3067"&gt;The meat paradox: when love collides with habit&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3069" data-end="3129"&gt;So what happens when your identity clashes with your dinner?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3131" data-end="3335"&gt;Enter “the meat paradox.” That’s the term behavioral scientists use to describe the psychological conflict between caring for animals and eating them. It’s uncomfortable—but it’s also surprisingly common.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3337" data-end="3671"&gt;A 2020 paper published in &lt;em data-start="3363" data-end="3409"&gt;Social Psychological and Personality Science&lt;/em&gt; found that the &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Lauren-Camilleri-3/publication/341408268_The_role_of_moral_disengagement_and_animal_empathy_in_the_meat_paradox/links/6461a47ffbaf5b27a4c9731a/The-role-of-moral-disengagement-and-animal-empathy-in-the-meat-paradox.pdf?.com"&gt;more strongly people identified as animal lovers&lt;/a&gt;, the more mental gymnastics they performed to justify eating meat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3337" data-end="3671"&gt;In fact, these individuals were more likely to endorse myths like “animals don’t really suffer” or “meat is essential for health.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3673" data-end="3696"&gt;It’s empathy, detoured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3698" data-end="3984"&gt;But here’s where it gets juicy: when people confront the paradox head-on—by watching documentaries, visiting sanctuaries, or simply learning more about animal cognition—many start shifting their behavior. Not always toward full veganism, but toward conscious reduction. And that counts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="3986" data-end="4038"&gt;Why this matters for the planet (and your health)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4040" data-end="4175"&gt;This isn’t just about animals. The meat paradox also masks bigger issues, like climate change, public health, and community resilience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul data-start="4177" data-end="4862"&gt;
&lt;li data-start="4177" data-end="4456"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4179" data-end="4456"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="4179" data-end="4197"&gt;Climate impact&lt;/strong&gt;: According to the UN’s FAO, animal agriculture accounts for nearly &lt;a href="https://www.fao.org/family-farming/detail/en/c/1634679/?.com"&gt;14.5% of global greenhouse gas emissions&lt;/a&gt;—more than all the world’s cars, trucks, and planes combined. Beef alone produces five times the emissions of chicken and twenty times that of beans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-start="4457" data-end="4701"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4459" data-end="4701"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="4459" data-end="4476"&gt;Health impact&lt;/strong&gt;: The World Health Organization has classified processed meats as a &lt;a href="https://www.iarc.who.int/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Monographs-QA_Vol114.pdf?.com"&gt;Group 1 carcinogen&lt;/a&gt; (the same category as tobacco), while diets rich in plant-based proteins are linked to lower risks of heart disease and Type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-start="4702" data-end="4862"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4704" data-end="4862"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="4704" data-end="4724"&gt;Community impact&lt;/strong&gt;: Factory farming systems often rely on exploited labor, polluted waterways, and rural communities bearing the brunt of industrial runoff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4864" data-end="5023"&gt;Loving animals but eating meat isn’t just a personal paradox—it’s a cultural one. But change is possible, and it doesn’t require abandoning heritage or flavor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="5025" data-end="5080"&gt;A gentle unblocking: how to realign values and meals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5082" data-end="5319"&gt;So what can you do if you feel the stirrings of that paradox in your own life? Start by removing blame. You’re not a bad person for growing up with barbecue Sundays or loving your grandma’s chicken soup. Food is cultural. Food is memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5321" data-end="5389"&gt;But here’s how you can begin to bridge the empathy gap—step by step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 data-start="5391" data-end="5413"&gt;1. Name the animal&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5415" data-end="5674"&gt;Use their real name. Cow instead of beef. Pig instead of pork. Doing this gently reanimates the beings behind the bites. Research shows that meat-eaters who are reminded of the animal origins of food report increased discomfort—and decreased desire to eat it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 data-start="5676" data-end="5702"&gt;2. Learn their stories&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5704" data-end="5871"&gt;Follow animal sanctuaries on Instagram. Read about rescued farm animals. Watch short clips of cows playing or pigs cuddling. This isn’t manipulation—it’s reconnection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5873" data-end="5993"&gt;The more we see animals as individuals, the harder it becomes to overlook their suffering. That’s not guilt—it’s growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 data-start="5995" data-end="6018"&gt;3. Redefine protein&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6020" data-end="6293"&gt;We often justify meat consumption through nutrition. But the truth? Beans, lentils, tofu, tempeh, seitan, and even oats are packed with protein. A 2023 Harvard study showed that plant-based diets easily meet protein needs—with added benefits for heart health and longevity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6295" data-end="6365"&gt;Empathy doesn’t have to clash with health. They can align beautifully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 data-start="6367" data-end="6388"&gt;4. Cook with care&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6390" data-end="6614"&gt;Shift the ritual. If meat has always been the centerpiece of your plate, try flipping the script: let seasonal veggies shine, experiment with spice-forward marinades, or recreate comfort food classics with plant-based swaps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6616" data-end="6743"&gt;I once made my grandmother’s birria using jackfruit and ancho chiles. It wasn’t identical—but it was soulful, and she loved it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 data-start="6745" data-end="6780"&gt;5. Make space for in-betweeners&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6782" data-end="7048"&gt;You don’t need to go “all or nothing” overnight. Flexitarian, reducetarian, or plant-curious—there’s room for nuance. Reducing meat even a few meals a week can significantly lower your carbon footprint, support animal welfare, and free up mental space for alignment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 data-start="7050" data-end="7079"&gt;6. Involve your community&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7081" data-end="7259"&gt;Invite friends over for a plant-based potluck. Share recipes instead of lectures. When change feels communal, it’s more likely to stick—and it becomes a source of joy, not shame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 data-start="7261" data-end="7290"&gt;7. Celebrate flavor first&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7292" data-end="7510"&gt;Plant-based eating is not about subtraction. It’s about expansion. Charred eggplant with miso glaze, roasted corn esquites, mango-chili ceviche made with hearts of palm—these dishes deliver both comfort and creativity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="7512" data-end="7552"&gt;The emotional side of shifting habits&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7554" data-end="7754"&gt;Change can bring up grief. You might miss certain textures, or the nostalgia of a family recipe. That’s okay. Acknowledge it. Food is tied to identity, and you’re not losing anything—you’re expanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7756" data-end="8072"&gt;In fact, many people who reduce or eliminate meat report a surprising benefit: they feel &lt;em data-start="7845" data-end="7854"&gt;lighter&lt;/em&gt;, emotionally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8074" data-end="8212"&gt;That’s because the empathy switch doesn’t have to stay off forever. You can turn it back on—and when you do, the world often feels richer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="8214" data-end="8248"&gt;The upshot? Empathy is a muscle&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8250" data-end="8441"&gt;The more we use it, the stronger it gets. And yes—sometimes that means feeling more. But it also means living more truthfully, more tenderly, and more in sync with the values we already hold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8443" data-end="8608"&gt;You can love animals. You can even grieve what you didn’t know. And you can still eat well, with joy, color, and deep cultural roots—just pointed in a new direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8610" data-end="8692"&gt;Because the heart has room for both compassion and change. And your plate can too.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;GLP-1s - which mimic the effects of the hormone that stimulates insulin release, suppressing glucagon, and slowing stomach emptying - also have a range of other benefits including significant weight loss, improved blood sugar control, and potential cardiovascular benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But they too come with negative side effects, including vomiting, mood changes and vision problems.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers believe the new findings could help shape future clinical guidelines for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, especially with GLP-1 medication costs decreasing due to market competition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the new study, the researchers drew on anonymized electronic health records from a global health research network (Trinetx) spanning the period 2004 to 2024 to track the development of dementia in patients with type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The patients had been treated with either GLP-1s or metformin (there were 87,229 patients in each group with an average age of 58) for at least six consecutive months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;From the data, the researchers found that GLP-1 drugs were &lt;span&gt;associated with a significantly lower (10 percent) risk of developing dementia, overall, with an incidence of about 2.5 percent compared with an incidence of nearly five percent for metformin.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And specifically, taking this type of drug was associated with a 12 percent lower risk of developing Alzheimer's disease, and a 25 percent lower risk of developing other non-vascular dementias than metformin use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Further in-depth analyses showed that these positive effects were evident across all age groups, but with the strongest effect among people over 60, women, and those of White ethnicity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Risk of death from any cause was also lower.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The researchers believe the new findings could help shape future clinical guidelines for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, especially with GLP-1 medication costs gradually decreasing due to market competition &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nearly five percent of those treated with GLP-1 receptor agonists died compared with nearly nine percent of those treated with metformin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;With metformin, the researchers note that the benefits primarily derive through a variety of metabolic processes that impact the entire body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These include reducing glucose production in the liver, increasing insulin sensitivity, and influencing gut health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, GLP-1 receptor agonists&lt;span&gt; exert direct effects on the central nervous system by crossing the blood-brain barrier.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This allows them to act on GLP-1 receptors within the brain, influencing various functions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Therefore, this could make them a more effective solution than metformin, especially when it comes to dementia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is an observational study, and as such, no firm conclusions can be drawn about cause and effect. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And the researchers point out that the tracking period, while sufficient for observing dementia outcomes, may not fully capture long-term cognitive effects, especially given the progressive nature of Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They conclude: 'Given the severe societal, familial, and economic burden of diabetes-related dementia, these findings raise important considerations about the role of GLP-1 [receptor agonists] as first-line therapies in [type 2 diabetes] management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'While further long-term studies are warranted to validate these results, integrating GLP-1 [receptor agonists] as primary therapeutic agents may represent a paradigm shift in preventing the cognitive complications of diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Both medications demonstrate neuroprotective properties, such as reducing neuroinflammation and oxidative stress, improving insulin sensitivity, and enhancing cerebrovascular health, which likely contribute to their benefits in overall dementia.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Of course, they have no way of really knowing—which is why some of the “hung smile” posts &lt;a href="https://x.com/narutopeachs/status/1913966286515675647"&gt;have&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://x.com/wildflowertv/status/1938314096962847062"&gt;become&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://x.com/_uncle_gworl/status/1872463955127619876"&gt;purposefully&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://x.com/emonormie/status/1934117024763924555"&gt;silly&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

But there’s no clear throughline, and even those posting about “hung smiles” concede it’s just another way for them to say these guys are hot. “It’s used a lot to compliment masculine and buff men, especially male actors, singers, influencers etc.,” said the anonymous person behind the X account @fabbgrat—they went viral earlier in July with a “&lt;a href="https://x.com/fabbgrat/status/1942207363622011281"&gt;hung smile” post&lt;/a&gt; about &lt;a href="https://slate.com/culture/2025/07/superman-2025-movie-reviews-new-james-gunn.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Superman&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; star David Corenswet that was favorited more than 58,000 times.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="142" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmdf0pr2000093b77k3gjdccb@published"&gt;“Hung smile” has existed online for many years, albeit in a different form—a &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130317173425/https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=hung%20smile"&gt;2011 entry&lt;/a&gt; on Urban Dictionary stated it referred at the time to the fond smile a person might demonstrate when recalling the size of their ex-partner’s extraordinarily huge penis. Its current meaning appears to have been popularized late last year thanks to a post about a surprising figure: accused health care CEO killer &lt;a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2024/12/luigi-mangione-manifesto-unitedhealthcare-ceo-brian-thompson.html"&gt;Luigi Mangione.&lt;/a&gt; When police released images of a suspect during their manhunt in December, &lt;a href="https://www.interviewmagazine.com/culture/flick-that-bean-one-night-in-times-square-with-blizzy-mcguire"&gt;Blizzy McGuire&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="https://www.papermag.com/blizzy-season"&gt;shit-posting&lt;/a&gt; social media star who gave the world the “&lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/davidmack/christian-girl-autumn-meme-caitlin-convington-emily-gemma"&gt;Christian Girl Autumn” meme&lt;/a&gt; in 2019, proclaimed that the handsome man seen smiling in CCTV footage had “that hung smile.” Their &lt;a href="https://x.com/blizzy_mcguire/status/1864732383859093789"&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; has since been seen more than 9.3 million times on X, causing McGuire to ask &lt;a href="https://x.com/blizzy_mcguire/status/1934489278777602121"&gt;six months later&lt;/a&gt; whether she was responsible for the term’s ascendence.

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="139" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmdf0pr4y000a3b77scjqzzop@published"&gt;So is it possible for someone’s smile to be an outward reflection of what lies beneath? No, you horny idiots. Well, rather … not &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt;, explained Justin Dubin, a &lt;a href="https://www.mhs.net/providers/d/dubin-justin"&gt;Florida urologist&lt;/a&gt;, member of the American Urological Association, and co-host of a &lt;a href="https://www.themanuppod.com/"&gt;podcast about men’s health&lt;/a&gt;. Aptly comparing “hung smiles” to “&lt;a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/big-dick-energy-bde"&gt;big dick energy&lt;/a&gt;” (a term &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/2018/6/27/17506898/big-dick-energy-explained"&gt;popularized in 2018&lt;/a&gt; thanks to Pete Davidson and Ariana Grande’s relationship), Dubin said that what people may actually be responding to in these men could be a perceived sense of self-confidence that may or may not be connected to penis size. “If you have a perceived larger penis size, you’ll have a more favorable image to yourself,” Dubin said. “Because you’re more confident in yourself, maybe you do have a big dick energy because of the fact you &lt;em&gt;believe&lt;/em&gt; you have a bigger dick.”&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="163" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmdf0pr7z000b3b77zbaiyxqt@published"&gt;The first step to understanding any of this is appreciating that the relationship between a man and his penis can be extraordinarily personal, and a lot of men don’t like what they see downstairs. As many as &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2007/may/31/health.medicineandhealth1"&gt;almost half of all guys&lt;/a&gt; may be dissatisfied with their size, even if &lt;a href="https://peplau.psych.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/141/2017/07/Lever_Frederick_Peplau_2006.pdf"&gt;85 percent of their female partners&lt;/a&gt; are more than pleased. (Among gay men, there is &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180909065240/https://www.gmfa.org.uk/fs160-the-penis-issue"&gt;some evidence&lt;/a&gt; penis size might matter a touch more, and may determine &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2874247/"&gt;whether they are more likely to top or bottom&lt;/a&gt;). As with most body-image issues, a man’s perception of his penis is often affected by media he may consume. One &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31107944/"&gt;2019 study&lt;/a&gt; interviewing six men who had undergone penile augmentation surgery found they were often influenced by seeing large penises in pornography or hearing jokes about small penises in mainstream media. (Just as an FYI, a &lt;a href="https://bjui-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/bju.13010"&gt;2014 international study&lt;/a&gt; of more than 15,000 penises found an average erect length of 5.16 inches and girth of 4.6 inches.)&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="96" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmdf0prb5000c3b77eawaf78f@published"&gt;Crucially, though, whether a man is smaller than average or not, men who &lt;em&gt;believe&lt;/em&gt; they’re on the smaller side are likely to be &lt;a href="https://www.psypost.org/dissatisfaction-with-penis-size-and-genital-appearance-tied-to-mental-health-issues-in-men/#google_vignette"&gt;less sexually satisfied&lt;/a&gt; and more likely to suffer from &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13685538.2024.2363275#abstract"&gt;anxiety or depression&lt;/a&gt;. Conversely, guys who do seem self-assured or happy with their junk may thus naturally radiate big dick energy, whether justifiably or not. That’s in line with the findings of one &lt;a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2006-09081-001"&gt;2006 study&lt;/a&gt; that found men who rated their penises as larger than average also believed themselves to be more attractive overall, suggesting a general confidence boost because of their perceived size.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="92" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmdf0prdy000d3b77xybjcoxw@published"&gt;One of the study’s authors, David Frederick, who is an associate professor of psychology at California’s Chapman University, presented some unpublished research at the Sexuality Preconference of the Society for Personality and Social Psychology this year. Frederick found that men who reported having larger penises and greater upper-body muscularity were also more confident flirting and pursuing romantic relationships. “Men’s views of their penis size were far more important than their height or weight for identifying which men were more confident hitting on a stranger or asking for their number,” Frederick told me.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="29" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmdf0prgz000e3b77wubgork2@published"&gt;“There are obviously no studies on whether men with larger penises have more confident smiles, but there are reasons these men might have something to smile about,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="74" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmdf0prjz000f3b777r1u6b91@published"&gt;Seeking further clarity, I reached out to the first person who came to mind: the &lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/girthmaster-onlyfans-creator-adult-star-viral-1235009248/"&gt;Girthmasterr&lt;/a&gt;, the Australian &lt;a href="https://www.interviewmagazine.com/culture/getting-deep-with-girthmasterr-the-biggest-star-on-onlyfans"&gt;OnlyFans creator&lt;/a&gt; who became &lt;a href="https://x.com/zoneofcarlos/status/1782047063070716223"&gt;virally famous&lt;/a&gt; last year thanks to his 8-inch-long, 7-inch-circumferenced penis. “There’s definitely truth to the big dick smile,” he told me. “It comes from knowing that your dick is big enough to get the job done—you need only the opportunity to prove it. You’re immune to the dick-measuring contest without any effort.”&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="95" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmdf0prmx000g3b77lsi83wbk@published"&gt;Truth be told, I didn’t notice anything particularly distinctive about the Girthmasterr’s smile. In &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C5hILIrPjTw/?hl=en"&gt;some&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C7vPMbgRnKu/?hl=en&amp;amp;img_index=1"&gt;photos&lt;/a&gt;, he shows his teeth, but in &lt;a href="https://www.interviewmagazine.com/culture/getting-deep-with-girthmasterr-the-biggest-star-on-onlyfans"&gt;many others he doesn’t&lt;/a&gt;. He just looks sort of … normal, albeit &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DBHwHc4T0q5/?hl=en"&gt;confident&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DHpqkl6x7nl/?hl=en&amp;amp;img_index=1"&gt;content&lt;/a&gt;. But the Girthmasterr said the thing that gives him this energy is being free from the mental anguish he believes smaller guys suffer from. “The real confidence of having a big dick comes from knowing how unimportant it is to many women, whereas men that don’t have a big dick will always wonder ‘What if,’ ” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="94" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmdf0prpw000h3b77fy29zry3@published"&gt;Dubin, the urologist, can understand where the current boom in “hung smile” jokes comes from because he believes it’s very normal to want to speculate about the size of a man’s penis. In the past, people have tried to deduce men’s size by gleaning things from their height, race, hand span, or foot size. However, Dubin said there’s not much scientific data to support any general connection between these features and the penis. He did, however, point to some studies that suggested things like &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37305632/"&gt;nose&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.menshealth.com/sex-women/a38021905/nose-penis-size-connection-doctor-explains-anthony-youn/"&gt;size&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.menshealth.com/health/a38123633/index-finger-penis-size-ratio-tiktok/"&gt;finger length&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17191423/"&gt;butt size&lt;/a&gt; may be connected.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="153" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmdf0prtg000i3b77sut7z3ov@published"&gt;If people are drawing connections between a man’s smile and his penis, it may also be because there is evidence that the reverse is true. In 2022, &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12119-022-10000-y"&gt;researchers found&lt;/a&gt; that people shown pictures of different men’s penises made judgments about their personality and handsomeness. Prototypical penises were associated with attractiveness, being good in bed, agreeableness, and openness to experiences. Meanwhile, men with narrower penises were thought to be more neurotic, while those with wider ones were seen as more extroverted and sexually active. “First impressions really, really matter,” New Mexico Highlands University assistant professor of psychology Thomas R. Brooks, one of the researchers behind the study, told me. “When we don’t have a lot of information on somebody when we first meet them or encounter them, whether that’s in person or online, we take what we get and we have what are called heuristics that we use to make shortcut assumptions about people.”&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="125" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmdf0prwi000j3b77v3bdljqs@published"&gt;Brooks conceded he hadn’t heard of the “hung smile” term until I contacted him, but believed it could be a phenomenon that warrants further study. He suggested, though, that what might be occurring is a variation of the so-called &lt;a href="https://www.simplypsychology.org/halo-effect.html"&gt;halo effect&lt;/a&gt;, whereby we allow our positive judgment of a person in one area of their life—in this case, their appearance or smile—to color our perception of them in other areas. “If you see a cute dude on social media, and he’s got the ‘hung smile’ and you’re initially attracted to him, then you’re probably going to generalize that good feeling you have to other areas, like that he’s got a great personality, he takes care of his mom, and he probably has a big dick.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="49" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmdf0przg000k3b77b4e42oi7@published"&gt;However, it’s also possible that if you’re attracted to a man’s “hung smile,” you could just be attracted to his smile alone. A &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7854600/"&gt;2021 study&lt;/a&gt; found that bigger smiles were perceived as more attractive, meaning that you’re probably just projecting other things about that man with a big grin.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="95" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmdf0ps2b000l3b7731wsofw8@published"&gt;At the end of the day, Dubin believes the only way to correctly determine the size of a man’s junk is to actually measure it. After all, he would know. “I’ve seen more penises than 99 percent of people, and I have no idea,” he said. “I cannot predict what anyone’s penis size is when they walk into that room.” But even if you’re not a guy who’s packing, Dubin suggested you can simply fake it till you make it: “Believing and acting like you have a big dick, people will think that you &lt;span class="slate-paragraph--tombstone"&gt;do.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

At just 17 years old, he finds himself facing unexpected pressure from his family after his young niece is diagnosed with leukemia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I really really don’t want to sound egoistic, but I’m a guy with long hair, which over the years has basically become my personality,” the teen explains in &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1m49412/aitah_for_refusing_to_cut_off_my_hair_because_my/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:his post;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;his post&lt;/a&gt;. He says that while he’s always cared for his niece and her family, he’s struggling with the idea of giving up the one thing that brings him confidence and joy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getty&lt;/p&gt; Stock photo of man shaving child's hair&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The situation begins when his 7-year-old niece is diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), a moment that the teen says “basically broke their family apart.” Wanting to be supportive, he makes efforts to emotionally be there for his niece and the rest of the family during the difficult time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But things shift when chemotherapy causes his niece’s “beautiful long blonde hair” to fall out, and her family decides to shave her head. “The next day, a group chat including the entire family was created where my aunt announced it would be wholesome if everyone shaved their hair off as well,” he writes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At first, the teen finds the idea “wholesome,” but admits he doubts anyone would actually follow through. That changes quickly when he comes home to find both his mother and sister already bald. “[Followed] by my other cousin, and grandma,” he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pressure mounts when his mother confronts him the next morning. “When are you ready to do it?” she asks, trimmer in hand. The teen is stunned. “I originally thought it was something to decide on your own,” he says. “But since everyone else is doing it, I’m kind of being pushed into a corner.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though he deeply loves his niece, the teen can’t ignore how much his hair means to him. “It’s pretty much the only thing about myself I love,” he admits. He also questions how much the gesture really matters to his niece, recalling a video his aunt took of her reaction to other family members shaving their heads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“She has to tap her maybe 4 times to get her attention, and when she looks, she just stares at it, says ‘wow’ and continues watching her cartoon,” he writes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After watching that video, he notices his mom becoming “pushy” about him doing the same. “In other words, she wants to drag me down into the pit with her,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Things intensify when he receives a text from his aunt urging him to shave his head too. “She said it would be really nice if I shaved my head as well, in order to show my emotional support,” he writes. But the teen questions whether the act would truly have any impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If we have to keep things real, shaving my head will basically change nothing in the entire situation,” he says. “But I can’t just say no, can I?” He reveals that what stings the most is the lack of acknowledgment shown to the family members who already shaved their heads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If my aunt would have shown a little more appreciation to my sister and mom, I would have probably considered it,” he admits. “But considering she did not even reply to the pictures and just immediately showed them to my niece, as if you HAVE to do it, I don’t think I’m willing to do it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getty&lt;/p&gt; Stock photo of family upset with teen boy&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the emotional weight of the decision, the teen reiterates his love for his niece. “I really really really love my niece,” he writes. “And even though I’m not that close with her, I always really cared about her and made sure she always felt comfortable with me.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Never miss a story — sign up for &lt;a href="https://people.com/people-news-daily-newsletter-sign-up-8692701" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:PEOPLE's free daily newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;PEOPLE's free daily newsletter&lt;/a&gt; to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the emotional burden is growing, and the teen feels outnumbered. “I’m almost getting threatened to cut off my hair by three people,” he shares. What troubles him most is the fear of sacrificing something personal only for it to go unrecognized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If I do decide to do it, what if no appreciation is shown?” he asks. “Yes, I would have done it, to show support from my side, but if it’s nowhere to be appreciated, then what’s the point?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other Redditors weigh in, including cancer survivors themselves. “Don’t do it,” one commenter writes. “I never asked, wanted anyone to do that. It made me feel worse.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another commenter echoes that sentiment. “As a cancer patient, I never understood this gesture,” they say. “I also see it as attention seeking behavior.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The teen ends his post not with anger, but with a question that reflects the emotional complexity of his situation. “But really, what do I do?” he asks. “I seriously really don’t know.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://people.com/teen-sparks-family-fallout-over-refusal-to-shave-head-for-niece-with-cancer-11776303" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:People;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;People&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo Home</author><pubDate>Tue, 22 Jul 2025 21:33:21 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiekFVX3lxTE9VTzJGM053emN4d1VWRzltRG5nWWZBb2E4NmVSSkhSbG5Yb2NIOVk5eV96UnFZUmZQRGxxTHdXcVB2S04wSHVGaDBHUmVJUVJCNDNqZ3BnS2dRSllzUnM0SFV1Mjl4QVN5X3FVaUR0YWZIaGx1aFRTRlFR</guid></item><item><title>南卡罗来纳州死于脑吞噬变形虫。医生解释降低患病风险的方法- WLTX | Death from brain-eating amoeba in South Carolina confirmed.

        &lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;COLUMBIA, S.C. — A South Carolina children's hospital has confirmed a death from a &lt;a href="/article/news/local/brain-eating-amoeba-south-carolina/101-da55c2f0-ec50-4446-9353-d77c6c8fca0f" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;brain-eating amoeba&lt;/a&gt; in South Carolina. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Department of Public Health sent an email out Tuesday evening saying that the "organism is presumed to have occurred at Lake Murray."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prisma Heath Richland Children's Hospital in Columbia confirmed Tuesday that a patient treated at their facility died from the organism. This announcement came a day after the South Carolina Department of Public Health (SCDPH) confirmed that there was a case of someone contracting the illness, but did not confirm a death. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We send our condolences to the family,” said Dr. Anna Kathryn Burch, a pediatric infectious disease physician at Prisma Health Children's Hospital. “The people here at Prisma Health Children’s Hospital care, and just want you to know that we’re thinking of your family.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prisma Health did not give any additional details regarding the patient, including the person's age and where that person may have come into contact with the amoeba. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amoeba--whose scientific name is Naegleria fowleri--can be found in warm freshwater but occasionally has been detected in tap water. The Centers for Disease Control stresses that infections are extremely rare, with fewer than 10 cases a year in the U.S. However, those cases are usually deadly.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DPH says there have been 167 cases reported nationwide in the past 62 years. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Burch held a media briefing Tuesday where she addressed questions about the amoeba. Here is a summary of some of those response and questions some people may be answering in the wake of this news. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;p class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;h3 id="isPasted"&gt;What is N&lt;em&gt;aegleria fowleri&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/h3&gt;                    &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;Naegleria fowleri&lt;/em&gt; is an amoeba that is ubiquitous to any fresh water in the state of South Carolina and honestly in the Southeast in general, Burch said. "So any lake, river, pond, or hot spring that you could come into contact with in South Carolina will have this amoeba in it. It typically lives in the silt at the bottom of lakes and rivers."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The interesting thing is that for most people who come in contact with this type of amoeba, it causes no harm whatsoever. Most of us have been exposed to this amoeba who have been in lakes and rivers and those kind of things. The problem is, is that it's not an issue when we come in contact with it.  Where it becomes a problem is if water with the amoeba forcefully enters the nose is able to cross from the nose into the brain. It cause a syndrome called primary amoeba meningoencephalitis.... which causes the brain to swell. More than 97% of reported U.S. cases have been fatal.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Burch adds the amoeba does not exist in salt water, so there is no risk if you're at the beach near the ocean. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;p class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;h3 id="isPasted"&gt;How common is this infection?&lt;/h3&gt;                    &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In my career as a pediatric infectious disease physician in South Carolina, I’ve now seen two cases," Burch said "There has only been one reported case in the state this year, and this is that case.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;p class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;h3 id="isPasted"&gt;What can parents do to protect their children?&lt;/h3&gt;                    &lt;/p&gt;
                    
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Avoiding forceful entry of water into the nose during activities like diving, tubing, or skiing&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teaching kids to blow out their nose or hold their nose when jumping into water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using nose clips during freshwater activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Avoiding digging in shallow, sandy or silty areas, where the amoeba lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, never use untreated tap water for nasal irrigation devices like neti pots. Tap water must be boiled and cooled, or use sterile or distilled water instead.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;p class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;h3 id="isPasted"&gt;Should families avoid swimming in lakes and rivers?&lt;/h3&gt;                    &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is a tough question, especially for those of us raised in the South where freshwater swimming is a summer tradition. The risk increases during extremely hot temperatures. Families should weigh the risks and take precautions like nose clips, avoiding dunking, or choosing to float instead of diving. Pools and splash pads are typically safe because they are chlorinated.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;p class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Is the risk greater in warmer weather? &lt;/h3&gt;                    &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The risk definitely is increased when it's hotter temperatures, such as when we get these 100 degree days. So if you do happen to go into the water during those times, I think having a discussion with your children about why it's so important to learn how to not get water up the nose, have things like the nose clips out there. Maybe decide not to go on the tube and just float around with floats and those kind of things."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;p class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;h3 id="isPasted"&gt;What’s your advice for concerned parents?&lt;/h3&gt;                    &lt;/p&gt;
                                
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is a rare infection—fewer than 10 cases are reported per year in the U.S. But knowing how it spreads and how to reduce risk is the best thing you can do. We shouldn’t be afraid of our lakes and rivers, but we should be informed and cautious. Educate your kids, use nose protection, and make the decision that’s right for your family.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;p class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;h3 id="isPasted"&gt;What are the symptoms?&lt;/h3&gt;                    &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Symptoms usually begin around five days after exposure, but it can range from one to twelve days. It starts with a severe headache, fever, stiff neck, vomiting, and diarrhea. If your child has recently been in freshwater and shows any of those symptoms, it’s critical to tell your healthcare provider.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;p class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;h3 id="isPasted"&gt;Is it found in tap water?&lt;/h3&gt;                    &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s rare, but there have been isolated cases where &lt;em&gt;Naegleria fowleri&lt;/em&gt; was found in tap water. Chlorinated water should not carry risk, but again, never use tap water for nasal rinsing unless it’s been properly boiled or sterilized.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;p class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;h3 id="isPasted"&gt;Is it difficult to diagnose?&lt;/h3&gt;                    &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yes, because it’s so rare, it’s not always top-of-mind for providers. That’s why it’s vital to mention any recent freshwater exposure to your doctor. Knowing that can help guide proper testing and quicker diagnosis.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

By analyzing gene activity from healthy and neurodegenerative brain tissue, they pinpointed 453 interventions predicted to reverse cellular aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Initial animal tests showed improvements in behavior, cognition, and molecular markers of youth in older mice. This breakthrough paves the way for therapies that could protect against neurodegeneration and promote brain health in aging populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aging Clock:&lt;/strong&gt; Machine learning tool predicts biological brain cell age using gene data.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rejuvenation Hits:&lt;/strong&gt; Identified 453 compounds that reverse age-related cell decline.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Proof of Concept:&lt;/strong&gt; Mice treated with predicted compounds showed improved memory and younger gene profiles.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;CIC bioGUNE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What if there was a way to make aging brain cells younger again? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An international research team from Spain and Luxembourg recently set out to address this question. After developing an aging clock capable of assessing the biological age of the brain, they used it to identify possible brain-rejuvenating interventions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The computational tool they created, recently presented in the journal &lt;em&gt;Advanced Science,&lt;/em&gt; constitutes a valuable resource to find compounds with therapeutic potential for neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-111884"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/aging-clock-neurogenesis-neurosicnce.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/aging-clock-neurogenesis-neurosicnce-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/aging-clock-neurogenesis-neurosicnce-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/aging-clock-neurogenesis-neurosicnce-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/aging-clock-neurogenesis-neurosicnce-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/aging-clock-neurogenesis-neurosicnce-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/aging-clock-neurogenesis-neurosicnce-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/aging-clock-neurogenesis-neurosicnce.jpg" alt="This shows a clock and neurons." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/aging-clock-neurogenesis-neurosicnce.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/aging-clock-neurogenesis-neurosicnce-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/aging-clock-neurogenesis-neurosicnce-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/aging-clock-neurogenesis-neurosicnce-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/aging-clock-neurogenesis-neurosicnce-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/aging-clock-neurogenesis-neurosicnce-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/aging-clock-neurogenesis-neurosicnce-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The researchers developed what is called an “aging clock”, a computational tool designed to measure the biological age of cells, as opposed to their chronological age. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the world population is aging rapidly, with over two billion people projected to be above the age of 60 by 2050, age-related brain disorders are on the rise. Living longer but in poor health is not only a daunting prospect; it also places a substantial burden on healthcare systems worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea of being able to counteract the functional decline of our brain through rejuvenating interventions sounds therefore promising. The question is how can we identify compounds that have the potential to efficiently rejuvenate brain cells and to protect the aging population from neurodegeneration? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prof. Antonio Del Sol and his teams of computational biologists, based both at CIC bioGUNE, member of BRTA, and the Luxembourg Centre for Systems Biomedicine (LCSB) from the University of Luxembourg, used their machine learning expertise to tackle the challenge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Building a clock to measure the biological age of the brain&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers developed what is called an “&lt;em&gt;aging clock&lt;/em&gt;”, a computational tool designed to measure the biological age of cells, as opposed to their chronological age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, the organs and tissues of people of the same age can evolve differently over time depending on genetic and environmental factors, leading to different biological ages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These clocks are therefore useful tools to assess aging at the molecular level and can help in understanding its causes and consequences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The clock designed by CIC bioGUNE and LCSB researchers is specific to the brain and uses gene expression information from 365 genes to make predictions. Using a machine learning approach, it was trained on data from healthy individuals, aged from 20 to 97, and could accurately predict their age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further tests showed that the clock is able to estimate the biological age of different cell types in the brain, especially neurons. Lastly, by looking at the predicted biological ages for healthy individuals and for patients with neurological conditions, the researchers observed that patients exhibited a higher biological age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our results tell us that the biological age of the brain cells calculated by our clock reflects the decline in brain function experienced by the patients, especially between 60 and 70, and is even correlated with the degree of neurodegeneration,” explains Dr. Guillem Santamaria, first author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It supports the view of neurodegeneration as a form of accelerated aging but, more importantly, the positive association between neurodegeneration and biological age suggests that the rejuvenating interventions identified by the clock could serve as neuroprotective agents.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Identifying compounds that have a rejuvenating potential&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The aim of the researchers was to use the clock to find genetic or chemical interventions that would signiﬁcantly shift back the biological age of brain cells. They explored the effect of thousands of compounds on neural progenitor cells and neurons and identified 453 unique rejuvenating interventions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the identified compounds that have the potential to reverse the biological age of the two types of brain cells, several are known to extend lifespan in animal models and some are already used to treat neurological disorders, but the vast majority has not yet been studied in the context of health- or lifespan extension.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“On the one hand, the fact that our computational platform identified drugs that have a known effect on brain function supports the idea that using the predicted effect of a compound on the biological age is an efficient way to evaluate its neuroprotective potential,” details Prof. Antonio Del Sol, Ikerbasque researcher and head of the Computation Biology groups at CIC bioGUNE and LCSB.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“On the other, the results also highlight that our clock can help us find many new candidates that haven’t been studied before for their rejuvenating properties. It opens up a lot of new avenues.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First validation in animal model and broadening the therapeutic horizon&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a proof of concept of their approach, the researchers then tested three of the predicted compounds in mice, in collaboration with the team of Prof. Rubén Nogueiras at the Centre for Research in Molecular Medicine and Chronic Diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The administration of these drugs signiﬁcantly reduced anxiety and slightly increased spatial memory in older mice, addressing two well-known symptoms associated with aging. An analysis of gene expression showed that the combination of these compounds also led to a shift toward a younger phenotype.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Altogether, these results show that a selection of compounds predicted to rejuvenate the brain did produce rejuvenation at the molecular level in the cortex of aged mice and had an impact on behavioural and cognitive functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Globally, the study, recently published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Advanced Science&lt;/em&gt;, highlights the computational aging clock developed by the researchers as a valuable resource for identifying brain-rejuvenating interventions with therapeutic potential in neurodegenerative diseases. It provides a strong foundation for further research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The hundreds of compounds predicted by our platform require validation across multiple biological systems to assess their eﬃcacy and safety, oﬀering extensive opportunities for future therapeutic development,” concludes Prof. Antonio Del Sol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this neurogenesis research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#b3d9c0d6ddd7c1d2f3d0dad0d1dadcd4c6ddd69dd6c0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Jana Sendra&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://cicbiogune.es" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;CIC bioGUNE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Jana Sendra – CIC bioGUNE&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/advs.202503344" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;A Machine-Learning Approach Identifies Rejuvenating Interventions in the Human Brain&lt;/a&gt;” by Antonio Del Sol Mesa et al. &lt;em&gt;Advanced Science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Machine-Learning Approach Identifies Rejuvenating Interventions in the Human Brain&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The increase in life expectancy has caused a rise in age-related brain disorders. Although brain rejuvenation is a promising strategy to counteract brain functional decline, systematic discovery methods for efficient interventions are lacking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A computational platform based on a transcriptional brain aging clock capable of detecting age- and neurodegeneration-related changes is developed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Applied to neurodegeneration-positive samples, it reveals that neurodegenerative disease presence and severity significantly increase predicted age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By screening 43840 transcriptional profiles of chemical and genetic perturbations, it identifies 453 unique rejuvenating interventions, several of which are known to extend lifespan in animal models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the identified interventions include drugs already used to treat neurological disorders, Alzheimer’s disease among them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A combination of compounds predicted by the platform reduced anxiety, improved memory, and rejuvenated the brain cortex transcriptome in aged mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results demonstrate the platform’s ability to identify brain-rejuvenating interventions, offering potential treatments for neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 22 Jul 2025 20:52:24 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibEFVX3lxTE4zMWVTLWU4UVZvVnFhbUdWS3R0YW5lZVZZUl9tOTR3amZoRnExLWp5N2xzYmx3Vm56R1ViQ1p4emN1V1Bxa0tBOU5Hak1RSEM3aFNNdU5sZFF5SFJ1TWwxUzh4Ykx1WHRsblBIRg</guid></item><item><title>科学家增压糖替代品–它开始杀死癌症- SciTechDaily | Scientists Supercharge Sugar Substitute – And It Starts Killing Cancer - SciTechDaily</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimgFBVV95cUxOLTE1eHV2cE5xcERRdjl3Q2JMbmYyXzhPTnZ5dFVPVVNHRkU2X0VZMlJ2UUFmWFVQY01GYU5WUng0ZXFrX0dqWU5zNndSa3h5ckkwUFUyWV90cXVINFkxVDB4SWlSdUlCMHE0ei1yYVVVNG5veXRtN0R4a2o3OXFpMmFuVm5Gc2Z3ZUpkcWY5dTJiVFV1d1k0VHZR?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SciTechDaily</author><pubDate>Tue, 22 Jul 2025 20:13:48 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimgFBVV95cUxOLTE1eHV2cE5xcERRdjl3Q2JMbmYyXzhPTnZ5dFVPVVNHRkU2X0VZMlJ2UUFmWFVQY01GYU5WUng0ZXFrX0dqWU5zNndSa3h5ckkwUFUyWV90cXVINFkxVDB4SWlSdUlCMHE0ei1yYVVVNG5veXRtN0R4a2o3OXFpMmFuVm5Gc2Z3ZUpkcWY5dTJiVFV1d1k0VHZR</guid></item><item><title>麸质可能被错误地归咎于美国人的胃病- Gizmodo | Gluten Could Be Wrongly Blamed for Americans’ Stomach Troubles - Gizmodo</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilwFBVV95cUxQYmlEeHp0RXJCbWdsbzJHV0VreFhyTmlIdndOOUxjUDZENnBMT2VrSUhObVFNWmpzNnVkSTVuMHhGRS0tV056VEY5Szc1Z2xYZWtyYk9EYmEzNDJQaDU3RDllRWpVZTFRakczMmE5aEhkdkJrWnJZMjJCeUVnTmZUZ3VXekhZYzlXajhGSFNzQ3JMcDdSenpZ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content prose dark:prose-invert lg:prose-lg lg:leading-[29px] font-serif max-w-none"&gt;
              
              
              &lt;p&gt;For many of us, gluten is a dietary villain, capable of causing all sorts of gastrointestinal troubles. Research out this week looks to complicate that narrative, however, finding that people are sometimes wrongly blaming gluten for triggering their symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scientists at McMaster University in Canada conducted the study, a small, randomized trial of IBS patients. People became sicker just as often after eating food containing gluten or wheat as they did after eating food without the ingredient, they found. Gluten is likely safer to eat for those with IBS than commonly thought, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“These findings suggest that expectations played a major role in symptom generation and that only some of these patients could benefit from gluten or wheat restriction,” they wrote in their paper, &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langas/article/PIIS2468-1253(25)00090-1/abstract"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; Monday in The Lancet Gastroenetrology and Hepatology.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/irritable-bowel-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20360016"&gt;IBS&lt;/a&gt; is a complex, chronic, and relatively common condition, estimated to affect between 5 and 10% of the population worldwide (including up to &lt;a href="https://aboutibs.org/what-is-ibs/facts-about-ibs/#:~:text=IBS%20affects%20between%2025%20and%2045%20million%20people%20in%20the%20United%20States."&gt;45 million people&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S.). Its symptoms include stomach pain, bloating, and diarrhea or constipation. Unlike the closely named inflammatory bowel disorder, IBS isn’t marked by physical changes or visible damage along the digestive tract, but it can still be a debilitating burden for many, with around 20% of sufferers experiencing severe bouts. The exact causes of IBS remain unclear, though scientists have &lt;a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/irritable-bowel-syndrome-ibs"&gt;speculated&lt;/a&gt; it can arise from a miscommunication between the nerves found in the gut and the brain.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;People with IBS tend to report having specific triggers that can cause a flare-up of illness, gluten included, and often manage their condition by avoiding these triggers. The researchers behind the new study aimed to better understand gluten’s potential role in IBS, so they recruited over two dozen people with IBS for their randomized, double-blinded trial, all of whom had reported improving after switching to a gluten-free diet.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At first, the volunteers were randomly assigned to one of three groups. All the groups were first told to eat cereal bars for a week. One group ate bars made with flour containing gluten, the second ate bars made with wheat flour, and the third ate bars made with gluten- and wheat-free flour. Afterward, the volunteers took a break for two weeks. Then they switched to eating the bars they hadn’t eaten yet for another round of testing, a process repeated twice. By the study’s end, all the volunteers had eaten all three kinds of bars, though on different schedules and without knowing which bars they had eaten on a given week.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;A total of 28 people completed the trial. A significant percentage of people reported having worsening IBS symptoms after eating gluten or wheat bars, the study showed, but about just as often as they did after eating non-gluten/wheat bars (roughly a third experienced worsening IBS during each of the three conditions). 93% of participants also reported having adverse events after each scenario of bar-eating. Interestingly enough, tests of the participants’ stool found that only a third strictly followed their diets as instructed, with likely many fearing they would get sick.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The findings are based on a very small sample size, so it’s not yet certain that they apply to the general population of people with IBS tied to gluten. There are also, of course, digestive conditions clearly caused by an intolerance to gluten, particularly &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/celiac-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20352220"&gt;celiac disease&lt;/a&gt;. And the researchers aren’t saying gluten can’t sometimes be a genuine trigger for people’s IBS. But they argue that in many cases, people’s negative perception of gluten is causing a nocebo effect, the dark cousin of the placebo effect. In other words, someone’s belief that gluten is bad for them can potentially spark or worsen the IBS symptoms seen after eating it, rather than gluten itself.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The researchers say better communication and follow-up care from doctors are needed for IBS patients, given the findings.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“What we need to improve in our clinical management of these patients is to work with them further, not just tell them that gluten is not the trigger and move on. Many of them may benefit from psychological support and guidance to help destigmatize gluten and wheat and reintroduce them safely in their diet,” said senior author Premysl Bercik, a professor at McMaster’s Department of Medicine, in a &lt;a href="https://healthsci.mcmaster.ca/despite-self-perceived-sensitivities-study-finds-gluten-and-wheat-safe-for-many-people-with-ibs/"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; from the university.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;That may be easier said than done, though. The researchers note that most patients, upon learning the team’s findings, staunchly refused to entertain the idea of gluten not being a trigger for their IBS symptoms. So it looks like gluten may need a promotional campaign to win back its reputation.&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;On the other hand, states in New England had the lowest STD rates, with Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine falling to the bottom of the list.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The rankings, provided by a new study from &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.invigormedical.com/lifestyle/std-infection-rates-by-county-state/?srsltid=AfmBOooNQyZ5MZ9gm21GyNZIcNT8cTFh1UwMoIAt7HpC5XyYbYOX1y3E"&gt;Invigor Medical&lt;/a&gt;, used the latest CDC data - from 2023 - to calculate STD rates for all 50 states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers found many states ranking in the top 10 have limited access to sexual health clinics and emphasize abstinence education as a primary method to prevent pregnancy and STDs, which could be drivers behind their higher rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And many states do not mandate sex education in schools, meaning millions of students miss out on potentially life-saving information. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;States like Alaska and South Dakota also have higher numbers of outbreaks among Indigenous populations, which are more likely to have limited access to care. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People in the New England region, on the other hand, typically have higher household incomes and rates of insurance, making them better able to access care and sexual education. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The report also found women in the US are 10 percent more likely than men to be diagnosed with an STD, with a rate of 902 cases per 100,000 compared to 819. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This could be because women are screened more often during routine reproductive health visits, while cases in men may go undiagnosed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The vagina also has a moist, thin lining that is easily penetrable, making it prone to infections. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Louisiana had the country's highest rate of chlamydia with 792 cases per 100,000 residents. This added up to 36,242 diagnoses in 2023. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nationwide, chlamydia affects 1.6million Americans every year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Common symptoms of chlamydia include abnormal or foul-smelling vaginal discharge, pelvic pain, abdominal tenderness, pain during intercourse, irregular bleeding, and fever. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, less than half of infections show symptoms, and many are asymptomatic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mississippi followed close behind overall and had the second-highest rate of chlamydia, with 701 cases per 100,000. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alaska recorded 1,067 STDs per 100,000 people in 2023 and had the highest rate of gonorrhea at 311 cases per 100,000. This adds up to about 2,280.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Untreated gonorrhea can lead to serious health issues, including pelvic inflammatory disease and infertility. And while the infection can usually be easily treated, some strains are resistant to commonly used antibiotics - making them harder to clear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Earlier this year in Alaska, an unnamed woman in her 50s died from disseminated gonococcal infection (DGI) after contracting gonorrhea. This causes her to go into sepsis and heart failure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In DGI, gonorrhea infections travel to the bloodstream and infect organs throughout the body due to the infection going untreated. It's thought to occur in just 0.5 percent of gonorrhea cases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She is one of eight Alaskans to be identified with DGI since January of this year, the state health department said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above chart from Invigor Medical shows the rate of STDs by race and ethnicity&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above chart from Invigor Medical shows the rate of STDs in the US by age group and sex&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Georgia, which had the fourth-highest rate of STDs overall, topped the list for HIV infections. It had an HIV rate of 25.5 per 100,000, totaling 2,359 cases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nationwide, the HIV rate is 14 cases per 100,000 people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;HIV, which stands for human immunodeficiency virus, attacks the body's immune system and leaves it unable to fight off foreign invaders. Left untreated, it can lead to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Georgia's high rate could be from recent HIV outbreaks in the Atlanta area. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;South Dakota rounded out the top five with an overall STD rate of 1,015 per 100,000. It also had the highest rate of syphilis at 223 per 100,000 or roughly 2,000 cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Syphilis among all ages is on the rise nationwide, increasing nearly 80 percent over the past five years, and the surge is worrying public health officials, as the disease can advance to damage the brain, nerves, eyes, and heart if it goes untreated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Symptoms begin with small open sores on the genitals, mouth, or rectum, as well as enlarged lymph nodes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the second stage, a skin rash develops, as well as genitals sores, fever, muscle and joint pain, vision changes, and loss of appetite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When the infection advances further, it can inflame and damage heart valves and slowly degrade the brain, causing personality changes, memory loss, difficulty making decisions, and strokes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;On the other end of the spectrum, Vermont recorded the fewest STD cases with a rate of 241 per 100,000. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Schools in the state have more robust sexual health education programs than in other areas like the south. Its largest demographic is also over 60, a group historically less affected by STDs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Tue, 22 Jul 2025 20:04:46 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilgFBVV95cUxOZTlhNHYxSGRlYjBBZUowSDNvVlJiZnJSUXkxQ1B5dlBBamdWa29sT2hYLV9oSzhUM1RsaWU2RTUtWDdRdkttLTFuaFp0NGg5US1mSGQwYTlIa1ljcFZmOUZYeEVaSS1jUnhmZ05odGVOUFFRQnlTcnZWd1V3YVJoRG1YMEQtOFM3akNGQmRZemk2LVV3TnfSAZsBQVVfeXFMTWtHS00xR1c4d05WRTFPc2ZwZnZMdWJpVGJYQVFCYnBXak1rbXVJemMySDRrNC1HSzdLN2EzRjA0TVhZWnhzeEFnZXJpQkR5NUZvd2t6Z05NcHY0ZmM0VkZtQzRkN3NMZk52alZ5bzhjUXZYd3llNVpMSXhVbVJ0dkJON0R0RUtSMHFfR1dkcEZvVHl6UG5HY0QxcHc</guid></item><item><title>官员对第一人死亡后致命的昆虫传播疾病的传播发出警报-每日邮报 | Officials sound alarm over the spread of deadly insect-borne disease after first person dies - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqAFBVV95cUxPZ0hrSFhqeGxvOVllb3pGcWJMUE9zQVZEaUdWTlNjaG9aaWFTanhFdklnM1U3Nm5YbGZVVXZ1dWI5V0V1RVplQUVkalNkQUZULXpRaXZpVllYVlpISlhVSGtlbm5FeVFiWkFPdklCVzJYdjk1dzQ4ckw4Y3JuT1pzLWMzdi0yUWYyMDBhUmM2bmV4d1N5Y3lhWC02TV8xQVZDOUxlXy1sd1bSAa4BQVVfeXFMTzcwSkYxRVVYWW1PUzFzbkFyTTBicjlLV2pJV3JpV055ZjJCZVIzaUNDdEpSX2VsZzU1UUNrdXZPNFVERDFiYXd6V2NIVHlGMFRBV2MtazJjNXlBTXlsakxWX1h4N0M3cS05WUtIajN1bXBpUFp5Y2g0Q0JtcGw5ZzRCQ0xRdC1PWmV6NGlxc2JDVFdWZm1PLXBIQVJ4Zm1zUXpNYkV3Ry05aGFyclZB?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Health experts are &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14904089/Fears-grow-paralyzing-disease-moves-new-US-states.html"&gt;sounding the alarm&lt;/a&gt; over the rise of a deadly insect-borne disease following America's first death from the virus this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;An unnamed individual in Maricopa County, &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/arizona/index.html" id="mol-b468b650-6719-11f0-a138-ef6212e1f504"&gt;Arizona&lt;/a&gt;, was diagnosed with West Nile Virus, which is becoming more prevalent in the US due to a warming climate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They were&lt;span&gt; among the one percent of patients who develop a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13911573/man-paralyzed-doctors-botched-spinal-surgery-pennsylvania.html"&gt;severe form&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; of the virus, which causes dangerous swelling of the brain.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;This occurs when the virus crosses the blood-brain barrier and infects the brain and/or spinal cord, leading to conditions like encephalitis, meningitis, or paralysis. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Officials revealed the victim was an older adult with underlying health conditions.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They were the 17th human case of the West Nile virus in the Maricopa County area and among the 51 human cases nationwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While West Nile virus typically causes mild symptoms, individuals with certain medical conditions - such as &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-caf71650-670a-11f0-a138-ef6212e1f504"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/diabetes/index.html" id="mol-caf78b80-670a-11f0-a138-ef6212e1f504"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, hypertension, kidney disease, and people who have received organ transplants - are at greater risk of serious health complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Currently West Nile virus activity appears to be at a relatively stable level, but the presence of the virus in places it typically doesn't appear is raising concerns among experts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The West Nile virus is the most common mosquito-spread disease in the continental US&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is because higher temperatures shorten the time it takes for the virus to incubate within the mosquito and become infectious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, warmer temperatures can enhance mosquito survival and reproduction rates, further amplifying the spread of the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Maricopa County's chief medical officer Dr Nick Staab said: 'This tragic loss is a reminder that West Nile virus can be serious, especially for older adults and those with existing health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14891111/health-hazards-hospital-summer-vacation.html"&gt;'Monsoon season brings&lt;/a&gt; much-needed rain, but it also creates ideal conditions for mosquitoes to breed.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The most cases have been recorded in Arizona (17 cases), &lt;span&gt;followed by Louisiana (seven), Oklahoma and Texas (five) and Tennessee (three).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Other states with human cases of West Nile virus are California, Alabama, Georgia, Kansas, Mississippi, North Dakota, Nebraska, Ohio, South Carolina, and Virginia. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;So far this year, there have been 51 human cases of West Nile virus in the US, including 24 severe or 'neuroinvasive' cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Last year, there were 748 human cases of the virus recorded, including 515 neuroinvasive cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The worry among experts is that West Nile virus is spreading to new areas, and mosquitoes carrying the virus are being found in previously unaffected regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is partly due to climate change, which is expanding the range of mosquito-borne diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is currently the leading cause of mosquito-borne disease in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Recently, West Nile virus has been detected in mosquitoes in New York City, but no human cases have been reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Once a person is bitten by an infected mosquito, It generally takes between three and 14 days for the disease to develop. &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Around 80 percent of infected people are asymptomatic (no symptoms), but 20 percent will develop fever, headache, and body aches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In rare cases - about 1 in 150 - the virus can cause severe complications as it spreads to the brain - like encephalitis or meningitis - which may lead to paralysis, long-term disability, or death. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People over the age of 60 are at greater risk for severe illness if they are infected, as are those with with certain medical conditions, such as cancer, diabetes, hypertension, and kidney disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There is no specific treatment for the virus or vaccine, but &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-10941781/Could-monkeypox-West-Nile-Virus.html"&gt;80 percent of cases are mild&lt;/a&gt;, where sufferers may experience flu-like symptoms or rashes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In more severe cases, patients have reported paralysis and memory loss. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Prospero Rangel, 78, beat cancer but was left relearning how to walk after contracting West Nile virus last year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;So far, there have been 51 reported human cases of West Nile virus so far this year across the US.

&lt;p&gt;An experimental, hormone-free male birth control pill has just passed its first safety test in humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trial included 16 people and was only intended to test whether the drug reached adequate levels in the body, as well as whether it triggered any serious side effects, such as concerning changes in heart rate, hormone function, inflammation, mood or sexual function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across the doses tested, no significant side effects were observed. That result tees up the pill to be tested in larger trials that will now look at both safety and efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results of the early safety trial, published Tuesday (July 22) in the journal &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1590019&amp;amp;xcust=livescience_us_4658126578778925921&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs43856-025-01004-4&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Fhealth%2Ffertility-pregnancy-birth%2Fmale-birth-control-pill-passes-early-safety-test-with-more-trials-underway" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43856-025-01004-4" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed="skimlinks" data-placeholder-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1590019&amp;amp;xcust=hawk-custom-tracking&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs43856-025-01004-4&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Fhealth%2Ffertility-pregnancy-birth%2Fmale-birth-control-pill-passes-early-safety-test-with-more-trials-underway" data-google-interstitial="false" data-merchant-name="nature.com" data-merchant-network="SkimLinks"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Communications Medicine&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, are a critical first step toward getting the pill approved, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.uwmedicine.org/bios/stephanie-page" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.uwmedicine.org/bios/stephanie-page" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dr. Stephanie Page&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an endocrinologist at the University of Washington School of Medicine who wasn't involved in the study, told &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/male-birth-control-pill-yct-529-passes-human-safety-test/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/male-birth-control-pill-yct-529-passes-human-safety-test/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Scientific American&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

In the testes, the receptor would usually be activated by the insertion of a "key" — a vitamin A metabolite — but the drug stops this key from clicking into place. That, in turn, prevents the chain reaction that ends with sperm being made.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finding a compound with this effect required the scientists to &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.acs.org/pressroom/newsreleases/2022/march/non-hormonal-pill-could-soon-expand-mens-birth-control-options.html" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.acs.org/pressroom/newsreleases/2022/march/non-hormonal-pill-could-soon-expand-mens-birth-control-options.html" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;closely examine the structure of the receptor&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; when it's bound to its key, as well as test dozens of molecules to see which could block the interaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In preclinical tests with male lab mice, the drug "elicited profound effects" on sperm production. It triggered reversible infertility within four weeks of use, showing 99% effectiveness at preventing pregnancy in the female mice the treated males mated with. When taken off the drug, the male mice's fertility was restored within about four to six weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further tests in nonhuman primates returned similar results, with sperm counts falling dramatically within two weeks of starting the drug and fully recovering within 10 to 15 weeks of stopping the drug. These preclinical tests set the stage for the recent clinical trial in people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trial included 16 males ages 32 to 59, all of whom had previously undergone vasectomies. This was done out of an abundance of caution, in case the experimental drug was to have any lasting impacts on fertility, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.malecontraceptive.org/yourchoice-therapeutics.html" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.malecontraceptive.org/yourchoice-therapeutics.html" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Nadja Mannowetz&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, co-founder and chief science officer of YourChoice Therapeutics, told Scientific American.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The participants were split into groups who received either &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/32941-is-the-placebo-effect-real.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/32941-is-the-placebo-effect-real.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;placebo&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; pills or a low or high dose of the drug. Most of the participants took the pill only after a period of fasting, but a subset were also given doses after a large meal, to see if that affected levels of the drug in the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across all of the doses and conditions tested, the levels of the drug in the body reached decent levels, but Mannowetz anticipates that, if approved, the final dose would be closest to the highest one tested: 180 milligrams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both the animal study and the human trial results suggest that the approved pill would likely be taken once a day, but further trials will confirm that dosing. And although no notable side effects emerged in this small trial, future trials with larger study cohorts will still need to monitor for these effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The positive results from this first clinical trial laid the groundwork for a second trial, where men receive YCT-529 for 28 days and 90 days, to study safety and changes in sperm parameters," the study authors wrote in their paper. &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06542237?intr=YCT-529&amp;amp;rank=2" target="_blank" data-url="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06542237?intr=YCT-529&amp;amp;rank=2" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;That trial is already underway&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and again is looking at males who have already had vasectomies or who have made a firm decision not to father children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-freeText-CkahAZt3SAkbygj5u7wyTX-NPOIhd0jE6Qk008TmmhOtNqBjiS50ZLt" class="slice-container freeText-wrapper freeText-CkahAZt3SAkbygj5u7wyTX-NPOIhd0jE6Qk008TmmhOtNqBjiS50ZLt slice-container-freeText"&gt;&lt;div class="info-block"&gt;&lt;p class="infoDisclaimer"&gt;This article is for informational purposes only and is not meant to offer medical advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

 &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;An MRI scan can now tell how fast you're aging by revealing the physical changes in your brain&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Those with more fluid and a smaller hippocampus had brains far older than the average 45-year-old&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ahmad Hariri, a professor of psychology and neuroscience at Duke, said: 'What's really cool about this is that we've captured how fast people are aging using data collected in midlife and it's helping us predict diagnosis of dementia among people who are much older.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;DunedinPACN revealed that people whose brain scans showed faster aging did worse on memory and thinking tests and had more shrinkage in the hippocampus, a key region tied to memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Smaller hippocampal volume was linked to faster cognitive decline, while larger ventricle volumes (fluid-filled spaces in the brain) was associated with worse health after middle age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Faster agers were also more likely to develop health problems like frailty, heart attacks, lung disease, or strokes later in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The way we age as we get older is quite distinct from how many times we've traveled around the sun,' Hariri said in a &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://today.duke.edu/2025/07/scientists-can-tell-how-fast-youre-aging-single-brain-scan"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study author added that several computer algorithms have been created to serve as so-called 'aging clocks' but these programs typically rely on data from people of all ages, taken at a single point in their lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The new study, published in the journal &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-025-00897-z"&gt;Nature Aging&lt;/a&gt;, focused on participants at age 45, creating more uniformity in the results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A software called FreeSurfer was used to process the brain scans and measure 315 different brain features, including cortical thickness, how thick the outer layer of the brain (the cortex) is. Thinner areas of the cortex might suggest faster aging or wear and tear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Fast agers were 18 percent more likely to develop chronic diseases, and 40 percent more likely to die sooner&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The link between aging of the brain and body are pretty compelling,' Hariri added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The professor added that the connection between Pace of Aging and dementia was just as strong across different racial and economic backgrounds in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Specifically, the Dunedin Study included participants who were low-income and non-White, and lived everywhere from Latin America to the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It seems to be capturing something that is reflected in all brains,' Hariri said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The MRI scans also measured factors like gray-white matter signal intensity ratio, which compares how bright gray matter looks to white matter (the brain's wiring that connects different areas).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A change in this ratio can show differences in brain tissue health, like how well the brain is holding up as you age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers noted that the size of a person's hippocampus can also shrink with age or from diseases like Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;So, a smaller hippocampus might signal faster aging or higher dementia risk, especially among people who are only in their 40s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, Ventricles, the fluid-filled spaces in the brain that help cushion it, often get bigger when the brain tissue around them is shrinking - another sign of advanced aging or brain health issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dementia was the main threat discovered in faster aging brains, as it increased the risk of cognitive decline&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Duke team then examined the brain scans of 624 people ranging in age from 52 to 89 who took part in the North American study of risk for Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They determined that the fastest agers &lt;span&gt;were 60 percent more likely to develop dementia in their later years.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Fast agers also began to suffer from memory and thinking issues sooner than those who found to be aging slower.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;These slow agers had brains that looked younger and healthier than expected, like having a 30-year-old's brain in a 45-year-old body.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Their brains featured a thicker cortex or larger hippocampus and showed fewer signs of wear and tear.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;They were also less likely to develop chronic diseases, meaning they typically had longer lifespans than the fast agers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When the team saw the results, 'our jaws just dropped to the floor,' Hariri said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Olive oil, rich in antioxidants and healthy fats, may lower heart disease risk by up to 30%.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Legume-based pasta is high in fiber and protein, helping lower cholesterol and support heart health.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Oats contain fiber and plant sterols that support healthy cholesterol and weight management.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Your heart pumps over 2,000 gallons of blood per day, delivering oxygen and nutrients to every cell and organ in your body, picking up waste along the way and sending it to be filtered.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Given how important this single organ is, it’s no wonder that keeping your heart healthy is one of the best things you can do for your overall health and well-being. And while &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7894073/these-7-things-could-make-you-more-likely-to-get-heart-disease-according-to-the-american-heart-association/" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt; is the leading cause of death in the U.S., there’s a lot you can do to reduce your risk, starting right in your kitchen.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Research shows that heart-healthy eating patterns like the Mediterranean diet and DASH diet can help improve key markers for heart health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; These diets emphasize whole foods that are rich in fiber, healthy fats, antioxidants and plant-based proteins.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; But you don’t have to overhaul your entire diet or break the bank to start supporting your heart. Keeping just a few simple &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/15297/our-top-15-heart-healthy-foods/" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;heart-healthy ingredients&lt;/a&gt; in your pantry can make it easier to add important nutrients to your everyday meals and snacks. We asked cardiologists for their must-have pantry staples, and chances are you already have a few of them on your shelf. Here’s what they recommend keeping stocked. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-1-olive-oil"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 1. Olive Oil &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re wondering what oil to grab for roasting vegetables, whisking up marinades and dressings or finishing your pasta, olive oil can be a heart-healthy choice. "I recommend keeping some delicious olive oil close at hand and using it as your primary cooking oil, but also to drizzle it on each of your meals throughout the day," says &lt;a href="https://www.scripps.org/locations/specialty-centers/scripps-shiley-pavilion/scripps-center-for-integrative-medicine" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Elizabeth Epstein, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/is-olive-oil-good-for-you-8766002" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Olive oil&lt;/a&gt; has an extensive history of research supporting its role in improving cardiovascular health. A 2022 meta-analysis of 13 studies with over 865,000 participants found a strong relationship between olive oil consumption and a decreased risk of cardiovascular disease.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; For every 5-gram (about 1 teaspoon) increase in olive oil per day, they found a 4% decrease in cardiovascular disease risk and all-cause mortality. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "The best nutrition evidence we have supports the Mediterranean diet, which has been tested in several randomized controlled trials and shown to reduce heart attacks, strokes and cardiovascular death by 30 percent," says Epstein.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The liberal use of olive oil may be a key part of the puzzle, with its high levels of anti-inflammatory polyphenols, antioxidants and oleic acid. While any olive oil will offer some benefit, extra virgin olive oil is highest in antioxidant and bioactive plant compounds that may offer additional benefits to your heart.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-2-legume-based-pasta"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 2. Legume-Based Pasta &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You don’t have to skip pasta, even on a heart-healthy diet. "One food I always keep stocked in my pantry is &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7958987/best-legume-pastas/" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;legume-based pasta&lt;/a&gt;, such as pasta made from edamame and mung bean, lentils, chickpeas or black beans," says &lt;a href="https://www.daniellebelardomd.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Danielle Belardo, M.D.&lt;/a&gt; Pasta made from legumes is typically higher in protein and fiber than wheat pasta, and can be much more filling. When it comes to heart health, eating more beans and bean-based foods is a safe bet. Multiple studies link legume consumption to improvements in lipid profiles and a reduced risk of heart disease, including one study suggesting that adults who eat legumes four times per week have a 22 percent lower risk of coronary heart disease than those who only eat them once each week.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; This is partly due to the high amount of soluble fiber found in legumes, which effectively lowers LDL cholesterol and supports steady blood sugar.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If eating whole beans several times a week feels like a big leap from where you’re at, legume-based pasta can be a simple and approachable switch. "It’s nutrient-dense, easy to prepare and aligned with the principles of evidence-based heart-healthy eating," says Belardo, who emphasizes legume-based pasta’s positive impact on glycemic control, satiety and overall metabolic health. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-3-oats"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 3. Oats &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Your morning bowl of oatmeal may be doing more for your heart than you realize. Oats are rich in soluble fiber, beta-glucans and anti-inflammatory compounds like phytosterols, all of which help lower cholesterol and support healthy weight management.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "Oats, like all whole, plant-based foods, contain plant sterols, a group of substances made in plants that block cholesterol absorption in the digestive tract," says &lt;a href="https://www.steponefoods.com/pages/about-elizabeth-klodas-md" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Elizabeth Klodas, M.D.&lt;/a&gt; Between soluble fiber binding cholesterol in the gut, plant sterols reducing absorption and beta-glucans positively influencing the gut microbiome and cholesterol metabolism, oats are a triple threat against heart disease.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Just be sure to choose whole, minimally processed oats. Research shows they retain more of their fiber, beta-glucans and heart-healthy phytochemicals compared to ultra-processed or highly-sweetened oats and oat-based foods.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Luckily, between overnight oats, hot oatmeal, granola, oatmeal pancakes and smoothies, there are endless ways to enjoy them!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-our-expert-take"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Our Expert Take &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Heart-healthy eating doesn’t have to include a total pantry makeover. The foods cardiologists always have in their own pantries include simple staples like olive oil, oats and legume-based pasta. Regularly including these foods in a balanced, overall healthy diet may help lower cholesterol, support a healthy weight and protect your heart well into the future. &lt;br&gt;

On average, the difference in brain aging between men and women was small, about 2.5 months. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-aa4933" class="body-graf"&gt;“We don’t yet know exactly why, but this fits with other research suggesting that men may be more affected by certain types of stress or health challenges,” Mohammadi-Nejad said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e68aa2" class="body-graf"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/aging/protect-memory-education-key-new-science-suggests-rcna69400" target="_blank"&gt;Brains shrink as people age&lt;/a&gt;. When &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/aging/obesity-can-cause-changes-brain-similar-alzheimers-study-suggests-rcna66555" target="_blank"&gt;gray matter shrinks prematurely&lt;/a&gt;, it can lead to memory loss or judgment problems, although the pandemic study doesn't show whether people with structural changes will eventually develop cognitive deficits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3c63e0" class="body-graf"&gt;The study wasn’t designed to pinpoint specific causes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-5ff679" class="body-graf"&gt;“But it is likely that the cumulative experience of the pandemic—including psychological stress, social isolation, disruptions in daily life, reduced activity and wellness—contributed to the observed changes,” Mohammadi-Nejad said. “In this sense, the pandemic period itself appears to have left a mark on our brains, even in the absence of infection.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ccfaf3" class="body-graf"&gt;An earlier study on how &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/mental-health/covid-lockdowns-teen-brains-aged-prematurely-rcna169966" target="_blank"&gt;teenagers' brains were affected by the pandemic &lt;/a&gt;discovered a similar result.  The 2024 research from the University of Washington found that boys’ brains had aged the equivalent of 1.4 years extra during the pandemic, while girls aged an extra 4.2 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-391e18" class="body-graf"&gt;In the new study, Mohammadi-Nejad and his team turned to the UK Biobank, a massive database which launched in 2006, to determine whether the pandemic had any impact on people’s brains. The database has been keeping track of anonymous health data from 500,000 volunteers who were recruited between 2006 and 2010, when the participants were between 40 to 69 years old. Thus far, the biobank has collected 100,000 whole body scans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a70aa7" class="body-graf"&gt;To develop a baseline model of normal aging, to compare with what might have occurred during the pandemic years, the researchers used imaging data from 15,334 healthy individuals that had been collected prior to the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-724c41" class="body-graf"&gt;“We used this large dataset to teach our model what typical, healthy brain ageing looks like across the adult lifespan,” Mohammadi-Nejad explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-15e1dc" class="body-graf"&gt;Next the researchers turned to a group of 996 participants who had two scans, the second taking place on average 2.3 years after the first. Of these participants, 564 had both scans prior to the pandemic, which helped the artificial intelligence learn how the brain changes when there is no pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4f875b" class="body-graf"&gt;The other 432 had a second scan after the start of the pandemic, mostly between 2021 and 2022, allowing the researchers to investigate how the pandemic might have affected  brain aging. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-fcb5f4" class="body-graf"&gt;Although these second scans were done later in the pandemic, “they reflect brain changes that likely happened during the height of the pandemic, when people experienced the most disruption,” Mohammadi-Nejad said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-799bfd" class="body-graf"&gt;Other research has suggested that environmental factors might cause a person’s brain to age prematurely. One study conducted in the Antarctic tied living in relative isolation to brain shrinkage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a301c8" class="body-graf"&gt;“The most intriguing finding in this study is that only those who were infected with SARS-CoV-2 showed any cognitive deficits, despite structural aging,” said Jacqueline Becker, a clinical neuropsychologist and assistant professor of medicine at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. “This speaks a little to the effects of the virus itself.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-419ae2" class="body-graf"&gt;And that may eventually help explain syndromes, such as long Covid and chronic fatigue, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d8d4ec" class="body-graf"&gt;What we don’t know from this study is whether the structural brain changes observed in people who didn’t get Covid will amount to any observable changes in brain function, Becker said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-23e516" class="body-graf"&gt;Adam Brickman, a professor of neuropsychology at Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, said the study is a compelling narrative, but “still a hypothesis.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-22eadf" class="body-graf"&gt;It doesn’t show whether the accelerated aging seen in people who didn’t get Covid will persist long term, said Brickman, who was not involved with the study&lt;strong&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-70e76c" class="body-graf"&gt;If the brain indeed was changed by the pandemic in meaningful ways, then people might counter those changes by doing things that are healthy for the brain, he said.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a8c84f" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“We know that exercise is good for the brain and keeping blood pressure at a healthy level, for example. We know that sleep and social interactions are important.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Tue, 22 Jul 2025 19:18:22 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinwFBVV95cUxNOUh5VVlkZXdMZEswU3Z2RlZ0UDlIaHc3RWJSSnpzNTdmejBCX0pLeEppWnhCS29GZ1FKSWJ3c2NaejZqRHZVc2I0STlTdXluU1E5Q2Z0cHZrdVNEVEpUaFJBNWQ5dmh4U2pMNkF1VE9zNTJ2U3FwM19sUFp3N1ZzTWFPTEZJMmVYeGdiLVpxY01pR1JBSTlsdi1CSXRKT2PSAVZBVV95cUxPNktOSlliY3dwenByTFc1WHpUVkRaWWFaTE9nd3U0UExTNWJYSEdodjR0TUxHVEdKaXlNd2t4cHdZUXo2bERVczBVV214cXJqNEd3RDZvZw</guid></item><item><title>卫生官员说，在南卡罗来纳州米德兰兹郡确诊的食脑变形虫感染-该州 | Brain-eating amoeba infection confirmed in SC Midlands, health officials say - The State</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaEFVX3lxTE5tOU9HRXpBajNhNlhFMmI4NjM1ZWVuTDFVZHo4U29KLWpZOTQwX2k1cUZpdEdUSHItMGVnbFVVRFo1X0ZhUjlVcXRad2w3VzNSekppUWwtREgzc2l5T0ExQWgwclhpSHd20gFoQVVfeXFMUE1IRWZ5azVmS241Q05tQk54cVFKSWtDMzhwal82TzNCR3QxWldpaE9BSEliOE1zYzN2eG1xUDRBYVFyQXBJRmFReFg4eGU3bmROZEMzMG5NNXpZYi1qc0FYTU50S1JkdEE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article id="" class="paper story-body"&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div class="lead-item "&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="trinityAudioPlaceholder trinity-player-iframe-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A person in the Midlands has died from a brain-eating amoeba. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A patient at the Prisma Health Children’s Hospital in the Midlands recently died from the infection, Dr. Anna-Kathryn Burch, a pediatric infectious disease physician at the hospital confirmed. The hospital consulted with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention when responding to the case, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The state Department of Public Health became aware of the case the week of July 7 but noted that the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/naegleria/about/index.html" target="_blank" rel="Follow"&gt;Naegleria fowleri amoeba&lt;/a&gt; is not required to be reported to the health department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="zone-el-101" class="zone zone-el" index="2" issportsarticle="false" stnplayerkill="true" allowstnplayer="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The agency does not track infections from the amoeba and does not provide information about or comment on individual cases, including the person’s condition,” the department said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agency did not name the body of water the infection came from or any specific details about the infected individual, citing federal and state privacy laws.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Congaree Riverkeeper Bill Stangler said he was also unable to specify where the infection occurred.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The amoeba is common within warm freshwater bodies like lakes and rivers as well as in soil. However, infections are rare. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms usually start within a week of infection, and they include headache, fever, nausea, vomiting and a stiff neck, according to South Carolina’s &lt;a href="https://dph.sc.gov/diseases-conditions/infectious-diseases/insect-or-animal-borne-disease/naegleria-fowleri-ameba" target="_self" rel="Follow"&gt;publich health website&lt;/a&gt;. As the illness develops, confusion, loss of balance, seizures and hallucinations can occur. The infection is fatal in 95% of cases, with death occurring between one and 12 days after infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Infections from Naegleria fowleri were only reported three times in South Carolina from 2010 to 2022. Across the entire country, there were 40 cases in that time frame.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To avoid infection, the state public health department advises to avoid water activities when the temperature is high and the water level is low, to hold one’s nose shut when jumping into the water and to avoid digging in or stirring up sediment around warm, fresh water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;This is a developing story.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="summary gray"&gt;This story was originally published &lt;span class="inline-block"&gt;July 22, 2025 at 2:57 PM.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="zone grid"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="story-module"&gt;&lt;div class="author-card "&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keith’s note:&lt;/strong&gt; NASA just&lt;strong&gt; &lt;a href='https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2025-07-22/html/2025-13789.htm"&amp;gt;https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2025-07-22/html/2025-13789.htm' target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;issued a standard paperwork thing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; in the Federal Register today. It is a note about some questionnaire they want people to fill out egarding special NASA events that they went to. Sounds innocent enough and it is good that NASA would want feedback. Except NASA states that they are only worried about less than 0.01% of the American public and that they are going to spend more than one government employee’s annual hours looking at an expected 650 responses? What about looking into what the rest of the nation thinks about how ‘Great’ NASA is or should be? &lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href="https://nasawatch.com/education/nasas-0-01-outreach-plan/"&gt;more below&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id="more-20173"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The note says &lt;em&gt;“The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is committed to effectively performing the Agency’s communication function in accordance with the Space Act Section 203 (a) (3) to “provide for the widest practicable and appropriate dissemination of information concerning its activities and the results there of,” and to enhance public understanding of, and participation in, the nation’s space program in accordance with the NASA Strategic Plan. The Space Act of 1958 directs the Agency to expand human knowledge of Earth and space phenomena. Organizing outreach events is one way NASA intends to leverage excitement about the nation’s space program and expand human knowledge of Earth and space phenomena.”&lt;/em&gt; Sounds good to me. Agencies get asked to do this sort of paperwork all the time – for paperwork reasons.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Then there is the whole data thing. Google just told me that there are ~347,000,000 Americans and that ~138,000,000 of them will file tax returns. Every taxpayer directly or indirectly funds NASA. All of these people fund all of NASA. But how do they benefit from that? Many ways of course – even though NASA Is woefully incapable of explaining that to rank and file citizenry – even after 60 years of trying to do so.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There is one of those &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/02/ensuring-lawful-governance-and-implementing-the-presidents-department-of-government-efficiency-regulatory-initiative/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;new Executive Orders&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that says that you can get in big trouble if you have regulations that hinder America or whatever. OK, so why is NASA worrying about what the &lt;em&gt;“affected public of 35,300” &lt;/em&gt;(i.e. a tenth of one percent of all Americans) thinks about some fancy NASA space party thing they went to – but not query the 99.98% of Americans who get less or nothing from NASA outreach? And they are only expecting a ~2% response rate from the &lt;em&gt;“affected public”&lt;/em&gt;? And they expect to spend more than one FTE (4,046 hours) figuring out what these 650 thought?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Of course NASA will argue back (if they bother to respond, that is) that NASA has all kinds of outreach events and they have big social media accounts and lots of news clippings and they won an Emmy etc. But ask NASA for metrics i.e. numbers, data, etc. – that is, how many real, actual people outside of their little space bubble were reached for a certain mission; what that interaction(s) were delivered; how the response is measured; what their media metrics for video and social media are; and how many students were contacted in a school year. Ask for that and you get an email saying something useless in 3 sentences. NASA either does not know or does not care to tell you if they do know.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Better yet, ask NASA for their actual outreach plan – the thing that guides who they reach out to and how they do it – and you get nothing in response. There is no plan. Then ask them about data capture and analysis for all outreach efforts i.e. what grades, schools/universities, zip codes, congressional districts, stated interest topics, geographic areas etc. and they either send you old partial data gibberish or do not repsond. And NASA has no follow-up plan for whatever audiences they do manage to reach, and measure, and understand.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;NASA does astonishing stuff. No kidding. It sets the standard for all others. On one hand The agency has a global reach that exceeds that of most governments and large corporations. But NASA fails to grasp what that global reach means and the vast soft power opportunity it offers (especially if you want to counter China or someone else). Yes, flashy graphics and pretty pictures get you a momentary media sugar high. But NASA has not a clue how to take all that it has done, build upon it synergistically, and maximize its value to everyone who either pays for it and/or benefits from it. There is no long term plan.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And yet NASA Is being pushed to aspire to be “Great Again” or that “NASA Is Back” or it will continue to be great etc. while other nations see the same value to space exploration and are surging ahead, nipping at NASA’s heels.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If NASA falls behind it is our own collective fault.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Requests for additional information or copies of the information collection instrument(s) and instructions should be directed to NASA PRA Clearance Officer, Stayce Hoult, NASA Headquarters, 300 E Street SW, JC0000, Washington, DC 20546, phone 256- 714-8575, or email &lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="641710051d07014a004a0c0b110810240a0517054a030b12"&gt;[email protected]&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="345c45195b575d5b194446551944465b534655597459555d581a5a5547551a535b42"&gt;[email protected]&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I. Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is committed to effectively performing the Agency’s communication function in accordance with the Space Act Section 203 (a) (3) to “provide for the widest practicable and appropriate dissemination of information concerning its activities and the results there of,” and to enhance public understanding of, and participation in, the nation’s space program in accordance with the NASA Strategic Plan. The Space Act of 1958 directs the Agency to expand human knowledge of Earth and space phenomena. Organizing outreach events is one way NASA intends to leverage excitement about the nation’s space program and expand human knowledge of Earth and space phenomena. In order to organize effective outreach events and registration opportunities for members of the public, it is necessary to collect information from perspective guests and those that will check-in the guests at events. The NASA Special Events System is a tool to allow invitees to register for and check-in to NASA event opportunities (launch viewing, agency engagements, etc.) in a single location.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;II. Methods of Collection&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The NASA Special Events tool is a web-based application on a Salesforce platform. The intent of using electronic collection techniques is to increase the accuracy of information gathered and to streamline the process for guests and workforce alike.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;III. Data&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Title: NASA Special Events.&lt;br&gt;OMB Number: 2700-new.&lt;br&gt;Type of review: New Information Collection.&lt;br&gt;Affected Public: 35,300.&lt;br&gt;Estimated Annual Number of Activities: 15.&lt;br&gt;Estimated Number of Respondents per Activity: 650.&lt;br&gt;Annual Responses: 10,000.&lt;br&gt;Estimated Time per Response: 11 minutes.&lt;br&gt;Estimated Total Annual Burden Hours: 4,046 hours.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IV. Request for Comments&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Comments are invited on: (1) Whether the proposed collection of information is necessary for the proper performance of the functions of NASA, including whether the information collected has practical utility; (2) the accuracy of NASA’s estimate of the burden (including hours and cost) of the proposed collection of information; (3) ways to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information to be collected; and (4) ways to minimize the burden of the collection of information on respondents, including automated collection techniques or the use of other forms of information technology.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Comments submitted in response to this notice will be summarized and included in the request for OMB approval of this information collection. They will also become a matter of public record.&lt;/p&gt;

Some scientists have even &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11592557/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;called inflammation&lt;/a&gt; “the cause of all diseases”. But what actually causes &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jun/27/the-truth-about-inflammation-all-you-need-to-know-about-2023s-hottest-health-topic-from-causes-to-cures" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;inflammation&lt;/a&gt;, and what fights it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In some contexts, inflammation is good. When the body faces an acute threat – say, an ear infection or a sprained ankle, it responds with acute inflammation – an immune system process marked by fever, swelling and pain in the affected area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SignInGateSelector" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"contentType":"Article","sectionId":"wellness","tags":[{"id":"wellness/wellness","type":"Keyword","title":"Well actually"},{"id":"campaign/email/well-actually","type":"Campaign","title":"Well Actually (Newsletter sign up)"},{"id":"type/article","type":"Type","title":"Article"},{"id":"tracking/commissioningdesk/us-lifestyle-and-wellness","type":"Tracking","title":"US lifestyle and wellness"}],"isPaidContent":false,"isPreview":false,"host":"https://www.theguardian.com","pageId":"global/2025/jul/22/how-to-fight-chronic-inflammation-free","idUrl":"https://profile.theguardian.com","contributionsServiceUrl":"https://contributions.guardianapis.com","editionId":"US"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;But in the face of chronic threats – say, from trauma or job stress, acute inflammation can become chronic, and the immune, stress and cardiometabolic responses can become dysregulated. Research links chronic inflammation with &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24468642/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;low mood&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25123210/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;cognitive impairment&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16525580/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;cardiovascular risks&lt;/a&gt;, and a range of health conditions, including &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/19/inflammation-depression-mind-body" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;depression and dementia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;A growing number of products and routines – like &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/apr/19/what-skincare-experts-do-to-their-skin" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;red light masks&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2024/oct/16/cortisol-face-tiktok-cushings-syndrome" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;de-puffing regimens&lt;/a&gt; – claim to fight the signs of inflammation. Many nutritional methods have proven to help chronic inflammation, too – such as eating &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8803482/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;a vegetable-heavy Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt; or more &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30412134/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;whole grains&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3914936/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;omega-3-rich fish&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;But &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/sep/30/inflation-healthy-food-eating-america" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;cost &lt;/a&gt;and &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/dec/18/climate-diet-food-plan" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;access issues&lt;/a&gt; can get in the way of these solutions. Plus, they may not address a major root cause, as &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6768696/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;increasing&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5476783/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;evidence&lt;/a&gt; says chronic stress can induce chronic inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;To prevent and manage chronic stress, more health professionals are offering “&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/apr/04/prescribed-time-in-nature-linked-to-improvements-in-anxiety-depression-and-blood-pressure" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;social prescriptions&lt;/a&gt;”, or referrals to non-medical, community-based, de-stressing activities.

But according to Dr Qing Li, professor of clinical medicine at Nippon Medical school in Tokyo, forest bathing can also help support healthy functioning of the Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) axis, a key player in controlling the stress and inflammation response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Forest environments can promote relaxation and activate the parasympathetic nervous system, which is responsible for the ‘rest and digest’ functions,” says Dr. Li. It can also reduce activity in the sympathetic nervous system, which is responsible for the “fight or flight” responses. By helping to prevent and manage stress, forest bathing can also help prevent and manage chronic inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36328581/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;series of Li’s studies&lt;/a&gt; show that forest bathing can reduce the stress hormones cortisol, adrenaline and noradrenaline. Other &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33066853/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; similarly finds time in nature can reduce physiological markers of stress, like cortisol, and the perception of stress. One &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/a-20-minute-nature-break-relieves-stress?utm_source=chatgpt.com" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;study &lt;/a&gt;found just 20 minutes of nature per day can make a difference in stress levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="engage-with-art-and-music" class="dcr-12ibh7f"&gt;Engage with art and music&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Art can also promote relief from chronic stress. In one &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5004743/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;, healthy adults who participated in a 45-minute art-making session saw significantly lower levels of cortisol afterward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Feelings of &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/apr/18/truth-about-stress-benefits-of-the-good-kind-exercise-that-makes-it-worse" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;stress are related to a loss of control&lt;/a&gt;, says Dr Girija Kaimal, professor of creative arts therapies at Drexel University, who co-authored the study. Creating art helps us feel like “there’s something we have a sense of agency over” and “lets us take charge of the distress”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The study’s participants self-reported that they found art-making relaxing, enjoyable, “freeing from constraints”, and conducive to &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2025/may/08/what-is-flow-psychology" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;flow&lt;/a&gt; and self-discovery. “Distraction is a great initial coping mechanism to help us calm down after a stressful event, but art can help us dig deeper – it helps us pay attention to what distressed us, and it’ll help the next time something similar sets us off,” says Kaimal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;It’s important to create “the kind of art that speaks to you,” says Kaimal – whether it’s writing, dancing, or drawing – and skill level doesn’t matter. “You want to get into a judgment-free zone where you can play and have fun without consequences.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;A growing body of research suggests experiencing art, not just creating it, can also promote inflammation reduction. &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31167611/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Some&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29779734/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; has found listening to music, for instance, can reduce blood pressure and cortisol. Researchers at the University of Florida have been documenting the &lt;a href="https://arts.ufl.edu/site/assets/files/188411/epiarts_table_final.pdf" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;health benefits of engaging with the arts&lt;/a&gt;, with some studies suggesting just one to three hours of related activity per week can reduce risk of depression and cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-20" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;skip past newsletter promotion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;aside aria-label="newsletter promotion" class="dcr-av5vqf"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-1xjndtj"&gt;Practical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good life&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SecureSignup" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"newsletterId":"well-actually","successDescription":"Practical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good life"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1eusqlu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy Notice: &lt;/strong&gt;Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This makes sense from an evolutionary perspective because bodily movement was often linked with fighting a predator or fighting for our lives, says Dr. Michael Gleeson, emeritus professor of exercise biochemistry at Loughborough University. “The body puts its survival first,” and temporarily inhibits the inflammatory response so it can use energy more efficiently, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In his co-authored &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nri3041" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt;, Gleeson suggests exercise not only induces an anti-inflammatory environment in the short-term, but may also reduce visceral fat mass in the long-term. The accumulation of visceral fat can drive and worsen chronic inflammation by promoting development of insulin resistance, atherosclerosis and other diseases linked to physical inactivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Other research finds that exercise can significantly reduce production of &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11332-025-01445-3" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;pro-inflammatory proteins&lt;/a&gt;, like CRP and IL-6, and increase &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5883991/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;anti-inflammatory proteins&lt;/a&gt;, like IL-10.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;To reap these and other benefits, the World Health Organization &lt;a href="https://iris.who.int/bitstream/handle/10665/337001/9789240014886-eng.pdf" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;recommends&lt;/a&gt; adults spend at least 150 minutes each week on moderate aerobic activity, like brisk walking and cycling, or 75 minutes on vigorous activity, like running, Zumba or sports. A longitudinal &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S002561961830538X?utm_source=chatgpt.com" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; finds sports involving social interaction – such as tennis, badminton and soccer – are best at promoting health and longevity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="support-other-people" class="dcr-12ibh7f"&gt;Support other people&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Because cooperation with others has historically been essential for survival, our bodies have evolved to respond to the absence of social connections. The &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02699931.2013.837379" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;late neuroscientist Dr John Cacioppo&lt;/a&gt; compares this evolutionary response to hunger. Just as hunger signals the absence of energy and nutrients and cues the body to find food, loneliness signals the absence of social connections, and cues us to seek out or repair relationships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;That’s why multiple studies link feelings of loneliness and social isolation to a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5130107/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;range of stress responses&lt;/a&gt;, including increased &lt;a href="https://pure.johnshopkins.edu/en/publications/getting-under-the-skin-social-isolation-and-biological-markers-in" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;pro-inflammatory proteins&lt;/a&gt; and dysregulated &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19744794/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;cortisol&lt;/a&gt; function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Conversely, studies link &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15473629/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;high levels of social support &lt;/a&gt;to lower cortisol, and link social activities like &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4229892/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;volunteering&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37036113/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;giving social support&lt;/a&gt; to lower pro-inflammatory proteins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="experience-awe" class="dcr-12ibh7f"&gt;Experience ‘awe’&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Within all of these activities, the experience of awe – a feeling of being in the presence of something vast that transcends our current understanding of the world – can also reduce inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Dr Jennifer Stellar, a professor of psychology at University of Toronto, co-authored a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25603133/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; that links awe to greater positive affect and lower inflammatory proteins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Further research is underway but Stellar suggests “that positive emotions can undo the effects of negative emotions, and negative emotions are associated with inflammation”. Another reason is that “awe makes us feel connected to others, and social connection has been documented to act as a buffer against inflammatory responses.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;So how can you encounter awe? Her co-author, Dr Dacher Keltner, a professor of psychology at University of Berkeley California and renowned awe expert, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/may/02/awe-psychology-life-death-dacher-keltner" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; that it can result from engagement with the “eight wonders of life”: the moral beauty of others, nature, collective movement, music, visual design, spirituality and religion, big ideas, and the cycle of life and death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Tue, 22 Jul 2025 16:01:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijgFBVV95cUxPR3lYaFpRWTRfZnhaUnRhdU9FbExTQXRhN3VKOWR2M2U4YTNjUkdGUzdaREo1U2wzVE5fYURXTUVFelRObGlnOWxaZWJJV1ZDM05tbFpBRXdnQ1IzZkxaM2lCbTJOeUN5RzF4aFNINVpMVmU1cEZJS0xJNGR5R1ZJQWdpWHg1TWg4TUhHc2lR</guid></item><item><title>性建议：我看到的那个男人在床上解放了我。现在，这将是我们的垮台。- Slate Magazine | Sex advice: The man I'm seeing liberated me in bed.

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="46" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd94rr6h00173b775qxm39ky@published"&gt;I am a voracious reader of your column. I love the content, advice, and inspiration it provides me. I am writing in for help with a problem I am having. My rational side knows the answer, but my emotional side will not get with the program.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="88" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd94rr8f00183b77f93x85fd@published"&gt;I am female and my partner is male. We began our relationship hot and heavy. He reawakened in me a connection with my sexual self that has been powerful and liberating. I am in my mid-40s, perimenopausal, and still I WANT to have sex as often as possible because of how good it feels to be desired and connected to a man that I love.  We have been very adventurous. I have a vivid imagination and fantasize and masturbate regularly. I always prefer him. Here is the problem…&lt;/p&gt;

  



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="83" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd94rram00193b77dm16bz7w@published"&gt;His libido is vanishing. He is also in his 40s. He has an incredibly stressful job, custody troubles, substance abuse, and past sexual trauma. He is a complicated, yet simple man, and we love each other very much. I communicate endlessly about his diminishing initiative to be intimate and how it makes me feel. This then turns into him feeling guilt and shame for not being able to provide what I need, and he worries I will leave him for someone who can.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="201" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd9mgfku000b3b7820xbz79a@published"&gt;He is finally taking erectile dysfunction medication, but he seems to never be in the mood to initiate. I feel like I am badgering him. I know he is tired and stressed, but he is so sexy to me that I want him ALL the time, and the pressure I put on him only makes it worse. I try to tell him that I don’t need his penis to work for me to be sexually satisfied. I just need him to want me the way he used to. He says he will go to therapy with me, but not alone. We talk about our relationship issues, but he is exhausted by the fact that it always comes back to sex and my constant need for it. Non-monogamy is not really for us (although we have discussed my fantasy of bringing another male to the bedroom). I know I need to back off and give him some grace. It is his body, and I need to learn how to be patient. Still, my feelings of rejection and neglect are overwhelming sometimes. How can I reconcile my understanding of what he is physically/mentally going through with my overwhelming feelings of hurt and frustration?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="119" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd94rrja001c3b77y2vef73g@published"&gt;As a longtime reader, I’m guessing you’re aware of my philosophy that feelings can’t be forced—whether that’s you feeling satisfied, or your partner feeling desire. He probably does want, on some level, to want you the way he used to. You’re absolutely correct that patience, space, and grace are the best way to create conditions that are conducive to your partner feeling desire toward you. You know that men often deal with feelings of inadequacy around erectile dysfunction, and may have a hard time with their libido being lower than they feel it should be or than it used to be. And you’re aware that most of us worry, at some point, about whether our partners might leave us.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="37" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd94rrlx001d3b77zlzk5vhc@published"&gt;As an aside, absolutely do not pursue bringing in a third partner at this time. It’s too combustible. Even discussing the fantasy has a chance of adding more shame and pressure to what your partner is feeling.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="92" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd94rroa001e3b77u6nmbhpe@published"&gt;Are you sure that the neglect you’re feeling is entirely related to sex? Your partner is juggling a lot, and I’m wondering whether you’ve perhaps enjoyed the sexual liberation you describe so thoroughly that you may not have noticed intimacy, connection, and support being somewhat absent in other areas. So take a long, sober look at the relationship. Do you get the amount of touch you need outside of sex? Is he emotionally available to a degree that is sufficient for you? Do you have ways of connecting outside of physical intimacy?&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="52" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd94rrqc001f3b77tl8l28dj@published"&gt;If everything else is healthy and happy, what can you do to increase the sexual gratification you get from your solo time? Sometimes this looks like adding props and media—a new vibrator, some different fantasies—and sometimes this looks like a kind of mindful minimalism. Whatever you’re doing right now, explore other directions.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="79" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd94rrsk001g3b77h73b4v38@published"&gt;As for reconciling what your mind knows with what you feel and what your body wants, therapy is absolutely an option. It may help to simply accept the fact that we sometimes have to hold disparate perspectives. Talking it out with trusted friends is another time-tested way of dealing with difficult feelings. Have a commiseration session—whether you’re all navigating similar hiccups or having different challenges, a group complaint night has a way of helping contextualize what we’re going through.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="62" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd94rrup001h3b7790eqxj9n@published"&gt;Lastly—and I know this is a wild thing for a sex advice columnist to say to someone who is fairly freshly sexually liberated—it might help to rein in your libido. What can you do to focus on other aspects of life? Or to sit with arousal and desire without letting it run free? This might give you the reprieve you’re looking for.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="95" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd94st7w001s3b77y7zbqgqi@published"&gt;I am a 25-year-old woman who is into being a dom, as it serves as a major turn-on for me. The trouble is that I find that many (if not all) of the guys I go out with are decidedly not keen on the idea of playing the role of a sub. Am I going to have to restrict myself to circles with men who are into being subs if I want to satisfy my kink? Or should I try to see if I can convince someone who isn’t really into it to go along?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="75" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd94st7w001v3b77w35kn115@published"&gt;Take a moment to look at your last question: ”convince someone who isn’t really into it.” That’s always a dodgy proposition when we’re talking about sex, and doubly so when the sex involves power exchange, restraint, or pain. Your potential lovers are people who deserve respect, autonomy, and care. Functional BDSM absolutely requires that the submissive’s boundaries and rights be respected—if that isn’t the case, it’s assault or coercion at best, and rape at worst.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="157" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd94st7x001w3b77w417lqpc@published"&gt;When you question whether you’ll have to restrict yourself to circles of men who identify as subs, I imagine you’re wondering whether BDSM clubs and FetLife are your only dating options. While you’ll certainly have a more efficient time finding men who are open to submitting in those spaces, there are other avenues open to you. It’ll help to define what being a dom means to you, and what you’re looking for in a sub. Is this more about psychological role play? Service? Are sadism and masochism part of the equation? What do you need out of the experience to feel satisfied? Let’s say it’s about service—is a defined scenario important? Or will someone whose love language is “acts of service” and loves letting you sit on their face suffice? And does any dynamic need to be pervasive throughout the relationship, present in every sexual and flirtation interaction, or can it be confined to specific sexual moments?&lt;/p&gt;

  


  
  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="132" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd94st7z001x3b77rszlzfv3@published"&gt;Once you’ve got the clarity outlined above, you might look in places like Feeld, which tend to attract people who are, broadly speaking, sexually open. Or attend local events that are marketed as “sex positive” and meet people there. Negotiating relationships with a power dynamic is complex, which is why you’ll need details about exactly what you need to be fulfilled. Be prepared for lots of folks to say, “No, thank you.” That’s part of the reality of dating, whether the detail we’re navigating is a sexual interest, a personality quirk, or the demands of any number of careers. And, if it turns out that your interests are precise and narrow enough that you do essentially need to focus your search in classic BDSM spaces, ask yourself why that feels like confinement.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="92" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd94tayc002b3b77slzkvbj8@published"&gt;It’s worth making it clear to Alex that you’re willing to walk away over this, but I’d stop short of anything that might feel wheedling or manipulative. State the situation plainly: Receiving oral sex is important to your satisfaction, you won’t stay in a relationship where it isn’t part of the sex, and you’re hoping that he’ll be willing to give it a try with you, even though you know he’s never enjoyed it before. Whatever his answer is, accept that and make your choices accordingly with as little turmoil as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alcohol takes around 24 hours to completely leave your body, so you may start noticing improvements after just one day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alcohol makes you need to urinate more often, causing dehydration. But your body can absorb a glass of water almost immediately, so once alcohol is out of your system, alcohol dehydration is reduced, improving digestion, brain function and energy levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alcohol also reduces the liver's ability to regulate blood sugar. Once alcohol leaves the system, blood sugar begins to normalize.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If you are a daily drinker you may feel a bit worse to start with while your body adjusts to not having alcohol in its system all the time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;You may initially notice disrupted sleep, mood changes, sweating or tremors. Most symptoms usually resolve in about a week without alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-medium health-ccox mol-style-bold"&gt;After one week &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Even though alcohol can make you feel sleepy at first, it disrupts your sleep cycle. By the end of an alcohol-free week, you may notice you are more energetic in the mornings as a result of getting better quality sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As the body's filter, the liver does much of the heavy lifting in processing alcohol and can be easily damaged even with moderate drinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The liver is important for cleaning blood, processing nutrients and producing bile that helps with digestion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But it can also regenerate quickly. If you have only mild damage in the liver, seven days may be enough to reduce liver fat and heal mild scarring and tissue damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Even small amounts of alcohol can impair brain functioning. So quitting can help improve brain health within a few days in light to moderate drinkers and within a month even for very heavy dependent drinkers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-medium health-ccox mol-style-bold"&gt;After one month &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alcohol can make managing mood harder and worsen symptoms of anxiety and depression. After a few weeks, most people start to feel better. Even very heavy drinkers report better mood after one to two months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As your sleep and mood improve you may also notice more energy and greater wellbeing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After a month of abstinence regular drinkers also report feeling more confident about making changes to how they drink.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;You may lose weight and body fat. Alcohol can trigger hunger reward systems, making us overeat or choose less healthy foods when drinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Even your skin will thank you. Alcohol can make you look older through dehydration and inflammation, which can be reversed when you quit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alcohol irritates the gut and disrupts normal stomach functioning, causing bloating, indigestion, heartburn and diarrhea. These symptoms usually start to resolve within four weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One month of abstinence, insulin resistance – which can lead to high blood sugar – significantly reduces by 25 percent. Blood pressure also reduces (by six percent) and cancer-related growth factors declines, lowering your risk of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;It can take up to three days for the body to return to normal functioning following a two-day boozy drinking session, experts say&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-medium health-ccox mol-style-bold"&gt;After six months &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The liver starts to repair within weeks. For moderate drinkers, damage to your liver could be fully reversed by six months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At this point, even heavy drinkers may notice they're better at fighting infections and feel healthier overall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-medium health-ccox mol-style-bold"&gt;After one year or more &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alcohol contributes to or causes a large number of chronic diseases, including heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes, and seven different types of cancer, as well as mental health issues. All of these risks can be reduced by quitting or cutting back on alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alcohol increases blood pressure. High blood pressure (hypertension) is the top risk factor for death in the world. A small 2mmHg increase in blood pressure above the normal range (120mmHG) increases death from stroke by 10 percent and from coronary artery disease by seven percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cutting back on alcohol to less than two drinks a day can reduce blood pressure significantly, reducing risk of stroke and heart disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Reducing blood pressure also reduces risk of kidney disease, eye problems and even erectile dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;With sustained abstinence, your risk of getting any type of cancer drops. One study looked at cancer risk for more than 4 million adults over three to seven years and found the risk of alcohol-related cancer dropped by 4 percent, even for light drinkers who quit. Reducing from heavy to moderate drinking reduced alcohol-related cancer risk by nine percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;This article is adapted from The Conversation, a nonprofit news organization dedicated to sharing the knowledge of experts.

Drinking at your current level puts you at risk of developing problems with your health and life in general, such as work and relationships. Consider cutting down (see below for tips).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;16-19:&lt;/span&gt; Higher risk of complications from alcohol. Cutting back on your own may be difficult at this level, as you may be dependent, so you may need professional help from your GP and/or a counsellor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;20 and over:&lt;/span&gt; Possible dependence. Your drinking is already causing you problems, and you could very well be dependent. You should definitely consider stopping gradually or at least reduce your drinking. You should seek professional help to ascertain the level of your dependence and the safest way to withdraw from alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Severe dependence may need medically assisted withdrawal, or detox, in a hospital or a specialist clinic. This is due to the likelihood of severe alcohol withdrawal symptoms in the first 48 hours needing specialist treatment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/mol-permabox&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

I was a stepmom of two and the primary caretaker of my husband, who is a disabled Veteran of the Marine Corps. He became paralyzed after an injury in 2011.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In April 2021, she went to the doctor after she developed common UTI symptoms. Tests confirmed she had a UTI and her doctor prescribed her an antibiotic called Ciprofloxacin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Before I took the antibiotic, I asked if there was anything I needed to know or be aware of since I didn't take medications and antibiotics often,' Talia explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The response was that there was nothing I needed to be aware of, it was "safe and effective" and that the medication was frequently prescribed at the practice to treat UTIs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I trusted my doctor of 10 years so I started my course of treatment.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;She said the medicine left her in excruciating pain for months, describing it as feeling like 'electrical shocks' were running through her body and 'bugs were crawling' all over her&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;It also affected her vision and hearing, resulted in her having severe stomach issues, and ultimately left her unable to walk&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Talia explained that after her third dose she began to develop 'pain in her entire body, especially her legs.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It felt like I had the flu, when you're whole body hurts, except I wasn't actually sick,' she added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'As the day went on, it continued to worsen and I started having tingling and numbness in my extremities. I had zapping pains in my head and face. It was like electrical shocks.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It got so bad that she couldn't walk - 'It was like a bomb went off in my body' - so she decided to go to the emergency room.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After describing her symptoms, the first thing the ER doctor asked her was, 'Are you taking Ciprofloxacin?'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The ER doctor then explained that the drug she was on had something known as a black box warning from the FDA - the strongest warning the FDA could give, usually for a 'serious or potentially fatal' side effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Back in 2016, according to the FDA website, the organization 'advised that the serious side effects associated with fluoroquinolone antibacterial drugs [like Ciprofloxacin] generally outweigh the benefits for patients.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'An FDA safety review has shown that fluoroquinolones when used systemically are associated with disabling and potentially permanent serious side effects that can occur together,' its website &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-safety-and-availability/fda-drug-safety-communication-fda-advises-restricting-fluoroquinolone-antibiotic-use-certain"&gt;reads&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Within five months her condition had become so bad she could hardly eat, and she lost over 50 percent of her body weight, weighing a mere 60 pounds before she was put on hospice&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;It got so bad that she believed she was going to die after doctors warned that her organs would start failing soon&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'These side effects can involve the tendons, muscles, joints, nerves, and central nervous system.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The reaction to the medicine has become known as fluoroquinolone toxicity - according to &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.goodrx.com/classes/quinolone-antibiotics/fluoroquinolone-toxicity?srsltid=AfmBOoqywth-1awJHeX73SQSIQA2mf_fzeqbwayaDRkswRfUyPgFRoxv"&gt;GoodRx&lt;/a&gt;, symptoms include 'muscle or joint pain and tendonitis/tendon rupture, nerve damage and twitching, anxiety, depression, hallucinations and memory problems, eye pain, vision loss, ringing in your ears, hearing loss, and loss of smell, and chest pain or skipping heartbeats, known as palpitations.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In response to the fluoroquinolone toxicity, Talia then developed something called mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS), which is 'an inappropriate activation of the immune system where the body rejects everything, as a form of protection.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And in the months that followed, she said her condition only 'worsened.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I was having electrical shocks 24/7, it felt like I had bugs crawling all over my body, horrendous bone and joint pain, debilitating neuropathy, vision and hearing changes, stomach problems, my body was stiffening up, and I was unable to bend in order to sit down,' she shared. 'It felt like my body was in shut down mode.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The biggest problem she faced was difficulty swallowing, which made it extremely hard for her to eat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At one point, she was told by doctors that she would go into organ failure soon because of lack of food. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Within five months, I lost over 50 percent of my body weight and went on Hospice, weighing 60 pounds in September 2021,' she recalled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;While she has thankfully improved since then, she still requires 24/7 care and is bed-bound - and she doesn't think she'll ever get her old life back&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Flash forward to now, four years after the ordeal first started, and Talia is still living with the effects of the condition&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Before and after: 'I still require 24/7 care for my survival, as I am bed-bound and mainly get up only to go to doctor's appointments in a wheelchair,' she said&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She started to believe she was going to die, and even had a priest come to her house and read her her last rites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I truly believed that was the end for me and made peace with it after five months of horrendous suffering,' she said, as she broke down in tears.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This was so traumatic for me, listening to my family and friends crying and thinking that would be the last time I ever saw them.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But Talia's husband wasn't ready to give up, and he 'made it his mission' to get her medication for her MCAS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The hospitals had previously denied her request but he kept pushing, and eventually, they gave her mast cell stabilizers, which changed everything for her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It gave her the ability to eat again, and by May 2022, she was able to leave Hospice and switch to palliative care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Flash forward to now, four years after the ordeal first started, and Talia is still living with the effects of the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I am still on palliative care to this day and require 24/7 care for my survival, as I am bed-bound and mainly get up only to go to doctor's appointments in a wheelchair,' she said. 'I can't do anything by myself. I don't have the strength.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said she's still in 'constant pain' and she doesn't think she will ever get back to the way she was before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This has destroyed [me]. &lt;span&gt;I lost my career, my independence, my quality of life,' she confessed. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'I can only eat five foods because of MCAS, I can't go out and live a "normal" life like everyone else. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I miss working, I miss being able to eat whatever I want, I miss being able to workout, I miss driving, I miss my social life and the life I had with my husband. And there is nothing I can do to get my old life back.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Talia said she later confronted her doctor about prescribing her the dangerous medication, but claimed was brushed off - and looking back, she feels like the medical system failed her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'When I confronted [my doctor] about the black box warning, the permanent and disabling side effects and how fluoroquinolones should be used as last resort, she told me she was going to continue to prescribe Cipro because she always had and no one else had had a reaction like me,' she shared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;She is now on a mission to share her story in the hopes that it can stop others from making the same mistake&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;She has launched a petition for the FDA 'to issue informed consent for all fluoroquinolone antibiotic prescriptions,' which has over 3,000 signatures&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Not only did she have a duty to warn me about this dangerous class of antibiotics, but when I asked if there was anything I needed to know, I was told no. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Additionally, the way she reacted afterwards, by telling me she was going to prescribe Cipro for a UTIs, despite the FDA warnings that I printed and brought to her office, was extremely unprofessional and shows her lack of caring about what happened. I felt very betrayed and abandoned by the medical system.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Talia is currently raising money on her &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/support-talias-fight-for-health-and-hope"&gt;GoFundMe &lt;/a&gt;page to help cover her medical costs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She is now on a mission to share her story in the hopes that it can stop others from making the same mistake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She has also launched a &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.change.org/p/request-us-fda-to-issue-informed-consent-for-all-fluoroquinolone-antibiotic-prescriptions?utm_medium=custom_url&amp;amp;utm_source=share_petition&amp;amp;recruited_by_id=f927e270-521b-11ef-b65c-8d5e1d4f435f"&gt;petition &lt;/a&gt;for the FDA 'to issue informed consent for all fluoroquinolone antibiotic prescriptions,' which has over 3,000 signatures. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She concluded, 'If you are prescribed a fluoroquinolone antibiotic as first line, ask for an alternative, if there is one.

collected samples from the leaves of Stevia rebaudiana, a plant native to tropical and subtropical South America. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The plant is used to make the sugar substitute Stevia, which can be 50 to 300 times sweeter than sugar and has no calories. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After fermenting the leaves with Lactobacillus plantarum — the same bacteria used in yogurt and fermented vegetables — the team found fermented Stevia proved effective at killing pancreatic &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-a313a6b0-667b-11f0-93ae-09643ae30151"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Compared to non-fermented Stevia, fermented varieties (FSLE) destroyed more cells of pancreatic cancer, which kills eight in 10 Americans affected within five years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It also left healthy cells virtually untouched and neutralized free radicals, which cause harmful inflammation throughout the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Artificial sweeteners like Stevia have long been under fire for &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14798029/popular-health-snack-linked-risk-strokes-heart-attacks.html"&gt;being linked to health issues&lt;/a&gt; like strokes, heart disease and some forms of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, the science on sugar substitutes and alternatives is murky, while decades of research does show the harms of traditional sugar are much clearer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A study shows the sweetener Stevia may help stave off pancreatic cancer (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers said the findings could eventually turn the tide for pancreatic cancer, which is on the rise and most often only detected after it has spread throughout the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Narandalai Danshiitsoodol, study co-author and associate professor in the Department of Probiotic Science for Preventive Medicine at Hiroshima University, said: 'Globally, the incidence and mortality rates of pancreatic cancer continue to rise, with a five-year survival rate of less than 10 percent.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the US, approximately 67,440 people are diagnosed with pancreatic cancer each year, and about 51,980 people die from it, according to the American Cancer Society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Pancreatic cancer is highly invasive and prone to metastasis, meaning it more commonly breaks away from the primary tumor and spreads throughout the body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It shows significant resistance to existing treatments, such as surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy, thus the need for anti-cancer compounds was sought after in less conventional methods like medicinal plants.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;That’s where Stevia and fermentation comes in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the study, published in the International &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/26/9/4186"&gt;Journal of Molecular Sciences&lt;/a&gt;, researchers fermented Stevia leaf extract and compared it to unfermented extract. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The technique is called microbial biotransformation, which has emerged as a valuable technique for improving the efficacy of natural plant extracts. It involves the use of microbial enzymes - bacteria and yeast, for example - to modify bioactive compounds and enhance their potency. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Stevia turned out to be most potent when fermented for 72 hours, without oxygen, at 37 degrees Celsius (98.6 degrees Fahrenheit) - the body's natural, healthy temperature. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team found Stevia killed pancreatic cancer (PANC-1) cells more efficiently than the non-fermented extract. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At the same time, it barely touched healthy HEK-293 (healthy) cells, even at high doses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The extract also slowed cancer cell growth and made them lose shape, preventing them from sticking together and spreading.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, fermented stevia proved to be a potent antioxidant. Cancer arises from oxidative stress, which damages cells and DNA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In lab tests the Stevia extract neutralized free radicals more effectively than non fermented varieties, eradicating 94 percent of them in one test. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The chart shows survival rates for pancreatic cancer, per the National Cancer Institute&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Fermentation likely created new compounds. The researchers suspect chlorogenic acid that is in the original stevia transformed into chlorogenic acid methyl ester (CAME), a more active form. The raw extract had none of this, by comparison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's thought that CAME shut down cancer cells by blocking their cell cycle and making them commit apoptosis, molecular steps that lead to its death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Danshiitsoodol said: 'This microbial transformation was likely due to specific enzymes in the bacteria strain used.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Hiroshima University team plans to study FSLE in mouse models next, which will help determine how well CAME works in a living system and identify safe, effective doses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over time this could potentially lead to a natural and easy way to combat one of the world's deadliest cancers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/avian-influenza-bird-flu/bangladesh-and-india-alert-who-about-new-h5n1-infections" target="_blank"&gt;Bangladesh and India report more H5N1 infections&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Bangladesh's case,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An investigation revealed the child had contact with backyard poultry before symptoms began. No other cases were detected, and the child has recovered. The illness marks Bangladesh’s 11&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;human H5N1 case since 2008 and its third of 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In June, the WHO noted the&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/avian-influenza-bird-flu/bangladesh-notifies-who-2-recent-human-h5n1-avian-flu-infections" target="_blank"&gt;two cases reported earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;, both of them children from Khulna division in the southwestern part of the country. Both recovered from their infections. Today’s report on the new cases didn’t note the clade, but the two cases reported earlier this year involved the older 2.3.2.1a, known to circulate in birds and poultry in Bangladesh and India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;India's case was a grown man, who died of his infection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Avian flu in cows is &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/avian-influenza-bird-flu/avian-flu-exacts-heavy-financial-toll-dairy-industry-report-says" target="_blank"&gt;A major financial burden.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK, I did not know this about cow behavior.  Adult cows sometimes &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/avian-influenza-bird-flu/flies-milk-snatching-among-h5n1-transmission-contributors-dairy-cattle" target="_blank"&gt;suckle on each other&lt;/a&gt;, and this is believed to contribute to intraherd transmission of avian flu.  But the study also implicates FLIES, and this is not a happy-making thing, at all!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even LESS happy-making: &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/plague/report-describes-offseason-plague-case-transmitted-cat" target="_blank"&gt;A cat transmitted plague to its owner.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mississippi has &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/pertussis/mississippi-warns-steep-increase-pertussis-cases" target="_blank"&gt;a steep increase in pertussis cases.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Researchers are suggesting that maybe &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/diphtheria/adults-largely-dont-need-tetanus-diphtheria-vaccine-boosters-researchers-say" target="_blank" title=""&gt;We don't need our every ten years Td boosters?&lt;/a&gt;  Sorry, I disagree.

While these rhythms have long been thought of as stable traits, studies reveal that metabolic state, like fasting before sleep, can enhance their timing and co-occurrence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fasting in rats boosted the density and synchronization of these sleep rhythms, aligning them for better memory consolidation. These findings suggest sleep’s memory-supporting architecture is more flexible — and modifiable — than previously believed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SO-Spindle Coupling:&lt;/strong&gt; Slow oscillations and sleep spindles work in precise timing to stabilize memories during NREM sleep.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Metabolic Influence:&lt;/strong&gt; Fasting before sleep increased SO and spindle density and improved their coupling in rats.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trait and State:&lt;/strong&gt; While sleep rhythms have stable baseline patterns, they can adapt to metabolic and experiential states.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For decades, scientists have marveled at sleep’s mysterious power to strengthen our memories. The human brain, it seems, does some of its most important work while we’re unconscious: replaying, refining, and reinforcing the day’s experiences so they can be stored for the long term. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A key part of this process involves two distinct patterns of brain activity unique to non-REM (NREM) sleep: slow oscillations (SOs) and sleep spindles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-111846"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/fasting-sleep-memory-neuroscienc.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/fasting-sleep-memory-neuroscienc-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/fasting-sleep-memory-neuroscienc-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/fasting-sleep-memory-neuroscienc-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/fasting-sleep-memory-neuroscienc-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/fasting-sleep-memory-neuroscienc-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/fasting-sleep-memory-neuroscienc-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/fasting-sleep-memory-neuroscienc.jpg" alt="This shows a fork and a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/fasting-sleep-memory-neuroscienc.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/fasting-sleep-memory-neuroscienc-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/fasting-sleep-memory-neuroscienc-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/fasting-sleep-memory-neuroscienc-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/fasting-sleep-memory-neuroscienc-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/fasting-sleep-memory-neuroscienc-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/fasting-sleep-memory-neuroscienc-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Future research is now needed to uncover the exact circuit-level mechanisms and to explore whether interventions like diet, neuromodulation, or targeted memory reactivation could enhance SO-spindle coupling in meaningful ways. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;These electrical rhythms—large, slow waves paired with rapid, waxing-and-waning bursts—are thought to synchronize widespread brain regions and promote synaptic plasticity, the foundation of learning and memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past few years, research has zeroed in on a crucial detail: it’s not just the presence of SOs and &lt;a href="https://neurosciencenews.com/sleep-spindle-brain-health-28325/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;spindles&lt;/a&gt; that matters, but the precise way they are timed together. This SO-spindle coupling, researchers argue, may be one of sleep’s most essential mechanisms for consolidating memories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But is this coupling a fixed feature of an individual’s sleep, like a fingerprint? Or is it flexible—capable of adjusting to recent experiences, such as what you’ve learned that day or even what you’ve eaten? A growing body of work is beginning to suggest the answer is more nuanced than we thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The Rhythm of Memory&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;During &lt;a href="https://neurosciencenews.com/nrem-sleep-cognition-28118/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;NREM sleep&lt;/a&gt;, your brain cycles through patterns of silence and activity at about one cycle per second. These are the slow oscillations, sweeping waves of hyperpolarization (down states) and depolarization (up states) in the cortex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In parallel, the thalamus generates spindles, brief bursts of higher-frequency activity in the 11–16 Hz range. When spindles are precisely timed to the upstate of a slow oscillation, the conditions are ideal for strengthening synaptic connections—a process believed to stabilize memory traces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier studies have shown that this SO-spindle coupling declines with age and is associated with both memory decline and cognitive impairment. But what about day-to-day variability? Could an unusually rich day of learning, for example, “tune” your brain to couple SOs and spindles more tightly as you sleep?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Testing the Trait vs. State Debate&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To tackle this question, a research team studied 41 young adults over two nights: one after a word-pair learning task and one control night with no learning. Some participants learned a modest list of 40 word pairs, while others memorized 120, and one group had to meet a minimum recall standard. The researchers measured SO-spindle coupling across these conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, they found no consistent differences in coupling strength between the learning and control nights—suggesting that pre-sleep learning alone may not significantly influence this aspect of sleep architecture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, within the group that reached a performance criterion, there was a correlation between memory performance and the &lt;em&gt;phase&lt;/em&gt; of SO-spindle coupling. This finding hints that while coupling may not change dramatically night-to-night, subtle aspects of its timing may still matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also uncovered a robust link between the amount of spindle power and the preferred phase of SO-spindle coupling—echoing previous findings that this relationship varies with age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taken together, the results support the idea that SO-spindle coupling may have both trait-like stability (reflecting an individual’s typical sleep structure) and state-dependent fine-tuning influenced by experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Beyond Learning: How Metabolism Shapes Sleep Rhythms&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If not only learning, what else could shape SO-spindle coupling? One intriguing possibility is metabolic state. Recent work found that individuals with lower fasting glucose levels had stronger and more precise SO-spindle coupling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This association persisted after controlling for many demographic and health factors, though it disappeared when diabetes status was accounted for—pointing to a complex link between glucose metabolism and sleep oscillations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Animal experiments provide even more direct evidence. In a study of adult rats, researchers manipulated metabolic state by fasting the animals for six hours before sleep or injecting them with glucose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fasting increased the density of both SOs and spindles, improved their co-occurrence, and shifted spindle timing closer to the upstate of the slow oscillation—an alignment thought to optimize memory consolidation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Glucose injections, meanwhile, increased spindle density but didn’t affect SOs or their coupling. Importantly, these changes occurred without altering the overall amounts of NREM or REM sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results suggest that while age and baseline physiology set the stage, day-to-day factors like nutrition can modulate the fine structure of sleep rhythms, potentially enhancing the brain’s ability to consolidate memories overnight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The Neurochemistry of Sleep Substates&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even more tantalizing is emerging evidence that NREM sleep itself isn’t uniform, but fluctuates through subtle substates over minutes at a time. These substates, identified in rodent studies, are defined by varying levels of neuromodulators like serotonin, acetylcholine, and norepinephrine—all of which are known to influence memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How these slow neurochemical waves interact with the precise timing of SOs and spindles is still largely unknown, but understanding it could unlock deeper insights into how sleep supports memory and learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The Bigger Picture&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings reinforce the idea that SO-spindle coupling is a dynamic interplay between stable individual characteristics and flexible state-dependent factors. While your personal sleep architecture likely provides a consistent baseline, it can still adapt—at least subtly—to what you’ve learned, what you’ve eaten, and possibly other yet-unknown variables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those looking to optimize their &lt;a href="https://neurosciencenews.com/sleep-spindles-blood-sugar-23596/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;sleep for better memory&lt;/a&gt;, this research offers some practical lessons: maintaining healthy metabolic habits may support more effective sleep-based memory consolidation. And it underscores the importance of high-quality sleep itself—not just quantity, but the integrity of its underlying rhythms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future research is now needed to uncover the exact circuit-level mechanisms and to explore whether interventions like diet, neuromodulation, or targeted memory reactivation could enhance SO-spindle coupling in meaningful ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sleep is far from passive. It’s a highly orchestrated process that relies on the exquisite timing of electrical and chemical signals to reinforce what we’ve learned and prepare us for the next day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By continuing to unravel how slow oscillations and spindles work together—and how they can be tuned by our daily experiences—scientists are bringing us closer to understanding how to make the most of our sleeping hours for our waking minds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding:&lt;/strong&gt; This work was supported by Gemeinnützige Hertie-Stiftung, Network for Excellence in Clinical Neuroscience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this sleep and memory research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://neurosciencenews.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Neuroscience News Communications&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://neurosciencenews.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Neuroscience News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Neuroscience News Communications – Neuroscience News&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/ejn.70204" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Phase-Amplitude Coupling in Sleep EEG—Stable Trait or Shaped by Experience?&lt;/a&gt; ” by Niels Niethard. &lt;em&gt;European Journal of Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phase-Amplitude Coupling in Sleep EEG—Stable Trait or Shaped by Experience? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The consolidation of newly encoded memories into long-term storage critically depends on plasticity processes during sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is assumed that memory representations are facilitated by repeated reactivation of neuronal firing patterns during sleep, which promotes synaptic plasticity and thereby strengthens memory traces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A growing body of evidence shows that such memory reactivations occur during specific oscillatory patterns in the EEG that are unique to sleep (Brodt et al. 2023).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 22 Jul 2025 13:23:19 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiZ0FVX3lxTE5HMllJOGF2TUlCeW5vT2xEdWpvamwxOFlzWWdWMS1VdU5KV1J0aHNJVXBmUFFYcU4wcHJBT3JBV04xQ0pOYXJYd0tTY1loLUszcVJKd3pHbW1FZ2V0THpXVXNuamtJNEk</guid></item><item><title>Lizzo认为这种按摩有助于她的身体转变-背后有真正的科学- AOL.com | Lizzo Credits This Type Of Massage For Helping With Her Body Transformation—And There's Real Science Behind It - AOL.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieEFVX3lxTE5qa21pTUhsMWstbXdSRlljMTZkeGlRSFZhVVItamFLaVdPMkJnbU5rMFM1LVRVWXg2RUNHdWpBb2dRRW02NkNydUM0ZHIyY2ZlUDFISy1kN3h4ajNLZDU3cG9nUUZkS1Y2NmgyUHdmUTZZZHN0T1Q1Tg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="caption"&gt;Lizzo Saw This Beauty Expert To Get Cover Ready&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;Getty Images/Flavia Lanini&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lizzo is many things—a singer, a songwriter, an actor, and, now, &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/life/a65192751/lizzo-transformation-health-journey/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:a cover star;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;a cover star&lt;/a&gt;. When the entertainer, who's birth name is Melissa Viviane Jefferson, appeared in the &lt;em&gt;Women's Health&lt;/em&gt; Summer 2025 issue, she appeared fit, healthy, and at peace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last few years have been transformative for the 37-year-old, both inside &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; out. Lizzo is quick to point out that her &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/food/a65319688/lizzo-fuel-like-healthy-eating-habits/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:body reinvention;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;body reinvention&lt;/a&gt; is not the result of &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/weight-loss/a43557514/ozempic-for-weight-loss/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Ozempic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Ozempic&lt;/a&gt; or weight loss surgery, but rather diet, exercise, and lifestyle changes. She loads up on &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/food/g44560437/healthy-sheet-pan-dinners/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:protein-rich meals;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;protein-rich meals&lt;/a&gt;, works out five days per week, hosts spiritual retreats...and relies on some help from a very special friend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The four-time Grammy winner has been outspoken on social media about the pivotal role celebrity &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a32171081/lymphatic-drainage-massage/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:lymphatic drainage;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;lymphatic drainage&lt;/a&gt; specialist &lt;a href="https://flavialanini.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Flavia Lanini;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Flavia Lanini&lt;/a&gt; has played in her wellness journey. She's a regular at Lanini’s eponymous Beauty Institute in Beverly Hills, indulging in her signature detox treatment once or twice weekly. The results speak for themselves, as seen in a recent &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DLq4AAvRTD_/?img_index=5" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:before and after;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;before and after&lt;/a&gt; phot0 posted to Instagram.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Lanini, it all comes to down to Lizzo’s dedication and effort—and their ongoing relationship. “I always tell my clients that they really need to trust in the process and trust &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt;. If that happens, I can deliver results—and I’m so happy with Lizzo’s results,” she says. “We took a different approach to weight loss than she ever had before, using holistic treatments and targeting all-around health.” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, more on exactly what Lanini did to have Lizzo looking—and feeling—good as hell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The woman behind the woman. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Lanini, Lizzo first came to see her about a year ago, with the goal of both losing weight and improving her overall health. “We really wanted to take the natural approach because she hates needles and can’t handle pain,” she says. That meant regular &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a64653766/benefits-of-sauna/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:sauna sessions;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;sauna sessions&lt;/a&gt;, drinking Lanini’s detoxifying teas, several non-invasive muscle- and skin-tightening treatments, and a re-framing of her attitude toward food and nutrition. At the crux of their protocol? Lanini’s signature detox treatment. “This was really the best process for Lizzo because it helped boost her metabolism so much. We started doing it once or twice per week,” she explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Brazilian-born Lanini is a lymphatic drainage expert, and lymphatic drainage is involved, the treatment is far more than that. “My technique is different because of my background and training. Being an esthetician in Brazil is nothing like being an esthetician here. I went to university for five years to earn my degree, and then spent 11 years working with doctors,” she explains. In fact, a similar protocol is even used on cancer patients in Brazil to help detox the body in between treatment rounds, she notes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The treatment includes:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ultrasound&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;First up, an ultrasound treatment on the abdomen to help stimulate digestion. “Think of your gut as an apple tree. The ultrasound works to shake it and remove the ‘apples,’ the build-up on the gut lining,” she explains. This not only helps get things moving, so to speak, but also boosts metabolism and can even help combat brain fog. When your body doesn’t need to expend energy cleaning the gut, it can focus that energy elsewhere, Lanini claims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Massage&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Step two involves a head-to-toe rubdown. Rather than relying on traditional lymphatic drainage techniques (more on those in a moment), Lanini’s method focuses on relaxing the fascia around the muscle to improve the muscle’s functionality and movement, in turn stimulating the lymphatic system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The massage is paired with Lanini’s proprietary topical sculpting cream featuring guarana, a caffeine-rich Brazilian plant. Post-massage, the cream is mixed with different salts and clay and applied underneath a wrap to boost additional detoxification.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sauna&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;During a 20-minute sauna session, Lanini's clients sip on a detoxifying, lymph-supporting tea, which also boasts Brazilian ingredients including acai, guarana, and hibiscus, among others. “It helps keep the body balanced, combats gut inflammation, and acts as electrolytes while you’re in the sauna,” Lanini explains, who adds that Lizzo drinks the tea twice daily. When all is said and done, clients feel lighter, less bloated, sleep better, and have improved energy, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While this was Lizzo’s standard regimen, Lanini upped the ante before a big event, like the Met Gala (or our cover shoot). “When she wanted to be even more snatched we’d do the detox treatment three days in a row. You really do end up with a completely different body,” Lanini says. She adds that because Lizzo was also concerned with loose skin after losing so much weight, they also incorporated VelaShape, which tightens the skin using radiofrequency and other energy modalities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bringing it all home.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;And for those of us who can’t see Lanini regularly? Even the much more widely-available, traditional lymphatic drainage massages can help improve both health and aesthetic appearance. “Think of the lymphatic system as your body’s waste management system,” says Andy Wood, a masseuse specializing in lymphatic drainage massage at Chicago’s &lt;a href="https://milkandhoneyspa.com/locations/gold-coast-chicago/chicago-gold-coast/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Milk + Honey Spa;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Milk + Honey Spa&lt;/a&gt;. It helps to move and flush out a variety of toxins and debris, including excess fluid, cellular waste, viruses and more, he explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike blood, which is pumped by the heart, there’s nothing actually pumping the lymphatic system. It moves when we move, or as a result of gravity, compression, or manual stimulation, adds Morgana Kemper, owner of &lt;a href="https://labrasileiramassage.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:La Brasiliera;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;La Brasiliera&lt;/a&gt;, a spa specializing in Brazilian lymphatic drainage massage with locations in Charlotte and Chicago. Lymphatic drainage massage is a way of manually boosting the lymphatic system and is ideal for combatting swelling and strengthening immunity, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As far as aesthetics go, it’s important to point out that lymphatic drainage massage alone isn’t going to &lt;em&gt;actually &lt;/em&gt;cause any kind of real weight loss, Wood says. Rather, when paired with diet and exercise (as in Lizzo’s case), it can help enhance the effects and appearance of that weight loss, he explains. Still, because it does flush out excess fluid, it can help make the body, particularly the abdomen, appear slimmer and more contoured, Kemper says. And while lymphatic drainage is generally very gentle (think subtle tapping and soft, sweeping motions), Brazilian techniques in particular can be a bit firmer and help redistribute fat cells for an even greater contouring effect, she adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regardless, both experts we spoke with say getting a lymphatic drainage massage monthly is ideal for those looking to make it a part of their wellness or weight loss routine. Can’t get to the spa? Kemper is a big fan of &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a61973861/best-rebounding-workouts/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:trampoline rebounding;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;trampoline rebounding&lt;/a&gt;: “It can make the lymphatic system flow 15 times faster,” she says. Or, try &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/beauty/a64523152/what-is-dry-brushing/?gad_source=1&amp;amp;gad_campaignid=20192787275&amp;amp;gbraid=0AAAAACrQpnxzZaR2nlkmsMjHsOjBJ52ib&amp;amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwyvfDBhDYARIsAItzbZGDGU0-U7kQyt2tJrZl3vVCOOiHAap-L5OcoRrtx7phB7-LakxcH7AaAkniEALw_wcB" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:dry brushing;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;dry brushing&lt;/a&gt;, another easy, at-home, lymph-boosting option.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The picture-perfect proof.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, Lizzo is the best advertisement for an integrative, holistic approach as the gateway to healthy, long-lasting changes. “Not only has she lost half of her body weight, she’s also so much more conscious of her health now. And that’s because we went from the inside-out,” says Lanini of her poster-child client.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lizzo echoed these sentiments when she spoke with &lt;em&gt;WH. &lt;/em&gt;Yes, she’s surpassed her goal weight, but she’s also released the mental weight of feeling judged by others—and herself. “It’s not just about before-and-after photos. It’s about consistency, discipline, and self-love. I’m beyond honored to be a part of your transformation and your healing process. You’re not just inspiring others, you’re leading the way,” Lanini captioned the recent &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DLq4AAvRTD_/?img_index=5" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Instagram post;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Instagram post&lt;/a&gt; where she showcased Lizzo’s results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We couldn’t agree more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 22 Jul 2025 13:13:59 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMieEFVX3lxTE5qa21pTUhsMWstbXdSRlljMTZkeGlRSFZhVVItamFLaVdPMkJnbU5rMFM1LVRVWXg2RUNHdWpBb2dRRW02NkNydUM0ZHIyY2ZlUDFISy1kN3h4ajNLZDU3cG9nUUZkS1Y2NmgyUHdmUTZZZHN0T1Q1Tg</guid></item><item><title>这种常见的血压药物延长了动物的寿命，减缓了衰老- ScienceAlert | This Common Blood Pressure Drug Extends Lifespan, Slows Aging in Animals - ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiogFBVV95cUxPcWFDVWFWS3NJVjJVeFl4X0VzR0c4c1lyT1BUR1pRa2VpNzBqWTAyd3dDTmFsenlDdm1FbV9jSUR2S2g5RlgyRnJ4VXNEWUo1SlBWa2t6VkpqVU1LZGVfOVEzN1RJVFp4TENfVHlhc1pZU3k3UkFiZGlnMmphdnU4R1RIdTRXSW1fbVdTUmhpZy1OWnlmb3pOVWVHaEpNVzZNTWc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;The hypertension drug &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rilmenidine"&gt;rilmenidine&lt;/a&gt; has been shown to slow down aging in worms, an effect that in humans could hypothetically help us live longer and keep us healthier in our latter years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous research has shown rilmenidine mimics the effects of caloric restriction on a cellular level. Reducing available energy while maintaining nutrition within the body has been shown to extend lifespans &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24146-z"&gt;in several animal models&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether this translates to human biology, or is a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/skipping-meals-could-be-much-worse-for-you-than-we-realized"&gt;potential risk to our health&lt;/a&gt;, is a topic of &lt;a href="https://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2020/can-calorie-restriction-extend-your-lifespan/"&gt;ongoing debate&lt;/a&gt;. Finding ways to achieve the same benefits without the costs of extreme calorie cutting could lead to new ways to improve health in old age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a study published in 2023, young and old &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caenorhabditis_elegans"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; worms treated with the drug – which is normally used to treat high blood pressure – lived longer and presented higher measures in a variety of health markers in the same way as restricting calories, as the scientists had hoped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For the first time, we have been able to show in animals that rilmenidine can increase lifespan," &lt;a href="https://news.liverpool.ac.uk/2023/01/23/hypertension-drug-could-be-repurposed-to-delay-ageing-study-finds/"&gt;said molecular biogerontologist João Pedro Magalhães&lt;/a&gt;, from the University of Birmingham in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are now keen to explore if rilmenidine may have other clinical applications."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/anti-aging-cocktail-extends-mouse-lifespan-by-about-30-percent?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;Anti-Aging Cocktail Extends Mouse Lifespan by About 30 Percent&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;C. elegans&lt;/em&gt; worm is a favorite for studies, because many of its genes have similarities to counterparts in our genome. Yet in spite of these similarities, it is still a rather distant relation to humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_144581" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-144581" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/08/SizeAndMorphologyCElegansCellsComparedToHumanCells642.jpg" alt="Various cell types illustrated in shades of pink" class="size-full wp-image-144581" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/08/SizeAndMorphologyCElegansCellsComparedToHumanCells642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/08/SizeAndMorphologyCElegansCellsComparedToHumanCells642-600x334.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-144581" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Some human cell types and their nuclei on the left, compared to cells from &lt;em&gt;C. elegans &lt;/em&gt;on the right.

This particular chemical structure could be targeted in future attempts to improve lifespan and slow down aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We found that the lifespan-extending effects of rilmenidine were abolished when nish-1 was deleted," the researchers explained in their &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/acel.13774"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Critically, rescuing the nish-1 receptor reinstated the increase in lifespan upon treatment with rilmenidine."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Low-calorie diets are hard to follow and come with a variety of side effects, such as hair thinning, dizziness, and brittle bones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's early days still, but the thinking is that this hypertension drug could confer the same benefits as a low-calorie diet while being easier on the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_141684" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-141684" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/ManTakingBloodPressurereadingAtHome_R_U_642.jpg" alt="A man sitting on a couch taking his blood pressure" class="size-full wp-image-141684" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/ManTakingBloodPressurereadingAtHome_R_U_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/ManTakingBloodPressurereadingAtHome_R_U_642-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/ManTakingBloodPressurereadingAtHome_R_U_642-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-141684" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Rilmenidine is normally used to treat high blood pressure.

ROACH: I have low serum cholesterol but a high coronary calcium score, and I was told to take magnesium supplements to bring my calcium score down (in addition to daily aspirin and a statin). What are your thoughts about magnesium to bring down a high calcium score? -- D.B.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-1" data-gaid="inarticle-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="EPM4DYX4GVEKZGZ6GCT3Z5R6JE"&gt;ANSWER: A coronary calcium score is a measurement of calcium in the blood vessels of the heart. High coronary calcium scores predict an increased likelihood of blockages in the blood vessels, which can lead to a heart attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-2" data-gaid="inarticle-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="NZ7LHZUP4JCRRDYU2WQKUNU3WQ"&gt;The literature is mixed about whether a high magnesium intake can reduce the risk of coronary calcium and, in theory, reduce heart disease risk. Most of the evidence suggests that high blood magnesium levels reduce heart disease risk. However, people with higher magnesium levels are more likely to be consuming a healthier diet, which is known to reduce heart disease risk by itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-3" data-gaid="inarticle-3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="RGLA72QGQJFQVLUJXEHIEARPOA"&gt;To be sure that magnesium helps prevent heart disease, a future large trial could give half the subjects a magnesium supplement and the other half an identical-appearing pill without magnesium, then follow the groups to see which is more likely to get heart disease. These types of trials are difficult, time-consuming and expensive, and they have not yet been done for magnesium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-4" data-gaid="inarticle-4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="ZJTCYIGRJNA43GNLY5JEQRZ7VM"&gt;However, you already have coronary calcium, so you are at a higher risk for a heart attack. Studies that have looked at the use of magnesium supplementation to prevent a heart attack in people with known or suspected blockages haven’t consistently found a benefit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-5" data-gaid="inarticle-5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="DQK47HMYF5FPHDHZFILIYHRQAI"&gt;This is in contrast to statin trials, which have universally shown a reduction in heart attack rates in people with coronary blockages or those who are at a very high risk. Statins are effective at reducing risk for people with known blockages in their arteries, even if they have normal cholesterol levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-6" data-gaid="inarticle-6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="B4ZVP2R3PZARDLDH24GLOPPHME"&gt;Having a low cholesterol level reduces but does not eliminate the risk for blockages.

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IN A NUTSHELL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;🔬 &lt;strong&gt;Groundbreaking IVF technique&lt;/strong&gt; successfully delivers eight healthy babies in the UK, free from severe mitochondrial diseases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;🌟 The new method, called &lt;strong&gt;Mitochondrial Donation Treatment&lt;/strong&gt;, uses DNA from three sources to prevent the transmission of harmful mutations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;👶 Significant reduction in &lt;strong&gt;mutated mitochondrial DNA&lt;/strong&gt; observed, with all children healthy at birth and minimal health issues reported.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;💡 Despite its success, this procedure remains &lt;strong&gt;controversial&lt;/strong&gt; and unapproved in many countries, sparking ethical debates on genetic intervention.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recent advancements in in vitro fertilization (IVF) technology have once again brought hope and joy to families worldwide. In a remarkable achievement, United Kingdom doctors have successfully delivered eight healthy babies using an innovative DNA-enhanced IVF method. This groundbreaking technique, aimed at preventing the transmission of severe mitochondrial diseases, has proven effective in giving these children a disease-free start in life. The news not only marks a significant milestone in reproductive medicine but also raises intriguing ethical and scientific discussions about the future of genetic intervention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Understanding Mitochondrial Diseases&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mitochondria, often referred to as the &lt;strong&gt;powerhouses of the cell&lt;/strong&gt;, play a crucial role in energy production. Despite their small size, they contain a separate set of DNA, distinct from the nuclear DNA inherited from both parents. When mutations occur in mitochondrial DNA, it can lead to serious health issues. These mutations can severely affect energy supply to vital organs such as the heart, muscles, and brain, often resulting in developmental delays and a shortened lifespan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Globally, around &lt;strong&gt;one in 5,000 newborns&lt;/strong&gt; are affected by these debilitating conditions, experiencing symptoms like vision loss and muscle weakening. The recent breakthrough in IVF technology, known as Mitochondrial Donation Treatment (MDT), offers a promising solution. By utilizing healthy mitochondrial DNA from a donor, this technique aims to eliminate the risk of inheriting such diseases, providing a healthier future for those affected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="cM5cjTCL7P"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.rudebaguette.com/en/2025/07/its-like-teleporting-knowledge-this-breakthrough-optical-ai-chip-transfers-100-million-books-in-just-7-minutes-using-light-speed-data/"&gt;“It’s Like Teleporting Knowledge”: This Breakthrough Optical AI Chip Transfers 100 Million Books in Just 7 Minutes Using Light-Speed Data&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Innovative Three-source Strategy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new IVF technique, known as &lt;strong&gt;Pronuclear Transfer&lt;/strong&gt;, involves a revolutionary approach to conception. By combining DNA from three sources—the mother’s egg, the father’s sperm, and healthy mitochondrial DNA from a donor—this method ensures that the child inherits the vast majority of their traits from their biological parents. However, they also receive a small fraction (approximately 0.1%) of healthy mitochondrial DNA from the donor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This genetic alteration, while minute, is significant enough to prevent the transmission of mitochondrial diseases. The process involves transferring the nuclear DNA from an egg with a mitochondrial DNA mutation into a donor egg with its nucleus removed. The resulting embryo, which contains the parents’ nuclear DNA and the donor’s healthy mitochondrial DNA, is then implanted, leading to a successful pregnancy. This approach not only offers hope for affected families but also opens new doors in the field of genetic research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="zIWn6ShkUq"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.rudebaguette.com/en/2025/07/nvidia-helix-destroys-ai-lag-forever-ultra-powerful-system-instantly-transforms-stalled-chatbots-into-million-word-lightning-fast-assistants-for-us-businesses/"&gt;“NVIDIA Helix Destroys AI Lag Forever”: Ultra-Powerful System Instantly Transforms Stalled Chatbots Into Million-Word, Lightning-Fast Assistants for US Businesses&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Promising Results and Ongoing Challenges&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results of the study have been overwhelmingly positive, with a &lt;strong&gt;95-100% reduction in mutated mitochondrial DNA&lt;/strong&gt; observed in six of the babies. The remaining two showed a substantial reduction of 77-88%, well below the threshold for disease manifestation. All eight children were healthy at birth, with only minor, treatable health issues reported in a few cases. This success demonstrates the potential of the technique to transform lives, offering a disease-free future to children who might otherwise face severe health challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite its success, the procedure remains controversial and is not yet approved in many countries, including the US and France. Ethical objections include concerns about the destruction of human embryos and fears of the emergence of “designer babies.” These debates underscore the need for careful consideration of the ethical implications of genetic intervention, even as science continues to push boundaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="hpe0Pfyv7f"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.rudebaguette.com/en/2025/07/it-transforms-while-flying-engineers-create-shape-shifting-robot-that-morphs-mid-air-to-land-and-roll-on-wheels/"&gt;“It Transforms While Flying”: Engineers Create Shape-Shifting Robot That Morphs Mid-Air to Land and Roll on Wheels&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ethical Considerations and Future Prospects&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with any groundbreaking scientific advancement, the development of MDT has sparked ethical debates. Critics argue that altering the genetic makeup of embryos raises concerns about the potential for unintended consequences and the moral implications of such interventions. Supporters, however, emphasize the profound impact this technology can have on families affected by mitochondrial diseases, offering them a chance at a healthier future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The details of this procedure have been published in the New England Journal of Medicine, providing a comprehensive overview of the scientific and ethical considerations involved. As the technique continues to evolve, it will be crucial for the scientific community, policymakers, and the public to engage in open dialogues about the responsible use of genetic technologies. How will society balance the potential benefits of these advances with the ethical considerations they entail?&lt;/p&gt;

Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, a new study offers fresh insights into how structural brain connectivity patterns are linked to psychopathic traits and the externalizing behaviors that often accompany them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Published using data from the MPI Leipzig Mind-Brain–Body dataset, the research examined 82 young adults, employing advanced connectome-based predictive modeling to pinpoint the structural networks underlying psychopathy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings illuminate not just &lt;em&gt;where&lt;/em&gt; in the brain psychopathy may reside, but &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; its expression can lead to outwardly harmful behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, the study identifies two distinct neural pathways that appear to mediate the relationship between psychopathic traits and externalizing actions — opening up potential avenues for targeted interventions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Psychopathy and the Externalizing Spectrum&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Psychopathy occupies a unique place within the externalizing spectrum — a broad category of behavioral problems that includes aggression, substance abuse, impulsivity, and rule-breaking. People high in psychopathic traits often exhibit these behaviors more prominently than their peers, creating serious personal, social, and legal consequences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous studies have already pointed to abnormalities in brain functioning and connectivity in individuals with high psychopathic traits. Functional imaging research, for instance, has identified reduced activity in regions critical for emotion regulation, such as the amygdala and prefrontal cortex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, less is known about the &lt;em&gt;structural&lt;/em&gt; wiring of the brain in psychopathy — that is, the white matter pathways that physically connect distant brain regions and enable them to communicate effectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Network-Based Approach to Psychopathy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The current study takes a network-level perspective, reflecting a broader trend in neuroscience that views mental disorders not as localized “lesions” but as disruptions in the dynamic interactions between brain regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using structural connectome data derived from diffusion MRI, the researchers constructed a comprehensive map of each participant’s brain connectivity — a so-called &lt;em&gt;connectome&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They then applied a predictive modeling framework, systematically leaving out one participant at a time to validate their findings (a rigorous technique known as leave-one-out cross-validation).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their analysis revealed two sets of networks associated with psychopathy: one set of connections where greater integrity was positively related to psychopathic traits (the “positive network”) and another set where greater integrity was negatively related to psychopathy (the “negative network”).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Positive and Negative Networks: A Tale of Two Pathways&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;positive network&lt;/em&gt; involved structural connections among brain regions implicated in social-affective processing, language comprehension, and reward sensitivity. These regions include areas such as the orbitofrontal cortex, anterior insula, and subcortical reward circuitry — all of which are crucial for interpreting social cues, evaluating rewards and punishments, and making moral decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Higher connectivity in these areas in psychopathic individuals may paradoxically support their superficial charm, manipulativeness, and reward-driven behavior, despite their emotional deficits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conversely, the &lt;em&gt;negative network&lt;/em&gt; encompassed connections between regions involved in attentional control and modulation, such as the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and parietal attention systems. Reduced structural connectivity here may underlie the poor impulse control and inability to inhibit inappropriate behaviors that are hallmarks of psychopathy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, these two opposing networks illustrate the complexity of psychopathy as a disorder that combines emotional detachment with impulsive, often destructive behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Two Neural Pathways Linking Psychopathy to Behavior&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crucially, the study didn’t stop at identifying networks — it also investigated how these networks might mediate the relationship between psychopathic traits and externalizing behaviors. Through mediation analyses, the researchers identified two distinct pathways:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Emotional Processing Pathway:&lt;/strong&gt; Involving the positive network, this pathway connects psychopathic traits to externalizing behaviors through dysfunctions in social-affective and reward-related processing. Individuals high in psychopathy may fail to feel guilt or empathy and remain highly motivated by immediate rewards, making them more prone to antisocial actions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attention Modulation Pathway:&lt;/strong&gt; Involving the negative network, this pathway links psychopathy to externalizing behaviors through impaired attentional control. Difficulty shifting attention away from rewarding stimuli or suppressing inappropriate impulses may exacerbate risk-taking and aggressive behavior.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings elegantly map onto clinical observations of psychopathy: the chilling emotional coldness coupled with rash, reckless actions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Implications for Intervention and Future Research&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;By uncovering the distinct neural pathways that bridge psychopathy and externalizing behavior, this research opens potential new avenues for intervention. Therapies that target attentional control — such as mindfulness training or cognitive remediation — may be particularly helpful for addressing impulsive behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, interventions that aim to enhance social-affective understanding, such as empathy training or moral reasoning exercises, may help reduce the more callous aspects of psychopathy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, these findings highlight the importance of viewing psychopathy as a disorder of network dysfunction rather than a single brain region. This perspective aligns with contemporary models of mental illness that emphasize the brain’s connectivity and systems-level organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future studies will need to explore whether these structural abnormalities are present early in development, perhaps even before behavioral symptoms fully emerge. Longitudinal research could determine whether interventions aimed at strengthening specific networks could mitigate the emergence or severity of psychopathy and its associated behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A More Nuanced View of Psychopathy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Psychopathy has often been portrayed in starkly negative or sensationalized terms, but findings like these offer a more nuanced view. They remind us that even the most troubling behaviors may have roots in the intricate workings of the brain’s wiring, shaped by genetic and environmental factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding these neural underpinnings not only advances science but also holds the potential to inform more compassionate and effective approaches to prevention and treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we continue to map the brain’s networks and unravel how they give rise to behavior, studies like this one bring us closer to decoding the enigma of psychopathy — and, in turn, to finding ways to help those whose lives are touched by it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this psychopathy and neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://neurosciencenews.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Neuroscience News Communications&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://neurosciencenews.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Neuroscience News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Neuroscience News Communications – Neuroscience News&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/ejn.70158" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;The Role of Structural Brain Networks in Psychopathy and Its Relation to Externalizing Behaviors&lt;/a&gt;” by Peiyang Guo et al. &lt;em&gt;European Journal of Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Role of Structural Brain Networks in Psychopathy and Its Relation to Externalizing Behaviors&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Externalizing behaviors are particularly pronounced in the context of psychopathy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recent neurobiological models suggest that psychopathy may be associated with abnormalities in brain network connectivity, which could contribute to its development and its links to externalizing behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the specific structural networks contributing to psychopathy and its relation to externalizing behaviors remain poorly understood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this study, we investigated the structural connectivity associated with psychopathy and its relation to externalizing behaviors in 82 young adults from the MPI Leipzig Mind-Brain–Body dataset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A structural connectome–based prediction model with leave-one-out cross-validation identified both positive and negative networks associated with psychopathy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specifically, the positive network involved regions related to social-affective processing, language, and reward systems, while the negative network was associated with regions involved in attention modulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, mediation analyses revealed two potential neural pathways from psychopathic traits to externalizing behaviors via emotional processing and attention modulation networks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings suggest that alterations in structural connectivity play a significant role in psychopathy and may underlie the externalizing behaviors observed in individuals with the disorder.&lt;/p&gt;

odds ratio, 2.71; &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = .005).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the two groups were further subdivided into two groups each — those with and without SIBO — significant further variations of microbial diversity were observed between those with and without HT, Mathur told &lt;em&gt;Medscape Medical News&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Interestingly, we saw the small bowel microbiome was not only different in SIBO-positive patients, including higher gram negatives, which is to be expected, but that the presence or absence of hypothyroidism itself was associated with specific patterns of these gram-negative bacteria,” she explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In addition, when we looked at hypothyroidism without SIBO present, there were also changes between groups, such as higher &lt;em&gt;Neisseria &lt;/em&gt;in the hypothyroid group.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“All these findings are novel as this is the first paper to look specifically at the small bowel,” she added, noting that previous smaller studies have focused more on evaluation of stool samples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We believe the small bowel is the most metabolically active area of the intestine and plays an important role in metabolism,” Mathur noted. “Thus, the microbial changes here are likely more physiologically significant than the patterns seen in stool.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Further Findings from a Large Population&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a separate analysis, the team evaluated data from the TriNetX database on the 10-year incidence of developing SIBO among 1.1 million subjects with hypothyroidism in the US compared with 1 million controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found that people with hypothyroidism were approximately twice as likely to develop SIBO compared with those without hypothyroidism (relative risk [RR], 2.20).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, those with HT, in particular, had an even higher risk, at 2.4 times the controls (RR, 2.40).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Treatment with levothyroxine decreased the risk of developing SIBO in hypothyroidism (RR, 0.33) and HT (RR, 0.78) vs those who did not receive treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mechanisms?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the fact that differences in SIBO were observed even between people who were treated for HT and those without the condition in the first analysis, and hence had similar TSH levels, was notable, Mathur.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This suggests that perhaps there are other factors aside from TSH levels and free T4 that are at play here,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Some people have theorized that perhaps delayed gut motility in hypothyroidism promotes the development of SIBO; however, there are many other factors within this complex interplay between the microbiome and the thyroid that could also be playing a role.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For example, SIBO leads to inflammation and weakening of the gut barrier,” Mathur explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, “levothyroxine absorption and cycling of the thyroid hormone occurs predominantly in the small bowel, [while the] microbiome plays a key role in the absorption of iron, selenium, iodine, and zinc, which are critical for thyroid function.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, “further research is needed to understand how the mechanisms are affected during the development of SIBO and hypothyroidism,” Mathur said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Assessment of Changes Over Time Anticipated&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Commenting on the research, Gregory A. Brent, MD, senior executive academic vice-chair of the Department of Medicine and professor of medicine and physiology at the David Geffen School of Medicine at University of California Los Angeles said the study is indeed novel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This, to my knowledge, is the first investigation to link characteristics of the small bowel microbiome with hypothyroidism,” Brent told &lt;em&gt;Medscape Medical News&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While any clinical significance has yet to be determined, “the association of these small bowel microbiome changes with hypothyroidism may have implications for contributing to the onset of autoimmune hypothyroidism in susceptible populations as well as influences on levothyroxine absorption in hypothyroid patients on levothyroxine therapy,” Brent said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the SIBO differences observed even among treated patients with vs without HT, “it seems less likely that the microbiome changes are the result of reduced thyroid hormone signaling,” Brent noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, a key piece of the puzzle will be to observe the microbiome changes over time, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These studies were at a single time point [and] longitudinal studies will be especially important to see how the association changes over time and are influenced by the treatment of hypothyroidism and of SIBO,” Brent said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The authors and Brent had no disclosures to report.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Medscape</author><pubDate>Tue, 22 Jul 2025 12:27:53 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMioAFBVV95cUxNcll1VUo5TWFJQUY4T0tfU2EtT1JxZ01IWU9UVExhS245TzIwSGFxVmZlbkdydnhwcldidXRXVEVxV3Q4RkY2R1RfU2toV1M4SUgxNlU4dzlKZm5PdmkwdEJJLWl3RnVyay02N2tpZk0yYTMzbzI5ZFlobHd4YW5FZlZoM1FFWGZkSUs4blFfRlNoWU54NlpmVFRQOTdIRW1Z</guid></item></channel></rss>
