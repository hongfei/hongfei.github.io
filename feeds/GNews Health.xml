    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Detailing his top five health hacks for helping to slow down aging in his brain and hopefully reduce his risk of dementia, Bain-Kim, who founded the start-up Lifeforce, told &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/longevity-startup-founder-habits-to-protect-brain-aging-alzheimers-2025-9"&gt;Business Insider&lt;/a&gt; he relies on specific diets and workouts, as well as supplements and sound sleep. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Regular exercise boosts blood flow to the brain to help clear out substances that could cause dementia, and quality sleep can also help the brain clear out potentially harmful deposits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And research has shown that certain diets or lifestyle habits can also boost brain health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;Below, Daily Mail details the longevity expert's top tips:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;CREATINE SUPPLEMENTS &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Creatine, long popular with bodybuilders, is now attracting fans looking to boost their cognition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The supplement is made from three amino acids, glycine, arginine and methionine,  and provides extra fuel to boost muscle growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But studies suggest that this extra fuel could also be used by the brain, with the energy potentially helping to fend off cognitive decline and protect against stress caused by sleep deprivation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40395689/"&gt;2025 study&lt;/a&gt; found dementia patients who took 20 grams of creatine a day for eight weeks had a slight increase in cognitive function compared to those who did not take the supplement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Bain-Kim believes that people already take far too many supplements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But amid its potential brain health effects, he said he added this supplement to his daily routine because he felt it might help to lower his risk of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Creatine is widely available in powder and pill forms, with users advised to take around three to five grams per day. One serving costs as little as 30 cents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The FDA does not regulate creatine supplements, and experts urge people to buy the supplement from a reputable source to reduce the risk of it also containing impurities or ingredients that could be harmful to you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In previous cases, some creatine supplements have been&lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://goliathlabs.com/blogs/articles/does-creatine-have-lead?srsltid=AfmBOoon6xbI3QoKZnvT83tXUZJvLhETvj85ggEQbljcBUpxv-ib4gRu"&gt; found to contain&lt;/a&gt; trace amounts of lead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And people with kidney disease, affecting about 37million Americans, are advised to consult with their doctor before taking the supplement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above is a stock image of Ozempic. Bain-Kim says he microdoses on the drug to boost his brain health and longevity&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;MICRODOSING OZEMPIC&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Losing weight while on Ozempic and similar drugs can boost heart health and slash the risk of chronic diseases like type 2 diabetes and cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But some studies have also suggested that taking the drugs could help to slow cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2836412?utm_source=chatgpt.com"&gt;Studies show&lt;/a&gt; that patients who take liraglutide and semaglutide, the active ingredients in Mounjaro and Ozempic, have a lower risk of dementia compared to those not on the drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There is also some evidence that it may slow down brain shrinkage, a normal part of aging that begins around age 40 to 50 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Bain-Kim said he started to take a GLP-1 medication after hearing about this potential benefit, and he now microdoses one of the weight loss drugs, though he did not specify which one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Microdosing is when someone takes a very small amount of a drug in order to benefit from its effects while minimizing any risks or side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is not clear whether the benefit is linked to improvements caused by weight loss or to the drugs themselves, but experts say that maintaining a healthy weight can help to reduce someone's risk of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;MORE LIGHT CARDIO&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group artSplitter"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Experts say that more time spent exercising can help to flush substances out of the brain that may raise the risk of suffering from dementia (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Research has overwhelmingly shown that exercising can help to reduce the risk of dementia by boosting blood flow to the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But some experts now say that doing more Zone 2 cardio exercises, such as running at a pace where you can maintain a conversation, can be more beneficial than pushing yourself to your maximum capacity in every workout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is possible that focusing on Zone 2 cardio can lead to people exercising for longer periods, boosting blood flow to the brain over a longer time period, which can help to flush out substances that could cause dementia and boost brain health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Bain-Kim still lifts weights but said he recently doubled down on the lighter cardio, such as light jogging or biking, to improve his brain health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He does two sessions of light cardio every week, he said, and plays competitive pickleball regularly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Zone 2 cardio is equivalent to exercising at about 60 to 70 percent of your maximum heart rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Maximum heart rate is calculated by subtracting your age from the number 220. This means that a 30-year-old has a maximum heart rate of 190 beats per minute and a Zone 2 heart rate of around 113 to 132 beats per minute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;FOLLOW THE 'MIND' DIET&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts have touted the Mediterranean diet as a way to boost cognitive health for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But Bain-Kim says he recently switched to the Mediterranean-Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay diet, or the MIND diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;MIND is an eating plan developed by Harvard researchers to slow cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some research has suggested it can slow decline, including a &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4581900/"&gt;2015 study&lt;/a&gt; on 1,000 adults that showed slower cognitive decline among those on the diet compared to those not on the diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But a &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2302368"&gt;2023 study&lt;/a&gt; on the diet that tracked 2,000 cognitively unimpaired people for three years found no significant differences in cognitive function or brain size between those on and not on the diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The MIND diet emphasizes fibers and healthy fats such as omega-3s that can support brain health by helping the brain form and maintain cell membranes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The diet consists of at least six servings of leafy greens, at least five servings of nuts, at least four of beans, two or more servings of berries and one serving of fatty fish such as salmon, mackerel or sardines per week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Those on the diet also use olive oil as their primary cooking oil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts say this diet may reduce the risk of dementia by cutting inflammation levels and improving the health of blood vessels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;MORE QUALITY SLEEP&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Sleep is also being touted as a way to prevent dementia, with experts saying it can also remove potentially dangerous toxins from the brain (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sleep has recently become the cornerstone of every 'longevity athlete's' fitness plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And Bain-Kim is no exception, saying that for peak health and performance he tries to sleep about seven hours and 45 minutes every night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This tracks with the CDC's recommendation, which states everyone needs between seven and nine hours every night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Everyone appreciates a good night's sleep, but for me that's now core to my strategy because of the brain protection benefits of getting enough sleep,' he told Business Insider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It's become the non-negotiable for me.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts suggest sleep can help ward off dementia by allowing the brain to clear harmful proteins, such as beta-amyloid, which build up in the organ during waking hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://theconversation.com/poor-sleep-may-nudge-the-brain-toward-dementia-researchers-find-265216"&gt;study found this month&lt;/a&gt; that people suffering from chronic insomnia, or struggling to sleep, were twice as likely to develop dementia as healthy adults who slept normally. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

                                        &lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (AP) — Infection rates from drug-resistant “nightmare bacteria” rose almost 70% between 2019 and 2023, according to a new &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/ANNALS-25-02404" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention scientists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bacteria that are difficult to treat due to the so-called NDM gene primarily drove the increase, CDC researchers wrote in &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://doi.org/10.7326/ANNALS-25-02404" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;an article published Monday&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in the Annals of Internal Medicine. Only two antibiotics work against those infections, and the drugs are expensive and must be administered through an IV, researchers said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bacteria with the gene were once considered exotic, linked to a small number of patients who received medical care overseas. Though the numbers are still small, the rate of U.S. cases jumped more than fivefold in recent years, the researchers reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The rise of NDMs in the U.S. is a grave danger and very worrisome,” said David Weiss, an Emory University infectious diseases researcher, in an email.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;It’s likely many people are unrecognized carriers of the drug-resistant bacteria, which could lead to community spread, the CDC scientists said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That may play out in doctors’ offices across the country, as infections long considered routine and easy to treat — like urinary tract infections — could become chronic problems, said Dr. Maroya Walters, one of the report’s authors.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Antimicrobial resistance occurs when germs such as bacteria and fungi gain the power to fight off the drugs designed to kill them. The misuse of antibiotics was a big reason for the rise — unfinished or unnecessary prescriptions that didn’t kill the germs made them stronger.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;In recent years, the CDC has drawn attention to “ &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/afcee30eb24848d38f9b855fbcc9a4ba"&gt;nightmare bacteria&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ” resistant to a wide range of antibiotics. That includes carbapenems, a class of antibiotics considered a last resort for treatment of serious infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers drew data from 29 states that do the necessary testing and reporting of carbapenem-resistant bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;They counted 4,341 cases of carbapenem-resistant bacterial infections from those states in 2023, with 1,831 of them the NDM variety. The researchers did not say how many of the infected people died.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rate of carbapenem-resistant infections rose from just under 2 per 100,000 people in 2019 to more than 3 per 100,000 in 2023 — an increase of 69%. But the rate of NDM cases rose from around 0.25 to about 1.35 — an increase of 460%, the authors said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A researcher not involved in the study said the increase is probably related to the &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/covid-19-pandemic"&gt;COVID-19 pandemic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We know that there was a huge surge in antibiotic use during the pandemic, so this likely is reflected in increasing drug resistance,” said Dr. Jason Burnham, a Washington University researcher, in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC’s count is only a partial picture. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many states are not fully testing and reporting cases. Even in states that do, cases tend to be among hospital patients sick enough to warrant special testing. Many hospitals also aren’t able to do the testing needed to detect certain forms of genetic resistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC researchers did not have data from some of the most populous states, including California, Florida, New York and Texas, which means the absolute number of U.S. infections “is definitely underestimated,” Burnham said.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;This is not the first study to report a rise. A CDC &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7423a2.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; published in June noted an increase in NDM cases in New York City between 2019 and 2024. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;___&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="optimizelyHubpeekId" class="optimizelyHubpeekClass"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

They found that millennials — born between 1981 and 1996 — appear to be aging biologically faster than previous generations, based on biomarkers in blood that indicate the health of various organs. That acceleration was associated with a significantly increased risk — up to 42 percent — for certain cancers, especially those of the lung, gastrointestinal tract and uterus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="4NBOJB3KZ5CCPLZUPDG3XKRWNQ" data-contentid="4NBOJB3KZ5CCPLZUPDG3XKRWNQ" class="wpds-c-foYyTm wpds-c-foYyTm-idwISdm-css"&gt;Much of the work in this area is in its early stages and has not proved a direct cause and effect in humans. The evidence comes from epidemiological studies, which look at patterns of disease in large populations; observational studies, which track people’s behaviors and exposures without intervening; and animal models which are sometimes, but not always, good proxies for people.

Chagas disease has been found in pets like cats and dogs, as well zoo and wild animals in 17 states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Human cases have been confirmed in eight states: Texas, California, Arizona, Tennessee, Louisiana, Missouri, Mississippi and Arkansas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, experts point out that because the disease is not well known and doctors aren’t looking for it, cases are likely significantly higher.

There are also a probable 10 additional cases and deaths, the WHO says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On 4 September, the DRC’s Ministry of Health confirmed that the outbreak was caused by the &lt;i&gt;Zaire ebolavirus&lt;/i&gt;, the most dangerous and common of Ebola virus strains, which was also responsible for the 2014–16 outbreak in West Africa. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The WHO has issued a call for US$21 million to support the response of the DRC’s government. The agency says that priorities are sending health workers to affected communities, identifying cases as early as possible, increasing community engagement, providing treatment and reducing transmission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A viral leap&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the precise source of the outbreak is not known, researchers say that it probably arose from a spillover event, in which the virus transfers from an infected animal, such as a bat, to humans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s not identical to previous strains that have been identified, which strongly suggests that it’s a new spillover event,” says epidemiologist Peter Horby of the Pandemic Sciences Institute at the University of Oxford, UK. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The outbreak is currently confined to four regions of Kasai province: Bulape, Mweka, Mushenge and Kakenge. These areas are remote and isolated, making it challenging for responders to reach them, Horby says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think the big problem is that the patients — because it’s an isolated area and it’s very rural — are presenting very late, with quite advanced disease and have very restricted health-care systems, so the mortality rate is very high,” he adds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although this makes tackling the outbreak difficult, “the remoteness may shield the outbreak [from] other settings”, says Henry Kyobe Bosa, who leads the Ebola and COVID-19 response for Uganda’s Ministry of Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Credit: Shutterstock&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new model of vascular dementia reveals hidden disease processes and raises urgent questions about the role of microplastics in brain health.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vascular dementia, a form of cognitive decline caused by disease in the brain’s small blood vessels, is common but has been studied less intensively than &lt;span class="glossaryLink" aria-describedby="tt" data-cmtooltip="cmtt_44d955d660610a76fe199b3479668107" data-gt-translate-attributes='[{"attribute":"data-cmtooltip", "format":"html"}]' tabindex="0" role="link"&gt;Alzheimer’s&lt;/span&gt; disease, which is marked by abnormal plaques and protein tangles in neural tissue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A University of New Mexico researcher aims to change that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a recent paper highlighted by the editors of the &lt;em&gt;American Journal of Pathology&lt;/em&gt;, Elaine Bearer, MD, PhD, the Harvey Family Endowed and Distinguished Professor in the UNM School of Medicine’s Department of Pathology, introduces a framework to define and classify different types of vascular dementia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She hopes the approach will help researchers better understand the disease’s variants and speed the development of effective treatments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Multiple Risk Factors and New Concerns&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conditions like hypertension, atherosclerosis and diabetes have been linked to vascular dementia, but other contributing causes, including &lt;a href="https://hscnews.unm.edu/news/unm-scientist-devises-new-way-to-identify-microplastics-in-brain-tissue-from-dementia-patients" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;the recent discovery of significant quantities of nano– and microplastics in human brains&lt;/a&gt;, remain poorly understood, Bearer said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We have been flying blind,” she said. “The various vascular pathologies have not been comprehensively defined, so we haven’t known what we’re treating. And we didn’t know that nano– and microplastics were in the picture, because we couldn’t see them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bearer identified 10 different disease processes that contribute to vascular-based brain injury, typically by causing oxygen or nutrient deficiency, leakage of blood serum, and inflammation or decreased waste elimination. These cause tiny strokes that harm neurons. She lists new and existing experimental techniques, including special stains and novel microscopy, to detect them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the paper, Bearer used a specialized microscope to meticulously study tissue from a repository of brains donated by the families of New Mexicans who had died with dementia, employing stains that highlighted the damaged blood vessels. Surprisingly, many patients diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease also had disease in the small blood vessels of the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We suspect that in New Mexico maybe a half of our Alzheimer’s people also have vascular disease,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Toward Better Diagnosis and Treatment&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bearer contends a methodical approach to identifying different forms of vascular dementia will help neurologists and neuropathologists more accurately score the severity of the disease in both living and deceased patients and advance the search for potential treatments — and even cures. To make that happen, the &lt;span class="glossaryLink" aria-describedby="tt" data-cmtooltip="cmtt_8b74678badcaea2726bdd807c7d5f988" data-gt-translate-attributes='[{"attribute":"data-cmtooltip", "format":"html"}]' tabindex="0" role="link"&gt;National Institutes of Health&lt;/span&gt; (NIH) has raised the possibility of forming a consensus group of leading neuropathologists to work out a new classification and scoring system, she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, a fresh area of concern is the unknown health consequences of nano– and microplastics in the brain, Bearer said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Nanoplastics in the brain represent a new player on the field of brain pathology,” she said. “All our current thinking about Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias needs to be revised in light of this discovery.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What I’m finding is that there’s a lot more plastics in demented people than in normal subjects,” she said. “It seems to correlate with the degree and type of dementia.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The quantity of plastics also was associated with higher levels of inflammation, she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bearer’s work builds on years of collaboration with Gary Rosenberg, MD, professor of Neurology and director of the UNM Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (ADRC), which &lt;a href="https://hscnews.unm.edu/news/hsc-newsroom-post-alzheimers-research-grant" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;won a five-year $21.7 million NIH grant&lt;/a&gt; in 2024 that supported Bearer’s research. Rosenberg, a longtime chair of the UNM Department of Neurology and also director of the UNM Center for Memory &amp;amp; Aging, has published extensively on the association of vascular disease with dementia symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When we started thinking about putting this ADRC together, I thought one of the things I should look at is the vasculature, because nobody’s done it systematically and comprehensively, and we have a world’s expert here at UNM,” Bearer said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Describing the pathological changes in this comprehensive way is really new. What I’m hoping will come out of this paper is working with other neuropathology ADRC cores across the country to develop consensus guidelines for classifying vascular changes and the impact of nano– and microplastics on the brain.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Create a creamy on-the-go snack by combining protein-packed cottage cheese with sweet chopped peaches. When peaches are out of season, opt for frozen or experiment with an alternative such as chopped strawberries or orange segments. Elevate the flavor profile by adding a hint of vanilla extract or cinnamon to the cottage cheese. For those with a sweet tooth, a drizzle of honey or maple syrup is the perfect finishing touch.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; With a focus on fiber-rich beans, vegetables and healthy fats, this creamy bean dip is suitable for those following the Mediterranean diet. Tangy sun-dried tomatoes add a pop of acidity and make this dip reminiscent of Marry Me Chicken. We use carrots, peppers, radishes and snap peas for dunking, but you can use your favorite crunchy veggies.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Soy milk and Greek-style yogurt provide a solid protein base for this chocolate-strawberry protein shake.

Tossing in a few ice cubes chills the shake down and gives it a refreshing, frosty texture.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; These pumpkin pie spice energy balls are everything you could want in a snack: classic pumpkin spice flavor with a satisfyingly chewy texture with bits of crunch from seeds and nuts throughout. It’s worth seeking out cashew or almond butter to make these—they have a more neutral flavor that lets the spices and pumpkin shine, but any nut butter will work.

Chunky peanut butter adds a bit of crunch for extra texture, but smooth peanut butter blends in beautifully if you prefer a silkier bite.

Paying attention to subtle changes and acting promptly is the best defence against colon cancer,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;'Subtle' warning signs of bowel cancer are 'often overlooked', Dr Jack Ogden (pictured), a GP at The Lagom Clinic in Bristol, told the Daily Mail &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dame Deborah James, nicknamed the 'bowel babe' raised more than £11.3mn for Cancer Research and is credited for increasing awareness of the disease, which killed her in 2022 aged 40&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The first, commonly overlooked sign is iron deficiency anemia, which can present as 'unexplained fatigue, pale skin or shortness of breath', Dr Ogden said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Anemia is a condition when the body doesn't have enough red blood cells to pump oxygen around the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It can also cause symptoms like chest pain, heart palpitations, headaches and dizziness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is because tumours can bleed, causing iron loss and cause inflammation that produces a protein which interferes with iron absorption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Equally, constipation, diarrhoea, or suddenly noticing narrower stools with no clear cause, is another key easy-to-dismiss subtle bowel cancer sign, he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Pencil-thin stools can be an indicator that a tumour is obstructing the colon causing it to squeeze stool into a thinner shape, Dr Ogden added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, losing weight without changing diet or exercising more is the third pain free sign, that may indicate the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Worryingly, he said it doesn't have to be sudden—it can also be subtle or gradual.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Often this weight loss can be caused by increased metabolic demand, loss of appetite and tumours preventing the absorption of nutrients. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Bloating and abdominal discomfort, equally, is the fourth 'subtle' sign of the cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This may present itself as 'persistent cramping' or feel full quickly after eating, Dr Ogden said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The fifth sign, he warned, was blood in the stool—which isn't always necessarily as obvious as it may seem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The blood can be dark or hidden and only detectable via stool tests, Dr Ogden said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If stools are dark red or black it can be a sign bleeding is taking place higher up in the bowel due to cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In contrast, bright red blood is most commonly caused by haemorrhoids, also known as piles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the NHS, anyone experiencing these symptoms for three weeks or more is advised to speak to their GP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;James Van Der Beek, who lives in Texas , revealed in November that he had been diagnosed with colorectal cancer in August 2023, aged just 46&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Bowel cancer symptoms can also be caused by other conditions like irritable bowel syndrome, but it's important to get checked so the disease can be spotted as early as possible. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Although the vast majority of bowel cancer diagnoses affect those aged over 50, rates in older age-groups has either declined or held stable while diagnoses in younger adults have risen by 50 per cent over the last 30 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Cancer Research UK estimates that over half (54 per cent) of bowel cancer cases in the UK are preventable. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors have suggested obesity, antibiotic over-use, mobile phone radiation and even invisible particles of plastic in drinking water are potential triggers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A recent global review found rates of colorectal cancer—also known as bowel cancer —in under-50s are climbing in 27 out of 50 countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;England has one of the steepest increases, with cases in younger adults rising by an average of 3.6 per cent a year, while in the US, the rate is going up by around two per cent annually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;When we sleep, the body releases its '&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_hormone"&gt;growth hormone&lt;/a&gt;', building up and repairing muscles and bones – but the details of how and why have been something of a mystery, until now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through a close analysis of brain circuitry in mice, researchers led by a team from the University of California, Berkeley (UC Berkeley) have found special mechanisms and feedback loops that regulate growth hormone release &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/just-one-night-of-poor-sleep-can-change-how-your-brain-sees-food"&gt;while we sleep&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings could help us better treat conditions that come with sleep problems, including type 2  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="174439" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/delayed-rem-sleep-may-be-an-early-signal-of-alzheimers-study-finds"&gt;Alzheimer's disease&lt;/a&gt;. Understanding sleep is the key to understanding a whole host of aspects of our health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/better-sleep-could-help-your-brain-flush-out-dementia-linked-toxins"&gt;Better Sleep Could Help Your Brain Flush Out Dementia-Linked Toxins&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"People know that growth hormone release is tightly related to sleep, but only through drawing blood and checking growth hormone levels during sleep," &lt;a href="https://news.berkeley.edu/2025/09/08/sleep-strengthens-muscle-and-bone-by-boosting-growth-hormone-levels-uc-berkeley-researchers-discover-how/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; neuroscientist Xinlu Ding, from UC Berkeley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're actually directly recording neural activity in mice to see what's going on. We are providing a basic circuit to work on in the future to develop different treatments."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_174442" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-174442" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/MouseSleep.jpg" alt="Mouse experiments diagram" class="wp-image-174442 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/MouseSleep.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/MouseSleep-415x415.jpg 415w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/MouseSleep-600x600.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-174442" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers analyzed the release of growth hormone in mice during sleep/wake cycles. (Ding et al., &lt;em&gt;Cell&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;That directly recorded neural activity, logged during multiple sleep-wake cycles in mice, revealed that growth hormone was released in different ways during &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_eye_movement_sleep"&gt;REM (rapid eye movement) sleep&lt;/a&gt; and non-REM sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While growth hormone was increased in both phases, the neurons promoting and inhibiting its production shifted in terms of their influence. There was also a feedback loop involving neurons in the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locus_coeruleus"&gt;locus coeruleus&lt;/a&gt;, a part of the brain linked to wakefulness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This suggests that sleep and growth hormone form a tightly balanced system," &lt;a href="https://news.berkeley.edu/2025/09/08/sleep-strengthens-muscle-and-bone-by-boosting-growth-hormone-levels-uc-berkeley-researchers-discover-how/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; neuroscientist Daniel Silverman. "Too little sleep reduces growth hormone release, and too much growth hormone can in turn push the brain toward wakefulness."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Sleep drives growth hormone release, and growth hormone feeds back to regulate wakefulness, and this balance is essential for growth, repair, and metabolic health."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides its main job – promoting growth – growth hormone manages how glucose and fat are processed in the body. Without the right amount of the hormone, through a lack of sleep, the risk of obesity, diabetes, and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-heart-is-vulnerable-these-4-things-will-help-you-protect-it"&gt;cardiovascular disease&lt;/a&gt; can increase. That adds to the number of ways that the new discoveries could be linked to good health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's more, the locus coeruleus also plays a part in managing how alert the brain is while we're awake. It's possible that the mechanisms revealed here are affecting cognition &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/where-does-brain-fog-come-from-new-evidence-could-solve-the-mystery"&gt;during the day&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lot more research is needed to determine all this for sure, and while there's good reason to believe that human brains and mice brains operate in the same way in these areas, it still needs to be proven. Ultimately though, new treatments for poor sleep could follow, which is something so many of us &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/these-4-simple-exercises-could-help-break-your-insomnia"&gt;struggle with&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Understanding the neural circuit for growth hormone release could eventually point toward new hormonal therapies to improve sleep quality or restore normal growth hormone balance," &lt;a href="https://news.berkeley.edu/2025/09/08/sleep-strengthens-muscle-and-bone-by-boosting-growth-hormone-levels-uc-berkeley-researchers-discover-how/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Silverman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are some experimental gene therapies where you target a specific cell type. This circuit could be a novel handle to try to dial back the excitability of the locus coeruleus, which hasn't been talked about before."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2025.05.039"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cell&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;h1 itemprop="headline"&gt;Bat Found In Local Residence Tests Positive For Rabies&lt;/h1&gt;
                    
                        &lt;h6&gt;By Craig Manning
                             | 
                                Sept. 23, 2025&lt;/h6&gt;
                    
                    &lt;span itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Grand Traverse County Health Department (GTCHD) announced on Monday that a bat recently found inside a local residence had tested positive for rabies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Michigan Department of Health and Human Services had tested the bat for rabies “after possible human exposure.” Per a GTCHD press release, “all individuals identified as exposed” are now receiving “the necessary post-exposure medical care.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spread through bites or scratches from infected animals, rabies is a virus that &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/about/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;the CDC describes&lt;/a&gt; as “deadly if people don’t receive medical care before symptoms start.” However, because the rabies virus needs to travel all the way to the brain before symptoms emerge, the virus has a lengthy incubation period during which it can be prevented. The CDC website notes that roughly 100,000 Americans are vaccinated against the virus each year, following potential or confirmed exposures. Comparatively, fewer than 10 deaths from the virus are reported each year in the United States, thanks to vaccination and prompt medical response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To avoid rabies exposure, GTCHD recommends avoiding contact with wild animals, particularly those with higher likelihood of carrying the rabies virus, including bats, raccoons, skunks, and foxes. Other recommendations include keeping pets vaccinated against the virus, sealing openings in the home that might allow bats to gain entry, and never handling bats or other wild animals with bare hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In situations where people do find bats in their home, they are urged not to release the animal back into the wild, but to “safely contain the bat without directly handling it in any way and contact GTCHD at 231-995-6051 to discuss testing and possible exposure.” Those who believe they have been bitten or scratched by an animal, or who have had any contact with a bat, should seek medical attention as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the GTCHD press release, this bat is the 33rd in Michigan to have tested positive for rabies this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

							&lt;p data-start="88" data-end="216"&gt;I’ve noticed a funny pattern among people (myself included): certain tiny, non-negotiable rituals reveal a lot about who we are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="218" data-end="261"&gt;Case in point? The die-hard night showerer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="263" data-end="567"&gt;If you absolutely must rinse off before your head hits the pillow—no matter how busy, tired, or late it is—there’s a good chance the traits below will feel familiar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="263" data-end="567"&gt;Think of this as a mirror, not a verdict. Use it to understand yourself better, and maybe to smile at how delightfully consistent you are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="569" data-end="583"&gt;Let’s dive in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="585" data-end="611"&gt;1. You thrive on ritual&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="613" data-end="745"&gt;Do you get oddly calm the moment steam fills the bathroom and the day starts sliding off your shoulders? That’s the power of ritual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="747" data-end="1058"&gt;Night showerers often have a built-in “shutdown sequence.” It’s not just about getting clean; it’s the predictable cue that tells your brain, “We’re done here.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="747" data-end="1058"&gt;As &lt;a href="https://jamesclear.com/quotes/you-do-not-rise-to-the-level-of-your-goals-you-fall-to-the-level-of-your-systems"&gt;James Clear&lt;/a&gt; puts it, “You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1060" data-end="1235"&gt;Your shower is a system—reliable, repeatable, and stabilizing. Even if your day was chaos, this one habit stays the same, and that steadiness quietly supports everything else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="1237" data-end="1281"&gt;2. You genuinely care about sleep quality&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1283" data-end="1716"&gt;If you swear that you sleep better after a warm rinse, you’re not imagining it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1283" data-end="1716"&gt;A warm shower or bath an hour or two before bedtime can &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/search/research-news/3495/"&gt;help your body cool itself afterward&lt;/a&gt;—a signal that it’s time to sleep—leading to faster sleep onset and potentially better sleep efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1718" data-end="1875"&gt;The nightly shower says you don’t treat sleep like an afterthought. You protect it. You set it up. You respect that tomorrow’s focus begins the night before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="1877" data-end="1910"&gt;3. You’re highly sensory-aware&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1912" data-end="2163"&gt;Clean skin. Fresh pajamas. Cool sheets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1912" data-end="2163"&gt;For many night showerers, the textures and temperatures matter. You likely notice small bodily cues—residue from sunscreen, sweat from a commute, a hint of smoke from that restaurant—and want a reset before bed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2165" data-end="2319"&gt;That sensitivity isn’t “picky;” it’s data. You use it to make your environment work for you. And when your senses feel settled, your mind can settle, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="2321" data-end="2385"&gt;4. You’re big on boundaries (even if you don’t announce them)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2387" data-end="2706"&gt;I used to work as a financial analyst, and back then I brought the office home in my head—even after I stopped bringing home the laptop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2387" data-end="2706"&gt;Switching off was hard. When I started writing, I kept the habit of a firm evening shower. It’s my line in the sand: emails go silent, decisions can wait, and my time becomes my own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2708" data-end="2889"&gt;If you’re a nightly shower person, you probably do something similar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2708" data-end="2889"&gt;The shower is your door-closing moment—no drama, no speeches, just a quiet boundary that says, “Today is over.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="2891" data-end="2923"&gt;5. You’re a planner by nature&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2925" data-end="3160"&gt;Rituals make planning easier. Maybe you set out tomorrow’s clothes after drying off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2925" data-end="3160"&gt;Maybe you do your skincare, refill the water on your nightstand, and cue up an alarm. There’s a sequencing to your evening, and the shower anchors it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3162" data-end="3325"&gt;This doesn’t mean you’re rigid. It means you’re intentional. You know that small, consistent steps—wash, wind down, lights out—beat last-minute sprints every time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="3327" data-end="3364"&gt;6. You self-soothe in healthy ways&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3366" data-end="3593"&gt;Stress relief doesn’t need to look heroic. It can look like turning the water a degree warmer and letting your shoulders drop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3366" data-end="3593"&gt;The shower is a miniature sensory deprivation chamber: white noise, steady warmth, no notifications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3595" data-end="3817"&gt;I’ve had entire plot knots for articles untangle in those five minutes. The combo of solitude and sensory comfort is restorative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3595" data-end="3817"&gt;You’re not numbing out; you’re resetting your nervous system without burning hours or money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="3819" data-end="3903"&gt;7. You hold yourself to personal standards (and they’re yours, not anyone else’s)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3905" data-end="4121"&gt;Some people feel fine climbing into bed with the day’s dust. Others—maybe you—just can’t. It’s not about judgment; it’s about alignment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3905" data-end="4121"&gt;Your actions match your internal standards, and that builds quiet self-respect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4123" data-end="4403"&gt;Author &lt;a href="https://gretchenrubin.com/podcast/podcast-episode-little-happier-outer-order-contributes-to-inner-calm/"&gt;Gretchen Rubin&lt;/a&gt; says, “Outer order contributes to inner calm.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4123" data-end="4403"&gt;A nightly shower is “outer order” at its simplest. It’s a tidy, tactile way to say, “I take care of me.” That message compounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="4405" data-end="4439"&gt;8. You carve out micro-solitude&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4441" data-end="4674"&gt;If you’re a parent, caregiver, manager, or the go-to person in your group, uninterrupted minutes are rare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4441" data-end="4674"&gt;The shower is often the only guaranteed alone time you get all day. No one is asking for snacks, numbers, or answers in there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4676" data-end="4955"&gt;This micro-solitude is more than a break. It’s a brief return to yourself—thinking your own thoughts, processing your own feelings, catching up with your own mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4676" data-end="4955"&gt;People who always shower at night understand the value of those tiny pockets of privacy and guard them accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="4957" data-end="5013"&gt;9. You’re consistent because it’s part of who you are&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5015" data-end="5224"&gt;Here’s what I see with clients and readers who are steadfast night showerers: the habit isn’t powered by willpower anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5015" data-end="5224"&gt;It’s identity. You’re “the kind of person who wraps the day with a rinse,” full stop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5226" data-end="5494"&gt;Identity-based habits are durable. When life gets messy, you still do the thing—not because someone told you to, not because an app reminded you, but because it’s who you are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5226" data-end="5494"&gt;That consistency leaks into other areas: you follow through, you keep promises, you show up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="5501" data-end="5549"&gt;A few everyday payoffs you probably recognize&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul data-start="5551" data-end="5973"&gt;
&lt;li data-start="5551" data-end="5679"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5553" data-end="5679"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="5553" data-end="5573"&gt;Better mornings.&lt;/strong&gt; There’s less rushing because you’ve already handled hygiene and prep. You start cleaner, lighter, calmer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-start="5680" data-end="5840"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5682" data-end="5840"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="5682" data-end="5708"&gt;Fewer friction points.&lt;/strong&gt; No debating whether to shower before coffee, breakfast, or that early meeting. One less decision means more brain for what matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-start="5841" data-end="5973"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5843" data-end="5973"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="5843" data-end="5866"&gt;Improved self-talk.&lt;/strong&gt; It sounds small, but doing what you said you’d do—every single night—nudges you toward “I can rely on me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="5975" data-end="6000"&gt;Common myths to ignore&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul data-start="6002" data-end="6493"&gt;
&lt;li data-start="6002" data-end="6162"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6004" data-end="6162"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="6004" data-end="6035"&gt;“Night showers waste time.”&lt;/strong&gt; Actually, they often save time by bundling wind-down, stress relief, and hygiene into one ritual—freeing up morning bandwidth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-start="6163" data-end="6320"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6165" data-end="6320"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="6165" data-end="6197"&gt;“It’s just a hygiene thing.”&lt;/strong&gt; Hygiene is part of it, sure, but the deeper value is psychological: boundary-setting, sensory regulation, and consistency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-start="6321" data-end="6493"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6323" data-end="6493"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="6323" data-end="6368"&gt;“Real discipline means morning routines.”&lt;/strong&gt; Real discipline means routines that work. For you. If your evening structure is what keeps the wheels on, that’s discipline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="6495" data-end="6544"&gt;How to make your night shower work even harder&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6546" data-end="6609"&gt;If you’re already committed, a few tiny tweaks can level it up:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul data-start="6611" data-end="7212"&gt;
&lt;li data-start="6611" data-end="6741"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6613" data-end="6741"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="6613" data-end="6647"&gt;Keep it short and intentional.&lt;/strong&gt; Aim for the minimum time that makes you feel reset. You’re after restoration, not rumination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-start="6742" data-end="6942"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6744" data-end="6942"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="6744" data-end="6788"&gt;Pair it with a single “tomorrow” action.&lt;/strong&gt; After toweling off, place your running shoes by the door, load the coffee maker, or put your badge in your bag. The habit stacking makes mornings easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-start="6943" data-end="7092"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6945" data-end="7092"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="6945" data-end="6981"&gt;Let scent do some heavy lifting.&lt;/strong&gt; A consistent, mild scent (think eucalyptus or unscented if you’re sensitive) can become a sleep cue over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-start="7093" data-end="7212"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7095" data-end="7212"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="7095" data-end="7131"&gt;Choose a final “lights-out” cue.&lt;/strong&gt; After the shower: dim lamps, one page of a book, then bed. The sequence matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="7214" data-end="7238"&gt;A quick personal note&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7240" data-end="7592"&gt;Trail running is my happy place. It also means dirt under my fingernails and the occasional splash of creek water on my calves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7240" data-end="7592"&gt;On those evenings, the shower isn’t optional—it’s a reunion with myself. As the mud swirls down the drain, so does the mental clutter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7240" data-end="7592"&gt;I step out feeling like I’ve returned to my baseline. If you know that feeling, you know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="7594" data-end="7610"&gt;Final thought&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7612" data-end="7822"&gt;If you always shower before bed, you’re not just “particular.” You’re building a life scaffolded by small, meaningful actions that help you think clearly, sleep deeply, and show up as the person you want to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7824" data-end="7906"&gt;And that’s the bigger story: not hygiene, but identity. Not steam, but self-trust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7908" data-end="7919"&gt;Sleep well.&lt;/p&gt;

For those in the aspirin group, there was a 7.7 percent chance of cancer coming back within the three years covered by the study. For &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-a-placebo"&gt;the placebo group&lt;/a&gt;, the chances were 14.1 to 16.8 percent, depending on the type of mutation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Aspirin is a drug that is readily available globally and extremely inexpensive compared to many modern cancer drugs, which is very positive," &lt;a href="https://news.ki.se/common-inexpensive-drug-halves-recurrence-in-colorectal-cancer"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Karolinska Institute surgeon Anna Martling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_175096" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-175096" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/CancerRisk.jpg" alt="Cancer risk graph" class="wp-image-175096 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/CancerRisk.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/CancerRisk-548x415.jpg 548w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/CancerRisk-600x454.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-175096" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Aspirin was linked to a lower risk of recurring cancer.

At the same time, research has also highlighted associations between aspirin and an elevated risk of other health problems, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/study-shows-the-dangers-outweigh-the-benefits-when-it-comes-to-a-daily-aspirin"&gt;including internal bleeding&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The good news is that cancers are already screened for critical mutations, which in this study accounted for a little over 1 in 3 &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/colon-rectal-cancer/about/what-is-colorectal-cancer.html"&gt;colorectal cancers&lt;/a&gt; – a substantial number of cases that could potentially be targeted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Aspirin is being tested here in a completely new context as a precision medicine treatment," &lt;a href="https://news.ki.se/common-inexpensive-drug-halves-recurrence-in-colorectal-cancer"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Martling. "This is a clear example of how we can use genetic information to personalize treatment and at the same time save both resources and suffering."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa2504650"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Shutterstock&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fast, music-driven breathwork was shown to induce psychedelic-like states, shifting brain blood flow and reducing negative emotions.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Participants described feelings of unity, bliss, and euphoria, suggesting breathwork may offer a safe, natural alternative to psychedelics in mental health treatment.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Breathwork While Listening to Music&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Breathing exercises performed to music may bring about feelings of deep bliss, while also altering blood flow in areas of the brain involved in processing emotions. This finding comes from a study published recently in the open-access journal &lt;em&gt;PLOS One&lt;/em&gt; by Amy Amla Kartar of the Colasanti Lab in the Department of Clinical Neuroscience at Brighton and Sussex Medical School, U.K., and her colleagues. The research showed that these changes can take place even when the body shows signs of a stress response, and they are linked with a reduction in reported negative emotions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent years, breathwork has become increasingly popular as a way to ease psychological distress. Certain approaches that involve faster or deeper breathing, often paired with music, can create altered states of consciousness (ASCs) similar to those brought on by psychedelic drugs. One form, known as high ventilation breathwork (HVB), may provide a drug-free option for achieving these effects, with fewer legal and ethical barriers to widespread use in therapy. Despite its growing appeal, the biological processes and personal experiences behind HVB-induced ASCs have not been studied in depth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Exploring Altered States of Consciousness&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To address this gap, Kartar and her team investigated how HVB produces ASCs in people with experience practicing the technique. They collected self-reported data from 15 online participants, 8 in-lab participants, and 19 who underwent magnetic resonance imaging. Each person completed a 20- to 30-minute session of continuous, rhythmic breathing set to music. Within half an hour after the session, participants filled out questionnaires describing their experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results showed that the intensity of ASCs evoked by HVB was proportional to cardiovascular sympathetic activation, as indicated by a decrease in heart rate variability, indicating a potential stress response. In addition, HVB-evoked ASCs were associated with a profound decrease in blood flow to the left operculum and posterior insula – brain regions implicated in representing the internal state of the body, including breathing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, despite HVB causing large and global reductions in blood flow to the brain, there was a progressive increase in blood flow during the session to the right amygdala and anterior hippocampus, which are brain regions involved in the processing of emotional memories. These blood flow changes correlated with psychedelic experiences, demonstrating that these alterations may underlie the positive effects of this breathwork.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Oceanic Boundlessness and Psychedelic Parallels&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During all experimental sessions, participants reported a reduction in fear and negative emotions, with no adverse reactions. Across participants and experimental settings, HVB reliably enhanced ASCs dominated by Oceanic Boundlessness (OBN), which is a term coined by Freud in 1920 that describes a set of related feelings including spiritual experience, insightfulness, blissful state, positively experienced depersonalization, and the experience of unity. OBN is considered as a defining aspect of ASCs evoked by psychedelic substances, such as &lt;span class="glossaryLink" aria-describedby="tt" data-cmtooltip="cmtt_7a35a078a0055cdc610debfd9ae5eb2e" data-gt-translate-attributes='[{"attribute":"data-cmtooltip", "format":"html"}]' tabindex="0" role="link"&gt;psilocybin&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the authors, their study was novel and exploratory and requires replication by future research including larger sample sizes and a control group to separate the effects of music on the brain. Despite these limitations, the findings provide a better understanding of HVB and direct research to investigate its therapeutic applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Mapping the Brain During Breathwork&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors add: “Our research is the first to use neuroimaging to map the neurophysiological changes that occur during breathwork. Our key findings include that breathwork can reliably evoke profound psychedelic states. We believe that these states are linked to changes in the function of specific brain regions involved in self-awareness, and fear and emotional memory processing. We found that more profound changes in blood flow in specific brain areas were linked to deeper sensations of unity, bliss, and emotional release, collectively known as “oceanic boundlessness.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amy Kartar, lead author, adds: “Conducting this research was a fantastic experience. It was thrilling to explore such a novel area – while many people anecdotally recognize the health benefits of breathwork, this style of fast-paced breathing has received very little scientific attention. We are very grateful to our participants for making this work possible.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;A Natural Path to Transformation&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Alessandro Colasanti, P.I., adds: “Breathwork is a powerful yet natural tool for neuromodulation, working through the regulation of metabolism across the body and brain. It holds tremendous promise as a transformative therapeutic intervention for conditions that are often both distressing and disabling.”&lt;/p&gt;

Every three seconds, somewhere in the world, someone is diagnosed with dementia, and it's usually Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, approximately &lt;a href="https://www.alzint.org/about/dementia-facts-figures/dementia-statistics/"&gt;50 million people worldwide&lt;/a&gt; have AD. By 2050, this number will exceed 130 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The human health and socioeconomic consequences of this are going to be immense. But perhaps it doesn't have to be this way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Preventing Alzheimer's disease&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 2024 report from the influential Lancet Commission suggests that up to one-third of AD cases &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s13195-020-00646-x"&gt;could be prevented simply by avoiding certain risk factors&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/world-alzheimers-day-heres-how-far-weve-come-in-search-of-a-cure"&gt;World Alzheimer's Day: Here's How Far We've Come in Search of a Cure&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(24)01296-0"&gt;14 modifiable risk factors&lt;/a&gt; encompass: traumatic brain injury, hypertension,  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/depression" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73097" data-postid="175109" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;,  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="175109" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, smoking, obesity, high cholesterol levels, low physical activity levels, too much alcohol consumption, too little education, vision loss, hearing loss, social isolation, and air pollution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While this comprehensive list is rooted soundly in science, it's not easy for members of the general public to monitor and manage 14 separate health targets – especially when prevention efforts need to start decades before symptoms appear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a problem that needs addressing. Tackling this problem requires a prevention model that is simple and memorable – something the public can easily embrace, understand, and follow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are successful examples that can serve as a template. Stroke prevention associations, for instance, have successfully adopted the &lt;a href="https://www.heartandstroke.ca/stroke/signs-of-stroke"&gt;FAST (Face, Arm, Speech, Time) mnemonic&lt;/a&gt; to teach stroke warning signs. AD prevention needs a FAST equivalent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SHIELD (Sleep, Head Injury prevention, Exercise, Learning, and Diet) may fill that role. SHIELD brings together the most significant, overlapping dementia risk factors into five core pillars, offering a clear and effective strategy for prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Sleep&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sleep is a foundational element of SHIELD. Maintaining healthy sleep habits is a key protective factor against dementia. &lt;a href="https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/dr-martha-clare-morris/diet-for-the-mind/9780316441155/"&gt;Adequate sleep&lt;/a&gt; supports &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12875-023-02229-9"&gt;brain function, memory, mood, and learning&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Insufficient (less than five hours per night) or poor-quality sleep (frequent awakenings), especially in midlife, increases the risk of cognitive decline and dementia. Chronic poor sleep leads to a build-up in the brain of amyloid-beta protein, which is implicated in the development of AD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1097/IJG.0000000000001169"&gt;Poor sleep&lt;/a&gt; also increases the likelihood of obesity, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.122.20513"&gt;high blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;, and depression, all risk factors for AD. If you're currently sleeping four to five hours per night, consider changing this habit to avoid increasing your risk for developing dementia in later life. Sleep is a vital tool for brain protection and AD prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Head injury&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Head injury prevention is, rather surprisingly, often overlooked in conversations about dementia. There are &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3233/JAD-200662"&gt;strong links between traumatic brain injuries&lt;/a&gt;, including concussions, and higher AD risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such head injuries can occur in a wide variety of settings, not just professional sports. Intimate partner violence, for example, is unfortunately common in our society and is a frequent, but neglected, cause of head trauma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Head injury prevention should start early and continue throughout life, as damage can accumulate over time. Broader safety measures (such as improved helmet designs, stronger concussion protocols in youth and adult sports, and efforts to prevent head injuries in all settings) can play a significant role in protecting long-term brain health and avoiding AD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Exercise&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" alt="A woman with grey hair using exercise equipment." src="https://images.theconversation.com/files/690644/original/file-20250912-56-23emct.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;fit=clip" srcset="https://images.theconversation.com/files/690644/original/file-20250912-56-23emct.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=600&amp;amp;h=400&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/690644/original/file-20250912-56-23emct.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=30&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=600&amp;amp;h=400&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/690644/original/file-20250912-56-23emct.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=15&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=600&amp;amp;h=400&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/690644/original/file-20250912-56-23emct.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;h=503&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/690644/original/file-20250912-56-23emct.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=30&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;h=503&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/690644/original/file-20250912-56-23emct.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=15&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;h=503&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=3 2262w" sizes="(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Regular movement, even in small amounts, enables better brain aging.

Exercise directly addresses multiple major risk factors, including obesity, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and depression. It also supports the growth of brain cells, memory and emotional health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite this, physical inactivity remains common, especially in high-income countries, where it &lt;a href="https://barlowbooks.com/our-books/save-your-mind/"&gt;may contribute to as many as one in five AD cases&lt;/a&gt;. Exercise is not just "heart medicine," but "brain medicine" too. Regular movement, even in small amounts, enables better brain aging and can help avoid AD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Learning&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Learning, both in and out of school, remains one of the strongest protective factors against dementia. Lower educational levels, such as not finishing secondary school, are &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S1474-4422(11)70072-2"&gt;linked to a significantly increased risk for dementia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Learning contributes to the brain's "cognitive reserve," which is the brain's ability to function well despite damage or disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Individuals with AD &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.7326/0003-4819-139-5_Part_2-200309021-00014"&gt;maintained better mental function&lt;/a&gt; if they had continued learning throughout life. Public health messaging should promote life-long learning in all forms – from reading and language learning to engaging hobbies that keep the brain active.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's never too early (or too late) to learn another language or to challenge your brain. Boosting your cognitive reserve boosts your brain against AD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Diet&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diet also plays a major role in brain health and dementia prevention. No single food prevents dementia. Rather, a combination of nutrient-rich foods supports overall brain health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/dr-martha-clare-morris/diet-for-the-mind/9780316441155/"&gt;A healthy diet&lt;/a&gt; can lower dementia risk by emphasizing whole foods like fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, and fish, while restricting processed foods, red meat, and sweets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adhering to dietary patterns like the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/nu5114566"&gt;Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt; has shown promising results in protecting against cognitive decline. The Mediterranean diet is a brain/heart-healthy eating style inspired by the traditional diets of people in countries bordering the Mediterranean Sea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It emphasizes plant-based foods with olive oil as the primary fat source, while limiting red meat, processed foods, and added sugars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_175110" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-175110" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/med_diet_shield_642.jpg" alt="foods in the mediterranean diet" class="wp-image-175110 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/med_diet_shield_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/med_diet_shield_642-600x374.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-175110" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The Mediterranean diet has been linked with a decrease in Alzheimer's disease.

A healthy diet shouldn't feel restrictive or like a punishment for trying to improve brain health. Instead, it can be framed as a positive investment in long-term independence, clarity, and energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By simplifying the science, the SHIELD framework offers a realistic and research-backed approach to brain health. Until a cure is discovered, prevention is the strongest tool. Concepts like SHIELD provide a starting point for achievable prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer's disease should not be seen as inevitable. The statistic that there will be more than 130 million people with AD by 2050 must not be accepted as predestined. With the right decisions and actions, we can work towards AD prevention by protecting the minds and memories of millions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emma Twiss, a fourth-year undergraduate student in Life Sciences at Queen's University, co-authored this story.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/265053/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now, the team is planning to test the vaccine in women with recurrent yeast infections, also known as recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis (RVVC). It's thought to affect one in 10 women in their lifetime and cause at least three or more yeast infections every year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Currently, treatment relies on just one class of drug, which increases the risk that the infection will develop resistance and be harder to treat. These drugs also cannot be used during pregnancy and do not prevent future infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Karen Norris, lead study author and professor of immunology and translational biomedicine in the UGA College of Veterinary Medicine, said: 'RVVC is not life-threatening, but it is miserable. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This is a huge need.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Norris noted that the findings of these clinical trials could inform future research relating to more vulnerable populations, such as transplant recipients and cancer patients, who are at risk of life-threatening fungi that cause pneumonia, sepsis and infections in the central nervous system. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Norris said: 'I’ve had a physician say to me, "I have patients that I get through stem cell transplants for their cancer treatment, and then they get [the fungus] aspergillosis. I often don’t have adequate treatment for that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'That's where I believe this vaccine will do the most good: in people who are at high risk for highly dangerous, life-threatening infections.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team's research, published in June in the journal &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41541-025-01171-4.epdf?sharing_token=eSFdZiSvMMMpOoBogqwI7NRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0PTjK0U_xzcb8G2-906pF8em6Zq3uUl41a9tMp_PWoQEzy4bK30EZIh5Ne-NgXScB49oHaqGwOPHN9yZL4Uva_XvYG_sII9mtaf8eMv0Iv_vJcHiW1e0quRQNONCkKbZBI%3D"&gt;NPJ Vaccines&lt;/a&gt;, tested the NXT-2 vaccine on female mice that had been infected with vulvovaginal candidiasis, or a vaginal yeast infection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Candida albicans, which causes yeast infections, is pictured above (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The vaccine works by triggering the production of antibodies that work against NXT-2, a protein that helps export RNA and proteins.

They found the DNA of the bacteria Viridians streptococcal, which lives in the mouth and digestive tract, in more than 40 percent of plaque samples from both groups. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-15110035/pancreatic-cancer-oral-bacteria-gum-disease.html"&gt;Naturally found in the mouths of most Americans&lt;/a&gt;, Viridians streptococcal bacteria is usually harmless in healthy people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the participants, the bacteria was largely present as a biofilm, or community of organisms, embedded into the arterial walls, where it lays dormant and evades detection from the immune system. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, in people who are immunocompromised or have chronic conditions, the organisms may escape the biofilm and lead to conditions like endocarditis, an infection of the inner lining of the heart that causes inflammation, damage to heart tissue and blockages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When infected tissue breaks off from a heart valve, it travels through the bloodstream and can lodge itself into the coronary artery, blocking blood flow and eventually leading to a heart attack. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Based on the results, experts are urging Americans to maintain proper oral hygiene, including brushing and flossing teeth twice a day and staying current on dental check ups to reduce the amount of Viridians streptococcal in the mouth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Researchers in Finland found a common bacteria found in the mouth could be linked to America's biggest killer, heart disease (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Pekka J Karhunen, study author and professor in the Faculty of Medicine and Health Technology at Tampere University in Finland, told &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/heart-attacks-may-be-linked-to-bacterial-infections-study-finds#How-would-oral-bacteria-cause-a-heart-attack"&gt;Medical News Today&lt;/a&gt;: 'We aim to show that there is a biofilm consisting of many bacteria in the atherosclerotic plaques and we also study the possibility that calcification of the biofilm — which occurs in the surface of the teeth — might also be involved in the calcification of coronary arteries.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The findings come as nearly one in three Americans, 83million, have some form of cardiovascular disease, including coronary artery disease, heart failure, heart attack and stroke. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Health authorities expect by 2050, more than 60 percent of Americans will have some form of heart disease.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cardiovascular disease accounts for one in three - 1million - deaths in the US, making it the leading cause of death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The new study, published last month in the &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/JAHA.125.041521#sec-1"&gt;Journal of the American Heart Association&lt;/a&gt;, looked at coronary plaque samples from 121 people who suffered a sudden cardiac death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The average participant age was 63, and nearly three in four were men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Participants in this group also had an average body mass index (BMI) of 30, indicating obesity, one of the leading causes of heart disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team also looked at an additional 96 people who had undergone an endarterectomy, a surgery to remove plaque from the inner lining of an artery. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The average participant age in this group was 69, and 72 percent were men.

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team found 66 percent of plaque samples from the deceased group contained bacteria and 58 percent from the surgery group had it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, the most common bacteria in both groups was oral viridans group streptococci (Viridians streptococcal). It was found in 42 percent of deceased patients and 43 percent of those who had surgery. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In normal, unclogged arteries, there was less bacteria.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Karhunen said: 'Oral viridans group Streptococci are known to act as early colonizers in the buildup of the dental biofilm known as dental plaque. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This signals that the streptococci may not be there alone - it is possible that there is a biofilm composed of many bacteria.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He noted that while in the biofilm, bacteria 'are safe inside the jelly-like cover and they do not cause any harm to the individual.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, he said the 'situation changes dramatically' when the biofilm is activated through an infection or other cause, resulting in the bacteria spreading to the plaque and causing inflammation and blood clots. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Chloe Burke went into cardiac arrest at 21 years old while cheering at the University of Houston due to an undiagnosed congenital heart defect&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Matias Escobar, pictured here in the middle, nearly died while competing in the New York City Triathlon in 2023 at age 38&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The bacteria may then lead to endocarditis, an infection in the inner lining of the heart and its valves, which strikes between 10,000 and 30,000 Americans every year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The condition causes irregular growths made of germs and cell pieces to form clumps in the heart called vegetations, which can break loose and travel to the brain, lungs, kidneys or arteries, triggering heart failure, stroke, heart attack and blood clots. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers cautioned that the findings are not definitive.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, they noted they are studying 'the possibility of developing a vaccine against the formation of a biofilm and bacterial-induced thrombosis.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Elizabeth Klodas, chief medical officer and founder  of Step One Foods, &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a67948713/heart-attack-linked-to-bacterial-infection-study/"&gt;told &lt;/a&gt;Prevention the study findings are a reminder that 'our various bodily systems are interconnected.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She added: 'Getting regular dental check-ups and brushing our teeth and flossing is not only good for our mouths, but also for our hearts.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Sep 2025 01:49:22 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>告诉《华盛顿邮报》：特朗普和小RFK的自闭症计划对您有何影响？ -《华盛顿邮报》</title><link>https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/09/22/submissions-autism/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="SXHQNQPC5ZAWDFJ2HMFS2GU6QI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The Trump administration has made finding answers on autism a top priority, with Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F.

        &lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NAMPA, Idaho — &lt;span&gt;Officials have identified an invasive species of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="/article/news/nation-world/west-nile-virus-cases-running-higher-than-normal-health-warnings/507-4a4e49c2-26df-4375-aae6-508e755f266f" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;mosquito&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; in Nampa. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;A single Aedes aegypti, also known as the yellow fever or Egyptian mosquito, was recovered by the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/2cmad/posts/pfbid02CwbCQrsLr8eugGf5SAgoWZXhy4eu7TYGaaXjHx8rAGJAyDqjrpiqxEga638qE4jdl" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Canyon County Mosquito Abatement District&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; on Aug. 11.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The district first visually identified the species, then sent it in for DNA testing in order to confirm. A positive result confirmed the sample as Aedes aegypti on Sept. 17, 2025. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Canyon County Mosquito Abatement District Director Jim Lunders said this was the first known detection of the species in Idaho. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The mosquitoes are native to Africa and can transmit over 50 different diseases, including Zika and dengue. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No additional mosquitos of this kind were found in the surrounding areas, according to the Canyon County Mosquito Abatement District, although officials will continue to monitor through 2026. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The possibility of Ae. aegypti establishing reminds us of the importance of the public taking an active role in minimizing potential habitats around their home," Lunders said. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These mosquitoes bite at all times of day and breed in standing water. In order to protect against mosquitoes, people should monitor spaces like flower pots, birdbaths, unused pools and hot tubs, clogged gutters and old tires. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Canyon County residents who are experiencing mosquito problems can report them &lt;a href="https://www.2cmad.org/request/"&gt;online&lt;/a&gt; or by calling 208-461-8633.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;p class="caption"&gt;The La Plata County Public Health department is on the hunt for plague after confirmed reports of mass prairie dog deaths were reported in August. (Jerry McBride/Durango Herald file)&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p class="expand" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#articleImageModalD0A48675-8120-45F3-8C8F-1B0BCEB49361"&gt;&lt;i class="fa fa-arrows-alt"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;p class="article__body"&gt;La Plata County Public Health is investigating a large prairie dog die-off that has raised suspicions of plague in several undisclosed locations across the county.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p class="article__body"&gt;After receiving reports of unusual die-offs in prairie dog colonies in August, staff from the department’s communicable disease branch conducted on-site investigations, according to a news release.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p class="article__body"&gt;The investigations included interviewing property owners and neighbors about recent changes in rodent activity and conducting field surveys to collect samples – including carcasses or fleas – said Public Health Director Theresa Anselmo.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p class="article__body"&gt;While testing has not confirmed plague, reduced or absent activity has been observed in several colonies, Anselmo said.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class="content-part__text"&gt;            &lt;p class="article__body"&gt;Plague is &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/17782-plague" id="link-1fa012292092640a5cc29afa4d32f4b1" target="_blank"&gt;a bacterial disease&lt;/a&gt; caused by Yersinia pestis. It is most often spread by the bites of infected fleas or through direct contact with infected animals such as prairie dogs, squirrels or rats.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p class="article__body"&gt;There are three main types of plague: bubonic, which causes the swelling of the lymph nodes; septicemic, which occurs when plague bacteria enter the blood stream; and pneumonic, which affects the respiratory system.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p class="factbox-dropdown-button-container"&gt;
        &lt;i class="fa fa-arrow-circle-down factbox-dropdown-button"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;            &lt;p class="article__body"&gt;In August, the department issued CodeRED alerts to residents in areas where prairie dog die-offs were reported. Staff also notified local health care providers and veterinarians to watch for plague symptoms in patients and pets.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p class="article__body"&gt;“It’s not too concerning, but it is endemic in our area,” Anselmo said. “So it’s just something that we have to be concerned of and be aware – that is around all the time – and not something that necessarily people think about.”&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p class="article__body"&gt;The most effective tool against plague is public education, she said.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p class="article__body"&gt;Plague, caused by bacteria transmitted through the bite of infected fleas or contact with infected animals, is known to occur in prairie dogs, rock squirrels, wood rats and other rodents in Colorado.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p class="article__body"&gt;Plague can be treated in humans and pets if detected early. Symptoms include sudden onset of high fever and swollen lymph nodes. People who experience those symptoms are advised to seek medical care immediately. Pet owners should consult a veterinarian if their animal develops a high fever, abscess or swollen lymph nodes, as infected pets can transmit plague to humans.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p class="article__body"&gt;To reduce risk of exposure, health officials recommend using insect repellent and protective clothing outdoors, keeping pets away from wildlife and on flea prevention, avoiding sleeping with pets, and not handling dead animals or animal waste.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p class="article__body"&gt;They also caution against killing or eradicating prairie dogs, as it can cause fleas carrying plague bacteria to seek new hosts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;But their meeting came at a tumultuous time for the CDC after the agency’s boss, &lt;a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-axed-cdc-boss-susan-monarez-after-daily-beast-covid-vaccine-bombshell/" rel=""&gt;Susan Monarez, was forced out of her job&lt;/a&gt; for resisting Kennedy’s controversial policies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Monarez’s departure sparked a mass exodus at the top of the agency, with Jernigan, Daskalakis, and Chief Medical Officer Debra Houry also leaving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Speaking on a Zoom call on Monday, the trio said last week’s vaccine panel meeting—in which the group admitted they were “rookies”—confirmed their fears about how vaccine policy is being shaped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“The people deciding vaccine policy for the United States should not be rookies. That was beyond disappointing and disheartening,” said Houry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Daskalakis agreed. “Over 60 percent reduction in flu samples means that we don’t know what the next pandemic strain is going to be. We’re not going to be able to develop vaccines to be ready for seasonal flu or pandemic flu,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The chaos at the CDC has led to calls for Kennedy to resign. But the Health Secretary has defended the overhaul, telling a fiery Senate hearing this month that the agency had failed in its central mission: protecting Americans from infectious disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-media-item b-article-body__image"&gt;&lt;img data-chromatic="ignore" alt="Health and Human Services Secretary Robert Kennedy Jr." class="c-image" loading="lazy" src="https://www.thedailybeast.com/resizer/v2/RZT727WEWNHVRBHKMNFLRZSQ3U.jpg?auth=4358ae2172412fc9e6feb6108c4ae718080066b1552df53099b085cf5f114d30&amp;amp;width=800&amp;amp;height=533" srcset="https://www.thedailybeast.com/resizer/v2/RZT727WEWNHVRBHKMNFLRZSQ3U.jpg?auth=4358ae2172412fc9e6feb6108c4ae718080066b1552df53099b085cf5f114d30&amp;amp;width=274&amp;amp;height=182 274w, https://www.thedailybeast.com/resizer/v2/RZT727WEWNHVRBHKMNFLRZSQ3U.jpg?auth=4358ae2172412fc9e6feb6108c4ae718080066b1552df53099b085cf5f114d30&amp;amp;width=400&amp;amp;height=266 400w, https://www.thedailybeast.com/resizer/v2/RZT727WEWNHVRBHKMNFLRZSQ3U.jpg?auth=4358ae2172412fc9e6feb6108c4ae718080066b1552df53099b085cf5f114d30&amp;amp;width=768&amp;amp;height=511 768w, https://www.thedailybeast.com/resizer/v2/RZT727WEWNHVRBHKMNFLRZSQ3U.jpg?auth=4358ae2172412fc9e6feb6108c4ae718080066b1552df53099b085cf5f114d30&amp;amp;width=1024&amp;amp;height=682 1024w, https://www.thedailybeast.com/resizer/v2/RZT727WEWNHVRBHKMNFLRZSQ3U.jpg?auth=4358ae2172412fc9e6feb6108c4ae718080066b1552df53099b085cf5f114d30&amp;amp;width=1440&amp;amp;height=959 1440w"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="c-media-item__fig-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__caption"&gt;Health and Human Services Secretary Robert Kennedy Jr. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__credit"&gt;Andrew Harnik/Getty Images &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“America is home to 4.2% of the world’s population, yet we had nearly 20% of the COVID deaths,” said Kennedy, a known conspiracy theorist and vaccine sceptic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“We literally did worse than any country in the world, and the people at CDC who oversaw that process, who put masks on our children, who closed our schools, are the people who will be leaving.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Last week, Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices chairman Martin Kulldorff hit out at critics he said were falsely claiming they were made up of “unscientific and dangerous anti-vaxxers.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Kulldorff, a former Harvard professor of medicine who lost his job after refusing the COVID vaccine, also challenged ex-CDC heads to debate him to prove they could be trusted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“I suggest that you should only trust scientists that are willing to debate fellow scientists with different views,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Daily Beast</author><pubDate>Mon, 22 Sep 2025 21:58:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinwFBVV95cUxQNHBzY1drS3ljWmFWX00tUHBOYnB0bHF5cnVEeFVYY05UX3NpRE5WNlBBTTVVUVVFZ2Q3Qk9aSUpZR1NucjB4Z0dZM1NSblFucUtuQmFrOHpnSkxjYWVMd2xIT2xtdFZBTTAzeGlIelhnOHJ3MFlRQWMxOVdKUzZmZ0hwUUhMazhURmpfS3pNZnhVZWZ6b2VxOGZCV2NKMDQ</guid></item><item><title>专家警告，未经医生核实，切勿将这两种补充剂混合使用- AOL.com</title><link>https://www.aol.com/articles/never-combine-2-supplements-without-182500971.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ideally, we get all the nutrients we need through &lt;a href="https://parade.com/986848/nancy-henderson/types-of-diets/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:diet;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;diet&lt;/a&gt;.

It’s safe to take them together, so it’s not a risk, but it is an unwise use of your dollars,” says integrative medicine doctor &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dr-lamees-hamdan-838232b0" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Lamees Hamdan, MD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Lamees Hamdan, MD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wishinguwellness.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Stephanie Nielsen, PharmD, CNN, CFGP;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Stephanie Nielsen, PharmD, CNN, CFGP&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, &lt;/strong&gt;a pharmacist and functional genomics practitioner at The DNA Company, agrees. “Calcium and magnesium use the same absorption pathways in your intestines. Think of it like there are only so many Ubers headed to a concert. If all the cars are full or headed in the wrong direction, you are not getting picked up,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/most-important-supplement-for-brain-health" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Want to Improve Your Brain Health?

Experts Agree This Is the Most Important Supplement to Take&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Nielsen explains that when calcium and magnesium are both taken in doses greater than 250 milligrams, they compete for the same transport "vehicles," keeping with her aforementioned analogy. This, she says, can lead to unpredictable absorption of one or both.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like Dr. Hamdan, &lt;a href="https://cassioburycourt.com/clinical-reviewer/dr-olalekan-otulana-advanced-practitioner/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Olakan Otulana, MBCHB,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Olakan Otulana, MBCHB,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; a general physician at Cassiobury Court, says that taking magnesium and calcium supplements together isn’t necessarily dangerous, but he adds that what &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; dangerous is someone not getting enough of these two crucial nutrients, which they may be relying on the supplements for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of taking magnesium and calcium together, all of the experts recommend spacing them out. Dr. Otulana suggests taking the calcium supplement in the morning because some people find it energizing and taking the magnesium supplement at night because it can have a relaxing effect and support sleep. If you’re a coffee drinker, another reason to take magnesium at night is because coffee can block the absorption of it, according to Dr. Hamden.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://parade.com/703659/lisamulcahy/8-things-you-didnt-know-about-supplements/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:8 Facts You Didn't Know About Supplements;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;8 Facts You Didn't Know About Supplements&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;One Other Supplement Stack Doctors Say To Avoid&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides calcium and magnesium, Dr. Otulana says that iron and zinc supplements should not be taken at the same time. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Iron and zinc also compete for absorption in the digestive tract. If you take them together, particularly at high doses, they can interfere with how much of each your body absorbs. This is especially important if you’re taking them to treat a deficiency because you want to make sure your body actually gets the dose it needs,” he shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.lcmchealth.org/east-jefferson-general-hospital/about-us/education/family-medicine-residency/meet-our-faculty-and-residents/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. James Vu, MD, MPH,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. James Vu, MD, MPH, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;a resident physician at East Jefferson General Hospital LCMC Health, says that it’s especially not a good idea to take iron and zinc together on an empty stomach. Instead, he recommends taking them separately, both with food. “Food helps reduce competition between the minerals, allowing your body to absorb them more efficiently,” he explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/how-to-choose-safe-supplements" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:A Study Found That 90% of Melatonin Supplements Are Mislabeled—Here Are the Safest Supplement Brands to Try;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;A Study Found That 90% of Melatonin Supplements Are Mislabeled—Here Are the Safest Supplement Brands to Try&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Otulana adds that vitamin C helps with iron absorption, so it’s an especially good idea to take iron supplements with foods like citrus fruits, cantaloupe, bell peppers, broccoli or Brussels sprouts, which all contain vitamin C.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to taking supplements, Dr. Hamden says that it’s a misconception that the bigger the dose, the bigger the benefit; she emphasizes that this is not true. “Each supplement has a dosage that works the best, so more doesn't mean that it works better. Formulating supplements really is an art because many of them work better together. When stacking them, you need to lower the dosage of each individual one because the whole is greater than the sum of its parts,” she explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Vu adds to this, saying it’s always a good idea to talk to your primary care physician before starting or changing a supplement routine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It may be tempting to knock back all your supplements at once, but the safest and most effective way is to talk to your doctor about timing, including what can be taken together and what can’t. That way, you’ll get the maximum benefit possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Up Next:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://parade.com/living/women-over-50-sunscreen" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Related: The One Thing Women Over 50 Don't Realize About SPF, According to a Pro Makeup Artist;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Related: The One Thing Women Over 50 Don't Realize About SPF, According to a Pro Makeup Artist&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Sources&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dr-lamees-hamdan-838232b0" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Lamees Hamdan, MD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Dr. Lamees Hamdan, MD&lt;/a&gt;, integrative medicine doctor&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://cassioburycourt.com/clinical-reviewer/dr-olalekan-otulana-advanced-practitioner/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Olakan Otulana, MBCHB,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Dr. Olakan Otulana, MBCHB,&lt;/a&gt; general physician at Cassiobury Court&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.lcmchealth.org/east-jefferson-general-hospital/about-us/education/family-medicine-residency/meet-our-faculty-and-residents/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. James Vu, MD, MPH,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Dr. James Vu, MD, MPH, &lt;/a&gt;resident physician at East Jefferson General Hospital LCMC Health&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wishinguwellness.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Stephanie Nielsen, PharmD, CNN, CFGP;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Dr. Stephanie Nielsen, PharmD, CNN, CFGP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, &lt;/strong&gt;pharmacist and functional genomics practitioner at The DNA Company&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;This story was originally reported by &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/supplements-to-never-take-together" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Parade;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Parade&lt;/a&gt; on Sep 22, 2025, where it first appeared in the &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Health &amp;amp; Wellness;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Health &amp;amp; Wellness&lt;/a&gt; section.

        &lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NEWPORT NEWS, Va. — One Newport News teacher is sharing a painful lesson after losing her husband to a rare but deadly flesh-eating bacterium called vibrio. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joyce D'Arcy is mourning her husband Derek's death, which occurred just 13 days after a seemingly harmless trip to Virginia Beach in August, their favorite place. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It came from our favorite place to go — Virginia Beach was our favorite place to go," Joyce said. "It's just so sad that the best place we like to go is where he got sick." &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The couple’s day at the beach involved a simple, calf-high wade in the water, which was all it took for the bacteria to enter Derek's body through a small, open cut on his leg. Four days later, Joyce noticed a purple stripe on his leg. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The skin was just purple," she recalled. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the time the blood test results confirmed it was Vibrio three days later, the infection had already ravaged his lower legs. Derek, a pastor and painter, had a weakened immune system due to being on dialysis, which Joyce believes contributed to the swiftness of the infection. Doctors made the difficult decision to amputate both legs, but just 12 hours after the surgery, the infection had spread to his chest, head, and hands. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We knew we lost the fight," Joyce said. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She is now speaking out to warn others, emphasizing how quickly one can die from this bacteria, which Cleveland Clinic doctors say is more common than people think, particularly during the warmer months of May through October. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her hope is that by sharing her husband's story, she can prevent another family from experiencing the same devastating loss.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

Participants often acted automatically in familiar settings, reflecting learned associations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Almost half of these habits were also aligned with personal goals, suggesting that people create routines that support their intentions. The findings highlight the power of habit in shaping behavior and point to strategies for building healthier lifestyles by focusing on habit formation and disruption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Habit Dominance:&lt;/strong&gt; 65% of daily behaviors were driven by habit, not active choice.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Goal Alignment:&lt;/strong&gt; 46% of habitual actions also matched people’s conscious intentions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Health Implication:&lt;/strong&gt; Interventions should target forming positive habits and disrupting harmful ones.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Surrey&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Habit, not conscious choice, drives most of our actions, according to new research from the University of Surrey, University of South Carolina and Central Queensland University. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research, published in &lt;em&gt;Psychology &amp;amp; Health&lt;/em&gt;, found that two-thirds of our daily behaviours are initiated “on autopilot”, out of habit.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Habits are actions that we are automatically prompted to do when we encounter everyday settings, due to associations that we have learned between those settings and our usual responses to them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research also found that 46% of behaviours were both triggered by habit and aligned with conscious intentions, suggesting that people form habits that support their personal goals, and often disrupt habits that conflict with them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While there have been previous attempts to estimate the prevalence of habits in our day-to-day lives, this study used a new method to capture habits in action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The international research team surveyed 105 participants from the UK and Australia, sending six random prompts to their phones each day for a week, asking them to describe what they were currently doing, and whether it was triggered out of habit or done intentionally. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study found that 65% of daily behaviours were habitually initiated, meaning people were prompted to do them out of routine rather than making a conscious decision.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Benjamin Gardner, Professor in Psychology at the University of Surrey and co-author of the study, said: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our research shows that while people may consciously want to do something, the actual initiation and performance of that behaviour is often done without thinking, driven by non-conscious habits. This suggests that “good” habits may be a powerful way to make our goals a reality. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For people who want to break their bad habits, simply telling them to “try harder” isn’t enough. To create lasting change, we must incorporate strategies to help people recognise and disrupt their unwanted habits, and ideally form positive new ones in their place.”   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings may have broader implications for public health and wellness interventions. The researchers recommend that initiatives designed to help people adopt new behaviours, like exercising or eating healthier, should focus on building new, positive habits.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, for someone trying to take up exercise, inconsistent exercising may not be enough. The most effective strategy would involve identifying an everyday situation in which exercise can realistically be done – for example, at a certain time of day, or following a regular event, like leaving work – and consistently doing some exercise in that situation.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Likewise, to break a bad habit like smoking, simply wanting to quit may not cut it. The most effective strategies would involve disrupting triggers (e.g. avoiding places where they used to smoke) and creating new routines (e.g. chewing gum after a meal instead of having a cigarette). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Amanda Rebar, Associate Professor at the University of South Carolina and lead author of the study said: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People like to think of themselves as rational decision makers, who think carefully about what to do before they do it.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“However, much of our repetitive behavior is undertaken with minimal forethought and is instead generated automatically, by habit.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Grace Vincent, Sleep Scientist and Associate Professor at Central Queensland University and co-author of the study, said the findings offer hope to people trying to develop healthier lifestyles: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our study shows that two-thirds of what people do each day is sparked by habit, and most of the time those habits are also aligned with our intentions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This means that if we set out to create a positive habit, whether that’s around better sleep hygiene, or nutrition, or general wellbeing improvements, we can rely on an internal “autopilot” to take over and help us maintain those habits.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Unfortunately, not all habits are created equal. Exercise was the exception in our findings, as it was often triggered by habit, but less likely to be achieved purely “on autopilot”, compared to other behaviours.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this consciousness and neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#d2b6fcbcb8bdbebbbcb8bd92a1a7a0a0b7abfcb3b1fca7b9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Dalitso Njolinjo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="ttps://surrey.ac.uk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Surrey&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Dalitso Njolinjo – University of Surrey&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08870446.2025.2561149" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;How Habitual is Everyday Life?

Previous estimates of the prevalence of habit in everyday life have not distinguished between habitual instigation, whereby habit triggers action selection of a target action, and habitual execution, whereby habit facilitates smooth performance of action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="d1e166"&gt;Methods and Measures&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants (&lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt; = 105) from the UK and Australia completed an ecological momentary assessment study, in which they self-reported their current behavior, and to what extent that behavior was habitually instigated, habitually executed and intentional, 6 times daily over 7 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="d1e173"&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most observed behaviors were habitually instigated (65%), habitually executed (88%), and aligned with intention (76%). Whether a person’s behavior was generally habitual or aligned with intention did not vary as a function of demographics. Exercise behaviors were more commonly habitually instigated, and less habitually executed, than other action types.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="d1e176"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our findings illustrate the pervasive influence of habit on everyday life. We recommend that techniques conducive to forming new habits and disrupting old habits be built into behavior change interventions to maximize effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Mon, 22 Sep 2025 20:42:39 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMic0FVX3lxTE1jdFk5Z1lKU1k1eDlnYUlzR2d4emlxYjVTWmhPS01lcmZVQ0hjb0dEMWw0REU1RHFEaG5ZMHlyMlhPb2NST2FNRDhyYmRqNVF4X2szUzFxbDJsanJTZHFxb2ZybUFReTl5c3gyUHFXbDgtbnM</guid></item><item><title>首次发现抑郁症背后的脑细胞- SciTechDaily</title><link>https://scitechdaily.com/brain-cells-behind-depression-identified-for-the-first-time/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content cf entry-content content-spacious"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Research on rare post-mortem brain tissue shows changes in gene activity, offering new insight into the biological basis of depression.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers from &lt;a href="https://scitechdaily.com/tag/mcgill-university/"&gt;McGill University&lt;/a&gt; and the Douglas Institute have discovered two distinct types of brain cells that show alterations in individuals with depression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their study, published in &lt;em&gt;Nature Genetics&lt;/em&gt;, paves the way for potential treatments that directly target these cells while also advancing scientific understanding of depression, a major global health challenge affecting over 264 million people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is the first time we’ve been able to identify what specific brain cell types are affected in depression by mapping gene activity together with mechanisms that regulate the &lt;span class="glossaryLink" aria-describedby="tt" data-cmtooltip="cmtt_a15e5d2ae3fd42fd6258493af70006cf" data-gt-translate-attributes='[{"attribute":"data-cmtooltip", "format":"html"}]' tabindex="0" role="link"&gt;DNA&lt;/span&gt; code,” said senior author Dr. Gustavo Turecki, a professor at McGill, clinician-scientist at the Douglas Institute and Canada Research Chair in Major Depressive Disorder and Suicide. “It gives us a much clearer picture of where disruptions are happening, and which cells are involved.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Rare brain bank enables breakthrough&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team examined post-mortem brain tissue from the Douglas-Bell Canada Brain Bank, one of the rare global resources containing donated samples from individuals with psychiatric conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using single-cell genomic methods, they analyzed &lt;span class="glossaryLink" aria-describedby="tt" data-cmtooltip="cmtt_9b0fea3ca1b53e62677a40c331155d4d" data-gt-translate-attributes='[{"attribute":"data-cmtooltip", "format":"html"}]' tabindex="0" role="link"&gt;RNA&lt;/span&gt; and DNA from thousands of brain cells to determine which cell types functioned differently in depression and which DNA sequences might account for those changes. Their analysis included samples from 59 individuals with depression and 41 without the condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Key brain cells linked to depression&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results revealed altered gene activity in a certain type of excitatory neuron involved in mood and stress regulation, and in a subtype of microglia cells, which help manage inflammation. In both cell types, many genes were functioning differently in people with depression, suggesting potential disruptions in these key brain systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By pinpointing brain cells affected in depression, the study adds new insight into its biological basis and, more broadly, challenges lingering misconceptions about the disorder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This research reinforces what neuroscience has been telling us for years,” Turecki said. “Depression isn’t just emotional, it reflects real, measurable changes in the brain.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a next step, the researchers plan to study how these cellular changes affect brain function and whether targeting them could lead to better therapies.&lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;Under our current age of Trump, it’s frankly stranger when the federal government doesn’t do something completely unproductive. The latest bit of pointlessness? The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has switched back to using the name “monkeypox”—an outdated label for the disease mpox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;NPR was the &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goats-and-soda/2025/09/12/g-s1-88287/mpox-monkeypox-virus-stigma"&gt;first to report&lt;/a&gt; on the name switchback, which appears to have been implemented sometime in the last month. Nearly three years ago, virologists pushed for monkeypox to be retired, both for being potentially stigmatizing and factually inaccurate, since monkeys aren’t the primary hosts of the virus in the wild. HHS confirmed the switch to Gizmodo but offered no elaboration as to why it did so.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Why the change?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;In November 2022, the World Health Organization officially &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/monkeypox-new-name-mpox-1849826028"&gt;adopted&lt;/a&gt; the label “mpox” to describe the viral disease, following a &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/monkeypox-new-name-mpox-1849826028"&gt;concerted effort&lt;/a&gt; by relevant experts and scientists to retire “monkeypox.” This name was quickly reaffirmed by many health organizations and countries, including the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The reasoning was twofold. One, though humans first discovered monkeypox in a group of lab monkeys in the 1950s, we now know that rodents are its predominant animal hosts. Since 2022, the disease has also spread widely between people, causing outbreaks across the globe—another sign of monkeypox’s outdatedness. Though outbreaks have generally lessened in most parts of the world, the disease still causes &lt;a href="https://worldhealthorg.shinyapps.io/mpx_global/"&gt;large surges of illness&lt;/a&gt; to this day.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Secondly, many scientists &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/metaphors-matter-why-changing-the-name-monkeypox-may-help-curb-the-discriminatory-language-used-to-discuss-it-185343"&gt;noted&lt;/a&gt; the harmful racial and ethnic connotations of the name. People have long used “monkey” as a racist shorthand for Black or African people, and some have cast monkeypox as strictly an “African” disease (mpox is still most prevalent in parts of Africa, but the global outbreak has clearly illustrated that it doesn’t respect borders).&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Boghuma Titanji, a virus researcher at Emory University originally from Cameroon, recounted to NPR how her attempts to share information about the mpox outbreaks in 2022 quickly led to a pile-on from racist trolls on social media. “Likening me to a monkey, asking me to go back to Africa, where people have sex with monkeys, and being someone who defends gay sex with monkeys. Those were some of the really, really dark messages that I got in my inbox,” she told NPR.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;What’s in a name?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;There is, admittedly, some room for confusion here.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As it turns out, different organizations are responsible for naming a virus as opposed to the disease it causes. And while most experts and health agencies defer to the WHO’s guidance for a disease’s name, it’s the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) that decides the formal name of the virus.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Right around the same time that WHO was considering a name change, the ICTV stated that it would not drastically change its labeling of the virus behind mpox. Though the group has been updating its classification of many virus groups lately, it ultimately only added a &lt;a href="https://ictv.global/report/chapter/poxviridae/poxviridae/orthopoxvirus"&gt;broader label&lt;/a&gt; in front to illustrate its closeness to other similar pox viruses. So its official species name is now &lt;i&gt;Orthopoxvirus monkeypox &lt;/i&gt;(if it’s any consolation, many scientists have &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/silly-and-pompous-official-new-names-viruses-rile-researchers"&gt;complained&lt;/a&gt; about the ICTV’s virus name updating for other reasons).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s this distinction that HHS may be hanging its hat on in order to support the name switch. An HHS spokesperson told Gizmodo, “Monkeypox is the name of the viral disease caused by the monkeypox virus.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To be clear, though, that’s not accurate. Or at least, monkeypox isn’t the name that most every other health agency around the world now uses for the viral disease caused by the monkeypox virus; that’s mpox. That long list also currently includes the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, since the agency (part of HHS) is still using mpox on its &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mpox/about/index.html"&gt;webpage&lt;/a&gt; about the disease. Since the last update of that page occurred in April 2025, though, it’s probably only a matter of time before that changes as well.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;As for why the federal government is doing this, who honestly knows? Trump and other members of his administration have made it clear that they despise the WHO, to the point of &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/why-trumps-decision-to-leave-the-who-is-a-catastrophe-in-the-making-2000552752"&gt;stripping away the funding&lt;/a&gt; the U.S. has historically provided to the agency. But that doesn’t really explain why the change is happening now. For all we know, someone got in Trump’s or Health Secretary RFK Jr.’s ear last month and scared them into thinking “mpox” is too woke a term for the U.S. to endorse.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What we can say for sure is how utterly pointless any of this is.&lt;/p&gt;

These effects peak four hours after consumption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers were keen to discover how this combination of factors affects the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recruiting 20 men between the ages of 18 and 35 and 21 men between 60 and 80, researchers measured the effectiveness of blood vessels linked to heart and brain health before and after consuming a milkshake dubbed the “brain bomb.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;The milkshake participants consumed was called a “brain bomb” because the primary ingredient was heavy whipping cream. rawpixel.com – stock.adobe.com&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The decadent shake clocked in at 1,362 calories and 130 grams of fat, as the primary ingredient was heavy whipping cream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings confirmed previous research that has shown that a high-fat meal impairs the ability of the blood vessels linked to heart health to open in both young and old participants,” Marley and Bailey wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These impairments reduced the brain’s ability to buffer changes in blood pressure,” they added. “This was more pronounced (by about 10%) in the older adults, suggesting that older brains may be more vulnerable to the effects of the meal.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pair noted that &lt;a href="https://portlandpress.com/clinsci/article-abstract/131/23/2807/71652/Post-prandial-hyperlipidaemia-results-in-systemic?redirectedFrom=fulltext" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:previous research;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;previous research&lt;/a&gt; has shown that meals high in saturated fat increase cell-damaging free radicals while decreasing nitric oxide, which helps relax blood vessels and supports the transport of oxygen and glucose throughout the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s why the &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-eating/eat-smart/fats/saturated-fats" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:American Heart Association recommends;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;American Heart Association recommends&lt;/a&gt; limiting saturated fat to less than 6% of total daily calories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;The American Heart Association (AHA) recommends limiting saturated fat to less than 6% of total daily calories. adimas – stock.adobe.com&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;For someone who eats 2,000 calories a day, that means no more than 120 calories — or roughly 13 grams — should come from saturated fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That limit is easy to exceed.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Researchers found that zeaxanthin, long associated with eye health, may also boost the body’s immune response against cancer.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a recent study, scientists at the &lt;a href="https://scitechdaily.com/tag/university-of-chicago/"&gt;&lt;span class="glossaryLink" aria-describedby="tt" data-cmtooltip="cmtt_7b1595855b85627e26ccff3575b6e1d0" data-gt-translate-attributes='[{"attribute":"data-cmtooltip", "format":"html"}]' tabindex="0" role="link"&gt;University of Chicago&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; found that zeaxanthin, a carotenoid derived from plants and traditionally recognized for supporting eye health, may also enhance immune function by boosting the tumor-fighting abilities of certain immune cells. Published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="glossaryLink" aria-describedby="tt" data-cmtooltip="cmtt_5320548253fb53903fe4d0f8f1485d98" data-gt-translate-attributes='[{"attribute":"data-cmtooltip", "format":"html"}]' tabindex="0" role="link"&gt;Cell Reports&lt;/span&gt; Medicine&lt;/em&gt;, the research points to zeaxanthin’s promise as an accessible supplement that could improve the effectiveness of cancer immunotherapies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We were surprised to find that zeaxanthin, already known for its role in eye health, has a completely new function in boosting anti-tumor immunity,” said Jing Chen, PhD, Janet Davison Rowley Distinguished Service Professor of Medicine and senior author of the study. “Our study shows that a simple dietary nutrient could complement and strengthen advanced cancer treatments like immunotherapy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;How does this nutrient work?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chen’s laboratory has spent years investigating how nutrients shape immune function, and this study extends that effort. By screening an extensive library of blood nutrients, the team pinpointed zeaxanthin as a compound that directly boosts the activity of CD8+ T cells, the immune cells responsible for killing tumor cells. These T cells depend on a structure known as the T-cell receptor (TCR) to detect and eliminate abnormal cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers discovered that zeaxanthin helps stabilize and reinforce the TCR complex on CD8+ T cells when they engage with cancer cells. This strengthening effect amplifies intracellular signaling, leading to greater T-cell activation, higher cytokine production, and improved tumor-killing performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Zeaxanthin improves immunotherapy effects&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In mouse experiments, dietary zeaxanthin supplementation slowed the progression of tumors. Even more striking, when paired with immune checkpoint inhibitors—a widely used form of cancer immunotherapy—zeaxanthin markedly increased anti-tumor activity compared to immunotherapy on its own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To extend the findings, the researchers tested human T cells engineered to recognize specific tumor antigens and found that zeaxanthin treatment improved these cells’ ability to kill melanoma, multiple myeloma, and glioblastoma cells in laboratory experiments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our data show that zeaxanthin improves both natural and engineered T-cell responses, which suggests high translational potential for patients undergoing immunotherapies,” Chen said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;A safe and accessible candidate&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zeaxanthin is sold as an over-the-counter supplement for eye health, and is naturally found in vegetables like orange peppers, spinach, and kale. It’s inexpensive, widely available, well-tolerated and, most importantly, its safety profile is known – which means it can be safely tested as an adjunct to cancer therapies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study also reinforces the importance of a balanced diet. In their previous research, Chen’s group discovered that &lt;a href="https://biologicalsciences.uchicago.edu/news/tva-nutrient-cancer-immunity"&gt;trans-vaccenic &lt;span class="glossaryLink" aria-describedby="tt" data-cmtooltip="cmtt_9745a074b5eb990461959ea2eda628f3" data-gt-translate-attributes='[{"attribute":"data-cmtooltip", "format":"html"}]' tabindex="0" role="link"&gt;acid&lt;/span&gt; (TVA), a fatty acid derived from dairy and meat&lt;/a&gt;, also boosts T-cell activity – but through a different mechanism. Together, the findings suggest that nutrients from both plant and animal sources may provide complementary benefits to immune health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Clinical applications of zeaxanthin&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the results are promising, the researchers emphasize that the work is still at an early stage. Most of the findings come from laboratory experiments and animal studies. Thus, clinical trials will be needed to determine whether zeaxanthin supplements can improve outcomes for cancer patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our findings open a new field of nutritional immunology that looks at how specific dietary components interact with the immune system at the molecular level,” Chen said. “With more research, we may discover natural compounds that make today’s cancer therapies more effective and accessible.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Eating breakfast earlier may be a simple, daily habit that supports better health and a longer life as we age.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Researchers found that later breakfasts were linked to depression, fatigue, poor sleep, and a higher risk of death.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The study highlights “chrononutrition,” showing that when we eat, not just what we eat, impacts healthy aging.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It’s often said that &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.marthastewart.com/creative-breakfast-recipes-8777001" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;breakfast&lt;/a&gt; is the most important meal of the day, and a new study from &lt;a href="https://www.massgeneralbrigham.org/en/about/newsroom/press-releases/meal-timing-in-older-adults-health-and-longevity" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Massachusetts General Brigham&lt;/a&gt; emphasizes the adage. It also indicates an easy change that older adults can make that might boost their &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.marthastewart.com/healthy-aging-guide-7571546" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;health and longevity&lt;/a&gt;. As we get older, what and how we eat tends to change, but until this study, less has been known about how meal timing impacts our health.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Published in Communications Medicine, the &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43856-025-01035-x" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; examined key aspects of meal timing that are significant for aging populations to determine whether certain patterns might signal, or even influence, health outcomes later in life. The research team analyzed data, including blood samples, from 2,945 adults, aged 42 to 94 years old, living in a community in the UK. The study group was followed for more than 20 years. They found that as the older adults aged, they tended to eat breakfast and dinner at later times, while also narrowing the overall time window in which they ate each day. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-impact-of-later-breakfast"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block marthastewart-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Impact of Later Breakfast &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While it might not sound problematic, having a later breakfast time was consistently associated with having physical and mental health conditions, including depression, fatigue, and oral health problems.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Beyond that, the study also noted difficulty with meal preparation and worse sleep were also linked with later mealtimes. Most notably, later breakfast timing was associated with an increased risk of death during follow-up. The researchers adjusted for age in their statistical models—so they weren’t simply comparing older vs. younger participants. Even with these adjustments, they still found that later breakfast timing (specifically) was linked to a higher risk of multimorbidity and mortality.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Lead researcher Hassan Dashti, a nutrition scientist and circadian biologist at Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts General Hospital, explained that the study provides missing information about how the timing of meals evolves in later life and how the shift impacts overall health and longevity. He notes that later meal timing, particularly eating breakfast later, is associated with both health challenges and increased mortality in older adults.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Research on healthy eating has often focused on what should be eaten; this study underlines the importance of chrononutrition, the study of the timing of eating, as a modifiable risk factor for adverse health outcomes. Notably, that meal timing, especially breakfast, could serve as a simple marker of health in older adults and may guide future strategies for healthy aging. It is something that patients and their doctors can be aware of.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Our research suggests that changes in when older adults eat, especially the timing of breakfast, could serve as an easy-to-monitor marker of their overall health status," says Dashti. Also, encouraging older adults to have consistent meal schedules could become part of broader strategies to promote healthy aging and longevity, he adds.

Out of a sample of 149 people, about half of whom had been diagnosed with autism, his test correctly identified more than 97% of the autistic people, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;By comparison, a similar study conducted at Boston Children’s Hospital started with 416 people who were known to be autistic or not. The blood test appeared to be 85% accurate, but the scientists said they needed more samples. They are now following infants who were identified by the blood test to see how reliably it predicts autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hahn subsequently looked for fecal abnormalities in people with autism.

Due to that, he is now looking into the possibility that autism could be cured or its symptoms reduced by changing autistic children’s gut microbiota, such as bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="Inline-1" data-large-id="Inline-3" data-unit="hnp-timesunion.com/article_dtc" class="f jcc mnh250px pb16 aic lg:f lg:jcc lg:mnh250px lg:pb16 lg:aic"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his paper, he acknowledged that dietary differences and small sample sizes could account for the differences found in his and other similar studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hahn, through RPI, defended the research he plans to do as part of the newly announced CDC contract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said the question is worth investigating, even if the study only serves to replicate the results of previous studies — all of which found no connection between vaccinations and autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Professor Hahn believes that science is an ongoing process of discovery and that, as with a large Danish autism study released earlier this year, it can be helpful to revisit complex questions using new datasets in order to deepen our understanding of previous findings,” an RPI spokesman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="Inline-2" data-large-id="Inline-4" data-unit="hnp-timesunion.com/article_dtc" class="f jcc mnh250px pb16 aic lg:f lg:jcc lg:mnh250px lg:pb16 lg:aic"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Danish study of more than 1 million people, published in July in the Annals of Internal Medicine, looked at whether the aluminum in vaccines could lead to autism, allergies, asthma and about 50 other chronic conditions.

Scientific consensus is clear, and further studies are not warranted.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Instead of providing certainty, Dr. Juergen Hahn’s proposed work will provide legitimacy to vaccine skeptics by suggesting that a causal link between vaccination and autism is even conceivable,” Trujillo wrote to the board of trustees. “Vaccine hesitancy is on the rise globally, in part driven by perceived risk of vaccination. In contributing to this hesitancy, (RPI) will be complicit in decreasing vaccination rates, a return of once-defeated diseases like measles, and ultimately, unnecessary suffering and early deaths. I urge the institute to reconsider their CDC contract, for the good of humanity and their own reputation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC is having its own difficulties right now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="Inline-5" data-large-id="Inline-7" data-unit="hnp-timesunion.com/article_dtc" class="f jcc mnh250px pb16 aic lg:f lg:jcc lg:mnh250px lg:pb16 lg:aic"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, its Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices took a vote and then the next day reversed it regarding the shot known as the MMRV — measles, mumps, rubella and chickenpox (which is called varicella). The panel first decided the MMRV &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/cdc-vaccines-acip-hepatitis-b-chickenpox-21623ff8ead38ae1b21db488ee82a1f8" data-link="native" class=""&gt;should not be given to children under the age of 4&lt;/a&gt;, because some young children have febrile seizures after the shot. Febrile seizures aren’t dangerous — they don’t cause brain damage, for example — but they can be terrifying for the caregivers, panel members noted. But they voted to allow the Vaccines for Children program to cover the cost of that vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the next day, the panel decided not to allow the Vaccines for Children program to pay for the MMRV shot. Panel members said &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/19/health/cdc-vaccines-mmrv-hepatitis-b.html" data-link="native" class=""&gt;they were confused&lt;/a&gt; by the wording of the previous day’s proposal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Normally, the vaccine for chickenpox is administered in a separate shot from the vaccine, but at the same visit. But some doctors argued that the combined shot is easier because children only have to endure one needle instead of two. Doctors argued combined shots are especially important in areas where it’s hard to keep the children on the vaccine schedule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Past controversies&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The modern controversy over vaccines and autism traces to a late-1990s study that has since been discredited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="Inline-6" data-large-id="Inline-8" data-unit="hnp-timesunion.com/article_dtc" class="f jcc mnh250px pb16 aic lg:f lg:jcc lg:mnh250px lg:pb16 lg:aic"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A scientist in the UK &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2831678/#:~:text=In%20a%20statement%20published%20on,in%20lawsuits%20against%20vaccine%20manufacturers." data-link="native" class=""&gt;altered study results&lt;/a&gt; in 1998 to make it look like the popular vaccine for measles had caused autism. The scientist, Andrew Wakefield, was at the time trying to market his own version of the measles vaccine. He was exposed by a journalist and &lt;a href="https://www.hcplive.com/view/autism_doctor#:~:text=After%20a%20lengthy%20investigation%2C%20England's,on%20children%20without%20official%20permission." data-link="native" class=""&gt;lost his medical license&lt;/a&gt;. The study was based on 12 children, some of whom actually did not have autism and some of whom had symptoms before vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the idea he proposed, that vaccines given in early childhood could cause autism, has never gone away. It has been studied repeatedly, with no connections found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine is first given when children are around 12 to 15 months old. That’s around the same time that they start to speak. Some parents have described their children as losing skills in babbling, making eye contact and soothing themselves around that time, which leads to an association with the vaccine. That is now diagnosed as “regressive” autism, but doctors do not yet know what causes it; scientists have considered genetic and environmental factors. Statistically, the regression happens around 19 months, long after the vaccine is administered, but it can happen as early as 15 months, which is when the vaccine is often given.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="Inline-7" data-large-id="Inline-9" data-unit="hnp-timesunion.com/article_dtc" class="f jcc mnh250px pb16 aic lg:f lg:jcc lg:mnh250px lg:pb16 lg:aic"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn top"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn bottom"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times Union</author><pubDate>Mon, 22 Sep 2025 19:52:30 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimgFBVV95cUxOb2RVbXNNY29WOXdpb1RRU3pnTDZKTGtZVXgxMGQxZU1ZbjkySEIyb01XZXNmSlNwbWZ1eEhSZ01nMVFZNlRsaVJweXJ2OTFhRHVEcEIxTXZTQTlfSGVIcWJzeDlZWjJicGtmeU9Gb3pBXzBqQTBRek54VlNKQ2d6aWdsZjg3RjBfckZaWkdRVmlUQU9QWVZDanpn</guid></item><item><title>为什么女性要承受痴呆症的负担：解开性别差距- Medical Xpress</title><link>https://medicalxpress.com/news/2025-09-women-burden-dementia-unraveling-sex.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="mt-4 article-main"&gt;

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Research led by Dr. Farida Sohrabji, Regents Professor and director of the Women's Health in Neuroscience Program at Texas A&amp;amp;M University, observed that biological sex significantly increases the risk of stroke in &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/older+women/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;older women&lt;/a&gt;, a condition that accelerates the onset and progression of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"In every decade after 50," explained Sohrabji, "women are more likely to experience stroke compared to men, especially severe strokes. This significantly fuels the risk for &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/cognitive+impairment/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;cognitive impairment&lt;/a&gt; and eventual dementia, and is fundamental for future drug developments and personalized medicine."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A new approach to treatment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sohrabji's findings support a growing body of research in precision medicine, an approach that tailors medical care to individual characteristics, such as biological sex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Similar drugs don't always work as effectively or the same across sexes. Even though the disease or condition may be the same, the effect of treatments on male and female brains may not be," said Sohrabji.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This insight is urgent for Alzheimer's care, where women make up the majority of patients. For women 60 and over, the risk of developing Alzheimer's is almost twice as likely as the risk of breast cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We already customize and personalize treatments for certain cancers," Sohrabji said. "It's fundamental that we do the same for stroke and dementia, and I believe it will lead to better outcomes overall."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sohrabji's lab set out to understand why women are disproportionately affected by dementia and Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One key discovery points to hormonal changes during menopause. As estrogen levels drop, the brains of women become more vulnerable to inflammation, damage and ultimately stroke—known contributors to dementia and Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We found estrogen appears to protect against stroke," she said. "In fact, in models where ovaries are removed, stroke outcomes worsened, yet were reversed with estrogen treatment."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the evidence is complex, and the relationship isn't straightforward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We repeated the same study and used estrogen replacement to see if it would protect older female model populations. To our surprise, it did not," Sohrabji explained. "Estrogen was actually toxic. It made the loss of brain tissue more severe, impairment more severe and when we followed them long term, they showed signs of clear neurodegeneration."&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;h2&gt;The promise of sex-specific therapies&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on these complex results, Sohrabji and her team explored whether a small peptide called IGF-1 (insulin-like growth factor), in combination with estrogen therapy, could improve outcomes for middle-aged female models, and their findings were groundbreaking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only did the combination reverse the usually toxic effects of estrogen to this older group, but subsequent studies showed that IGF-1 treatment alone is sufficient to improve &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/stroke/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;stroke&lt;/a&gt; outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"If you gave the subjects &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/estrogen/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;estrogen&lt;/a&gt; and IGF-1, you clearly see neuroprotective effects," Sohrabji said. "In fact, IGF-1 treatment itself was one of the most neuroprotective molecules we have ever tested."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other work, the researchers tested a small, non-coding RNA molecule, and again, the results were striking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Administering the agent both protected brain tissue and noticeably reduced long-term signs of &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/cognitive+decline/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;cognitive decline&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our findings suggest the agent played a protective role in the process, and it was most effective in older female subjects compared to age-matched males," Sohrabji said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sex differences matter in brain research&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sohrabji's research represents a shift from one-size-fits-all treatments to tailored therapies, adding to a growing call in neuroscience and medicine in recognizing the importance of sex differences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"These differences aren't minor, they're profound. It's why we see women bear the burden of chronic diseases like dementia and Alzheimer's," Sohrabji said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By advancing sex-specific research, Sohrabji is championing a promising future where the burden of Alzheimer's no longer falls hardest on women, and where therapies advance overall human health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"As a basic scientist, and in my personal journeys, we follow our passions to improving human health and to solving these really important problems," Sohrabji said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sohrabji's research studies have been published in the &lt;a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/content/30/20/6852/tab-article-info" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Journal of Neuroscience&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0889159124005300?via%3Dihub" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Brain Behavior and Immunity&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neurobiolaging.2023.05.001" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Neurobiology of Aging&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

From 2014 through 2021, it increased by 3% every year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7a6532" class="body-graf"&gt;Dahut says there’s multiple things driving this increase. One issue is that PSA screenings declined after the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force said the testing did “more harm than good,” in 2012. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4f003d" class="body-graf"&gt;“There was a dramatic fall in men who had PSA testing,” Dahut says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-227340" class="body-graf"&gt;Six years later, that decision was revised and it's now recommended that men between 55 and 70 talk to their doctors about PSA testing, what’s known as informed decision making. Some men should undergo screening because of family history or past abnormal blood testing, while others might not need to check their PSA levels often. But this can be confusing. Today, the percentage of men undergoing PSA screening is low, Dahut adds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-38d3d9" class="body-graf"&gt;“If you look at the history of prostate cancer clinically, you know it can be indolent for years and years, then over time it can evolve to where the cancer is more aggressive and ultimately spread,” Dahut says. “It’s not surprising if screening went down and then over time you would see more men presenting with more advanced disease.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-129a54" class="body-graf"&gt;Dahut notes that other causes can play a role in increasing rates, such as environmental factors, diet and lack of exercise, for example. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-061710" class="body-graf"&gt;Prostate cancer does not have any symptoms until later stages. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-fe8f2a" class="body-graf"&gt;“Symptoms generally occur when the cancer has spread. If it has spread into the bladder, you might get blood in your urine,” Dahut says. “If it spreads to the bones or elsewhere, you have pain, or fatigue, or weight loss.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-653f85" class="body-graf"&gt;Treatment for prostate cancer can include observation, a prostatectomy, radiation and testosterone blocking, also called hormone therapy. Some people diagnosed with early-stage prostate cancer could only ever need observation, which has advanced as MRI technology has improved. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-5a74a2" class="body-graf"&gt;“Some men’s cancer never progresses,” Dahut says. “Men sometimes will opt for treatment because there’s anxiety knowing that there’s a cancer.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-897d7d" class="body-graf"&gt;With prostate cancer, there’s a strong “familial component,” which means knowing one’s family history can be important. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9f9a5b" class="body-graf"&gt;“People are probably not aware of the importance of family history and when one should be screened for prostate cancer,” Dahut says. “It’s not discussed that much. And if you have a strong family history of prostate cancer, you should probably begin discussing screening at age 40, for example.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-d1b76d" class="body-heading"&gt;‘Be Open’ About Prostate Cancer&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-01b4bc" class="body-graf"&gt;Since being diagnosed, Steves has met many cancer survivors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b9a134" class="body-graf"&gt;“What’s astonishing to me or remarkable to me is how secretive it is — unless you’re a member, then people are forthcoming,” he says. “I had friends of mine and work colleagues (who) had prostate cancer, and I never knew.

They found that Streptococcus mutans, best known for causing cavities, can settle in the gut and release metabolites that reach the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These metabolites trigger neuronal loss, neuroinflammation, and motor impairments resembling Parkinson’s. The findings suggest that targeting the oral–gut microbiome could lead to novel strategies for preventing or treating the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oral–Gut–Brain Link:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Streptococcus mutans&lt;/em&gt; can migrate from mouth to gut and affect the brain.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Toxic Metabolite:&lt;/strong&gt; Its metabolite ImP damages dopaminergic neurons and promotes Parkinson’s pathology.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Therapeutic Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; Blocking mTORC1 signaling reduced neuroinflammation and motor symptoms in mice.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;POSTECH&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There is now one more reason to brush your teeth thoroughly every day.

Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;They have identified the mechanism by which metabolites produced by oral bacteria in the gut may trigger the development of Parkinson’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings were published online on September 5 in &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parkinson’s disease is a major neurological disorder characterized by tremors, stiffness, and slowed movement. It affects approximately 1-2% of the global population over the age of 65, making it one of the most common age-related brain diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although previous studies suggested that the gut microbiota of individuals with Parkinson’s differs from that of healthy individuals, the specific microbes and metabolites have remained unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found an increased abundance of &lt;em&gt;Streptococcus mutans&lt;/em&gt;—a well-known oral bacterium that causes dental caries—in the gut microbiome of Parkinson’s patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More importantly, &lt;em&gt;S. mutans&lt;/em&gt; produces the enzyme urocanate reductase (UrdA) and its metabolite imidazole propionate (ImP), both of which were present at elevated levels in the gut and blood of patients. ImP appeared capable of entering systemic circulation, reaching the brain, and contributing to the loss of dopaminergic neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using mouse models, the researchers introduced &lt;em&gt;S. mutans&lt;/em&gt; into the gut or engineered &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; to express UrdA. As a result, the mice showed elevated ImP levels in blood and brain tissue, along with the hallmark features of Parkinson’s symptoms: loss of dopaminergic neurons, heightened neuroinflammation, impaired motor function, and increased aggregation of alpha-synuclein, a protein central to disease progression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further experiments demonstrated that these effects depend on the activation of the signaling protein complex mTORC1. Treating mice with an mTORC1 inhibitor significantly reduced neuroinflammation, neuronal loss, and alpha-synuclein aggregation, and motor dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This suggests that targeting the oral–gut microbiome and its metabolites may offer new therapeutic strategies for Parkinson’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our study provides a mechanistic understanding of how oral microbes in the gut can influence the brain and contribute to the development of Parkinson’s disease,” said Professor Ara Koh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It highlights the potential of targeting the gut microbiota as a therapeutic strategy, offering a new direction for Parkinson’s treatment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;The research was supported by the Samsung Research Funding &amp;amp; Incubation Center of Samsung Electronics, the Mid-Career Researcher Program of the Ministry of Science and ICT, the Microbiome Core Research Support Center, and the Biomedical Technology Development Program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this Parkinsons’s disease research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#88e3f1edbebcb8bfc8f8e7fbfcedebe0a6e9eba6e3fa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Yung-Eui Kang&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://postech.ac.kr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;POSTECH&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Yung-Eui Kang – POSTECH&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-63473-4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Gut microbial production of imidazole propionate drives Parkinson’s pathologies&lt;/a&gt;” by Ara Koh et al. &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gut microbial production of imidazole propionate drives Parkinson’s pathologies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parkinson’s disease (PD) is characterized by the selective degeneration of midbrain dopaminergic neurons and aggregation of α-synuclein. Emerging evidence implicates the gut microbiome in PD, with microbial metabolites proposed as potential pathological mediators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the specific microbes and metabolites involved, and whether gut-derived metabolites can reach the brain to directly induce neurodegeneration, remain unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here we show that elevated levels of &lt;em&gt;Streptococcus mutans&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;S. mutans&lt;/em&gt;) and its enzyme urocanate reductase (UrdA), which produces imidazole propionate (ImP), in the gut microbiome of patients with PD, along with increased plasma ImP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colonization of mice with &lt;em&gt;S. mutans&lt;/em&gt; harboring UrdA or &lt;em&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/em&gt; expressing UrdA from &lt;em&gt;S. mutans&lt;/em&gt; increases systemic and brain ImP levels, inducing PD-like symptoms including dopaminergic neuronal loss, astrogliosis, microgliosis, and motor impairment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, &lt;em&gt;S. mutans&lt;/em&gt; exacerbates α-synuclein pathology in a mouse model. ImP administration alone recapitulates key PD features, supporting the UrdA–ImP axis as a microbial driver of PD pathology. Mechanistically, mTORC1 activation is crucial for both &lt;em&gt;S. mutans&lt;/em&gt;– and ImP-induced PD pathology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, these findings identify microbial ImP, produced via UrdA, as a direct pathological mediator of the gut-brain axis in PD.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Mon, 22 Sep 2025 18:21:03 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMid0FVX3lxTFBZZ1ZwUWpCSVJ0QW0tRS1xRkw0Y3RzYV9PVW1qSGUyVk5WOUc5akctNVRGdGZPVFNHZkxLR2lLLVY3ZGtVRWR2ckEzNzBNQmc2MUFDWGRUVjROQVVlY1p5NXpNdVphVXJxNW85NkNwejI2WF9HQnJZ</guid></item><item><title>家长浏览有关儿童疫苗建议的混合消息- CBS新闻</title><link>https://www.cbsnews.com/news/vaccines-child-immunization-recommendations-parents/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="content__body"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Parents are navigating mixed messaging about &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cdc-acip-recap-measles-mmrv-covid-vaccines/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;childhood vaccinations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; from federal and state officials. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The impact of the mixed messaging is being seen inside doctors offices like pediatrician David Butler's office in Fort Myers, Florida. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First-time father Brandon Gonsalves, who is also a nurse practitioner, told Butler he's "not too sure yet" what his plans are for future vaccinations for his newborn. Gonsalves decided against vaccinating his baby for hepatitis B, which the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention currently recommends be done at birth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, the panel that advises the CDC on vaccines &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/live-updates/cdc-vaccine-advisory-panel-covid-19-hepatitis-b-vaccines/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;delayed a vote&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; that would have recommended moving the hepatitis B shot from birth to one month. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hepatitis-b/symptoms-causes/syc-20366802" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Hepatitis B&lt;/a&gt;, a liver infection, can cause long-term health problems such as liver disease, cirrhosis and cancer. The vaccine at birth has been a long-standing recommendation and has a history of safety.  &lt;/p&gt;

    
&lt;p id="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" data-ad="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" class="ad-mpu-plus-outstream-middle ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='"mpu-plus-outstream-middle"'&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Butler worries some families are making vaccine decisions based on politics or online research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's difficult because me, myself, all of my colleagues, all we wanna do is provide the best care we can for your child. They have their minds made up before they come in," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;COVID and chicken pox vaccines &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC advisory panel — called the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices and comprised of members who were hand-picked and appointed by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. — &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/live-updates/cdc-vaccine-advisory-panel-covid-19-hepatitis-b-vaccines/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;voted&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; last week to stop recommending the COVID-19 vaccines for everybody, leaving it up to individuals, but not requiring a prescription. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC had &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cdc-kids-covid-19-vaccine-recommendation/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;already changed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; its guidance, earlier this year, on COVID vaccines for children, saying parents should discuss the benefits with a health care provider. That prompted the &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/covid-19-shot-recommendations-american-academy-of-pediatrics-cdc/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;American Academy of Pediatrics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to share a recommendation differing from the agency for the first time in 30 years. The AAP is "strongly recommending" COVID-19 shots for children ages 6 months to 2 years old.&lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="mpu-flex-inc3" data-ad="mpu-flex-inc" class="ad-mpu-flex-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["mpu-flex-inc",3]'&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The advisory panel &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/live-updates/cdc-vaccine-advisory-committee-rfk-jr-vote-measles-hepatitis-b/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;also recommended&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; last week that the chicken pox vaccine be separated from the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine for children under 4 years old, rather than them being given together as a single vaccine, which is currently an option for parents who prefer to reduce the number of shots their child receives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The panel's recommendations must be approved by the CDC director to take effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;State-level changes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amid the changes at the federal level, some states are making their own adjustments. Many states are now disregarding CDC recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seven states led by Democrats in the Northeast formed a coalition, and four other states make up a new West Coast health alliance. Both groups are encouraging widespread vaccinations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Florida Surgeon General Dr. Joseph Ladapo said the state plans to &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/florida-surgeon-general-school-vaccine-requirements/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;roll back vaccine mandates&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; altogether. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Butler said "you've got to expect" more sick children as a result. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's what concerns mom Marcella Farah, whose 2-year-old is up to date with her vaccines and was getting a flu shot recently. &lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="mpu-flex-inc4" data-ad="mpu-flex-inc" class="ad-mpu-flex-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["mpu-flex-inc",4]'&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It's a little dangerous to not get vaccines," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked what she's heard from other parents, Farah said, "Everybody's a little bit more confused, but I think a lot of people are still very strong in their own beliefs."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, said he expects confusion around the COVID vaccine due to the panel's vote. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What I think it means is that people are going to be uncertain whether or not the COVID-19 vaccine is a benefit to them," he &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/video/cdc-vaccine-panel-says-covid-19-shots-individual-choice/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;told CBS News on Friday&lt;/a&gt;. "I think it would have been much better to make a very pointed recommendation for those in high-risk groups to get the vaccine, and for those in low-risk groups, that's where individual decision-making makes sense."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amid the confusion, &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/vaccination-rates-kindergarteners-fall-exemptions-rise/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;data from the CDC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; shows vaccination rates among kindergartners during the 2024-2025 school year decreased for all reported vaccines from the year before. &lt;/p&gt;

But there’s no hiding from a surveillance app.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;To see just how bad things have been getting for my husband I downloaded SnoreLab, one of several free phone apps that tracks and (mortifyingly)&lt;span class="paywall-EAB47CFD"&gt; records your nocturnal noise levels. It showed that last Wednesday I snored for 49 per cent of the 7 hours 16 minutes I was asleep — half an hour of that “loudly”. On Thursday and Friday it was 20 per cent of the night, and on Saturday 35 per cent. Playing back the “audio evidence”, my phone broadcasts the regular growlings, bursting every so often into night-splitting harrumphs. Could that really be me? Often for two to three hours a night?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="paywall-EAB47CFD"&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;However, help could now be at hand in the form of a wearable device called a Zeus, which has been 15 years in development by the respiration and sleep experts at Guy’s and St Thomas’ NHS Foundation Trust and King’s College London. After three positive clinical trials, next month it will begin a £1.5 million trial across six NHS trusts, funded by the National Institute for Health and Care Research. The aim is for it to be endorsed as an NHS treatment for snoring and the more serious condition of obstructive sleep apnoea, which is at present treated with a cumbersome mask you strap to your face each night called a &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/uk/healthcare/article/cpap-sleep-disorder-device-cuts-risk-of-needing-ventilator-rd2fwgv9r" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) machine&lt;/a&gt;. This new device promises to be a lot less intrusive but will it work for me?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/business-money/companies/article/sleep-tech-health-fitness-trackers-qcmpnkvcc" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Gen Zzzs: Is ‘sleep tech’ really on a par with fitness trackers?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;First, what exactly makes some 41 per cent of the UK adult population — and yes almost as many women as men, even if they are less likely to admit it — snore? Snoring happens when the muscles that support our tongue and throat relax when we are asleep, causing our upper airway to narrow, explains Professor Joerg Steier, who led the Zeus team and is a consultant in respiratory and sleep medicine at Guy’s and St Thomas’. This narrowing makes the walls in our upper airway flutter or touch, causing a noise as air passes through with each breath.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt; “When we are awake the brain tells our muscles to keep that upper airway wide open, which is why we don’t snore in the day,” he says. “But in sleep, when we go into our ‘standby mode’, the activity that the brain uses to activate these muscles drops out and the walls are no longer supported.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Contributing to the narrowing airway is the fact that our tongue tends to glide backwards as we relax and gets further pulled by gravity when we lie down, typically on our backs, which is the sleeping position most likely to result in snoring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Loud snoring isn’t bad for us, Steier says, but if the walls touch enough that the airway closes, that becomes obstructive sleep apnoea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“The air is blocked so you momentarily stop breathing, which then typically wakes you up,” Steier says. People with sleep apnoea will have their sleep broken many times a night — as many as 100 — which could lead to long-term health issues including chronic sleepiness, depression and cardiovascular health risks, according to Steier, who has spent the past 20 years researching treatments for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;A 2023 Snoring and Sleep &lt;a href="https://sleepreviewmag.com/sleep-disorders/breathing-disorders/snoring/global-study-reveals-high-prevalence-snoring" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; found that almost half of men and a third of women snore. A separate YouGov &lt;a href="https://yougov.co.uk/society/articles/2240-does-your-partner-snore" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;survey&lt;/a&gt; in the UK found that women admit to snoring much less than men. And it gets worse with age: 77 per cent of 55 to 64-year-olds reportedly snore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;It’s also exacerbated by obesity and by the menopause, when women lose the elasticity in their muscles. Even &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/uk/healthcare/article/dr-mark-porter-why-your-snoring-could-be-a-wake-up-call-to-something-more-serious-8lj9wvxvq" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;just one glass of wine over dinner adds to the problem&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“Alcohol, even a small amount, makes us more relaxed and that means our muscles are more relaxed so the airway is more collapsible,” Steier says. “The amount of alcohol that would stop you driving a car is making it likely you start snoring.” This might explain why I was particularly noisy on Wednesday night, after going to a book launch, and on Saturday, after meeting friends in the pub.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/life-style/luxury/article/most-effective-snoring-solutions-times-luxury-pkf2p6gsj" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;The most effective — and chic — snoring solutions&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Until now the most common remedies are to try to lie on your side or front when you sleep, which helps to prevent the tongue shifting backwards, or to wear a mouthpiece that helps to keep the tongue forward. My desperate husband often nudges me in the night to turn over but if I do I sometimes even wake myself up with a great harrumph, I am not keen to wear a mouthpiece — my Invisalign night retainer is pain enough — let alone strap on a Darth Vaderish CPAP mask. Blowing pressurised room air into your upper airway to keep it open may be an effective treatment for sleep apnoea but 30 per cent of people who try the device get fed up with using it within a year, according to the Sleep Apnoea Trust (it estimates that as many as &lt;a href="https://sleep-apnoea-trust.org/research" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;eight million people&lt;/a&gt; in the UK may have the issue to some degree).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;The medical team behind the new Zeus device — which has been developed in conjunction with an award-winning British biomedical engineering company, Morgan Innovation and Technology — hope snorers will find their invention unobtrusive enough to wear easily at night. It is shaped like a tiny boomerang and you attach it under your chin with a sticky pad before you go to sleep. It’s not the most glamorous of bedroom accessories but then there’s little glamour in turning into a warthog of a night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;The Zeus works by using a mini Tens machine (short for transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation) to deliver small electrical impulses to stimulate the genioglossus muscle that holds the tongue in place, with the aim of keeping it toned. “The initial thought was that it doesn’t take a lot for the brain to keep the upper airway in shape when we’re awake but this tone falls away when we fall asleep,” Steier says. “So we thought if we could maintain that tone, we won’t even need a big contraction of the muscles. We just need enough to keep the upper airway in shape. And how do we do this? Could we use electrical stimulation?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Tens machines are used to help relieve back pain, period and labour pain, and arthritis by stimulating targeted muscles to improve blood flow. In the Zeus, stimulation is directed under the jaw. It is also possible to stimulate the genioglossus muscle via an implant linked to the hyperglossal nerve but, Steier says, “We wanted to find a way to stimulate this muscle without the need for surgery.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/article/struggling-with-snoring-blowing-through-a-conch-might-help-80t9gp626" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Struggling with snoring? Blowing through a conch might help&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;To operate it you adjust tiny knobs embedded in it until you can feel the vibrations but not to such an extent that they keep you awake. The device then waits 20 minutes for you to fall asleep before starting up. Until it is endorsed as a NHS medical treatment, it is on sale for £250.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;So did it help me? In truth my experience has not been the slam dunk my husband prayed for. On the first night, it fell off while I was asleep — it turns out that night cream will stop it sticking, which may be a deal breaker for a lot of women. Although according to Nigel Clarke, CEO of Morgan Innovation and Technology, in the long term electrical stimulation may help to tone the neck, which would be quite the bonus. On the second night I had higher hopes, drifting off to the feeling of tiny buzzes in my jaw. However, I woke to find that my SnoreLab score was still terrible — I’d snored for an hour and a half, 20 minutes of that loudly. “Like a drunken sergeant,” as my husband put it. Oh, the mortification. And how disappointing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;In the three clinical trials during its development, 60 per cent of a total of 109 patients found that the technology lowered their sleep apnoea. Meanwhile, in an additional 2022 trial with 17 patients, conducted by the sleep charity Hope2Sleep, 82 per cent said that it helped them to reduce their snoring. And in a 2024 clinical trial on 48 sleep apnoea patients in a Dorset County Hospital NHS Trust, 84 per cent reported better quality of sleep. So far 1,500 devices have been sold worldwide, with fewer than 5 per cent being returned under a money back guarantee, Clarke says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Dr Allie Hare, consultant in sleep medicine at the Royal Brompton Hospital and co-founder of the specialist Grace Sleep clinic, also believes the device “is a helpful addition to the treatment options for snoring and milder forms of sleep”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/article/snoring-problem-marriage-experience-first-person-hjw37lf23" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;OK, I admit it — I’m a snorer. It’s my dirty (noisy) bedtime secret&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;So was I doing something wrong? Steier says that the device works best if the reason you snore is that your tongue is moving backwards and blocking your airway. But if it’s being blocked by other issues, such as the vertical walls losing their tone, then pulling the tongue back may not make a difference. Maybe I am one of those cases. Or was it simply operator error?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;For the subsequent four trial nights, I stuck it a bit further under my chin and it certainly seemed to work better — my snore scores for those nights were significantly lower. One morning my husband said he thought I’d left to sleep in another room as our bedroom was so uncharacteristically quiet. It’s not perfect but, while my SnoreLab app has replayed some continued grumblings, it’s now more creaky door than full warthog. I think we’d take that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;And despite the way it looks, it is fairly easy to get used to wearing it once you’ve faffed about with sticky pads and remembered to charge it every day, so I’m prepared to persevere. After all, research by Zeus suggests that in snoring households, 28 per cent of partners end up sleeping in separate rooms. We’re not at that stage yet. The Zeus may look like a passion killer but if my husband can have his nights back, I’m sure we can work around it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="last-paragraph" class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;&lt;a href="http://zeussleeps.com/" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;zeussleeps.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times</author><pubDate>Mon, 22 Sep 2025 18:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqAFBVV95cUxPOTJCT20tVGl2blFPcmt0LWFqS1htT1FUbm5LRTRUSmhPOWdUcjlRS0lUTEpfeWNYc053ZU5PVUpaa2c2a05CNHBGbG9kLUlzVGxJZ3BJdFQzZ0g4VE9PSVRWVDBMTThkOUZOOWFwTlMxNTZBMDRIVjZkaWd1bDMwNmF0VThtQS02dWhMQnJSVVRDaDNlTmR4dWY3NVgweWlhcm9LMDF2b0U</guid></item><item><title>一次血液测试可以测量我们身体不同部位的衰老情况- Medical Xpress</title><link>https://medicalxpress.com/news/2025-09-blood-bodies-aging.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="mt-4 article-main"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our bodies do not age at a uniform rate. The speed at which one organ ages can differ greatly from another due to a range of lifestyle, environmental and genetic factors. Conventional tests provide a single number for overall biological age, but they do not indicate which parts of the body are aging the fastest.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                &lt;p class="w-100 my-4 d-print-none"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Now, scientists have developed a single blood test that can measure the aging of 11 different physiological systems, offering a more detailed and personalized look at how our bodies are changing over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For years, scientists have relied on epigenetic clocks, which use DNA changes in the blood to estimate &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/biological+age/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;biological age&lt;/a&gt;. They can give more insights than chronological age but are still not very precise. In a paper &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-025-00958-3" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;i&gt;Nature Aging&lt;/i&gt;, scientists describe how they set out to develop a new test for the aging status of different parts of the body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A more precise look at biological aging&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, the team collected vast amounts of health data, including medical histories, blood tests, grip strength and other physical measurements, from about 7,500 people. They looked for clear links between blood-based biomarkers, such as cholesterol and blood sugar levels, and age-related conditions in several organs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the team used machine learning to connect these findings with DNA methylation patterns from a single blood sample. DNA methylation is the process by which DNA adds or removes chemical tags that switch genes on and off, and which change over time. By training a computer to recognize these patterns, scientists created the Systems Age test, which can calculate a unique score for the biological age of 11 physiological systems. These include the heart, lung, brain, metabolic and immune system.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;After training their model, the researchers tested it on blood samples of more than 8,000 people. They found that it was better at predicting specific diseases and aging-related conditions than the single-number biological age scores from older epigenetic clocks. For example, the test's heart score was a stronger predictor of heart disease than a standard biological age test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers also found that individuals with the same overall Systems Age could have very different patterns of aging across their physiological systems. Knowing this could help doctors provide more targeted treatments to individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"By providing system-specific scores, Systems Age may better pinpoint which age-related conditions individuals are at risk for," wrote Morgan Levine, one of the authors of the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, if your &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/immune+system/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;immune system&lt;/a&gt; is aging faster than your lungs or heart, your doctor might recommend specific strategies to boost your immunity. Or if your heart score is high, a doctor could suggest lifestyle changes or medications to target cardiovascular health.&lt;/p&gt;
