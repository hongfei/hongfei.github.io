			&lt;p&gt;New evidence confirms a long-held theory that people with  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/schizophrenia" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73022" data-postid="178283" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;schizophrenia&lt;/a&gt; hear 'voices' in their heads by misattributing inner speech as external.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"This idea's been around for 50 years, but it's been very difficult to test because inner speech is inherently private," &lt;a href="https://www.scimex.org/newsfeed/brainwave-study-sheds-light-on-cause-of-hearing-voices"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Thomas Whitford, a psychology researcher at the University of New South Wales.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using EEG (&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroencephalography"&gt;electroencephalography&lt;/a&gt;) to measure brainwaves, Whitford and his colleagues tested the way that the brain reacts to inner speech, and, in people with schizophrenia, the way their brains react to auditory hallucinations.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-identify-brain-signal-disruptions-behind-voices-in-schizophrenia"&gt;Scientists Identify Brain Signal Disruptions Behind Voices in Schizophrenia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"When we speak – even just in our heads – the part of the brain that processes sounds from the outside world becomes less active," Whitford &lt;a href="https://www.scimex.org/newsfeed/brainwave-study-sheds-light-on-cause-of-hearing-voices"&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt;. "This is because the brain predicts the sound of our own voice. But in people who hear voices, this prediction seems to go wrong, and the brain reacts as if the voice is coming from someone else."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants included 55 people with schizophrenia and recent auditory hallucinations, 44 people with schizophrenia but no recent auditory hallucinations, and 43 people with no history of schizophrenia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cohort was asked to listen to audio over headphones and to say either 'bah' or 'bih' in their minds at the same time that they heard a sound played. This sound was also either 'bah' or 'bih', but participants did not know if their choice of internally voiced word would match what they heard in their headphones.&lt;br&gt;
When the inner speech matched the external sound, the brains of the participants who had experienced recent auditory hallucinations reacted far more strongly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"In healthy people, using inner speech produces the same kind of reduction in brain activity as when they speak out loud," Whitford &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.scimex.org/newsfeed/brainwave-study-sheds-light-on-cause-of-hearing-voices"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. "But in people who hear voices, that reduction of activity doesn't happen. In fact, their brains react even more strongly to inner speech, as if it's coming from someone else. That might help explain why the voices feel so real."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/spark-into-space-comp?utm_source=promo_astro"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg" alt="Mid Article Promo Astro" class="alignnone wp-image-177074 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro.jpg 844w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This suggests that the 'voices' people with schizophrenia hear are their own inner speech, which their brain wrongly perceives as external. These findings may help doctors identify who is at risk of psychosis even before it occurs, which could allow for early intervention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/schbul/sbaf167"&gt;Schizophrenia Bulletin&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

According to Dr Sudhir Kumar, the real game-changer for your health might just be something you can do right beside your chair — &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a ref="dofollow" data-ga-onclick="Inarticle articleshow link click#Magazines#href" href="/topic/squats" target="_blank"&gt;squats&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;. Turns out, taking short &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a ref="dofollow" data-ga-onclick="Inarticle articleshow link click#Magazines#href" href="/topic/exercise" target="_blank"&gt;exercise&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; breaks during the day can do far more for your heart and blood sugar than one long workout after work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Sudhir Kumar, a renowned neurologist, recently shared on X that just 10 squats every 45 minutes are more effective in controlling &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a ref="dofollow" data-ga-onclick="Inarticle articleshow link click#Magazines#href" href="/topic/blood-sugar-levels" target="_blank"&gt;blood sugar levels&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; than a single 30-minute walk, especially for those who sit for long hours. He explained that prolonged sitting — whether at your desk or while binge-watching — increases the risk of obesity, diabetes, and heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-mid-newpos-mgid="mgid_124633975" id="div-mgid-mid-newpos-124633975"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added that even brief bursts of movement can help undo the damage caused by sitting too long. Short activities like squats or three-minute walks every 45 minutes keep your body active and metabolism in check — something a once-a-day workout doesn’t fully achieve. So, the next time your smartwatch nudges you to “stand up,” maybe throw in a quick round of squats. Your body will thank you more than that post-dinner stroll ever could.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="E_3" class="etoro"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;About Squats&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Healthline, squats are a fundamental movement that engages multiple muscles and joints, making them one of the most effective exercises for overall strength and mobility. Squats primarily target the lower body — glutes, quadriceps, hamstrings, adductors, hip flexors, and calves — while also activating core muscles like the rectus abdominis, obliques, and erector spinae. Advanced variations, such as back or overhead squats, even involve shoulders, arms, and back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-grx-impression="Article Recommendations - Edit#articleshow_inline_impression#magazines/panache/forget-long-walks-apollo-neurologist-suggests-one-simple-exercise-you-can-do-at-home-that-can-protect-your-heart-and-sugar-levels | " class="ar_wrp arwd_ld_chk font_mon clr hide custom_ad"&gt;&lt;div class="ar_survey hide"&gt;&lt;p class="ar_back_btn"&gt;&lt;span class="arb_btn"&gt;&lt;span class="ar_lt_arr"&gt;«&lt;/span&gt; Back to recommendation stories&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-mid-vdoai="vdoai_124633975" id="div-vdoai-mid-124633975"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Squats strengthen your core, improve posture, reduce injury risk, and enhance lower-body strength, helping with daily movements like walking, climbing, or lifting. They also burn calories and boost athletic performance, especially with jump squat variations. With countless variations and no equipment needed for bodyweight squats, they’re versatile and can be done anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-size="[[300, 250], [600, 250], [600, 300]]" data-adsslot="/7176/Economictimes/ET_News/ET_News_ROS/ET_News_ROS_MID_INTL_300" data-loc="100" id="div-gpt-ad-858478126-1-124633975" class="country_specAD"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p data-size="[[300, 250], [600, 250], [600, 300]]" data-adsslot="/7176/Economictimes/ET_News/ET_News_ROS/ET_News_ROS_MID1_INTL_300" data-loc="2" id="div-gpt-ad-858478132-1-124633975" class="country_specAD2nd"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-size="[[300, 250], [600, 250], [600, 300]]" data-adsslot="/7176/Economictimes/ET_News/ET_News_ROS/ET_News_ROS_MID1_INTL_300" data-loc="5" id="div-gpt-ad-858478132-1-124633975" class="country_specAD2nd"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-size="[[300, 250], [600, 250], [600, 300]]" data-adsslot="/7176/Economictimes/ET_News/ET_News_ROS/ET_News_ROS_MID1_INTL_300" data-loc="3" id="div-gpt-ad-858478132-1-124633975" class="country_specAD2nd"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;meta content="cms.article3" name="cmsei-article3"&gt;&lt;div class="inSideInd"&gt;&lt;div data-ga-action="Preference Banner InArticle Widget" data-ga-impression="Preference Banner InArticle Widget#Impressions | Preference Banner | Articleshow#url" class="Pbanner"&gt;&lt;div class="Pbannertext"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Add &lt;/p&gt;&lt;img alt="ET Logo" src="https://img.etimg.com/photo/123467569.cms"&gt;&lt;p&gt; as a Reliable and Trusted News Source&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Economic Times</author><pubDate>Tue, 21 Oct 2025 03:38:24 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>研究警告称，削减抗疟疾资金可能导致“有史以来最致命的复苏” --《卫报》</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/oct/21/global-health-infectious-disease-aid-cuts-malaria-funding-cost-deaths-gdp-africa</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body-commercial-selector article-body-viewer-selector dcr-11jq3zt"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Slashed contributions from wealthy countries to an anti-malaria fund could allow a resurgence of the disease, costing millions of lives and billions of pounds by the end of the decade, according to a new analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The fight against malaria faces new threats, including extreme weather and humanitarian crises increasing the number of people exposed, and growing biological resistance to insecticides and drugs, the report warns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Gareth Jenkins, of &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/malaria" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Malaria&lt;/a&gt; No More UK, said: “Cutting funding risks the deadliest resurgence we’ve ever seen.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Analysts said the cost to sub-Saharan &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/africa" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Africa&lt;/a&gt; would be substantial, and the region’s leaders have appealed to the G7 to maintain investment.

The fund provides &lt;a href="https://www.theglobalfund.org/en/malaria/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;nearly 60% of all international financing for malaria&lt;/a&gt; controls, such as mosquito nets and preventive drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;If funding was 20% lower than in the last round, researchers said there would be an additional 33 million cases and 82,000 deaths, and $5.14bn (£3.83bn) in lost GDP by 2030, according to the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;However, funding cuts look likely. Germany &lt;a href="https://www.devex.com/news/germany-commits-1b-to-global-fund-as-aid-cuts-shape-world-health-summit-111081" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;pledged $1bn &lt;/a&gt;to the fund last week, a figure &lt;a href="https://globalfundadvocatesnetwork.org/gfan-2025-pledge-tracker/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;23% lower&lt;/a&gt; than its last promise. The UK government is &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/oct/16/proposed-uk-cuts-global-aid-fund-preventable-deaths-charities" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;reportedly looking at a figure 20% down&lt;/a&gt; on its previous commitment, although it says no final decision has been made.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;If a funding vacuum led to preventive malaria control collapsing entirely, the report estimates there would be 525 million more cases, 990,000 more deaths and $83bn in lost GDP. About 750,000 of those deaths would be of children under five, representing “the loss of a generation to malaria”, the report’s authors warned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="c4e62d95-7a45-4fb0-a60e-e334aee6e920" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-47fhrn"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":10,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"Proposed UK cuts to global aid fund could lead to 300,000 preventable deaths, say charities","elementId":"c4e62d95-7a45-4fb0-a60e-e334aee6e920","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/oct/16/proposed-uk-cuts-global-aid-fund-preventable-deaths-charities"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":0,"display":0,"theme":0}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Conversely, they said that if the Global Fund received the &lt;a href="https://globalfundadvocatesnetwork.org/gfan-2025-pledge-tracker/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;full $18bn&lt;/a&gt; it was asking for, there would be a $230bn boost to GDP, 865 million fewer cases and 1.86 million fewer deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Phumaphi said there had been “marked increases in [domestic] budget allocation not just to health, but specifically to malaria, particularly since the beginning of this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But she added: “I think we need to appreciate the enormity of the challenge and exactly how much is required in funding in order for countries to be able to catch up.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;African countries heavily burdened by servicing debt and the economic aftershocks of Covid-19 were facing not only infectious diseases but also a growing epidemic of non-communicable diseases such as diabetes and cancer, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;It was worrying, Phumaphi said, that donor countries were considering pledging less than in the last round, “but we are grateful that countries like Germany have pledged substantial amounts – a billion is quite a substantial amount.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="1e12a2b9-bc82-4a4a-b8bd-7f407d0b3617" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-fd61eq"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Rising biological resistance to insecticides and anti-malarial drugs is one of the challenges faced by the fight to eradicate the disease.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Desire Danga Essigue/Reuters&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The former Botswana health minister said she was hopeful that wealthy individuals, the private sector and foundations would step up “because when we talk about productivity, jobs [and the] economic potential that Africa tends to lose, we are talking about potential investments and markets for the private sector”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;One of those individuals, the Nigerian businessman Aliko Dangote, encouraged others to join him in filling the funding gap: “Malaria is not just a health crisis; it is an $83bn brake on Africa’s growth and enterprise.

&lt;p&gt;Highmark will start covering Noom — a subscription-based app that claims to enable weight loss by harnessing psychological research — at no cost for nearly 2 million members next year.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The health insurer announced the partnership Monday, touting it as a way for members to make lasting changes to their eating and exercise habits.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearly 74% of U.S. adults are overweight or obese, costing the health care system $173 billion a year and presenting “one of the nation’s most urgent health challenges,” according to Highmark.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Noom resists the “diet” label, though it does rely on a color-coded food tracking system to steer users toward healthier options. It also incorporates daily lessons, quizzes and activities.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As CEO Geoff Cook recently put it to news outlet &lt;a href="https://qz.com/1990200/what-is-noom" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Quartz&lt;/a&gt;, Noom wants to rely on gamified, daily engagement to become the “Duolingo of health.”

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A year-long subscription to Noom’s weight-loss plan costs $209.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Highmark will fully cover Noom for members not on a Medicare Advantage Plan who have a body mass index of 25 or greater. The subscription is merely discounted below that threshold.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hope is that people can better manage their weight or diabetes to avoid dangerous — and expensive — complications like heart disease, said Tracy Saula, chief product and experience officer at Highmark Health.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A lot of money in the health care industry is spent on treating those diseases, but not nearly enough money in the industry is spent on saying, ‘how do we prevent those diseases?’ ” Saula said.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cody Fair, Noom’s chief commercial officer, said Highmark members will be able to access “AI-powered tools like body scan technology” and “smart food logging.” Some features available to members aren’t included in the version of the app available to the general public.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The insurer will send out enrollment instructions closer to the program’s start.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From there, members must go through an initial assessment to determine which tier of the program is best for them. Some focus just on weight loss, while others include diabetes management or advice specific to people on GLP-1 drugs, like Ozempic.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Noom app first launched in 2016 but didn’t achieve widespread popularity until the covid pandemic. As it gained users — eclipsing 45 million worldwide by 2021 — the app also amassed critics.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maria Baker, vice president of health strategy and delivery at Highmark Health, said she’s aware of common concerns, including that Noom’s psychological tips could lead to eating disorders.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are protocols in place to prevent this, according to Baker, including an initial assessment that looks at a person’s relationship with food.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If someone is displaying eating disorder indicators, they are not enrolled in one of the programs, they are actually referred back to Highmark,” she said.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From there, Highmark might recommend the patient talk to a clinician or case manager to decide whether Noom is appropriate for them.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Noom says it has authored more than 40 peer-reviewed scientific articles supporting its methods. Still, some users and experts say Noom’s marketing underplays the degree to which it’s a traditional diet.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The New York City-based company also provides GLP-1 drugs, including through a “microdose program” that’s meant to address affordability challenges.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Highmark, whose &lt;a href="https://triblive.com/local/regional/highmark-study-surgery-beats-drugs-like-ozempic-for-those-looking-to-lose-weight/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;researchers recently found&lt;/a&gt; weight-loss surgery often beats GLP-1 drugs on both cost and effectiveness, is not entrusting Noom with prescribing these medications.

&lt;/p&gt;

                        &lt;p&gt;An adult traveled through the Seattle-Tacoma International Airport (SEA) with measles, Public Health – Seattle and King County &lt;a href="https://kingcounty.gov/en/dept/dph/about-king-county/about-public-health/news/news-archive-2025/10-17-measles-exposure" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The adult, a resident of Arizona, traveled from an area with an active measles outbreak and was not vaccinated, officials stated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The person &lt;a href="https://kingcounty.gov/en/dept/dph/health-safety/disease-illness/measles" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;was at SEA&lt;/a&gt; on October 13 from 11:30 a.m. to 2:40 p.m. in the C Concourse at Gate C9, the Green Train Line, and the N Concourse at Gate N5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officials noted the person traveled before they discovered they were infected and before any rash appeared, but the virus can stay in the air for up to two hours after the infected person leaves the area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Those exposed to measles at SEA would become sick Oct. 20 to Nov. 3&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those exposed at the airport and not immune to measles would become sick between October 20 and November 3, while immunocompromised people may take longer to experience symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Measles is a highly contagious and potentially severe disease that causes fever, rash, cough, runny nose, and red, watery eyes,” Public Health – Seattle and King County stated on its website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If one person gets sick, up to 9 out of 10 people nearby can become infected if unprotected. It mainly spreads through the air after a person coughs or sneezes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Symptoms begin seven to 21 days after exposure, and the disease is contagious from around four days before the rash appears to about four days after.&lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;p&gt;
                        
                    &lt;/p&gt;
                
&lt;p&gt;“Measles can lead to ear infections, diarrhea, pneumonia, and rarely, encephalitis (brain inflammation) or death,” officials stated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Infants, children under 5-years-old, adults over 20 years, pregnant people, and people with weakened immune systems are most at risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The disease is preventable with the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officials noted there have been &lt;a href="https://doh.wa.gov/you-and-your-family/illness-and-disease-z/measles/measles-cases-washington-state-2025" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;11 other cases&lt;/a&gt; of measles in Washingto resdients this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Fast food often gets a bad reputation, but surprisingly it can fit into a healthy lifestyle with a little bit of planning and mindfulness. During busy days, sometimes fast food, like &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-breakfasts-at-chick-fil-a-8751741" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Chick-fil-A, may be the most convenient&lt;/a&gt; and realistic choice. &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/my-favorite-high-protein-chick-fil-a-salad-11741327" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Chick-fil-A is one of the most popular fast-food chains&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S. They’re known for their crispy chicken and signature sauces, but they also have several menu options that can fit more easily into a balanced diet. After speaking with a few registered dietitians, one menu item that stood out was the Market Salad with Grilled Chicken Nuggets. Let’s explore why this menu choice ranks supreme on their list and get expert tips for ordering at Chick-fil-A.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; According to&lt;a href="https://www.blissfulnutrition365.com/about-us" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt; Ambrazia Sublett, M.S., RDN, LD&lt;/a&gt;, “The Market Salad is a great choice because it’s a burst of colors with green from the salad greens, blueberries, apples and strawberries all providing phytonutrients that our body needs. The fruit addition to the salad not only adds color but flavor.”

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The Chick-fil-A Market Salad is made with &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8035429/is-salad-good-for-you/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;mixed greens&lt;/a&gt;, topped with a blend of blue cheese crumbles, strawberries, blueberries, red and green apples, and topped with your choice of protein, such as grilled chicken nuggets. It also comes with a packet of Harvest Nut Granola and Roasted Almonds for crunch. Here are a few more reasons why dietitians often recommend this salad.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; High in Lean Protein &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Adding a serving of grilled chicken nuggets to the Chick-fil-A Market Salad adds a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-proteins-to-help-you-lose-weight-11770165" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;source of lean protein&lt;/a&gt; that supports muscle maintenance, satiety and overall energy balance. The amount of protein your body needs depends on several factors including gender, age, activity level and current health status. According to the 2020–2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans, adults should consume approximately 10% to 35% of their daily calories from protein.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The Chick-fil-A Market Salad, with the addition of grilled chicken, contributes significantly to this recommended amount.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The Chick-fil-A Market Salad is one of the few fast-food options that incorporate a variety of fruits and veggies, including berries, apples and leafy greens. These nutrient-dense foods are &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/vitamin-c-vegetables-8768521" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;high in vitamin C, vitamin A and phytonutrients&lt;/a&gt;. Phytonutrients are bioactive compounds found in plants that are responsible for their vibrant hues and flavors. They also help to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-foods-to-fight-inflammation-11762781" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;fight inflammation and support immune health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Unlike some fast-food salads that provide a small amount of protein or a large amount of fried toppings, this salad provides a healthy balance. It offers protein, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290631/what-is-a-complex-carbohydrate/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;complex carbs from fruit&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai pseudoStyle" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-nut-for-heart-health-8604884" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;healthy fats from nuts&lt;/a&gt;, and fiber from vegetables, all of which help to provide a steady source of energy. This nutritious combo also helps to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/17387/5-tips-to-keep-your-blood-sugar-in-check/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;regulate blood sugar levels&lt;/a&gt;, reducing energy crashes later in the day. Sublett recommends choosing a vinaigrette for a light dressing that won’t weigh down the salad flavors.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Here are a few dietitian-approved strategies to make your Chick-fil-A meal more balanced without sacrificing taste:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drink Water:&lt;/strong&gt; Try pairing your meal with water or unsweetened iced tea instead of soda to cut back on added sugar and empty calories.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Choose Grilled over Fried:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://sproutsnutritionrd.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt; Sarah Sullivan, M.S., RDN, LDN,&lt;/a&gt; recommends choosing grilled options, which are lower in fat and calories than fried ones.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watch the Dressings and Sauces:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://bettrfull.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt; Nicole Randazzo, M.A., RDN, CDCES,&lt;/a&gt; says to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/how-to-choose-the-healthiest-salad-dressing-8684702" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;pay close attention to the sauces and dressings&lt;/a&gt;, as they may be higher in sodium and added sugar. “Skip the creamy dressings and opt for lighter sauces such as BBQ (45 [calories]), Zesty Buffalo (25), Sweet + Spicy Sriracha (45), or Honey Mustard (50),” adds Randazzo.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Balance Your Meal:&lt;/strong&gt; “Pairing a grilled entree with nutrient-rich sides like the kale salad or fruit cup can help you enjoy a meal that’s both delicious and supportive of your health goals,” says&lt;a href="https://nourishfamily.com/about/brooke/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="4" rel="nofollow"&gt; Brooke Miller, M.S., RD, LD&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be Mindful of Portion Sizes:&lt;/strong&gt; Some items, like milkshakes or waffle fries, are best enjoyed occasionally in smaller portions. Try sharing with a friend or ordering a kid’s size for a simple way to practice moderation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-our-expert-take"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; Our Expert Take &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When it comes to choosing a healthier fast-food option, variety and balance matter. The Chick-fil-A Market Salad with Grilled Chicken Nuggets is a great choice because it provides a source of lean protein, antioxidant-rich fruits and veggies, and healthy fats, all in one. With a few mindful ordering strategies, you can enjoy a meal that nourishes your body while still fitting into your lifestyle. And the best part?

All three were hospitalized and are now recovering, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/OPA/Pages/NR25-015.aspx" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;California department of public health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Mpox is a viral infection that often begins with flu-like symptoms such as fever, chills and muscle aches. These are usually followed by a rash that starts as small raised spots, then develop into fluid-filled blisters before forming scabs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The virus has two main genetic groups, or “clades”. Clade I mpox has caused widespread disease and deaths in parts of central and east Africa, most acutely in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Clade II was the strain behind the 2022 US outbreak, which has circulated at low levels since.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“The presence of clade I needs careful evaluation,” said Seth Blumberg, an associate professor of medicine at the University of &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/california" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;, San Francisco’s division of infectious diseases and hospital medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“I don’t think the historical results we’ve seen from Africa are directly translatable, but we need to monitor these cases closely.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Dr Rita Nguyen, assistant state public health officer, said in Friday’s statement that “clade I mpox cases can be severe” and the “risk of severe disease and hospitalization are highest for people with weakened immune systems.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“It’s critical to protect yourself by getting both doses of the mpox vaccine if you or your sex partner(s) may be at risk for mpox,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Anyone can contract mpox through close physical contact, including sex. Past outbreaks of clade II &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/05/lgbt-groups-unite-to-urge-uk-ministers-to-act-against-monkeypox" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;primarily affected&lt;/a&gt; gay and bisexual men and transgender or non-binary people who have sex with men. California’s public health department now believes person-to-person spread of clade I is occurring in California, mainly affecting these communities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In Long Beach, officials &lt;a href="https://www.longbeach.gov/press-releases/city-of-long-beach-confirms-first-case-of-clade-i-mpox/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;announced the first case&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has reported &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/monkeypox/outbreaks/2023/index.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;six prior US clade I cases&lt;/a&gt;, all linked to travel abroad. The first was detected in San Mateo county in 2024. Officials said the overall risk to the public remains low, and casual contact in settings like offices or public transit is unlikely to spread the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The Jynneos vaccine protects against both clade I and II mpox. It is a two-dose series given a month apart, with full immunity reached two weeks after the second dose. No booster is currently recommended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Vaccination doesn’t completely eliminate the risk of contracting mpox, but experts say it helps reduce severity if a person were to contract the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“The vaccines are completely protective,” Blumberg said. “Vaccines can prevent the severity of disease. If you were to get mpox, you would be less likely to need advanced care.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The CDC said it is not known how long vaccine protection might last, or if protection might decrease over time, according to its &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/monkeypox/vaccines/index.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;. The public health agency is analyzing the current data and conducting studies to better understand how the Jynneos vaccine works amid the current mpox outbreak, as well as how long protection might last.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Mon, 20 Oct 2025 20:41:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiigFBVV95cUxOWUJnS0N0RFJiUWd5UWUwWlY0a2FKeV9OUFhfRDZqdVloa0sxVlJsdThNcGNQWnV3eWYtUGR0TzdNRndjVzFObDdnb0RxcmZpemx6bGFCTWpZTXNVM0NLYzdiTm1yZExta1JHTVVheElBbkVpaDQ4WF9MWTNlYVBvdl8xcG5MOHdyMGc</guid></item><item><title>新的研究发现，母乳喂养妇女的保护性免疫细胞被确定为预防乳腺癌</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/oct/21/protective-immune-cells-breastfeeding-guard-against-cancer</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body-commercial-selector article-body-viewer-selector dcr-11jq3zt"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In the 18th century, physicians noticed nuns had some of the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2008/oct/06/cancer.women" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;highest rates of breast cancer.&lt;/a&gt; It was one of the earliest clues that led scientists to suspect that child-bearing and breastfeeding could protect against the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Modern data has confirmed the centuries-old observation but the biological reasons behind it have remained unclear. Explanations have often focused on pregnancy-related hormonal changes, but research &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09713-5" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;published Tuesday in Nature&lt;/a&gt; has found breastfeeding provides long-lasting immune protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Prof Sherene Loi, a clinician scientist at the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre in Melbourne, said the most sophisticated level of the immune system, called the adaptive immune system, involves T-cells which react against particular viruses or bacteria – and also against cancer. This response is &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/06/cancer-cure-immunotherapy" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;“one of our very modern therapeutic weapons against cancer”&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Loi, the senior author of the new study, said her team had noticed some breast cancers had large amounts of these specialised immune cells, while others had very few.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="a21567b7-aac0-40d8-9c02-62cb0cc93b00" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-47fhrn"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":4,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"Women who miss first breast cancer screening at ‘40% higher risk’ of dying from the disease","elementId":"a21567b7-aac0-40d8-9c02-62cb0cc93b00","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/sep/24/women-who-miss-first-breast-cancer-screening-at-40-higher-risk-of-dying-from-the-disease"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":0,"display":0,"theme":0}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Patients who had more cells had better outcomes, particularly for one of the most aggressive types: triple-negative breast cancer. These immune cells were also found in healthy breast tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The study sought to investigate why these T-cells were already there, whether they were related to pregnancy and breastfeeding, and if they protected against breast cancer formation and growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The researchers studied noncancerous breast tissue of more than 260 women from diverse populations who had breast reductions or surgery to reduce their risk of breast cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;They found those who had children had more of these specialised cells, called CD8⁺ T-cells. These cells remained in the breasts for more than 30 years after pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Using mice models, the researchers then implanted cancerous cells into the equivalent of their breast tissue, and found they grew less in the mice that had had pups and breastfed, than in virgin mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;When they depleted the T-cells from the mice with pups, they lost the protection. This suggested the T-cells were directly responsible for the effect, Loi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The researchers then investigated whether women who breastfed lived longer with triple-negative breast cancer. They looked at studies involving more than&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;1,000 breast cancer patients diagnosed after having children, and had a record of their breastfeeding history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;They found that women who had breastfed did better from their triple-negative breast cancer than those who had not. Their tumours also had more immune cells, suggesting there was ongoing immune activation and regulation from the body against their breast cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“The key take-home messages [are] that pregnancy and breastfeeding will leave behind long-lived protective immune cells in the breast and the body, and these cells help to reduce risk and improve defence against breast cancer, particularly triple-negative breast cancer, but potentially other cancers as well as disease,” Loi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Loi said the study provided an explanation why breastfeeding is protective, so that it can be used in the future to try to recreate this effect in women who don’t have children or are unable to breastfeed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Understanding the biological mechanism could help develop vaccines and new strategies to mimic this protection, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;She emphasised even if women do breastfeed, it’s not a 100% guarantee that they won’t get breast cancer. “The effects are really quite small for every individual, but population wide the effects are large.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Associate Prof Wendy Ingman from the University of Adelaide’s Medical School said the longer the duration of breastfeeding, the greater the benefits. She said, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9972148/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;for every year of breastfeeding, there is a 4% lifetime reduction&lt;/a&gt; in the mother’s breast cancer risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“This study shows that having babies and breastfeeding causes long-lasting changes in immune cells that could help protect the breast from cancer,” she said. “I’m hopeful that this type of research will lead to new approaches to reduce women’s breast cancer risk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Mon, 20 Oct 2025 20:20:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiswFBVV95cUxNZ0JJQVdCenlRVWhFVzNTVE5QSGp3U08xLVZCRUNHZ1JHWXI2X2VNdGQ3S1BOX2dHZ2MwN3JXNjFFaW83cDR0RVpHY1RqNWhZczRsVjJpbWh3OGhVcEJyYzNPN2l1MGtCdDZXU2NjNml3eWt4czlDaG10MXZFYS1DZ3o1QTBSRUQyN1pRa0ZiZ3pxZjRrNkJRcEpVaTZSZDZ1aFlQWjduNXJnR3QxTy0wMWtpRQ</guid></item><item><title>盲人患者再次阅读智能眼镜植入物- The Verge</title><link>https://www.theverge.com/news/802905/eye-implant-smart-glasses-restores-vision</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1"&gt;Several dozen patients with vision loss due to a progressive form of blindness called age-related macular degeneration (AMD) regained some of their central vision thanks to an eye implant paired with a set of smart glasses. The &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2501396"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; was published Monday in &lt;em&gt;The New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/em&gt;, and researchers &lt;a href="https://science.xyz/news/new-england-journal-of-medicine-prima/"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; that patients could see well enough using the technology to fill out crossword puzzles and read regular books again. Participants included people aged 60 or older with diagnosed AMD in both eyes, and visual impairment of a measured visual acuity of at least 1.2 logMAR or worse in the study eye.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1"&gt;AMD cannot be reversed because cells in the center of the patients’ retinas die over time. The study focused on restoring some of that lost vision using a 2-by-2-millimeter device made of tiny photovoltaic solar panels. The device was surgically implanted under the retina in the patient’s eye. Patients wore camera-equipped smart glasses, which transmitted zoomed-in images of the world to the retinal implant using near infrared light. The retinal implant then pulsed small electrical signals into the optic nerve, mimicking what the cells of the retina would normally do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1"&gt;The study started off with 38 patients who received the retinal implant, 32 of whom stayed in the clinical trial for a full year. At the one year mark, 26 of the 32 participants could see better than when they started — an &lt;a href="https://science.xyz/news/new-england-journal-of-medicine-prima/"&gt;80 percent success rate&lt;/a&gt;. It’s not perfect; patients can only see a blurry vision of the world and only in black and white. But researchers uninvolved in the study called the work “amazing,” as &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/20/health/retinal-implant-macular-degeneration.html"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1"&gt;The technology comes from the brain-computer interface company Science Corporation, whose founder and CEO, &lt;a href="https://science.xyz/company/team/max-hodak/"&gt;Max Hodak&lt;/a&gt;, cofounded Neuralink in 2016 with Elon Musk. Science Corporation acquired the retinal implant technology from the French medical device company Pixium Vision in 2024 after it ran out of money after a decade of working to develop the vision technology, as &lt;a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/pixium-bionic-eye-tech-rescued"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;em&gt;IEEE Spectrum&lt;/em&gt;.

                                        &lt;p&gt;ATLANTA (AP) — CDC researchers are being forced to skip a pivotal conference on infectious disease this week due to the &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/government-shutdown-congress-trump-health-care-54b2a584657a0b619bc8326708a05604"&gt;government shutdown&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, missing out on high-level discussions not long after surges in &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-outbreak-us-texas-mmr-vaccine-rfk-144ed193e13de675a750e52a505423e9"&gt;measles&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and whooping cough hit the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IDWeek, the largest annual meeting of infectious disease experts in the nation, is the leading venue for experts to trade information about diagnosing, treating and preventing threats including bird flu, superbugs and HIV, among many other topics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC typically sends scores of researchers and outbreak investigators. But of the hundreds of speakers listed in the printed program for the four-day conference, about 10 were identified as CDC scientists. And even that small number didn’t show up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main reason is the government shutdown that started Oct. 1. Federal scientists aren’t being paid and conference appearances are postponed unless they are funded outside of annual government budgets.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;Problems were apparent long before the shutdown&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Infectious Disease Society of America and its conference partners selected Atlanta, where the CDC is based, as its host more than a year ago. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Organizers were excited to have the meeting in “the heart of public health,” and CDC officials agreed to be heavily involved in planning, said Dr. Yohei Doi, a University of Pittsburgh researcher who helped organize the meeting. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But soon after President Donald Trump’s inauguration, there was an immediate, if temporary, freeze on CDC communications and participation at medical meetings. That was followed by layoffs and research funding cuts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As things started to evolve, they said they no longer would be able to attend,” Doi said of CDC speakers.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;h2&gt;Disease threats are looming&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC’s absence comes as infectious disease specialists should be in high demand, in part because the worst pandemic in a century hit only a few years ago. Measles and &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/whooping-cough-pertussis-tdap-vaccination-outbreak-eb8f4776fdd0796ad789aac1ccdc9b67"&gt;whooping cough&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; have been surging. And new threats are constantly emerging. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has said he wants the CDC to primarily focus on infectious diseases, though he was a leading voice in the antivaccine movement before Trump appointed him to lead the federal government’s health agencies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC has already lost a quarter of its workforce through layoffs, buyouts, resignations and other actions. And the Trump administration is trying to lay off hundreds more, an effort temporarily &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/government-shutdown-layoffs-trump-unions-b312b3ca77cbdbc72e778ece3b2cbffc"&gt;blocked by a federal judge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s the most painful irony of all” to see these actions by the administration amid serious threats, said Michael Osterholm, a University of Minnesota infectious disease researcher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Osterholm, who spoke at the conference Sunday, said he is working with others to take on work that &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/cdc-vaccine-recommendations-data-b4eeba69e03a8d4ed50fb0a12fbcec6e"&gt;the CDC has curtailed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He announced a new open-access publication called Public Health Alerts to put out the kind of reports that were the staple of the CDC’s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Separately, a collaboration involving dozens of foundations would pool resources to fund some of the disease research work that the government has stopped doing, Osterholm said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is not business as usual anymore, but it doesn’t mean that we have to sit back and take it,” Osterholm said.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;h2&gt;Conference sponsor has clashed with Kennedy &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;HHS &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/vaccine-committee-cdc-cfbdcab84b2a919a6131d471959c3431"&gt;has discouraged federal collaborations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; with some medical organizations, including IDSA, and that likely had a chilling effect, said Dr. Debra Houry, who was the CDC’s chief medical officer until &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/cdc-monarez-firing-c31fd1b880cbc709a1adf6cd7ff22b1b"&gt;she resigned in August&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to protest agency changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A HHS spokeswoman, Emily Hilliard, said the administration believes federal scientists should share their research and expertise with peers and the public, and that conferences are vetted “to ensure compliance with ethics rules and the responsible use of taxpayer funds.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Anna Yousaf, a CDC infectious disease doctor, told The Associated Press she was invited to present findings about long-term outcomes of COVID-19-infected children who develop a rare inflammatory condition. She wasn’t allowed to attend this week’s conference, though a collaborator at another organization was planning to share the research, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other CDC scientists were in similar predicaments, she said, and it’s not clear how many of them could find such a workaround. That potentially means some research findings won’t be shared with researchers and physicians who could put the information to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;This 30-day plan is set at 1,800 calories, with modifications for 1,500 and 2,000 calories.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Each day provides at least 80 grams of protein and 30 grams of fiber, both of which promote satiety.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This plan prioritizes foods linked to reducing inflammation, like healthy fats, fish, fermented foods and colorful fruits and vegetables.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In this 30-day high-protein, high-fiber anti-inflammatory plan, you’ll find a month of &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-high-fiber-fruits-to-eat-11747635" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;high-fiber fruits&lt;/a&gt; and vegetables, whole grains and legumes as well as a variety of protein-rich foods, like fish, poultry, legumes and eggs. In addition to their other health benefits, both protein and fiber can promote satiety and help you feel full throughout the day.

Similar to the Mediterranean diet, the anti-inflammatory diet emphasizes a wide intake of plants, an array of protein sources and plenty of healthy fats, like avocado, fatty fish and olive oil, while limiting refined grains, added sugar and processed meats.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Unchecked chronic inflammation can increase the risk of many health conditions, including type 2 diabetes and heart disease.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; To make this plan work for many people, we include three different calorie levels to choose from and meal-prep tips at the beginning of each week.

&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_1-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can mix and match meals if there is one you don’t like, or browse some of our other &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/anti-inflammatory-diet-recipes-8660050" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;anti-inflammatory recipes&lt;/a&gt; for additional inspiration. When creating this plan, we aimed for 1,800 calories per day with at least 80 grams of protein and 30 grams of fiber and capped sodium at 2,300 milligrams per day, as recommended by the Dietary Guidelines for Americans.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; If you’re making a swap, you may want to choose a meal with a similar nutrition profile, especially as it pertains to protein and fiber, or plan to adjust a snack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_2-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, you can eat the same breakfast or lunch every day if you prefer. The breakfasts range from 358 to 534 calories, while the lunches span 384 to 540 calories. If you’re closely monitoring calories or other nutrients and making a change, you may want to adjust snacks or other meals to meet your goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="accordion__title"&gt;Why is there not a modification for 1,200 calories?&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_3-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We no longer provide modifications for 1,200-calorie days in our meal plans. The 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans suggests that limiting calories to 1,200 per day is too low for most people to meet their nutritional needs, plus it’s unsustainable for long-term health and well-being.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_4-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Foods that may lower inflammation include fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts, unsaturated fats and fish.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; These foods contain nutrients that can help reduce inflammation, such as fiber, omega-3 fatty acids, magnesium and vitamins A and C.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_689-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High-Fiber&lt;/strong&gt;: Each day provides at least 30 grams of fiber, though most days come in higher than that. Fiber is a type of indigestible carbohydrate found in whole grains, fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds and legumes. A high-fiber diet can reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes, improve heart health, promote gut health and even reduce inflammation.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Research has found that both high total fiber intake and a high intake of cereal fibers are linked to reduced inflammation and a lower risk of developing heart disease.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Cereal fiber sources include whole grains, like bran, whole wheat and oats.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High-Protein&lt;/strong&gt;: Each day provides at least 80 grams of protein from a variety of sources, like legumes, nuts, seeds, dairy, poultry, eggs and fish. Protein can help support a healthy immune system, preserve muscle mass and support bone health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; While protein’s impact on inflammation is less clear, there is some research suggesting that protein intake, especially from plant-based protein sources, can help reduce inflammation in older adults.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-sc-block-adslot-inline"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Follows the Anti-Inflammatory Diet&lt;/strong&gt;: This plan follows the principles of the anti-inflammatory diet by including a wide variety of fruits, vegetables, healthy fats, legumes and whole grains while limiting red meat, processed meat, refined grains and added sugar. Research links the anti-inflammatory diet to a reduced risk of type 2 diabetes and heart disease, healthier body weight, improved cognitive function and better gut health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The technique sounds so outlandish that it won an IgNobel prize in 2024. But the science behind rescuing people with blocked airways and clogged lungs by rectally delivering oxygen to the body is no joke.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                        
                                          
                                         
										

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;In fact, positive results are &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/med/fulltext/S2666-6340(25)00314-9" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;i&gt;Med&lt;/i&gt; regarding the first human clinical trial to evaluate the potential benefits of "enteral ventilation."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This is the first human data, and the results are limited solely to demonstrating the safety of the procedure and not its effectiveness. But now that we have established tolerance, the next step will be to evaluate how effective the process is for delivering oxygen to the bloodstream," says Takanori Takebe, MD, Ph.D., a leading expert in organoid medicine with dual appointments at Cincinnati Children's and the University of Osaka in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is enteral ventilation?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This concept envisions an enema-like process that uses a super-oxygenated liquid to deliver life-supporting oxygen to the bloodstream by absorbing it through the colon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A key paper &lt;a href="https://phys.org/news/2021-05-mammals-anus-emergencies.html" target="_blank"&gt;detailing initial findings&lt;/a&gt; on a porcine model was featured on the cover of &lt;i&gt;Med&lt;/i&gt; in 2021 and later in the popular Canada-based science television show, "The Nature of Things." That early work led to Takebe and colleagues receiving an IgNobel Prize in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If successful in ongoing human trials, the relatively low-tech process may allow hospitals to rescue people when airways are blocked by injury or inflammation, or when lung function is severely limited by infections and other complications.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;h2&gt;A new idea with decades-old roots&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The inspiration for the procedure comes in part from observing the abilities of the loach, a bottom-feeding fish that can swallow air from the surface and absorb the oxygen through its gut, thus supplementing its gills to survive in low-oxygen conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also builds upon the work of former Cincinnati Children's researcher Leland Clark, Ph.D., (b. 1918, d. 2005) who years ago invented a perfluorocarbon liquid, now called Oxycyte. Although the product did not move forward as a potential form of artificial blood, the 1989 movie "The Abyss" included a famous scene in which a rat was shown "breathing" the special liquid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Findings and next steps&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new study recaps findings from 27 healthy men in Japan who were asked to hold varying amounts of the perfluorocarbon liquid (without the liquid being oxygenated) for 60 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twenty held the liquid for the entire 60 minutes, including amounts up to 1,500 ml. At the largest volumes, participants reported abdominal bloating and discomfort, but no serious adverse events were reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A key next step will be to repeat the evaluation using the oxygenated liquid to measure how much of the liquid is needed, and for how long, to improve blood &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/oxygen/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;oxygen&lt;/a&gt; levels. Eventually, Takebe and colleagues hope to expand the technology for use in newborn care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Takebe—who has launched a company called EVA Therapeutics to pursue this project—says the timing of a future clinical trial will depend on the pace of fundraising.&lt;/p&gt;

In this study, participants listened to stories that emphasized either conceptual details (thoughts and emotions) or perceptual details (sights and sounds).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brain imaging showed that these two types of narratives activated distinct memory networks, which later predicted how well listeners recalled the core story events. The findings suggest that storytelling style can sculpt memory formation and may help tailor communication to different audiences, including age groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dual Memory Systems:&lt;/strong&gt; Conceptual storytelling activates emotional and interpretive brain networks, while perceptual storytelling engages sensory-focused areas.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Predictive Recall:&lt;/strong&gt; The type of brain activity during listening forecasted how well participants remembered story details later.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Applied Insight:&lt;/strong&gt; Matching communication style to a listener’s preferred memory system—conceptual or perceptual—may improve memory retention.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;SfN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does the way a person hears about an event shape their recollection of it later? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a new &lt;em&gt;Journal of Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt; paper, Signy Sheldon and colleagues, from McGill University, explored whether different storytelling strategies affect how the brain stores that experience as a memory and recalls it later. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers created narratives with the same core events, but different elaborative details. These elaborations had two different focuses: (1) conceptual details, which describe a person’s feelings and interpretations while experiencing core events, and (2) perceptual details, such as a person’s concrete observations about core events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neuroimaging revealed that when the 35 study participants remembered the stories later, different memory networks in the brain were involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notably, the distinct conceptual and perceptual brain networks that were active while listening to these different types of stories could predict how well participants later recalled the core elements of the story. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study suggests that how people hear about an event shapes the way their brain makes a memory of that experience. Sheldon elaborates on what this could mean: “There is a lot of work in the field to show that individuals and groups prefer different memory systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For example, older adults tend to engage the conceptual memory system more than younger adults, who prefer to engage the perceptual memory system when experiencing an event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This would mean that older adults may process events described with conceptual details better than younger adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If this is the case, this could help us tailor information to different age groups to improve memory. This is something we are hoping to test in the future.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Key Questions Answered:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq wp-block-yoast-faq-block"&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1760987334665"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;Q: What did researchers test in this study?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;A: They explored how different storytelling approaches—conceptual versus perceptual—shape memory formation and recall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1760987348056"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;Q: What did brain imaging reveal about storytelling and memory?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;A: Listening to conceptually rich stories activated emotional and interpretive brain regions, while perceptually rich stories engaged sensory networks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1760987375548"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;Q: Why does this matter?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;A: It shows that the way we tell or hear stories influences memory pathways in the brain, potentially allowing communication to be tailored by age or learning preference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this memory and neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#79141c1d1018390a1f1757160b1e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;SfN Media&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://sfn.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;SfN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;SfN Media – SfN&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1936-24.2025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Hippocampal–Cortical Networks Predict Conceptual Versus Perceptually Guided Narrative Memory&lt;/a&gt;” by Signy Sheldon et al. &lt;em&gt;Journal of Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hippocampal–Cortical Networks Predict Conceptual Versus Perceptually Guided Narrative Memory&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Current theories of event memory propose distinct connections between the hippocampus and neocortical regions, particularly those within the default mode network (DMN) subsystems, to support processing different types of content in memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has been established that hippocampal connectivity supports integrating this disparate content into unified event memories, suggesting that changing the way that an event is described could change the underlying hippocampal neural network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To address this knowledge gap, we developed event narratives that described the same core story (e.g., grocery shopping) with identical central story details described with additional descriptive details that were conceptually or perceptually related to the story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using fMRI, we established hippocampal connectivity patterns as a group of human participants (N=35, of any sex) encoded these narratives, and then related these patterns to later memory for the narrative details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consistent with prior work, we found that the conceptual narratives were associated with stronger anterior hippocampal connectivity to regions within the core and dorsomedial DMN subsystems, and a portion of this connectivity pattern predicted memory for the core story of the narrative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The perceptual narratives were selectively associated with anterior hippocampal connectivity to parietal and lateral temporal regions and regions outside the standard DMN, in relation to memory performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results provide new insights into hippocampal and DMN functional organization and how distinct neural components contribute differently to event memory.&lt;/p&gt;

They also have less brain volume loss than is typical for someone of their age, and seem to be better protected from developing dementia compared to their peers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="4" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Naturally, researchers want to study them, and Northwestern University has ongoing research that tracks these SuperAgers—and they just released findings after 25 years of studying these medical phenoms.... &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="6" class="body-tip css-mtq1aa emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="6.0"&gt;Meet the experts: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.providence.org/doctors/profile/203880-clifford-segil" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.providence.org/doctors/profile/203880-clifford-segil" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Clifford Segil, DO" data-node-id="6.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Clifford Segil, DO&lt;/a&gt;, is a neurologist at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, CA; &lt;a href="https://www.providence.org/doctors/geriatric-medicine/ca/santa-monica/scott-kaiser-1205042470" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.providence.org/doctors/geriatric-medicine/ca/santa-monica/scott-kaiser-1205042470" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Scott Kaiser, MD" data-node-id="6.3" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Scott Kaiser, MD&lt;/a&gt;, is a geriatrician and Director of Geriatric Cognitive Health for the Pacific Neuroscience Institute &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-exactly-did-the-study-find" data-node-id="7" class="body-h2 css-1q3hln2 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="7.0"&gt;What exactly did the study find?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="8" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;The scientific perspective paper, which was published in the journal &lt;em data-node-id="8.1"&gt;&lt;a href="https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/alz.70312" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/alz.70312" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Alzheimer’s &amp;amp; Dementia" data-node-id="8.1.0" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Alzheimer’s &amp;amp; Dementia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, is part of ongoing research into said SuperAgers. It notes a lot of interesting factors, like that SuperAgers have less brain thinning as they get older compared to other people of the same age, and that they have less Alzheimer's disease–type changes in the brain. As the research is still ongoing, scientists aren’t exactly sure why this is the case. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="9" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;But the researchers also discovered that SuperAgers tend to share certain lifestyle and personality traits. A key one worth noting: These older adults tend to be &lt;em data-node-id="9.1"&gt;highly&lt;/em&gt; social and outgoing. (We can get on board with that!) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="why-does-socializing-help-your-memory-as-you-age" data-node-id="10" class="body-h2 css-1q3hln2 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="10.0"&gt;Why does socializing help your memory as you age?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="11" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;There are a few possible things going on here. The researchers &lt;a href="https://www.nm.org/healthbeat/healthy-tips/4-habits-super-agers" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.nm.org/healthbeat/healthy-tips/4-habits-super-agers" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="found" data-node-id="11.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; that SuperAgers have more than four to five times the number of large, spindly neurons called von Economo neurons in their brains, which are thought to play a role in social processing and awareness. (It’s just not clear if being socially active causes this or if you tend to socialize more when you have more of these neurons in your brain to begin with.) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="12" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;But there is a growing push for people to stay social as they age for health reasons. “Chronic isolation can be as bad for your health as smoking,” says &lt;a href="https://www.providence.org/doctors/geriatric-medicine/ca/santa-monica/scott-kaiser-1205042470" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.providence.org/doctors/geriatric-medicine/ca/santa-monica/scott-kaiser-1205042470" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Scott Kaiser, MD" data-node-id="12.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Scott Kaiser, MD&lt;/a&gt;, a geriatrician and Director of Geriatric Cognitive Health for the Pacific Neuroscience Institute. “Conversely, we know that healthy social connections are critical for improved cardiovascular health, neurological health, and reducing your risk of dementia.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="14" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Staying social lowers overall stress levels and increases levels of the feel-good hormone oxytocin, Kaiser points out. He also notes that people who feel well connected to others may be more likely to make healthy choices around their diet, drinking, and lifestyle—and that could support good physical and mental health even more. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="15" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;But socializing also just works your brain, especially when you’re communicating with several people at once, says &lt;a href="https://www.providence.org/doctors/profile/203880-clifford-segil" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.providence.org/doctors/profile/203880-clifford-segil" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Clifford Segil, DO" data-node-id="15.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Clifford Segil, DO&lt;/a&gt;, a neurologist at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, CA. “The brain pathways required to juggle an interaction with multiple people is more complex and requires more processing space than a one-on-one interaction,” he says. Basically, being socially active is a workout for your brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="other-ways-to-protect-your-brain-as-you-age" data-node-id="16" class="body-h2 css-1q3hln2 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="16.0"&gt;Other ways to protect your brain as you age&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="17" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Segil recommends doing a few things to protect your brain health as you get older. “I continuously advise my aging patients that structure is beneficial for the brain,” he says. “I advise people to take classes as they age.” Joining clubs, volunteering to help others, listening to music, and reading books can put your brain to work, too, he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="18" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;But Segil also stresses the importance of being social as much as possible. “There are only potential benefits from being more social as you age,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-journey-blur="partial" data-ad-exclude="true" class="css-19m4yzp e1jy25xv0"&gt;&lt;div class="css-sfzxfp ev8dhu59"&gt;&lt;span class="css-3mrz81 ev8dhu51"&gt;&lt;img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/ea27d1a6-ecd9-4da8-b2a7-049a03b4ab93_1528214135.file?fill=1:1&amp;amp;resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Korin Miller" title="Headshot of Korin Miller" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="css-o0wq4v ev8dhu53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dsojn8 ev8dhu55"&gt;&lt;p class="css-1y37fga ev8dhu54"&gt;Korin Miller is a freelance writer specializing in general wellness, sexual health and relationships, and lifestyle trends, with work appearing in Men’s Health, Women’s Health, Self, Glamour, and more.

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throughout life, our cells are constantly exposed to environmental and internal factors that can damage DNA. While such DNA damage is known to contribute to both aging and cancer, the precise connection—particularly how damaged stem cells shape long-term tissue health—has remained elusive.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                        
                                          
                                         
										

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Melanocyte &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/stem+cells/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;stem cells&lt;/a&gt; (McSCs) are tissue‐resident stem cells that serve as the source of mature melanocytes, the pigment‐producing cells responsible for hair and skin coloration. In mammals, these stem cells reside in the bulge–sub‐bulge region of hair follicles as immature melanoblasts, maintaining pigmentation through cyclical regeneration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Published in &lt;i&gt;Nature Cell Biology&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41556-025-01769-9" target="_blank"&gt;a study&lt;/a&gt; led by Professor Emi Nishimura and Assistant Professor Yasuaki Mohri from The University of Tokyo used long-term in vivo lineage tracing and gene expression profiling in mice to investigate how McSCs respond to different types of DNA damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team identified a specific response to DNA double-strand breaks: senescence-coupled differentiation (seno-differentiation), a process in which McSCs irreversibly differentiate and are then lost, leading to hair graying. This process is driven by activation of the p53–p21 pathway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, when exposed to certain carcinogens, such as 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene or ultraviolet B, McSCs bypass this protective differentiation program—even in the presence of DNA damage. Instead, they retain self-renewal capacity and expand clonally, a process supported by KIT ligand secreted both from the local niche and within the epidermis. This niche-derived signal suppresses seno-differentiation, tipping McSCs toward a tumor-prone fate.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;Nishimura says, "These findings reveal that the same stem cell population can follow antagonistic fates—exhaustion or expansion—depending on the type of stress and microenvironmental signals. It reframes hair graying and melanoma not as unrelated events, but as divergent outcomes of stem cell stress responses."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Importantly, this study does not suggest that graying &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/hair/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;hair&lt;/a&gt; prevents cancer, but rather that seno-differentiation represents a stress-induced protective pathway that removes potentially harmful cells. Conversely, when this mechanism is bypassed, the persistence of damaged McSCs may predispose to melanomagenesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By identifying the molecular circuits that govern this fate bifurcation, the study provides a &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/conceptual+framework/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;conceptual framework&lt;/a&gt; that links tissue aging and cancer, and highlights the beneficial role of eliminating potentially harmful stem cells through natural "senolysis," resulting in a phenotype that safeguards against cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

The photoreceptor cells in the macula are responsible for producing sharp, detailed and colored vision. When the disease has progressed to the geographic atrophy stage, these cells deteriorate and die, and people lose their central vision — meaning that an object straight ahead may appear blurry or covered up with a dark blotch. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-52e65a" class="body-graf"&gt;Roughly 22 million people in the U.S. have AMD, and about 1 million have geographic atrophy, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.macular.org/about-macular-degeneration/geographic-atrophy" target="_blank"&gt;American Macular Degeneration Foundation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-90387c" class="body-graf"&gt;In the study, the participants, who had an average age of 79,  were fitted with the “PRIMA device,” a system meant to replicate vision. Patients wear augmented reality glasses embedded with a camera that captures their visual field. What the camera “sees” is transmitted to the chip &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/eye-implant-pig-protein-restored-sight-blind-people-rcna42681" target="_blank"&gt;implanted in their eye&lt;/a&gt; in the form of infrared light. The chip converts the light into an electrical current, which stimulates the remaining healthy cells in the macula in a realistic way, enabling signals these cells send to be interpreted by the brain as vision. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-162846" class="body-graf"&gt;An image processor, which the user must carry, lets patients zoom in and magnify the images they see, which appear in black and white.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii" id="anchor-e0020b"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture" data-flavor="fit" data-original-height="1125" data-original-width="2000"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-10/251029-tiny-eye-implant-inline-lr-1b498c.png 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-10/251029-tiny-eye-implant-inline-lr-1b498c.png 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-10/251029-tiny-eye-implant-inline-lr-1b498c.png 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-10/251029-tiny-eye-implant-inline-lr-1b498c.png 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-10/251029-tiny-eye-implant-inline-lr-1b498c.png" alt="The image on the right shows what the camera sends to the user's implanted microchip."&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;The image on the right shows what the camera sends to the user's implanted microchip.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;Science Corporation &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-405dba" class="body-graf"&gt;With the help of the PRIMA device, 80% of the 32 patients who returned for a reassessment one year after the chip implantation had achieved clinically meaningful visual improvements. Patients did experience side effects, predominantly related to the surgical procedure: The study reported that 26 serious adverse events occurred in 19 of the patients, ranging from elevated blood pressure in the eye to an accumulation of blood around the retina. The majority of the adverse events resolved within two months of the implantation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-de077d" class="body-graf"&gt;“It’s the first ever therapeutic approach that has led to an improvement in visual function in this group of patients,” said Dr. Frank Holz, the trial’s lead investigator and chair of the department of ophthalmology at the University Hospital of Bonn in Germany. “Late-stage age-related macular degeneration is a dismal disease. Patients are no longer capable of reading, driving a car, watching TV or even recognizing faces. So [these results] are a game-changer in my mind.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b59ed3" class="body-graf"&gt;One patient, Sheila Irvine, 70, who was fitted with the PRIMA device at Moorfields Eye Hospital in London, said in a statement provided by the hospital that her life before receiving the implant was akin to “having two black discs in my eyes, with the outside distorted.” A self-described “avid bookworm” before losing her vision, Irvine said she was now able to do crosswords and read prescriptions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-fc6cb2" class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Sunir Garg, professor of ophthalmology at the retina service of Wills Eye Hospital in Philadelphia, who was not involved in the study, said the results represent a breakthrough for patients with geographic atrophy. All doctors have been able to offer, he said, are visual aids, like magnifiers, and emotional support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7b95a0" class="body-graf"&gt;“Even with new medical therapies, the best that we can do is slow it down,” said Garg, who works with several drugmakers involved in treatments for AMD, including Apellis Pharmaceuticals, the maker of pegcetacoplan. That drug, which slows the progression of geographic atrophy, was recently approved in the U.S. and must be injected into the eye every 1 to 2 months. “We can’t stop it, and we can’t do anything to bring back lost vision.”   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii" id="anchor-6b5c8c"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture" data-flavor="fit" data-original-height="1333" data-original-width="2000"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-10/251019-prima-eye-implant-vl-443p-fecf6c.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-10/251019-prima-eye-implant-vl-443p-fecf6c.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-10/251019-prima-eye-implant-vl-443p-fecf6c.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-10/251019-prima-eye-implant-vl-443p-fecf6c.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-10/251019-prima-eye-implant-vl-443p-fecf6c.jpg" alt="An old woman wears glasses with a device attached to one of the lenses"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;An actor wearing the PRIMA system glasses.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;Science Corporation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-769765" class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Demetrios Vavvas, director of the retina service at Mass Eye and Ear in Boston, who was also not involved in the study, said that the PRIMA system is not without limitations.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f54edd" class="body-graf"&gt;Vavvas noted that the surgery required to implant the chip in the eye requires a high level of surgical skill and is not without risk. “You have to lift the retina off its normal position to implant this device, which increases the atrophy,” said Vavvas, who is a consultant to Sumitomo Pharmaceuticals, a company working on stem cell therapies for patients with other forms of vision loss. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-076743" class="body-graf"&gt;Vavvas said it was important to note that the device isn’t restoring normal vision, as patients were only able to see in black and white rather than color, and the trial participants had to undergo a significant amount of training in order to learn how to see with the PRIMA device. He also said that it wasn’t clear whether the enhancements in visual ability had significantly improved the patients’ quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-0e3c14" class="body-graf"&gt;But at the same time, Vavvas was also optimistic about its future potential, describing the current iteration of PRIMA as a key stepping stone in the field of vision restoration. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-71b486" class="body-graf"&gt;“Think of this device as the pre-release iPhone,” he said. “The limitations are clear. We shouldn’t oversell that the quality of life really improved. But there were certain [visual] tasks at which the patients were clearly better. So it shows to us that there is potential in this approach. It is still in some ways, a prototype. They’re working on iterations of this device that will be better.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-5962f8" class="body-graf"&gt;New upgrades to the PRIMA device could be coming in the next couple of years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-da6dfb" class="body-graf"&gt;The PRIMA system was invented by Stanford University ophthalmology professor Daniel Palanker and is being developed by the California-based neural engineering company Science Corporation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d03186" class="body-graf"&gt;Palanker said technical improvements are being made to increase the number of pixels in the chip from 400 to 10,000. The new chips have already been tested in rats, and the upgraded chips are being manufactured for future human trials. With the aid of the camera’s zoom function, Palanker said that this could theoretically enable patients to achieve 20/20 visual resolution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii" id="anchor-04d93b"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture" data-flavor="fit" data-original-height="1333" data-original-width="2000"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-10/251019-prima-eye-implant-vl-441p-954dea.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-10/251019-prima-eye-implant-vl-441p-954dea.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-10/251019-prima-eye-implant-vl-441p-954dea.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-10/251019-prima-eye-implant-vl-441p-954dea.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-10/251019-prima-eye-implant-vl-441p-954dea.jpg" alt="A penny is next to an implant chip that is about 1/50th of it's size, laid on a surface"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;The microchip shown next to a penny.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;Science Corporation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2d28f1" class="body-graf"&gt;“We are also working on next generation software that will allow patients to perceive not just black-and-white text, but also grey-scale natural images, such as faces,” Palanker said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7d0485" class="body-graf"&gt;Palanker suggested that the technology could be trialed in other retinal diseases that cause blindness, such as Stargardt disease, which has similar symptoms to age-related macular degeneration but is genetic and usually affects younger people.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-469478" class="body-graf"&gt;Garg and Vavvas are eager to see larger trials that provide more details about how the device improves patients’ ability to function on a day-to-day basis.

    &lt;p&gt;About 9 in 10 adults in the United States have not heard of cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic syndrome despite nearly 90% of adults being at risk for the condition, according to &lt;a href="https://newsroom.heart.org/news/about-9-in-10-havent-heard-of-condition-that-affects-nearly-90-of-u-s-adults" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;a recent survey&lt;/a&gt; from the American Heart Association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic syndrome, or CKM syndrome, is a disorder caused by the connections between &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/tag/heart-disease/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt;, kidney disease, &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/tag/diabetes/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/new-recommendations-measure-obesity-bmi/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;obesity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. The syndrome, which was &lt;a href="https://newsroom.heart.org/news/heart-disease-risk-prevention-and-management-redefined" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;defined by the AHA&lt;/a&gt; for the first time in October 2023, reflects how these conditions can influence or worsen each other. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The health conditions were previously considered separate problems and are often managed separately. With this new designation, the AHA wants people to understand that the conditions are closely connected," &lt;a href="https://www.massgeneralbrigham.org/en/about/newsroom/articles/what-is-ckm-syndrome" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Mass General Brigham explains&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To diagnose CKM syndrome, providers will test different risk factors, to determine your stage from 0 to 4, according to the &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic-syndrome" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;. Stage 0 means no risk factors; Stage 1 means you have excess body fat; Stage 2 means you have a condition such as Type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure or kidney disease; Stage 3 means you have heart disease without symptoms or a high risk of it; and Stage 4 means you have heart disease with symptoms, extra body fat and risk factors for diabetes or other metabolic conditions. Stage 4 could also include kidney disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2818457" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;a study&lt;/a&gt; published in JAMA last year, nearly 90% of U.S. adults have at least one risk factor for CKM syndrome, which include the following: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;High blood pressure&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Abnormal cholesterol&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;High blood sugar&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Excess weight&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reduced kidney function&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The interplay of these risk factors increases the risk for heart attack, stroke and heart failure more than any one of them alone," the AHA said in a news release about its survey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Changes to eating habits and physical activity can help prevent CKM syndrome, AHA and other experts say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a 2023 interview with &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/on-call-with-dr-kumar-cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic-syndrome-or-ckm-explained/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;CBS New York&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, cardiologist Dr. Nidhi Kumar said 33% of Americans have three or more risk factors that contribute to this syndrome. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When we think of danger in medicine, sometimes people think of the words 'cancer' or 'COVID,' but chronic diseases, like those that make up CKM, are the leading cause of death and disability in the United States," Kumar said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Eduardo Sanchez, the American Heart Association's chief medical officer for prevention, said in a statement that it's important for people to know it's common to have heart, kidney and metabolic risk factors at the same time. &lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="mpu-flex-inc3" data-ad="mpu-flex-inc" class="ad-mpu-flex-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["mpu-flex-inc",3]'&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It is reassuring that once the CKM connection was defined nearly three-quarters of those responding understood that it was important and wanted to learn more," Sanchez said about the AHA survey. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Cleveland Clinic adds, "researchers are hoping for a future where everyone gets holistic treatment for CKM syndrome instead of treatment for one body system at a time." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Harris Poll conducted the survey, which included about 4,000 U.S. adults, in August 2025 on behalf of the association.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vitamin K, an essential nutrient that prevents blood cots and aids in bone health could also be an effective long-term treatment for neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Japanese study team took the molecule, created a novel, altered form and used it to improve the transcriptions of cells into neurons at a rate 300% higher than controls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If replicated in humans, such an effect would slow or even reverse the progress of diseases like Alzheimer’s, Huntington’s, and Parkinson’s, and would be one of the first to be demonstrated to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though possessing of this neuroprotective effect, naturally-forming vitamin K compounds like menaquinone-4 are likely not substantial enough to prevent the onset and progression of these diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a groundbreaking study &lt;a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acschemneuro.5c00111" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in ACS Chemical Neuroscience, researchers from the Department of Bioscience and Engineering at Shibaura Institute of Technology in Japan synthesized 12 different vitamin K analogues that included a metabolite of vitamin A called retinoic acid, and a methyl ester side chain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pgs-dpg-flex" data-pgs-partner-id="good-news-network"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This analogue exhibited “a three-fold higher neuronal differentiation activity,” meaning it stimulated neuronal progenitor cells in mice to form new neurons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This novel form of vitamin K interacted heavily with the cellular receptor for metabotropic glutamate (mGluRs) which is known to be very involved with neuron intercommunication, and which if inhabited in mice, creates behavior alternations similar to those seen in dementia patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DEMENTIA DRUG RESEARCH: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Our research offers a potentially groundbreaking approach to treating neurodegenerative diseases. A vitamin K-derived drug that slows the progression of Alzheimer’s disease or improves its symptoms could not only improve the quality of life for patients and their families but also significantly reduce the growing societal burden of healthcare expenditures and long-term caregiving,” the authors &lt;a href="https://scitechdaily.com/breakthrough-vitamin-k-compounds-may-reverse-alzheimers-damage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;concluded&lt;/a&gt; their study by writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vitamin K, being a safe and tolerable naturally-occurring essential nutrient, would have enormous advantages for drug manufacturers looking to capitalize on this research for a dementia treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While any form of the molecule would have to be proven efficacious as a treatment, safety trials would be very straightforward as the compound already has established safety and supplemental doses.&lt;/p&gt;

By analyzing over 5,000 blood proteins, they identified molecular signs of damage to myelin—the protective sheath around nerve fibers—long before symptoms emerge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Key biomarkers such as IL-3 and MOG reveal a two-stage attack, first targeting myelin and later damaging the nerve fibers themselves. This discovery paves the way for an early diagnostic blood test and, potentially, preventive MS treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Early Detection:&lt;/strong&gt; Damage to myelin appears up to seven years before MS diagnosis, revealed by a spike in the MOG protein.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Immune Activation Marker:&lt;/strong&gt; IL-3 plays a central role in recruiting immune cells that trigger early brain inflammation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Diagnostic Tool:&lt;/strong&gt; Researchers identified 21 proteins that could form the basis for a predictive blood test for MS.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;UCSF&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By the time patients start seeking care for multiple sclerosis (MS), the disease has already been damaging their brains for years. But until recently, scientists didn’t understand which brain cells were being targeted or when the injury began.  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, by analyzing thousands of proteins found in the blood, scientists at UC San Francisco have created the clearest picture yet of when the disease attacks the myelin sheath that covers the nerve fibers. It shows that the immune system begins attacking the brain even earlier than previously had been thought. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-113463"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/Ms-immune-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/Ms-immune-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/Ms-immune-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/Ms-immune-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/Ms-immune-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/Ms-immune-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/Ms-immune-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/Ms-immune-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/Ms-immune-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/Ms-immune-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/Ms-immune-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/Ms-immune-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/Ms-immune-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/Ms-immune-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/Ms-immune-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;During this time, IL-3 and some related proteins that orchestrate an immune reaction appeared in the blood. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study measured debris from these attacks in a person’s blood, along with the signals that coordinate the immune system to go on the attack. It lays out, for the first time, the sequence of events that eventually lead to the disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The discovery could lead to new ways to diagnose multiple sclerosis — and possibly one day prevent it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MS first attacks the fatty myelin sheath, and a year later, it’s possible to see the breakdown of nerve fibers themselves. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the many immune signaling proteins that were elevated in the early stage of the disease, one protein stood out: IL-3. It plays an important role in this early phase when the central nervous system is suffering significant damage, but the patient doesn’t yet feel it. IL-3 is known for recruiting immune cells to the brain and spinal cord, where they attack nerve cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We think our work opens numerous opportunities for diagnosing, monitoring, and possibility treating MS,” said Ahmed Abdelhak, MD, assistant professor of Neurology at UCSF, and the first and co-lead author of the paper, which appears in &lt;em&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/em&gt; on Oct. 20. “It could be a gamechanger for how we understand and manage this disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers analyzed more than 5,000 proteins in blood samples from 134 people with MS, both before and after their diagnosis. These samples were provided by the U.S. Department of Defense Serum Repository, which stores samples from armed service members when they apply to join the military. The samples are then available for study decades afterwards, by which time some of the people may have gone on to develop MS.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seven years before a person’s diagnosis, they saw a spike in a protein called MOG, which stands for myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein and indicates damage to the insulation around the wires of the nervous system. A year after the MOG spike appeared, they saw a spike in another protein called neurofilament light chain, which indicates damage to the wires themselves. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During this time, IL-3 and some related proteins that orchestrate an immune reaction appeared in the blood. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team identified about 50 proteins that herald future disease, and they have submitted a patent application for a diagnostic blood test using the top 21 of them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ari Green, MD, chief of the Division of Neuroimmunology and Glial Biology in the UCSF Department of Neurology and senior author of the paper, said the study offers the hope of prevention and it gives a deeper understanding of what leads to the development of symptoms in MS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We now know that MS starts way earlier than the clinical onset, creating the real possibility that we could someday prevent MS — or at least use our understanding to protect people from further injury.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Authors:&lt;/strong&gt; Other UCSF authors are Gabriel Cerono, MD, Kiarra Ning, John Boscardin, PhD, The UCSF ORIGINS Study, Christian Cordano, MD, PhD, Asritha Tubati, Camille Fouassier, Eric D.

We used high-throughput discovery proteomics and samples from presymptomatic patients with MS and matched healthy controls to define the biological neurological onset and characterize the mechanisms involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remarkably, evidence of myelin injury was seen ~7 years before the symptomatic onset and preceded evidence of axonal injury by ~1 year. By contrast, astrocyte involvement became evident only at clinical onset. Numerous changes in the serum proteome indicate the involvement of interleukin 3 and nuclear factor kappa B pathways during the presymptomatic stage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, people with MS with a previously reported distinct autoantibody signature showed increased immune cell activity compared to those without. We propose a protein biomarker panel that may help distinguish presymptomatic patients with MS from healthy controls, pending validation in future studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our findings can help understand the pathophysiology of MS as well as the cascade of central nervous system injury and might facilitate early detection of MS in high-risk people.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Mon, 20 Oct 2025 16:17:41 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiZ0FVX3lxTFBWaUwxUWhzYTVEcVhtemdEZ1ZzcGl2aDF5YjdZbzM1VUhSVHB5eTRSWWFCWElCbUg2SmRUNjdwLTJSVmZGdEdhS1FRdnhSaFp6cDhFYXk3TUU5SWMtZTJBOWZtZXBaTGc</guid></item><item><title>美国国家医学科学院选出100名新成员-美国国家医学科学院</title><link>https://nam.edu/news-and-insights/100-new-members-elected-2025/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="elementor-element elementor-element-63cdbef1 big-para elementor-widget elementor-widget-theme-post-content" data-id="63cdbef1" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="theme-post-content.default"&gt;
					&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON — The National Academy of Medicine (NAM) today announced the election of 90 regular members and 10 international members during its &lt;a href="https://nam.edu/events/annual-meeting/"&gt;annual meeting&lt;/a&gt;. Election to the Academy is considered one of the highest honors in the fields of health and medicine and recognizes individuals who have demonstrated outstanding professional achievement and commitment to service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I am deeply honored to welcome these extraordinary health and medicine leaders and researchers into the National Academy of Medicine,” said NAM President Victor J. Dzau. “Their demonstrated excellence in tackling public health challenges, leading major discoveries, improving health care, advancing health policy, and addressing health equity will critically strengthen our collective ability to tackle the most pressing health challenges of our time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New members are elected by current members through a process that recognizes individuals who have made major contributions to the advancement of the medical sciences, health care, and public health. A diversity of talent among NAM’s membership is assured by its Articles of Organization, which stipulate that at least one-quarter of the membership is selected from fields outside the health professions — for example, from such fields as law, engineering, social sciences, and the humanities. The newly elected members bring NAM’s total membership to more than 2,500, which includes more than 200 international members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Established originally as the Institute of Medicine in 1970 by the National Academy of Sciences, the National Academy of Medicine addresses critical issues in health, science, medicine, and related policy and inspires positive actions across sectors. NAM works alongside the National Academy of Sciences and National Academy of Engineering to provide independent, objective analysis and advice to the nation and conduct other activities to solve complex problems and inform public policy decisions. The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine also encourage education and research, recognize outstanding contributions to knowledge, and increase public understanding of STEMM. With their election, NAM members make a commitment to volunteer their service in National Academies activities.&lt;/p&gt;

Unlike traditional chemotherapy and other invasive treatments, this new method avoids the painful side effects patients often endure.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The breakthrough comes from a partnership between The University of Texas at Austin and the University of Porto in Portugal, made possible through the UT Austin Portugal Program. The collaboration aims to make light-based cancer therapies more accessible and affordable. Current versions of these treatments rely on expensive materials, specialized lab setups, and powerful lasers that can sometimes damage surrounding tissue. By switching to LEDs and introducing tin-based "SnOx nanoflakes" ("Sn" is the chemical symbol for tin), the researchers have created a safer and potentially low-cost alternative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LED Light and Nanoflakes Team Up Against Cancer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our goal was to create a treatment that is not only effective but also safe and accessible," said Jean Anne Incorvia, a professor in the Cockrell School of Engineering's Chandra Family Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering and one of the leaders on the project. "With the combination of LED light and SnOx nanoflakes, we've developed a method to precisely target cancer cells while leaving healthy cells untouched."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a recent study published in &lt;em&gt;ACS Nano&lt;/em&gt;, the approach proved highly effective against both colorectal and skin cancer cells. After only 30 minutes of exposure, the LED-driven treatment destroyed up to 92% of skin cancer cells and 50% of colorectal cancer cells, while leaving healthy human skin cells unharmed. The results highlight the therapy's precision and safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Safer Alternative to Conventional Cancer Treatments&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cancer remains the second-leading cause of death worldwide, and many existing treatments come with severe side effects. Scientists across the globe are exploring new methods to make therapies safer and more targeted. One of the most promising is near-infrared photothermal therapy, which uses light to heat and destroy cancer cells without the need for surgery or toxic drugs. This principle forms the foundation of the UT Austin-Portugal team's research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having shown strong early results, the researchers are now focused on understanding how light and heat interact in the process and on testing other materials that might enhance the treatment. They also plan to design practical medical devices that can deliver the therapy directly to patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bringing Light-Based Cancer Care to Patients&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our ultimate goal is to make this technology available to patients everywhere, especially places where access to specialized equipment is limited, with fewer side effects and lower cost," said Artur Pinto, a researcher at the Faculty of Engineering of the University of Porto and lead researcher of the project in Portugal. "For skin cancers in particular, we envision that one day, treatment could move from the hospital to the patient's home. A portable device could be placed on the skin after surgery to irradiate and destroy any remaining cancer cells, reducing the risk of recurrence."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Incorvia and Pinto first teamed up through the UT Austin Portugal Program in 2021. Since then, they have exchanged visits between Texas and Portugal and combined their expertise to explore how two-dimensional materials can be used to advance cancer therapies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expanding the Research Frontier&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building on their success, the team recently received additional funding through the UT Austin Portugal Program to create an implant for breast cancer patients using the same LED and nanoflake technology. Their continued collaboration could pave the way for more personalized, affordable, and pain-free cancer treatments in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other co-authors of the article are: Ph.D. student Hui-Ping Chang (led development of the nanoflakes) and undergraduate student Eva Nance of The University of Texas at Austin; Filipa A.L.S. Silva (performed biological characterization), Susana G. Santos (supervised the work) and professor Fernão Magalhães (contributed to securing funding) of Faculty of Engineering of the University of Porto; and José R. Fernandes of the University of Trás-os-Montes and Alto Douro, who developed the LED systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UT Austin Portugal Program is a long-standing science and technology partnership between UT and the Portuguese Foundation of Science and Technology (FCT). Portugal has similar partnerships with two other U.S. universities -- the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Carnegie Mellon University -- and its 17-year collaboration with UT was recently renewed for another five years.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;If you’ve ever taken an edible to more easily drift off to bed, you’re not the only one. New research shows that a substantial portion of young American adults have used cannabis and/or alcohol as a sleep aid.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scientists at the University of Michigan conducted the study, which examined nationally representative survey data. They found that roughly one in five young adults have relied on these two drugs to help them sleep at times, particularly cannabis. Though effective, people’s overreliance on these drugs could eventually become a double-edged sword, the researchers caution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Cannabis and alcohol can help initiate sleep, but regular use may be problematic,” they wrote in their paper, &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2840034"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; this month in JAMA Pediatrics.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;A common sleep aid&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers examined data from the Monitoring the Future (MTF) Panel Study, a long-running project measuring drug use among teens and young adults. The project, run by the University of Michigan’s Institute for Social Research, routinely surveys high schoolers about their use of drugs and overall health, then continues to follow a subset of students into adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The current study involved nearly 1,500 people between the ages of 19 and 30. Approximately 22% had reported using either cannabis and/or alcohol in the past year to help them sleep, the researchers found. Around 18% reported using cannabis specifically, while about 7% used alcohol. Of those who reported using cannabis in general, roughly 41% had used it at times for sleep, compared to nearly 9% of regular alcohol users. People who used these drugs daily or near-daily were also more likely to report using them as sleep aids.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;Potential issues&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Many of us struggle with sleep from time to time. A 2022 study &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2798209"&gt;estimated&lt;/a&gt; that roughly 30% of U.S. adults have had trouble sleeping, including 23% of U.S. adults between the ages of 20 and 39. So it’s certainly understandable why many young people turn to these drugs to help them doze off. But the researchers note that there are real tradeoffs to using cannabis and alcohol for sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The most notable drawback is that our body gradually gets habituated to these drugs, meaning it takes increasing amounts to feel the same effects. In other words, over time, a person might need more cannabis or alcohol to help them sleep. These larger doses can then raise the risk of someone developing an unhealthy dependency on these drugs, also known as a substance use disorder. Trying to wean off these drugs can also be tricky, since both &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/marijuana-weed-withdrawal"&gt;cannabis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/alcohol-withdrawal"&gt;alcohol&lt;/a&gt; withdrawal can cause insomnia.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The researchers say that doctors should be more aware about the common use of cannabis and alcohol for sleep, which may help them step in before either a person’s sleeping or drug habits can become a bigger issue.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Raising clinicians’ awareness about the common intersection of substance use and sleep problems among young adults is important for screening and developing and offering clinical interventions for these critical health risk behaviors,” they wrote.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Why It’s a Concern: &lt;/strong&gt;Studies show that eating less sodium can improve blood pressure.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Also, the American Heart Association (AHA) recommends limiting sodium intake to 1,500 milligrams per day.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; A high-sodium diet can counteract the effect of blood pressure medications.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; High sodium usually comes from packaged foods such as fast food, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.health.com/healthiest-frozen-food-11821457" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;frozen meals&lt;/a&gt;, condiments, and salty snacks.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Why It’s a Concern: &lt;/strong&gt;Some blood pressure medications can increase potassium levels in your blood, so it's not recommended for people with chronic kidney disease, or taking certain medications like spironolactone, who have had issues with high potassium foods.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While potassium is recommended for many people with high blood pressure, some blood pressure medications can cause &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.health.com/hypokalemia-symptoms-7966570" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;hypokalemia&lt;/a&gt; (low blood potassium levels).

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;What Experts Say: &lt;/strong&gt;"If you’re on a medication that increases potassium level, such as a potassium-sparing diuretic (for example, spironolactone) or an ACE inhibitor (for example, lisinopril, enalapril, fosinopril, captopril), try to avoid eating food rich in potassium,’’ said Dowe.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Why It’s a Concern: &lt;/strong&gt;Licorice is a root that's naturally sweet and used in candies and herbal remedies.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Licorice can cause your body to hold more sodium and water while it loses more potassium. This reduces the effectiveness of diuretics and ACE inhibitors.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; This may raise blood pressure and cause abnormal heart rhythms. In severe cases, it can lead to serious heart conditions.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

This can cause more side effects.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increase drug absorption:&lt;/strong&gt; Food can increase drug absorption. Too much medicine in the body can cause side effects.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increase blood pressure, which can counteract drug effects: &lt;/strong&gt;Some foods, like those high in sodium, can increase blood pressure. This can work against the effects of medicines.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cause mineral imbalances:&lt;/strong&gt; Potassium and sodium balance is important for controlling blood pressure. Some medicines change how your body keeps or gets rid of these minerals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_51-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_52-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For example, if your medicine keeps more potassium in your blood and you also eat a lot of potassium, it can cause hyperkalemia. This means too much potassium in your blood, which can be dangerous if not treated.

The exposure has been tied to a young child who was not vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__LDG2k"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials said the child passed through the main hospital lobby and by Suite 1010 (Surgical and Procedural Services) on their way to outpatient testing at &lt;a href="https://www.nm.org/locations/palos-hospital" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;Northwestern Medicine Palos Hospital&lt;/a&gt;, 12251 S. 80th Ave., Palos Heights. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The virus can linger in an area for up to two hours and can be especially dangerous for babies and young children, pregnant women, and people with compromised immune systems. Cook County health officials are working to identify and notify people who may have visited the lobby, Suite 1010 and outpatient testing area, between the hours of 4:30 to 7:15 p.m. Monday, Oct. 13.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__LDG2k"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles is a highly contagious respiratory disease that spreads easily through the air when an infected person breathes, coughs or sneezes. Measles is so contagious that if one person has it, 90 percent of the people close to that person who are not immune or are unvaccinated will also become infected with the measles virus.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;For People Who May Have Been Exposed:&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;People who may have been exposed should check with their health care provider if they are unsure about prior vaccination. The health care provider will determine the need for testing if symptoms develop. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If an exposed person develops symptoms, they should call a healthcare provider before going to a medical office or emergency department for evaluation to ensure that special arrangement can be made to prevent patients and medical staff from possible exposure. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;People that are unvaccinated against measles, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/vaccines/index.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;mumps and rubella (MMR)&lt;/a&gt; and are exposed should talk with their doctor about getting MMR vaccine. It is not harmful to get MMR vaccine after being exposed to measles, mumps or rubella and doing so may prevent measles. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Most people are vaccinated against measles routinely in childhood and are not at high risk. The best defense against measles is vaccination. Two doses of MMR vaccine are 97 percent effective against measles and generally provide lifelong immunity. The first dose should be given between 12-15 months of age; the second between the ages of 4-6 years old. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Protect Yourself from Misinformation- Vitamin A is not a substitute for vaccination. Vitamin A supplementation does not prevent measles infection. It can help reduce the severity of measles symptoms — particularly in malnourished children or those with vitamin A deficiency—but only after infection has occurred. Relying on vitamin A instead of vaccination puts individuals and communities at risk of infection, complications, and disease spread. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Unvaccinated individuals who do not have a healthcare provider are encouraged to contact &lt;a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/links-1.govdelivery.com/CL0/https:*2F*2Fcookcountyhealth.org*2F/1/010001999c32ba5d-498faff7-e197-4bb6-867c-f49487e76240-000000/WzxWWf7mEsu7NSBnpW87wIiX2gIF5Wi5lUWuCZZ037g=425__;JSUl!!MLa4LY8OsLnxtQ!zKe3WUNjv_FLSWsoHfDHWc-GD9r9Xuzm5j9Ae1gE_gFHc8wstxH7DJUx4vxw9JWwgJxsisee1TocnnypkNGFXXvjoHamzVYx%24" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;Cook County Health&lt;/a&gt; at 312-864-1111 to schedule a vaccination appointment or reach out to a &lt;a href="https://findahealthcenter.hrsa.gov/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;federally-qualified health center. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__LDG2k"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.chicago.gov/publichealth" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;Chicago Department of Public Health&lt;/a&gt; offers free MMR vaccinations for anyone who needs them, regardless of insurance status, at CDPH immunization clinics throughout the city.

The implant, which measures 2 millimetres by 2 millimetres, and is just 30 micrometres thick, is surgically inserted beneath the retina to replace the light-sensitive cells that have been lost to the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The clinical trial, which is described today in &lt;i&gt;The New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, involved 38 people with advanced AMD whose retinas had degenerated severely. One year after device implantation, 80% of participants had gained a clinically meaningful improvement in their vision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Where this dead retina was a complete blind spot, vision was restored,” says trial leader Frank Holz, an ophthalmologist at the University of Bonn in Germany. “Patients could read letters, they could read words, and they could function in their daily life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-02629-w" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03420-x/d41586-025-03420-x_19705470.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;Reversing blindness with stem cells&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite some minor events related to implantation surgery, the trial’s safety-monitoring board viewed the device’s benefits as outweighing its risks. In June, the device’s owners — the San Francisco-based neurotechnology company Science Corporation — applied for certification that would allow the device to be sold on the European market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think this is an exciting and significant study, which has been well-designed and analysed. It gives hope for providing vision in patients for whom this was more ‘science-fiction’ than reality,” says Francesca Cordeiro, an ophthalmologist at Imperial College London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Restored vision&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;AMD is the commonest form of incurable blindness in older people. There are two main types, wet and dry AMD. The current work studied people with dry AMD, the advanced form of which affects around 5 million people globally. In dry AMD, the central retina’s light-sensitive cells die over a period of years, leaving affected individuals with intact peripheral vision but without their high-acuity central vision. “They can’t recognize faces, they can’t read, they can’t drive a car, they can’t watch television,” says Holz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The light-sensitive cells that die (rods and cones) convert light into electrochemical signals that are conveyed to other types of retinal neurons, which then send messages to the brain’s visual-processing regions. Because retinal neurons survive AMD, scientists reasoned that a light-sensitive implant that electrically stimulates the retina according to the pattern of photons striking it could reinstate a sense of vision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-03575-3" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03420-x/d41586-025-03420-x_19914304.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;A visual guide to repairing the retina&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The implant, termed PRIMA — for photovoltaic retina implant microarray — was originally developed by the Paris-based company Pixium Vision, and was acquired by Science Corporation last year. It is wireless, unlike previous retinal devices. And, being photovoltaic, the photons that activate it also provide the energy source for generating its electrical output.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is used in combination with glasses that contain a camera that captures images and converts them into patterns of infrared light that they transmit to the retinal implant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The system, which allows users to zoom in and out on target objects, and adjust contrast and brightness, does, Holz says, take months of intensive training to use optimally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the current study, 38 individuals were treated at 17 clinical sites across 5 European countries, and 32 of the participants were tested a year after implantation. Twenty-six of them had a clinically meaningful improvement in their vision — which, on average, amounted to being able to see two lines further down a standard eye test chart of letters. Overall, most participants’ vision came close to the resolution achievable with PRIMA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the study’s end, most recipients were using PRIMA at home to read letters, words and numbers. Of the 32, 22 said that their user satisfaction was medium to high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

PBS</title><link>https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/advice-to-feed-babies-peanuts-early-and-often-helped-thousands-of-kids-avoid-allergies</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="body-text"&gt;
                    &lt;p&gt;A decade after a landmark study proved that feeding peanut products to young babies could prevent development of life-threatening allergies, new research finds the change has made a big difference in the real world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peanut allergies began to decline in the U.S. after guidance first issued in 2015 upended medical practice by recommending introducing the allergen to infants starting as early as 4 months. The rate of peanut allergies in children ages 0 to 3 fell by more than 27% after guidance for high-risk kids was first issued in 2015, and by more than 40% after the recommendations were expanded in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That’s a remarkable thing, right?” said Dr. David Hill, an allergist and researcher at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, and author of a study published Monday in the medical journal Pediatrics. Hill and colleagues analyzed electronic health records from dozens of pediatric practices to track diagnoses of food allergies in young children before, during and after the guidelines were issued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/giving-babies-peanut-based-foods-early-prevents-allergies"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;READ MORE:&lt;/strong&gt; Give peanuts to infants to prevent allergies, new guidelines say&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I can actually come to you today and say there are less kids with food allergy today than there would have been if we hadn’t implemented this public health effort,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 60,000 children have avoided food allergies since 2015, including 40,000 children who otherwise would have developed peanut allergies. Still, about 8% of children are affected by food allergies, including more than 2% with a peanut allergy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peanut allergy is caused when the body’s immune system mistakenly identifies proteins in peanuts as harmful and releases chemicals that trigger allergic symptoms, including hives, respiratory symptoms and, sometimes, life-threatening anaphylaxis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For decades, doctors had recommended delaying feeding children peanuts and other foods likely to trigger allergies until age 3. But in 2015, Gideon Lack at King’s College London, published the groundbreaking Learning Early About Peanut Allergy, or LEAP, trial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lack and colleagues showed that introducing peanut products in infancy reduced the future risk of developing food allergies by more than 80%. Later analysis showed that the protection persisted in about 70% of kids into adolescence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study immediately sparked new guidelines urging early introduction of peanuts — but putting them into practice has been slow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only about 29% of pediatricians and 65% of allergists reported following the expanded guidance issued in 2017, surveys found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Confusion and uncertainty about the best way to introduce peanuts early in life led to the lag, according to a commentary that accompanied the study. Early on, medical experts and parents alike questioned whether the practice could be adopted outside of tightly controlled clinical settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data for the analysis came from a subset of participating practice sites and may not represent the entire U.S. pediatric population, noted the commentary, led by Dr. Ruchi Gupta, a child allergy expert at Northwestern University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the new research offers “promising evidence that early allergen introduction is not only being adopted but may be making a measurable impact,” the authors concluded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advocates for the 33 million people in the U.S. with food allergies welcomed signs that early introduction of peanut products is catching on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This research reinforces what we already know and underscores a meaningful opportunity to reduce the incidence and prevalence of peanut allergy nationwide,” said Sung Poblete, chief executive of the nonprofit group Food Allergy Research &amp;amp; Education, or FARE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new study emphasizes the current guidance, updated in 2021, which calls for introducing peanuts and other major food allergens between four and six months, without prior screening or testing, Hill said. Parents should consult their pediatricians about any questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It doesn’t have to be a lot of the food, but little tastes of peanut butter, milk-based yogurt, soy-based yogurts and tree butters,” he said. “These are really good ways to allow the immune system exposure to these allergenic foods in a safe way.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tiffany Leon, 36, a Maryland registered dietician and director at FARE, introduced peanuts and other allergens early to her own sons, James, 4, and Cameron, 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first, Leon’s own mother was shocked at the advice to feed babies such foods before the age of 3, she said. But Leon explained how the science had changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As a dietician, I practice evidence-based recommendations,” she said. “So when someone told me, ‘This is how it’s done now, these are the new guidelines,’ I just though, OK, well, this is what we’re going to do.”&lt;/p&gt;

One of the most popular is walking 10,000 steps per day. Maybe you’ve tried a “hot girl walk” to get outside and clear your mind, or a “silent walk” to stay fully present with your thoughts. But have you heard of the newest trend called Japanese walking?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Walking is the single most effective and important exercise an individual can perform, especially in older age,” says &lt;a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:LinkedIn;elmt:;cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=6deefbf2-941b-4156-9f41-a61ebb50d13d&amp;amp;siteId=us-aol&amp;amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;amp;contentUuid=cbd201bb-50ae-4627-9fa5-e6a8406c70c5&amp;amp;featureId=text-link&amp;amp;merchantName=LinkedIn&amp;amp;linkText=Chris+Alvarado&amp;amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5saW5rZWRpbi5jb20vaW4vY2hyaXN0b3BoZXItYWx2YXJhZG8tM2EzMzQ0MWI3LyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiY2JkMjAxYmItNTBhZS00NjI3LTlmYTUtZTZhODQwNmM3MGM1Iiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5saW5rZWRpbi5jb20vaW4vY2hyaXN0b3BoZXItYWx2YXJhZG8tM2EzMzQ0MWI3LyJ9&amp;amp;signature=AQAAAVMUScwTDeNv_0R8HB54f3Vg8HTpW1PR5wluufyHK0cK&amp;amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fin%2Fchristopher-alvarado-3a33441b7%2F&amp;amp;spaceId=1197803369" class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Chris Alvarado;elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:LinkedIn;elmt:;cpos:1;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;&lt;ins&gt;Chris Alvarado&lt;/ins&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a cardiac rehabilitation exercise physiologist in O’ahu, Hawaii. It offers benefits for your heart, muscles, bones, and mind. However, &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org/article/S0025-6196(11)61303-7/abstract" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:research;cpos:2;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;ins&gt;research&lt;/ins&gt;&lt;/a&gt; suggests that Japanese walking is one of the most effective walking routines for boosting overall health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the Japanese walking trend promotes physical activity and offers significant benefits in an impressively short 30-minute timeframe, you may be surprised to learn that it isn’t equally effective for everyone who tries it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="caas-jump-link-heading" id="what-is-japanese-walking"&gt;What is Japanese walking?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Japanese walking isn’t a new concept. It was initially developed in 2007 by Professor Hiroshi Nose and Assistant Professor Shizu Mazuki at Shinshu University in Japan, where they studied the effects of what they called “interval walking training” or IWT. The specific regimen involved alternating between faster and slower walking speeds as follows:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fast-walk for three minutes&lt;/strong&gt;: Pick a challenging but doable pace where you can talk, but it’s difficult to hold a conversation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Walk slower for three minutes&lt;/strong&gt;: Pick a slower pace where you can talk more comfortably and can recover before the next round.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Repeat: &lt;/strong&gt;Complete the regimen five times, which takes 30 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alvarado isn’t surprised that the Japanese walking routine has turned into a viral trend. “It’s simple and relatively easy to complete. There’s no complex learning curve, and it can be done with a friend or by yourself,” said Alvarado. He also says that it’s a low-risk, high-reward exercise routine. Injury risk is low, but it offers plenty of benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="caas-jump-link-heading" id="potential-health-benefits-of-japanese-walking"&gt;Potential health benefits of Japanese walking&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The original 2007 study compared Japanese walking to moderate-intensity continuous walking (for about 8,000 steps) and no walking at all. Those who participated in Japanese walking four times a week for five months experienced greater improvements in thigh strength, aerobic capacity, and blood pressure compared to other exercise routines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the most impressive takeaway from this study is that it only takes 30 minutes rather than the time it takes to complete 8,000 steps (or even 10,000 steps, as other recent trends suggest). According to Alvarado, that’s just one of the benefits of interval training. “These workouts can be done within a short period of time and can still result in significant physiological improvements,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since 2007, many studies have supported the benefits of IWT. Some studies have even found additional benefits for certain conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hip replacement: &lt;/strong&gt;A small &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0108690" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:2014 study;cpos:3;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;ins&gt;2014 study&lt;/ins&gt;&lt;/a&gt; shows that IWT can improve leg strength after a hip replacement in 12 weeks and could be part of a rehabilitation strategy (with medical clearance).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Age-associated decline&lt;/strong&gt;: A &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://faseb.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1096/fasebj.2018.32.1_supplement.588.9" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:2018 study;cpos:4;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;ins&gt;2018 study&lt;/ins&gt;&lt;/a&gt; suggested that 10 years of IWT can protect against the age-associated decrease in aerobic fitness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Type 2 diabetes&lt;/strong&gt;: A &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10194951/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:2023 pilot study;cpos:5;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;ins&gt;2023 pilot study&lt;/ins&gt;&lt;/a&gt; suggested that 20 weeks of IWT improves cholesterol and overall fitness for people with type 2 diabetes (with medical clearance).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mobility and endurance&lt;/strong&gt;: A &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.cureus.com/articles/284062-effects-of-high-intensity-interval-walking-on-cognitive-and-physical-functions-in-older-adults-a-randomized-pilot-study#!" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:2024 study;cpos:6;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;ins&gt;2024 study&lt;/ins&gt;&lt;/a&gt; found that older adults participating in IWT for eight weeks had better endurance and flexibility compared to those participating in a continuous walking program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 class="caas-jump-link-heading" id="why-japanese-walking-may-not-be-as-effective-for-everyone"&gt;Why Japanese walking may not be as effective for everyone&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Japanese walking, and walking in general, can benefit most people—especially compared to no physical activity at all. But not everyone will find Japanese walking effective and impactful to their overall health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alvarado notices that the original study is most relevant to older adults because participants were around age 63. Other studies seem to focus on a similar age group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For someone who may be younger or in better physical shape than the average person, the improvement curve may not yield as significant results as in the older population. This is because the exercise routine may not offer enough physical strain on the body,” said Alvarado. As a result, these people might initially see improvements, but they will likely plateau.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also notices that the original study didn’t mention the method of walking. In other words, we don’t know if participants walked on a treadmill or up and down hills. Few other studies mention a method.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This could have affected the outcomes of the participants in the study,” he said. For example, if some study participants walked in their hilly neighborhood, they may have seen more improvements in thigh strength compared to those who walked on a community track.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alvarado suggests that the Japanese walking trend may be most beneficial for older individuals, those just starting with a workout routine, or people who want to maintain their endurance with a low-risk exercise method. But &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://cdnsciencepub.com/doi/full/10.1139/apnm-2023-0595" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:more research is needed;cpos:7;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;ins&gt;more research is needed&lt;/ins&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to understand the benefits for healthy or younger adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="caas-jump-link-heading" id="how-to-start-japanese-walking"&gt;How to start Japanese walking&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Japanese walking doesn’t require much: just a reliable pair of shoes and a place to walk. And since Japanese walking only takes 30 minutes (about 2% of a 24-hour day), it’s a low-commitment exercise that can easily fit into your day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are a few ways you can start incorporating it into your routine:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Plan it out&lt;/strong&gt;: Fit your Japanese walking routine at least four times a week for the most benefits. If four times a week is too much at first, you can work up to it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Build in rest days&lt;/strong&gt;: You don’t need to walk every day to see results. Schedule rest days to help you recover and perform your best.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Find a partner&lt;/strong&gt;: Commit to the routine with a friend, family member, or furry companion. An exercise partner helps keep you accountable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Choose a method&lt;/strong&gt;: Alvarado suggests walking on your treadmill, in a park, or on your way to work. And if you get bored with one method, switch it up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pace wisely&lt;/strong&gt;: During the fast-walk phase, pick a challenging pace that you can recover from before the next round. This way, you can complete the entire 30-minute routine without a break.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Track your walks&lt;/strong&gt;: If you’re able, use a smartwatch or fitness tracker to view your pace. As you get in shape (or if you’re not feeling your best on a particular day), you may need to adjust your intensity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meet the experts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:LinkedIn;elmt:;cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=6deefbf2-941b-4156-9f41-a61ebb50d13d&amp;amp;siteId=us-aol&amp;amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;amp;contentUuid=cbd201bb-50ae-4627-9fa5-e6a8406c70c5&amp;amp;featureId=text-link&amp;amp;merchantName=LinkedIn&amp;amp;linkText=Chris+Alvarado&amp;amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5saW5rZWRpbi5jb20vaW4vY2hyaXN0b3BoZXItYWx2YXJhZG8tM2EzMzQ0MWI3LyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiY2JkMjAxYmItNTBhZS00NjI3LTlmYTUtZTZhODQwNmM3MGM1Iiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5saW5rZWRpbi5jb20vaW4vY2hyaXN0b3BoZXItYWx2YXJhZG8tM2EzMzQ0MWI3LyJ9&amp;amp;signature=AQAAAVMUScwTDeNv_0R8HB54f3Vg8HTpW1PR5wluufyHK0cK&amp;amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fin%2Fchristopher-alvarado-3a33441b7%2F&amp;amp;spaceId=1197803369" class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Chris Alvarado;elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:LinkedIn;elmt:;cpos:8;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;&lt;ins&gt;Chris Alvarado&lt;/ins&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, MPH, cardiac rehabilitation exercise physiologist and adjunct professor at Chaminade University in O’ahu, Hawaii&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions about this piece — or you just wanna chat about your favorite products you think we should check out — send us an email at &lt;strong&gt;shopping.editors@aol.com&lt;/strong&gt; and we'll write you back!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Curious about how we test and choose products at AOL?

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arsenic is a natural component of Earth's crust and highly toxic in its inorganic form. The element is a cause of a global public health crisis, as it is present in groundwater and the drinking water consumed daily by millions of people in countries such as Bangladesh, China, India, Mexico and Pakistan.&lt;/p&gt;


										  

										
																																	&lt;p&gt;Long-term exposure to high levels of inorganic arsenic can cause cardiovascular disease and cancers of the bladder and lungs. But now, scientists from Denmark have developed a new treatment that turns arsenic-rich groundwater waste into useful raw materials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While current methods to clean arsenic from groundwater are successful, they create another problem—an arsenic-rich sludge that requires complex, specialist and expensive disposal methods. The residue is also a major environmental and health hazard if not disposed of properly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a study, &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adz5816" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;i&gt;Science Advances&lt;/i&gt;, Kaifeng Wang and Case van Genuchten at the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland detail a two-step process to convert the hazardous sludge into a raw material for electronics, batteries and semiconductors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Transforming a deadly contaminant into a valuable resource&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, the sludge is washed in a strong alkali solution that pulls arsenic out of the waste by breaking the &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/chemical+bonds/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;chemical bonds&lt;/a&gt; between arsenic, phosphate and &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/iron+oxides/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;iron oxides&lt;/a&gt; that had been added in the cleaning treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This releases dissolved arsenic and phosphorus into the liquid. Next, the researchers heat the solution and add a common, safe chemical called thiourea dioxide. This converts dissolved arsenic into pure, solid, metallic arsenic nanoparticles. The remaining phosphates can be easily recovered separately by treating them with calcium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This work can catalyze the previously unimaginable scenario that the same contaminant resulting in 'the largest mass poisoning in human history' can be transformed to a commodity that provides increased economic welfare to &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/local+communities/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;local communities&lt;/a&gt;," wrote the researchers in their paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Scaling up challenges&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The process is still at the lab scale, and the key challenge for scaling up the technology is developing the most cost-effective and efficient method of operating. This includes practical ways for recycling and reusing the chemicals so local treatment plants don't have to keep buying them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the challenges are met, communities could find ready markets for their extracted arsenic. This is because the element is classified as a Critical Raw Material (CRM) in places like the US and Europe, meaning it is important economically. For example, metallic &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/arsenic/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;arsenic&lt;/a&gt; is needed for semiconductors and clean energy technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;The genes we inherit may have a subtle influence over whether we experiment with and make a habit of using cannabis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A team led by researchers from Western University in Canada, the University of California, San Diego (UC San Diego), and personal genomics and biotechnology company 23andMe compared the full genomes of 131,895 individuals with self-reported frequency of cannabis use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to identifying variations in two key genetic sequences associated with &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cannabis-really-has-changed-significantly-since-todays-parents-were-teens"&gt;cannabis use&lt;/a&gt;, the study linked the same genetic patterns to more than a hundred other physical and mental health traits, providing clues on how drug use relates to our wellbeing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/air-pollution-strongly-associated-with-dna-mutations-tied-to-lung-cancer"&gt;Air Pollution 'Strongly Associated' With DNA Mutations Tied to Lung Cancer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Numerous factors can affect whether an individual uses drugs for self-medication or recreational purposes, from &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.36571"&gt;where they live&lt;/a&gt; to how much &lt;a href="https://today.ucsd.edu/story/large-genetic-study-links-cannabis-use-to-psychiatric-cognitive-and-physical-health"&gt;money they have&lt;/a&gt;. Genetics often has a more indirect impact on our habits, making some prone to experimental or frequent use despite risks of ongoing harm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"While most people who try cannabis do not go on to develop cannabis use disorder, some studies estimate that nearly 30 percent will," &lt;a href="https://today.ucsd.edu/story/large-genetic-study-links-cannabis-use-to-psychiatric-cognitive-and-physical-health"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Sandra Sanchez-Roige, a professor of psychiatry at UC San Diego.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Understanding the genetics of early-stage behaviors may help clarify who is at greater risk, opening the door to prevention and intervention strategies."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first of the genes highlighted by the researchers is Cell Adhesion Molecule 2 (&lt;em&gt;CADM2&lt;/em&gt;), which helps handle cell assembly and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-first-of-its-kind-signal-has-been-detected-in-human-brains"&gt;nerve cell communication&lt;/a&gt;. It appears connected to measures of lifetime use of cannabis and frequency, based on these new findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, the gene Metabotropic Glutamate Receptor 3 (&lt;em&gt;GRM3&lt;/em&gt;) also seems involved. It contributes to neuron signaling and long-term &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/brains-memory-center-never-stops-making-neurons-study-confirms"&gt;brain plasticity&lt;/a&gt; and has been &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1503/jpn.130242"&gt;linked with psychiatric disorders&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;CADM2&lt;/em&gt; has previously &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41398-023-02453-y"&gt;been linked&lt;/a&gt; to cannabis use, but not frequency, while &lt;em&gt;GRM3&lt;/em&gt; hasn't been connected to cannabis in prior studies. Researchers could potentially investigate how the newfound DNA variations may affect the expression/function of these genes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team also compared their findings to other DNA variations and gene maps, spotting overlaps with conditions including anxiety,  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/depression" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73097" data-postid="177742" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/study-reveals-the-surprising-age-at-which-your-brain-reaches-its-peak"&gt;executive cognitive function&lt;/a&gt;, and  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="177742" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_177745" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-177745" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/GeneGraph.jpg" alt="DNA chart" class="wp-image-177745 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/GeneGraph.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/GeneGraph-600x280.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-177745" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;DNA variations near two genes in particular were highlighted. (Thorpe et al, &lt;em&gt;Mol. Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We showed that the genetics of cannabis use – both trying it and using it more often – are tied to the genetics of other psychiatric traits, cognitive measures, and even physical health problems," &lt;a href="https://today.ucsd.edu/story/large-genetic-study-links-cannabis-use-to-psychiatric-cognitive-and-physical-health"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Sanchez-Roige.&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/spark-into-space-comp?utm_source=promo_launch"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Launch-642x272.jpg" alt="Mid Article Promo Launch" class="alignnone wp-image-177073 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Launch-642x272.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Launch-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Launch-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Launch.jpg 844w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the data is significant, it also suggests any potential genetic influence remains rather modest compared to other factors. Genes may explain just under 13 percent of the variation in whether individuals have tried cannabis at some point in their life, and just 6 percent of the spectrum of its frequency of use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By pinpointing commonalities in DNA variations and how they differ between the likelihood of cannabis use and the frequency of cannabis use, it may be possible to assess risk among individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Cannabis use exists on a continuum," &lt;a href="https://today.ucsd.edu/story/large-genetic-study-links-cannabis-use-to-psychiatric-cognitive-and-physical-health"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; neuroscientist Hayley Thorpe, from Western University in Canada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"By studying these intermediate traits, we can begin to map how genetic risk unfolds before cannabis use disorder develops."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41380-025-03219-2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Molecular Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="embed-content" data-embed-type="raw-html-embed"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;”Ever since I stopped lifting super heavy and incorporated more low-intensity workouts, not only did I feel so much less bloated throughout the day, but I’m in such a better shape now,” – that’s how Mandana Zarghami says she got rid of what’s being called &lt;a href="/beauty/article/63063/1/the-truth-behind-tiktok-cortisol-obsession-hormone-balancing-viral"&gt;“cortisol face”&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@mandanazarghami/video/7384892913060400430"&gt;&lt;span&gt;a TikTok video&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Zarghami is not the only wellness influencer encouraging women to ditch lifting weights in favour of low-intensity exercises like walking and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@mandanazarghami/video/7555697541141007671"&gt;&lt;span&gt;pilates.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Other women on #GymTok have claimed that walking instead of running avoids facial puffiness associated with “&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@kateglavan/video/7387182382345981227?lang=en"&gt;&lt;span&gt;runner’s face&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;”, stopping lifting is what &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@alyb0ba/video/7415731047763152170"&gt;&lt;span&gt;“snatched” their body&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@monetzamoraa/video/7345546789824580907"&gt;&lt;span&gt;quitting HIIT workouts helped them lose weight&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;While the buzz around “lowering your cortisol” – your body’s stress hormone – is fairly new, the idea that women shouldn’t be engaging in high-intensity or high-impact exercise isn’t. After decades of women fighting for their right to exercise and play sports, why are we still so afraid of becoming swole, puffy, muscly women?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The history of women’s fitness culture is complicated. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;For much of the 20th century, women were discouraged from engaging in vigorous exercise, being told &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wbur.org/onpoint/2022/04/18/the-secret-history-of-womens-fitness"&gt;&lt;span&gt;they were physically limited&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. Until 1972, women were prohibited from running marathons in the US because they were considered &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/18/sports/women-running-boston-marathon.html"&gt;“physiologically incapable”&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;In America, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/01/14/well/move/fitness-evolution-trends-1970s.html"&gt;&lt;span&gt;the 70s changed women’s approach to exercise forever&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;: feminists urged women to embrace their physical strength, women’s magazines promoted exercise to trim your figure, New York City hosted the first all-women’s road race in Central Park and Jane Fonda opened her first workout studio in Beverly Hills. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="embed-content" data-embed-type="media-tiktok" data-id="7387182382345981227"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="embed-content" data-embed-type="raw-html"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;For a long time, cardio was king and women’s exercise was focused around burning calories, instead of building muscle – “bulky” women being considered “unfeminine”. Until recently, when we reached the point where more people know that &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/strength-training-builds-more-than-muscles"&gt;strength training is important not only to maintain muscle mass, but also for building bone density&lt;/a&gt; (something that becomes even more important with age). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;The shift I have seen take hold in a very deep way in popular culture is this move towards women lifting heavy weights,” says Danielle Friedman, author of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://danielle-friedman.com/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Let's Get Physical&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Even some of the big gym chains have had to replace cardio equipment with lifting equipment because of this shift.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But with this shift towards strength training has come a return to the age-old portrayal of women as fragile beings with bodies that can’t handle intense exercise; the latest in the re-purposed myths to keep women focused on maintaining a small, tradionally “feminine” figure. This time, the fear is centred around cortisol. Younger women &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;online have started increasingly worrying about getting &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@stellapatel27/photo/7478849185148603670"&gt;&lt;span&gt;cortisol face&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; or even &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@theworkoutwitch/video/7493329945528257834"&gt;&lt;span&gt;“cortisol belly”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; from doing the “wrong” workouts. These people encourage low-impact workouts like Pilates was a way&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@pilatesexercises/video/7395306837987380522"&gt;&lt;span&gt;lower your cortisol and tone your body&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. But this current focus on low-cortisol workouts is, for most people, largely unnecessary.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Alex Rothstein, assistant professor of exercise science at New York Institute of Technology’s School of Health Professions, calls cortisol a “very good hormone” when it’s doing its job properly, with a lot of negative associations. “Cortisol is not inherently a bad thing, but it gets a bad reputation when people live chronically stressful lives,” he says. “When it comes to cortisol and exercise, when you are taking part in an exercise programme that you are trained for, it’s pretty difficult to exercise yourself into negative cortisol levels.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It’s not bad for your body to produce cortisol; it can be a good thing, but too much stress is what’s bad for you. And that’s not even the exercise itself, but not resting and failing to eat enough food after you work out in order to recover appropriately.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class="embed-content" data-embed-type="raw-html"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Most often, high cortisol is &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cedars-sinai.org/blog/what-is-cortisol.html"&gt;&lt;span&gt;correlated to the stressors people encounter during the course of an ordinary day&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; (including lack of sleep or being overworked). This means stress-management techniques will lower cortisol levels and regular exercise can &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://lifestylemedicine.stanford.edu/how-exercise-balances-cortisol-levels/"&gt;&lt;span&gt;actually reduce stress and lower baseline cortisol levels over time&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. “A controlled cortisol spike [while working out] is actually healthy,” says Rothstein. “It can help build resilience and tolerance, as your body becomes better at handling stress.” (The “stress” being progressive overload.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;As with all things exercise-related, there’s no one-size-fits-all approach. Much of the low-intensity discussion is taking place alongside conversations around women’s hormones, and &lt;a href="https://www.bu.edu/articles/2024/bu-engineers-pioneer-womens-health-research/"&gt;women’s health is chronically understudied&lt;/a&gt;. For people with PCOS, like 26-year-old Jannat, shifting to low-intensity exercise has been beneficial. “I used to run because everyone did that, so I did too,” she says. “I felt awful after, but still booked a boxfit or a Zumba class and even played badminton.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Over the years, Jannat says her PCOS symptoms worsened, and she became tempted by the idea of a slower, more consistent workout routine after learning about low-cortisol and low-impact workouts in 2019, when she first came across PCOS-friendly trainers on TikTok. “Over time, I think I’ve taken the slowness all the way down and don’t work out anywhere near as much as I used to, but my PCOS symptoms are significantly better,” she says.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="embed-content" data-embed-type="media-tiktok" data-id="7341532533101694250"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="embed-content" data-embed-type="raw-html"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Many women, however, feel the best after lifting heavy weights. Casey Johnston, author of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.caseyjohnston.website/my-work/a-physical-education"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;A Physical Education&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; and otherwise known as “a swole woman” to her newsletter subscribers, cautions anyone who comes across any one way of exercise being the &lt;/span&gt;“answer” for women.&lt;span&gt; “There’s no trick, and the more specific it is, the more likely it’s empty marketing,” she says. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;“It’s not bad for your body to produce cortisol; it can be a good thing, but too much stress is what’s bad for you. And that’s not even the exercise itself, but not resting and failing to eat enough food after you work out in order to recover appropriately.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It also feels unsurprising that the idea that women should exercise in a dainty and delicate manner is resurfacing during the current &lt;a href="/beauty/article/66958/1/beauty-backslide-how-the-pendulum-swung-back-to-thinness-and-conservatism"&gt;resurgence of ultra-thin ideals, conservative aesthetics&lt;/a&gt; and regressive socio-political attitudes. As Naomi Wolf wrote in &lt;em&gt;The Beauty Myth&lt;/em&gt;, “A culture fixated on female thinness is not an obsession about female beauty, but an obsession about female obedience.” In the 19th century, &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2014/7/8/5880931/the-19th-century-health-scare-that-told-women-to-worry-about-bicycle"&gt;the made-up “bicycle face”&lt;/a&gt; was used to try to scare off women from cycling and having an independent mode of transportation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;For those who want to start lifting, Johnston recommends starting with the basics: lifting weights that feel a comfortable and appropriate amount of difficult for you, and then building steadily from where you are at. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;“What makes exercise good for us is the appropriately designed challenge of it, teaching our muscles how to work together,” she says. “Your body is designed for it.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

The agency scaled back &lt;a href="/news/2025/9/19/us-vaccine-advisory-panel-does-not-recommend-covid-jabs-for-all"&gt;COVID-19&lt;/a&gt; vaccine recommendations, approved COVID-19 vaccines for fewer people and aimed to remove the preservative &lt;a href="/news/2025/6/28/what-is-thimerosal-vaccine-preservative-called-toxic-by-us-health-chief"&gt;thimerosal&lt;/a&gt; from US vaccines. Experts told PolitiFact scientific research did not support its removal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;section class="more-on"&gt;&lt;h2 class="more-on__heading"&gt;Recommended Stories &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;span class="screen-reader-text"&gt;list of 3 items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="screen-reader-text"&gt;end of list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p&gt;During a September 22 news conference, in which US President Donald Trump told people not to take Tylenol during pregnancy, he also mentioned another objective. “We want no aluminium in the vaccine,” he said. The administration was already in the process of removing aluminium from vaccines, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About two weeks later, on October 8, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP, announced a new working group focused on the childhood vaccine schedule. Its discussion topics include vaccine ingredient safety and aluminium adjuvants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robert Malone, an ACIP member who has opposed COVID-19 vaccines, told Axios he expected the ACIP would determine there was “a lot of evidence” of “issues” with aluminium in vaccines. The committee would likely vote to re-categorise vaccines containing aluminium adjuvants so that people would have to discuss with their doctor before getting them, Malone told Axios.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That could have far-reaching ramifications. Here’s what to know about aluminium in vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A: Small amounts of aluminium are sometimes included in vaccines as adjuvants, or substances that boost the body’s immune response to the vaccine to ensure protection from infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That boost means people can get fewer vaccine doses in smaller quantities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="q-when-used-how-much-aluminium-is-in-a-vaccine"&gt;Q: When used, how much aluminium is in a vaccine?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A: Vaccines with aluminium adjuvants usually contain less than 1mg aluminium per dose, according to the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is a pretty abstract number. To help make it more concrete: a milligram is one-thousandth (1/1,000th) of 1g. One gram is about the weight of a raisin or a stick of gum. Imagine cutting one of those items into 1,000 equal pieces. One of the pieces would be about 1mg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="article-newsletter-slot" data-testid="article-newsletter-slot"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here is another way to think about it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People come in contact with and consume aluminium all of the time. It is one of the most abundant metal elements in the Earth’s crust, according to the US Geological Survey. It is naturally occurring in soil, air and water. Food is the main way people are exposed to aluminium. The average adult eats 7mg to 9mg of aluminium per day, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A baby in its first six months might receive a total of about 4.4mg of aluminium from recommended vaccines. In the same period of time, a breastfed infant would ingest about 7mg of aluminium from breastmilk, and a formula-fed baby would ingest about 38mg from formula.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="q-how-long-have-vaccines-contained-aluminium"&gt;Q: How long have vaccines contained aluminium?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A: Aluminium adjuvants have been used in vaccines for more than 70 years, the CDC said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Aluminium is one of our oldest adjuvants; it’s been used in vaccines since the 1920s,” said Dr Peter Hotez, a Baylor College of Medicine professor and codirector of Texas Children’s Hospital Center for Vaccine Development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="q-how-do-we-know-it-s-safe-to-include-small-amounts-of-aluminium-in-vaccines"&gt;Q: How do we know it’s safe to include small amounts of aluminium in vaccines?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A: Every vaccine’s safety and efficacy are tested in animal studies and human clinical trials before the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) licenses it for public use. Every vaccine containing adjuvants has been tested, and health agencies continuously monitor their safety, the CDC said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over several decades of use, vaccines with aluminium adjuvants have been proven safe, the FDA said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaccines containing aluminium have been “given to billions of people worldwide now”, said Dr Kawsar Talaat, a professor at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A growing body of research has also found that aluminium adjuvants do not cause aluminium toxicity or other adverse outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="q-do-aluminium-adjuvants-have-any-risks"&gt;Q: Do aluminium adjuvants have any risks?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A: Rarely, some people have allergic reactions to aluminium in the same way they might have allergic reactions to other substances, Talaat said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2022, researchers published a retrospective, observational study on more than 325,000 children that found an association between vaccine-related aluminium exposure and persistent asthma. Association is not the same as causation, meaning the study did not prove a link between aluminium in vaccines and asthma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts from the CDC and the American Academy of Pediatrics encouraged more research on the subject because the backwards-looking observational study did not prove causation and also had limitations, including that it excluded many children who developed asthma before they turned two years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 2025 study found no increased risk of asthma associated with childhood exposure to aluminium-absorbed vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="q-which-vaccines-contain-aluminium-adjuvants"&gt;Q: Which vaccines contain aluminium adjuvants?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A: At least 25 vaccines approved for use in the US have aluminium adjuvants, the CDC says. That includes vaccines that protect against HPV, hepatitis A and B and diphtheria, tetanus, and acellular pertussis (whooping cough).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="q-which-vaccines-do-not-contain-aluminium-adjuvants"&gt;Q: Which vaccines do not contain aluminium adjuvants?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC’s list of vaccines without adjuvants includes vaccines against COVID-19, Ebola, meningococcal, polio and rabies. Additionally, most seasonal flu shots and the vaccine against measles, mumps and rubella do not contain aluminium adjuvants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="q-can-we-remove-aluminium-from-vaccines"&gt;Q: Can we remove aluminium from vaccines?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A: Not quickly. If it could be done at all, it would take years to develop, test and license new, aluminium-free vaccines. Many of the vaccines with aluminium adjuvants do not have aluminium-free formulas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A vaccine is licensed based on all of its ingredients and the exact manufacturing process,” Talaat said. “If you were to take an ingredient out of a vaccine, you would have to start all over with the clinical trials and the manufacturing, and it is highly possible that some of these vaccines wouldn’t work without the aluminium in there.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although other adjuvants exist, they are newer and often more scarce than aluminium, which is abundant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An immediate ban on aluminium in vaccines would drastically reduce people’s ability to protect themselves and others against numerous diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think we’d see outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases,” Talaat said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="q-why-do-people-think-aluminium-in-vaccines-is-causing-autism"&gt;Q: Why do people think aluminium in vaccines is causing autism?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A: A 2011 study said vaccines with aluminium adjuvants “may be a significant” contributing factor to the rising number of &lt;a href="/news/2025/9/23/trumps-tylenol-announcement-what-causes-autism-and-is-cuba-autism-free"&gt;autism&lt;/a&gt; diagnoses in kids, Nature reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A year later, a World Health Organization vaccine safety committee called the 2011 study “seriously flawed”. The 2011 study and another by the same authors compared vaccines’ aluminium content and autism rates in several countries, the WHO group said, but that cannot be used to establish a causal relationship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We studied aluminium, and have no link between aluminium and autism,” Talaat said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Al Jazeera</author><pubDate>Mon, 20 Oct 2025 13:52:30 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinAFBVV95cUxQNlYtakI1d2lCT1U2UGF6SVNPcm9pWXBZYk1ZdnlFV0hXcmd2aUdlaHU0a3prUGdaRXkzYUxZQ1U2Qy1ZbjJBUWpnazctYmhEVWIwV213VmRPcW50VFJBbHNEeXhtaGZZOENVU2h1TWpvRVEzbk1zNkY0cmREaUJzX1RjZFhuWmg3MGszWmlxYy1OTlNLbWM5LWxzRk7SAaIBQVVfeXFMTzVZWV8xSEluLS1Zd2pDbjI2dTU0RlF4bUpCdXMyaGxGaXpPVUFaRGNxc254NXkxZmNyM0ZGU1BVSkVodENCRnd0cXNtV3BqaGctcS1TZFNaREg4em1ya1NXNTZUWmZBMlpuTW1nY2Z2SW51N0RXYkJFbEk3UEVYS1RXbFBrcmFIVU9NYkotV05wNE5mZk5EdGhXNWxPLXN5UUpR</guid></item><item><title>断开大脑的一部分使其进入深度睡眠-自然</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03388-8</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__teaser" data-test="access-teaser"&gt; &lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;picture class="embed intensity--high"&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="//media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03388-8/d41586-025-03388-8_51582210.jpg?as=webp 767w, //media.nature.com/lw319/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03388-8/d41586-025-03388-8_51582210.jpg?as=webp 319w" sizes="(max-width: 319px) 319px, (min-width: 1023px) 100vw,  767px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img class="figure__image" alt="Close up view of a young woman asleep in bed." loading="lazy" src="//media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03388-8/d41586-025-03388-8_51582210.jpg"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;p class="figure__caption u-sans-serif"&gt;&lt;span class="mr10"&gt;Surgically severing part of the brain can send the area into a deep sleep.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Credit: Peter Cade/Getty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slow, sleep-like brain waves persist in part of the brain that has been surgically disconnected from the rest of the organ even though the person is awake. The findings&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, published in &lt;i&gt;PLoS Biology&lt;/i&gt;, add to researchers’ understanding of what conscious and unconscious brain states look like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Children with severe epilepsy who do not respond to medication can undergo a surgical procedure called a hemispherotomy. During surgery, clinicians disconnect the part of the brain in which seizures originate from the rest of the brain, stopping them from spreading. The disconnected tissue is left in the skull and has an intact blood supply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team wanted to find out whether the disconnected part has some form of awareness — or was capable of exhibiting consciousness, says co-author Marcello Massimini, a neurophysiology researcher at the University of Milan in Italy. “The question arises because we have no access” to the disconnected region, he says, adding that it was unclear what happens once part of the brain is isolated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies investigating consciousness are difficult because there is no consensus on what conscious and unconscious states in the brain look like, says Ariel Zeleznikow-Johnston, a neuroscientist at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia. “There’s no generally accepted definitive signatures of consciousness in terms of electrical readings or brain activity,” he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even defining unconsciousness is challenging, because activities associated with consciousness, such as remembering dreams, can occur during states associated with unconsciousness, such as sleep or anaesthesia, Massimini says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Asleep or awake&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers in Italy, Australia and the United Kingdom examined electroencephalograms (EEGs) — a test that measures electrical activity in the brain — from ten awake children before they had a hemispherotomy and between six months and three years after the procedure. They compared the recordings with a database of EEGs from children with typical brains that were taken while they were awake or asleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found that the electrical activity slowed in the disconnected region after surgery, whereas activity in the intact brain did not change. The EEG of the intact region was also similar to EEGs from control children who were awake. After surgery, the disconnected region became dominated by slow rhythms called delta waves and was similar to EEGs taken while control children were in deep sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The slow pattern persists for months or years after surgery. Massimini says this finding raises questions about its function. The pattern has also been observed in injured parts of the brain among awake people who have had a stroke or traumatic brain injury. It could be protective, involved in maintaining a stable environment in the brain or helping the brain adapt to injury, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

They could also lessen the need for animal testing, which is ethically problematic for many people. But framing NAMs as innovative disrupters and ‘traditional animal models’ as outdated holdovers — as many are now doing — oversimplifies a reality that is much more nuanced. Worse, it is distracting researchers from considering the scientific, ethical and translational issues related to both types of approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Complementary approaches&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a clinically trained veterinarian and biomedical scientist, I have been using mouse models to try to understand human genetic diseases for more than 20 years. The principles driving the development of NAMs are not new. For decades, researchers have been using tools, such as human induced pluripotent stem cells, to garner information relevant to humans and to lessen the need for animal testing. What’s brought all this to the fore are major technological advances in NAMs and a push by regulators and funders globally for the expanded use of these methods in research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But instead of asking whether ‘to NAM or not to NAM?’ when considering the use of anything as a research model, the question should be: ‘Does the model I am using faithfully represent the biological system I am studying?’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03344-6" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03345-5/d41586-025-03345-5_51591564.png"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;Alternatives to animal testing are the future — it’s time that journals, funders and scientists embrace them&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NAMs and animal models offer distinct, often complementary insights into the workings of complex &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; biological systems. For well-defined, narrow applications, such as in toxicology, or when researchers are wanting to assess a specific biological process or disease mechanism at the molecular, chemical, cellular or organ level, NAMs are proving highly useful. Currently, however, no NAM can model how a specific gene functions in a person, how an organ or the entire body works or how a disease progresses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All models — whether they are NAMs or inbred mice — should be updated, refined or replaced as tools and data emerge that allow researchers to better match models to the human system they are trying to investigate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experimental technologies, such as the gene-editing tool&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR4" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; CRISPR–Cas9, have made it easier for researchers to design animal models that more faithfully recapitulate human biological processes or phenomena.

For instance, the disease models could have been oversimplified, or the group sizes made too small, or the animals being tested might not have been assigned to the treatment groups in a sufficiently random manner. Many of these issues could apply equally to studies involving NAMs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A problem with framing&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

In April, for example, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced plans to phase out its requirement for animal testing in the development of monoclonal antibody therapies, among other drugs. And just last month, the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) awarded US$87 million to set up the Standardized Organoid Modeling Center, a national resource dedicated to the development of organoid-based NAMs “to reduce reliance on animal modeling”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet, despite all of these developments, early adopters of NAMs — ourselves included — are still encountering resistance. Although there has been some progress (see ‘On the rise’), many such researchers struggle to publish their work, particularly in high-impact journals. Some continue to be asked by reviewers to validate their studies in animals or, when applying for grants, find that funders view pilot data more favourably if those data include animal studies.

This would help to ensure that those who are implementing these transformative technologies are applauded, not penalized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is a NAM?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some cell- and tissue-based NAMs involve human induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells. These can be generated in the laboratory from somatic cells, such as blood or skin cells. They continuously self-renew and, with the appropriate chemicals and mix of growth factors, can differentiate into almost any cell type in the body. Thus, using blood draws or biopsies, researchers can, in principle, obtain an unlimited supply of cells representing any organ type, patient or patient population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Organoids and spheroids are among the NAMs that can be generated from iPS cells or other cells. These 3D structures allow researchers to analyse cell behaviour, model diseases and test drugs in &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; systems that mimic the architecture, function and cell types of a human organ, or the &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03029-0" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03029-0" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;conditions provided by natural tissues&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;picture class="embed intensity--high"&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="//media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03344-6/d41586-025-03344-6_51578084.jpg?as=webp 767w, //media.nature.com/lw319/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03344-6/d41586-025-03344-6_51578084.jpg?as=webp 319w" sizes="(max-width: 319px) 319px, (min-width: 1023px) 100vw,  767px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img class="figure__image" alt="Micrograph of endometrial organoids." loading="lazy" src="//media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03344-6/d41586-025-03344-6_51578084.jpg"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;p class="figure__caption u-sans-serif"&gt;&lt;span class="mr10"&gt;An organoid made from cells found in the lining of the uterus. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Credit: Konstantina Nikolakopoulou, Turco Lab, Friedrich Miescher Institute for Biomedical Research&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using collagen, other similar proteins or polymer hydrogels that are free from animal derivatives, models are now being designed that biologically and mechanically mimic the microenvironments of tumours and the extracellular matrix (the network of proteins and other molecules that surrounds cells and tissues).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tumour spheroids generated from a person’s tumour tissue, or an entire biopsy, can be implanted into an extracellular matrix. And a circulatory system involving a pump can even push nutrients through the spheroids&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. These technologies allow researchers to control and monitor the tumour microenvironment much more efficiently than if they were using animal models or patient-derived xenografts, a technique in which a biopsy of an individual’s tumour is implanted into a mouse model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Modelling of the blood–brain barrier has also gained momentum. Using brain organoids, researchers can investigate whether certain drugs — or even cancer cells — &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-02096-z" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-02096-z" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;can cross this barrier&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, advances in NAMs &lt;i&gt;in chemico&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; are helping to accelerate drug development by flagging promising candidates for testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FDA’s AnimalGAN models, for example, use artificial intelligence to generate animal-based data in toxicology that would otherwise need to be obtained using animal studies. Likewise, mathematical approaches, such as quantitative structure–activity relationship models, can work out the mathematical relationship between the chemical structure of a compound and its biological activity and predict the properties of new chemical entities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Trials in a dish&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Globally, on average 86% of drug candidates fail in human clinical trials&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR2" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. This is either because of problems with toxicity or, more commonly, because the drugs are not sufficiently effective in humans&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR3" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. This inefficiency seems to be mainly the result of experiments in animal models failing to predict human responses to medications&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR4" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the past half a century, drug development has involved testing compounds in animals for years before exposing them to any human biology. By bringing human biology to the earliest phases of drug discovery, NAMs could significantly reduce the time and money needed to obtain positive results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-00656-x" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03344-6/d41586-025-03344-6_26808052.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;Organoids grown from amniotic fluid could shed light on rare diseases&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using ‘clinical trials in a dish’ (CTIDs) — in which each ‘dish’ might consist of a panel of 100 organoids generated using stem cells or diseased tissues from 100 individuals, say — researchers can test therapies on a representative sample of patients before they test them in animals or in conventional clinical trials&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR5" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CTIDs could be especially useful for developing therapies to treat rare diseases caused by genetic mutations. More than 100 mutations of the LMNA gene, for example, are known to cause rare inherited heart diseases&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR6" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Using CTIDs, drug developers could tailor therapies to individuals with different mutations by simultaneously testing the effectiveness of several drugs on multiple patients’ cells &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR7" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;,&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR8" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides benefiting the discovery and development of drugs for inherited diseases, CTIDs could provide crucial training data for AI models that have been designed to aid drug discovery&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR9" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NAMs could also help to reduce health inequalities. At scale, almost all of the alternative models cost less than animal work does, which could reduce costs for patients&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR10" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. And with the use of human iPS cells and patient-derived tissue in vitro, it should be possible to perform more-inclusive clinical trials in which medication is tested in under-represented populations, including those from low- and middle-income countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Shifting mindsets&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As early users of NAMs, we’ve been encouraged by various initiatives, both in the United States and Europe, to reduce the use of animal testing in research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FDA’s April announcement about monoclonal antibody therapies is part of a broader effort to ‘replace, reduce and refine’ the use of animals in research&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR11" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. A few weeks afterwards, the NIH declared that it would establish the Office of Research Innovation, Validation, and Application (ORIVA), in part to coordinate efforts to develop and expand the use of NAMs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The state had just passed “the Coronavirus Stop Act” in 2023, which banned nearly all COVID-19 vaccine requirements. If lawmakers did that for COVID-19, Manookian reasoned, they could do the same for all communicable diseases and all medical decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her theory was right, ultimately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bill she penned in the summer of 2024 made it through the Republican-controlled House and Senate in early 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manookian took to social media to rally support for the legislation as it sat on the desk of Gov. Brad Little.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the governor vetoed it. &lt;a href="https://gov.idaho.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/veto_s-1023aaaa_2025.pdf"&gt;In a letter&lt;/a&gt;, he explained that he saw the bill as government intrusion on “parents’ freedom to ensure their children stay healthy.” During an outbreak, he said, schools wouldn’t be able to send home students “with highly contagious conditions” like measles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manookian tried again days after the veto. In the next version of the bill, protections during a disease outbreak applied only to “healthy” people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time, Little signed it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weeks after the signing, Manookian joined like-minded advocates on a stage in Washington, DC, for a launch event for the MAHA Institute, a group with strong ties to Robert F. Kennedy Jr. (MAHA stands for Make America Healthy Again.) The new Health and Human Services secretary had denounced vaccines for years before President Donald Trump appointed him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the gathering, Manookian announced her next mission: to make it “a societal norm and to codify it in law” that nobody can dictate any other person’s medical choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re going to roll that out to other states, and we’re going to make America free again,” Manookian &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/fONtd73sNJg?feature=shared&amp;amp;t=81"&gt;told the audience&lt;/a&gt; in May.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manookian’s commitment to bring along the rest of the country has continued ever since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her nonprofit, the Health Freedom Defense Fund, is now distributing &lt;a href="https://healthfreedomdefense.org/resources/"&gt;model legislation and a how-to guide&lt;/a&gt;, with talking points to persuade legislators. Manookian said in podcast interviews that she is working with the nonprofit &lt;a href="https://standforhealthfreedom.com/about-us/"&gt;Stand For Health Freedom&lt;/a&gt; to mobilize activists in every state.&lt;/p&gt;

Colorectal &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.aol.com/shopping/health/article/would-you-wear-a-shirt-that-says-colonoscopy-enthusiast-these-cancer-survivors-want-you-to-154214235.html" data-ylk="slk:cancer rates are on the rise;cpos:1;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;cancer rates are on the rise&lt;/a&gt;, and inadequate fiber intake is a culprit. Americans often experience the consequences of low fiber intake, such as constipation, bloating, or discomfort. And now that fiber is on everyone’s radar, it has made its social media debut as the latest health trend: fibermaxxing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While most health professionals agree that increasing fiber intake is beneficial, too much of a good thing can cause problems. Let’s dive deeper into the fibermaxxing trend, why it’s so popular on social media, and when it can be more hurtful than helpful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="caas-jump-link-heading" id="what-is-fibermaxxing"&gt;What is fibermaxxing?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fibermaxxing is just as it sounds: maximizing your daily fiber intake. The goal is to meet or exceed the recommended daily fiber intake to reap health benefits, like improved digestion and more regular bowel movements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most healthy adults are advised to eat approximately 14 grams of fiber for every 1,000 calories they eat, or about 25 grams for women and 34 grams for men, according to the most recent &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/resources/2020-2025-dietary-guidelines-online-materials" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:dietary guidelines;cpos:2;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;dietary guidelines&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But most Americans eat 16 grams per day on average, which is well below the recommended amount. According to &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://wexnermedical.osu.edu/mediaroom/expertslisting/candace-pumper" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Candace Pumper;cpos:3;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Candace Pumper&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian nutritionist at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, low fiber intake is a big problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Colorectal cancer rates have increased among people under the age of 50, and research indicates diets low in fiber are a risk factor,” she says. “Optimizing fiber intake is an important health strategy for reducing their risk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="caas-jump-link-heading" id="the-advantages-and-disadvantages-of-fibermaxxing"&gt;The advantages and disadvantages of fibermaxxing&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since low-fiber diets are a concern, fibermaxxing can be beneficial for many Americans. But it’s easy to take a health trend too far. We asked Pumper to explain how fibermaxxing can help Americans increase their fiber intake and point out its disadvantages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="caas-jump-link-heading" id="the-advantages-of-fibermaxxing"&gt;The advantages of fibermaxxing&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More awareness&lt;/strong&gt;: Because of the fibermaxxing trend, more people are aware of fiber’s role in reducing the risk of certain chronic diseases. “I think more people will become more mindful of their baseline fiber intake and actively work toward improvement,” says Pumper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Functional health&lt;/strong&gt;: Many of us rightfully associate fiber intake with certain functional benefits, like digestive movement and regular bathroom visits. Pumper explains that fiber adds bulk to stool, which is important for promoting regular bowel movements and preventing constipation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Physiological health&lt;/strong&gt;: Pumper also explains that fiber promotes physiological benefits through fermentation by the gut microbiome, such as lowering cholesterol, regulating blood sugar, promoting satiety, and reducing inflammation. These benefits are associated with a decreased risk of heart disease, type 2 diabetes, obesity, and colorectal cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 class="caas-jump-link-heading" id="the-disadvantages-of-fibermaxxing"&gt;The disadvantages of fibermaxxing&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bloating and discomfort&lt;/strong&gt;: If you hop on this trend too quickly, Pumper warns that you might not feel as healthy as you thought you would. “Sudden increases in fiber or consuming too much fiber, whether above the recommended daily amount or all at once, may cause bloating, gas, and abdominal discomfort,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not for everyone&lt;/strong&gt;: While most Americans don’t meet fiber intake requirements, some need low-fiber diets on purpose. “Fibermaxxing is not appropriate for everyone, especially those who have been medically advised to follow a low-fiber diet as part of their care,” she says. For example, a doctor may advise a low-fiber diet before a colonoscopy or if someone has active inflammatory bowel disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Could encourage disordered eating&lt;/strong&gt;: Any diet that significantly increases or decreases certain nutrients should be practiced carefully. Pumper explains that fibermaxxing has the potential to affect mental well-being, reinforcing an “all-or-nothing” mindset about eating and weight that can lead to nutritional gaps or digestive issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 class="caas-jump-link-heading" id="how-to-eat-more-fiber-safely"&gt;How to eat more fiber safely&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want to increase your fiber intake without upsetting your stomach or causing health issues, consider consulting a healthcare provider, gradually increasing your dietary fiber intake, and diversifying the types of fiber you eat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consult your healthcare provider&lt;/strong&gt;: Before making drastic changes to your diet, talk to a healthcare professional about your current health status. If you have a digestive health issue or take certain medications, you may need professional guidance to monitor your nutrition. For example, Pumper advises that older adults and those taking corticosteroids (like prednisone or budesonide) check with their doctor because they may be more sensitive to major dietary changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increase fiber intake slowly&lt;/strong&gt;: To avoid bloating, gas, and discomfort, increase your fiber intake by only a few grams per day. Make one or two food swaps, like exchanging crackers for celery sticks with your favorite dip. “Fiber intake should be increased slowly, especially if you are starting below the minimum recommended intake. Also, balance fiber intake with adequate hydration to prevent digestive discomfort,” said Pumper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mix up the types of fiber you eat&lt;/strong&gt;: According to Pumper, the kind of fiber you eat matters because it impacts digestion differently. Soluble fiber (found in oats, legumes, and nuts) slows the digestion process, which is known to support weight loss. Insoluble fiber (found in fruits, veggies, and brown rice) helps you pass stool more easily and regularly. Aim for the right balance of both: about 5–10 grams of soluble fiber and 15–30 grams of insoluble fiber per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 class="caas-jump-link-heading" id="where-to-find-healthy-sources-of-fiber"&gt;Where to find healthy sources of fiber&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While many &lt;a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon Canada;elmt:;cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=63045c63-8df1-46e8-bdd0-1716edf6ace5&amp;amp;itemId=amazon_B003CT2YQY&amp;amp;siteId=us-aol&amp;amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;amp;contentUuid=8e9558c4-6e78-46c2-b7a7-0dcb233e07cf&amp;amp;featureId=text-link&amp;amp;merchantName=Amazon+Canada&amp;amp;linkText=fiber+supplements&amp;amp;custData=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&amp;amp;signature=AQAAAc8n1EuuWqvFQ8cLjqs0Qd8opInCsH2eL-ZiRh8CWmXf&amp;amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FMetamucil-Multi-Health-Psyllium-Supplement-Sugar-Free%2Fdp%2FB003CT2YQY%2F&amp;amp;spaceId=1197803369" class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:fiber supplements;elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon Canada;elmt:;cpos:4;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;fiber supplements&lt;/a&gt; are sold on the market, &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4415962/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:research;cpos:5;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; says that few offer the right formula to make a difference. The best way to increase fiber intake is through real foods, rather than relying on pills and powders (unless your healthcare provider advises otherwise).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fiber found in real food works alongside vitamins, minerals, and water to deliver benefits to your body. Isolated fiber supplements don’t have other nutrients to help support their role in digestive health, so their benefits can be limited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To eat more soluble fiber, try:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oatmeal with limited added sugar&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lentils, chickpeas, and beans&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flax seeds and sunflower seeds&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;To eat more insoluble fiber, try:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regular and sweet potatoes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apples, berries, and mango&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barley, brown rice, quinoa, and whole wheat&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you need guidance, talk to your healthcare provider, a dietician, or a nutritionist about the best ways to incorporate more fiber into your diet in a safe and healthy way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meet the experts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions about this piece — or you just wanna chat about your favorite products you think we should check out — send us an email at &lt;strong&gt;shopping.editors@aol.com&lt;/strong&gt; and we'll write you back!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Curious about how we test and choose products at AOL?

That recommendation was based on a clinical trial involving 386 participants, which found that those who took nicotinamide developed fewer new cases of skin cancer compared with those who did not.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expanding the Evidence with a Larger Patient Group&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until now, confirming those earlier findings in a much larger population has been difficult. Because nicotinamide is available over the counter, its use is rarely documented in medical records. To overcome that obstacle, researchers turned to the Veterans Affairs (VA) Corporate Data Warehouse, where nicotinamide is listed on the VA's official formulary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using these records, the research team reviewed the outcomes of 33,833 veterans who received baseline treatment with 500 milligrams of nicotinamide twice daily for more than 30 days. They tracked each patient's next diagnosis of basal cell carcinoma or cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Large Study Reveals Significant Risk Reduction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among those studied, 12,287 patients had taken nicotinamide, while 21,479 had not. The researchers found a 14% overall decrease in skin cancer risk among nicotinamide users. For those who began taking the supplement after experiencing their first skin cancer, the risk reduction jumped to 54%. However, this benefit lessened when treatment began after multiple skin cancers had already developed. The effect was strongest for squamous cell carcinoma, one of the most common nonmelanoma skin cancers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Early Use Could Shift Prevention Strategies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"There are no guidelines for when to start treatment with nicotinamide for skin cancer prevention in the general population. These results would really shift our practice from starting it once patients have developed numerous skin cancers to starting it earlier. We still need to do a better job of identifying who will actually benefit, as roughly only half of patients will develop multiple skin cancers,"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;said the study's corresponding author, Lee Wheless, MD, PhD, assistant professor of Dermatology and Medicine at Vanderbilt University Medical Center and staff physician at the VA Tennessee Valley Healthcare System.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Findings in Transplant Patients&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team also evaluated 1,334 patients who were immunocompromised due to solid organ transplants. In this group, overall risk reduction was not statistically significant, although early use of nicotinamide was linked to fewer cases of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Research Collaboration and Support&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wheless's work was supported by a Department of Veterans Affairs grant (IK2CX002452). Co-authors from Vanderbilt University included Katyln Knox, Rachel Weiss, Siwei Zhang, PhD, Lydia Yao, MS, Yaomin Xu, PhD, and Kyle Maas.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;University of North Carolina at Charlotte's School of Nursing, collaborating with Harvard's Human Flourishing Program, reports that adolescents who report transformative religious or spiritual experiences show both greater volunteering and voting in early adulthood alongside elevated loneliness and PTSD.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                        
                                          
                                         
										

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Large national surveys have linked religious or spiritual involvement with health, yet longitudinal evidence on life-changing experiences remains sparse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous research has associated religious or spiritual involvement with positive health indicators and lower stress, while qualitative and clinical literature has described both self-destabilizing elements and intensified &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/civic+engagement/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;civic engagement&lt;/a&gt; and social connectedness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interest in population-based longitudinal evidence has centered on whether these early spiritual experiences relate to later mental health, social functioning, and civic behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the study, "Between Vulnerability and Connection: Longitudinal Evidence on the Impact of Transformative Religious/Spiritual Experiences," &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smi.70110" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Stress and Health&lt;/i&gt;, researchers analyzed data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health to examine associations between transformative religious or &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/spiritual+experiences/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;spiritual experiences&lt;/a&gt; in late adolescence and a range of outcomes across physical, mental, behavioral, and social domains in early adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants numbered 10,529 after exclusions, spanning Wave I in 1994–1995 (&lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/early+adolescence/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;early adolescence&lt;/a&gt;), Wave III in 2001–2002 (late adolescence), and Wave IV in 2008 (early adulthood). Eligibility required completion of Wave III and valid sampling weights at Wave IV, with 1,613 respondents excluded because reported transformative experiences occurred before Wave I. Group counts at Wave III were 8,731 without a reported transformative religious or spiritual experience and 1,798 with a reported experience.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;Outcomes covered 38 indicators across &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/physical+health/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;physical health&lt;/a&gt;, behavioral health, mental health and well-being, and social engagement assessed at early adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Approximately 17% of adolescents reported a transformative religious or spiritual experience during late adolescence. Childhood patterns included household financial strain, strained parent-child dynamics, lower academic indicators, elevated depressive symptoms, and greater religious practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reporting a transformative experience in late adolescence aligned with greater volunteering in early adulthood. Civic participation also rose, as rated by higher voting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loneliness increased in early &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/adulthood/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;adulthood&lt;/a&gt; among those who reported a transformative experience. Signals for PTSD diagnosis, lower self-rated health, more &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/depressive+symptoms/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;depressive symptoms&lt;/a&gt;, functional limitations, diabetes, and prescription drug misuse appeared but were less consistent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sensitivity analyses using reduced covariates continued to show volunteering, voting, and loneliness. Models that incorporated contemporaneous covariates kept volunteering consistent and retained loneliness, voting, and PTSD under some specifications. Complete case analysis continued to show volunteering and loneliness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors conclude that transformative experiences function as a double-edged phenomenon linking adolescent vulnerability with later civic and prosocial engagement. The findings imply value in attention to meaning-making and long-term integration while recognizing modest effect sizes and limits on causal inference.&lt;/p&gt;

According to Dr Saurabh Sethi, a Harvard-trained gastroenterologist, the right kind of low-sugar desserts can actually support gut health. These desserts, when prepared thoughtfully, provide natural prebiotics, healthy fats, and probiotics, all crucial for maintaining a balanced digestive system. Here’s a handpicked list of 10 low-sugar desserts that not only comfort the soul but also keep the gut happy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Mon, 20 Oct 2025 13:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilwJBVV95cUxORWpLdWh2LWxwbWczekFEbEM5Y0JXZFdzUGwtMUhFYV9HZm10emdGLTdxSTlBUHBZQm9ScmhrTWEtZGprOG1yRjJpcnpaN0tJLXpucXhkQkNFbjVsTUZiOXNnN1hyWURSZWptUlpHc1ZzU0dDNUkyZnFpSFFmclEzREZsUGtkWUJmSExncXozR3haWlhVNGFDVnhZUkpNUy03RVN2S3U0TEJRcC1HX0ZBc2IwZ0VBZzZIZ3hjZ3hVWnNrMGM2SEx1SHR0T0lrMG9BdG4yRnF0Zklqdm9SLTBycnRzSXkxa25EbkEwLU1seXNvODExN0toOTJuWkxHNWFUdFZvUl9Ua1BERFZIOGRRUTl5aHdhUVXSAZ8CQVVfeXFMTlNGZ212OWZTNHRKeGVMbkpEQ0xZSzJaWmhkeUlUUTFSVWQ3UFJCUFEtWXFGSGpiZThzVlROWExnQkR4dXF6bXpuMzNaeHBfakk1eUp1SE1NWC1rcFRLdlljbms5Q0R3dXRPRkx5c0dOZWh6Wm1hUmMzY1lRN1BkMkloNk5mVUM5Z2tXWlNtdV9MUXRYVWFPTmg3NlVFa1F4TWpqQlBwZlQ3YVB6NndvTUFSUHNBeHJCZW1IdWxfWlRad2hBMzIwM05Ra0xLd2p0eUlaLTZBX2d5ek9EZmhlSEVSRGhxNS1kYXBDT2E3VERKVnk5dzFzLURPVkFoRGtxNDVoaW5ySVJ2RnpLUnpxSXJxV0JlalFrN0JaTDlZYTA</guid></item><item><title>锻炼悖论：为什么锻炼对减肥不好，但对保持健康的体重有用-对话</title><link>https://theconversation.com/the-exercise-paradox-why-workouts-arent-great-for-weight-loss-but-useful-for-maintaining-a-healthy-body-weight-266715</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="grid-ten large-grid-nine grid-last content-body content entry-content instapaper_body inline-promos" itemprop="articleBody"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The basic principle of weight loss is straightforward: if you consume fewer calories than you burn, you’ll lose weight. In practice though, this isn’t usually so easy or simple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alongside counting calories or eating smaller portions, many people add exercise into the equation when trying to &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/topics/weight-loss-684"&gt;lose weight&lt;/a&gt; to help tip the balance. Yet research shows that exercise may only have &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41366-022-01247-4"&gt;modest effects on weight loss&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But before you ditch your workouts, it’s important to note that exercise still plays a really important role when it comes to health – perhaps especially in keeping the pounds off after reaching your goal weight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several processes that help explain why exercise doesn’t always result in huge amounts of weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exercise can stimulate appetite, leading to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/ajcn/nqz054"&gt;increased food intake&lt;/a&gt;. People may also &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/obr.12507"&gt;subconsciously move less&lt;/a&gt; throughout the rest of the day after doing a workout, which means exercise may have less impact on their overall calorie deficit. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The body also becomes more efficient over time – burning fewer calories while doing the same activity. This process, sometimes called &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12986-021-00587-8"&gt;“metabolic adaptation”&lt;/a&gt;, reflects the body’s tendency to defend against weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From an evolutionary perspective, conserving energy during periods of intense physical activity probably &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cbpa.2023.111473"&gt;protected our ancestors from starvation&lt;/a&gt;. But in today’s world, metabolic adaptation is &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/oby.23333"&gt;one of many factors&lt;/a&gt; that can make weight loss difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The importance of exercise&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although exercise may not be the main driver of weight loss, it seems it might play a role in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1467-789x.2000.00016.x"&gt;maintaining weight loss&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

      &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/seven-techniques-to-avoid-weight-regain-approved-by-experts-210348"&gt;Seven techniques to avoid weight regain, approved by experts&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In a study of over 1,100 people, physical activity was shown to have little effect on the amount of weight a person initially lost. However, doing higher levels of activity after losing weight was strongly linked to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fnut.2021.683369"&gt;maintaining the weight loss&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s worth noting that exercise was also associated with measurable health improvements – including better cholesterol, lower inflammation, better blood sugar control and insulin sensitivity, all of which are associated with lower risk of health problems, such as &lt;a href="https://www.bhf.org.uk/informationsupport/risk-factors/high-cholesterol"&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.diabetes.org.uk/about-diabetes/looking-after-diabetes/treatments/insulin/resistance"&gt;type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="align-center "&gt;
            
            &lt;figcaption&gt;
              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;Exercise has many health benefits.&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;a class="source" href="https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/young-adult-asia-people-fat-slim-2506931991"&gt;Chay_Tee/ Shutterstock&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These many health benefits show just how important it is to exercise both while losing weight and maintaining weight loss. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eclinm.2024.102475"&gt;Evidence&lt;/a&gt; also suggests that combining exercise with weight loss drugs (such as Saxenda), may help people maintain their weight loss better than using the drug alone. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Why exercise works&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It may seem confusing that exercise isn’t especially effective for losing weight but can help prevent regain. The reasons behind this paradox aren’t fully understood, but several mechanisms may offer an explanation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first has to do with our resting energy expenditure (the amount of calories our body burns when doing nothing). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we lose weight, our resting energy expenditure decreases by more than you would expect for the amount of weight lost. This is thought to contribute to weight regain. But exercise raises total daily energy expenditure, which can help to partially offset this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A second factor relates to muscle mass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weight loss usually results in the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/nu13072473"&gt;loss of both fat and muscle&lt;/a&gt;. Losing muscle lowers resting energy expenditure, which can contribute to weight regain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But exercise, especially resistance training (such as Pilates or lifting weights), can &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3945/an.116.014506"&gt;help preserve&lt;/a&gt; or even rebuild muscle mass. This can boost our metabolism, which may aid in long-term weight maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Physical activity also helps our body to maintain its ability to burn fat. After losing weight, the body often becomes less efficient at &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/ijo.2015.59"&gt;using fat for energy&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But intense exercise can improve &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjsem-2017-000283"&gt;fat burning&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mayocp.2022.01.012"&gt;metabolic flexibility&lt;/a&gt; – the ability to switch between burning carbohydrates and fat depending on what’s available. This helps the body continue burning fat even when calorie intake is low or weight is lost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exercise &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1055/s-2000-8847"&gt;improves insulin sensitivity&lt;/a&gt; as well. This reduces the amount of insulin required to regulate blood sugar. This is beneficial as higher insulin levels can &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jamainternmed.2018.2933"&gt;promote fat storage&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/embo-reports/kve071"&gt;reduce fat breakdown&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exercise has many indirect effects on us that can aid in weight maintenance. For instance, exercise can &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psyneuen.2022.105843"&gt;improve sleep&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.33475"&gt;mood&lt;/a&gt; and reduce &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fphys.2014.00161/"&gt;stress levels&lt;/a&gt;. These all reduce levels of the stress hormone cortisol, which could lower the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/oby.20083"&gt;amount of fat&lt;/a&gt; the body stores.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regular activity can also help &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/biom13081170"&gt;regulate appetite&lt;/a&gt; and blood glucose, which may help reduce cravings and limit overeating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s important to acknowledge that everyone is different. This means we all &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1123/jpah.2012-0250"&gt;respond differently&lt;/a&gt; to exercise in terms of how many calories we burn or whether a workout makes us feel hungrier later in the day. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Different types of workouts also confer their own benefits when it comes to health and weight maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aerobic exercise (such as brisk walking, cycling or running) burns calories and, at higher intensities, may also enhance the body’s ability to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjsem-2017-000283"&gt;burn fat for fuel&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Resistance training, on the other hand, helps build and preserve muscle mass. This supports a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1172/jci114857"&gt;higher resting energy expenditure&lt;/a&gt;, aiding long-term weight maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exercise may not be the most powerful tool for losing weight, but it could help sustain hard-earned weight loss. Perhaps most importantly, it offers many physical and mental health benefits that go far beyond the numbers on the scale.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

Getting back the ability to read is a major improvement in their quality of life, lifts their mood and helps to restore their confidence and independence.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The trial found 84% of participants were once again able to read letters, numbers and words after being fitted with the implant, called the Prima device.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Eye specialists hailed the results as “remarkable” and said the device could help people with the “dry” form of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), the leading cause of sight loss in the over-50s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Moorfields said: “The revolutionary new implant is the first ever device to enable people to read letters, numbers and words through an eye that had lost its sight.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The 38 patients all had geographic atrophy with dry AMD, which over time progressively deprives someone of their sight and for which there is no treatment. Most people with the condition lose some of their central vision and in some cases it progresses to full sight loss as the cells in the macula die and the central macula melts away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;All had lost their central vision and had only limited peripheral vision before they had the device implanted in an operation lasting less then two hours. Five were treated at Moorfields and the others at hospitals in Germany, France, Italy and the Netherlands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Sheila Wilson from Wiltshire, one of those who had the chip implanted at Moorfields, said: “Before receiving the implant it was like having two black discs in my eyes, with the outside distorted. I was an avid bookworm and I wanted that back. There was no pain during the operation but you’re still aware of what’s happening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“It’s made a big difference. It’s a new way of looking through your eyes and it was dead exciting when I began seeing a letter. It’s not simple, learning to read again, but the more hours I put in, the more I pick up.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The Prima device, a super-thin microchip that is just 2mm by 2mm in size, is inserted under the centre of the eye’s retina in a procedure known as a vitrectomy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;To help them to see and write, patients were given augmented reality glasses containing a video camera connected to a small computer, which they attached to their waistband. It included a zoom feature to make text bigger and easier to read.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Patients can use the glasses to focus and scan the object in the projected image that they want to read. The glasses project the scenes as an infra-red beam across the chip, which activates the device. Artificial intelligence in the waistband computer processes the information and converts it into an electrical signal, which passes through the cells in the retina and optical nerve into the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Muqit stressed that patients had to undergo training and intensive rehabilitation of their eye in order to realise the benefits of the technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“It’s not like you’re popping a chip in the eye and then you can see again. You need to learn to use this type of vision,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The results of the trial are reported in the &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Mon, 20 Oct 2025 12:29:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMivAFBVV95cUxQZWhCalptZS1PYUpfZU9oN0o3OWo4c3JOaFdlSnp2Y2RUZ25CYkk4cm56UWIycVRGaUxmdWpER09HZlpZVDdrR3Zncy1uV08tdGROYlhxZ3dKNGU4WmpVa2lNLTB5NHNHaUpHY3Zyd21haWMxZW1UVEpyQVQ1WFhHczNRdkFBcDFOVGE2RnUxLWpEQWdkS2dqNW1kQWVEdUcxSTBiSDk5U0lKZS1YakJseUlRVnhuVGZ3U0lsLQ</guid></item><item><title>由于疫苗接种率暴跌，佛罗里达州维多利亚时代百日咳病例飙升-每日邮报</title><link>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15203309/cases-whooping-cough-florida-vaccine-rates.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cases of a Victorian-era disease have soared in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/florida/index.html" id="mol-c2e88db0-ab96-11f0-91b6-a7e7d42ed005"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt; amid the state's ban on vaccine mandates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As of September 27, the latest data available, there have been 1,295 cases of pertussis, also called whooping cough, in Florida, an 81 percent surge compared to the entirety of 2024. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And nationwide, cases rose six-fold in 2024 compared to the year before, &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/centers-for-disease-control-and-prevention-cdc/index.html" id="mol-ad9ad6f0-ab98-11f0-91b6-a7e7d42ed005" class=""&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt; figures show, a sign of waning immunity against a disease that once struck hundreds of thousands. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The highly contagious respiratory virus, caused by the bacteria Bordetella pertussis, is &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-15050927/Baby-dies-whooping-cough-vaccination-rates.html"&gt;especially dangerous for infants and young children&lt;/a&gt; who are more prone to &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/pneumonia/index.html" id="mol-c2e5f5a0-ab96-11f0-91b6-a7e7d42ed005"&gt;pneumonia&lt;/a&gt;, seizures, brain damage and death. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Even in non-fatal cases, older children and adults may suffer prolonged coughing fits so fierce that they lead to broken ribs, vomiting and trouble sleeping. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It can be prevented with the Tdap (tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis), which health authorities recommend at two, four, six and 15 to 18 months old, as well as ages four to six. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Preteens ages 11 to 12 should also be vaccinated against pertussis, and the shot is recommended every ten years after that. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But vaccination against whooping cough has declined in the US. During the 2024-2025 school year, Tdap vaccination among kindergarteners dropped to 92 percent compared to 95 percent in 2019, the rate needed to achieve herd immunity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Health officials have warned that whooping cough, which is extremely dangerous for young children and teens, is on the rise in Florida (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above map shows the rate of whooping cough per county in Florida between February and April 2025, the latest data available &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In Florida, Tdap vaccination rates were down to 90.6 percent in 2024, the lowest in a decade. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Tara Williams, a general academic pediatrician with the Orlando College of Osteopathic Medicine, told the USA TODAY Network Florida: 'We are setting up a cesspool of germs for our kids to walk into.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Whooping cough's surge comes weeks after Florida Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo announced the &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-15062445/florida-end-vaccine-mandates-ron-desantis-joseph-ladapo.html"&gt;state would ban all vaccine mandates for children&lt;/a&gt;, including Tdap, polio, hepatitis, Covid and measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Every last one of them is wrong and drips with disdain and slavery,' he said last month.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Tdap vaccine is 98 percent effective in children within a year of their last dose. In teenagers, the jab is 73 percent effective in the first year and 34 percent effective four years after vaccination.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Whooping cough occurs when the bacteria Bordetella pertussis attaches to tiny hairs in the throat and nose and release toxins that cause airways to swell. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At first, this may cause mild symptoms like a runny nose or mild cough, but it can progress to a cough so violent it leads many patients to vomit and develop breathing problems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Polly Deehy (pictured left in the hospital) from the UK had to be placed in a ten-day coma after coming down with whooping cough. And at just one month old, Rosie Robin of the UK (pictured right) was hospitalized for two weeks with the disease&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Health officials warned that the infection is initially difficult to tell apart from a cold, as the first signs are a runny nose and sore throat. But around a week later, sufferers may develop coughing bouts that last minutes, struggle to breathe after coughing and make a 'whoop' sound between coughs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Prior to the introduction of the pertussis vaccine in 1948, the US saw as many as 250,000 cases of pertussis per year. Cases steadily dropped by more than 90 percent each year compared to the pre-vaccine era, the CDC states. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The CDC has also noted that the bacteria that causes whooping cough, Bordetella pertussis, is prone to mutations, which could make it able to evade vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Marcos Mestre, chief clinical operations officer at Nicklaus Children's Health System in Miami, told CBS last year: 'We have been seeing some increase in pertussis cases that are coming through our emergency departments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Not necessarily requiring admission, but coming in for evaluation and treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'They're coughing to the point that they can't catch their breath. And those are the children we really worry about, when infants are getting infected and that could cause more severe illness.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

            Do you often experience difficulty defecating? If the answer is yes, newly released recommendations may help relieve your symptoms.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgvd8qeb000i3b6nw1r2hvlt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kiwifruit, rye bread and high mineral-content water can help alleviate chronic constipation, according to &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jhn.70133" target="_blank"&gt;new dietary guidelines&lt;/a&gt; copublished October 13 by the Journal of Human Nutrition and Dietetics and Neurogastroenterology &amp;amp; Motility.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgvd8qeb000h3b6ncob49h9s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            About &lt;a href="https://iffgd.org/gi-disorders/lower-gi-disorders/constipation/" target="_blank"&gt;1 out of every 6 to 7 people&lt;/a&gt; are affected by chronic constipation worldwide. In the United States, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7269025/" target="_blank"&gt;9% to 20% of adults&lt;/a&gt; have some form of chronic idiopathic constipation,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;in which the cause of the condition&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;is unknown.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgvd8qeb000j3b6n54hkzesh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Some &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/constipation/symptoms-causes/syc-20354253" target="_blank"&gt;symptoms of chronic constipation&lt;/a&gt; include having a bowel movement fewer than three times a week, hard or lumpy stool, or straining or experiencing pain when pooping.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgvd8qeb000l3b6n3uiboa2j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The guidelines “introduce foods and drinks (e.g., kiwifruit, prunes, rye bread, high mineral content water) and specific supplement interventions into clinical guidance, filling a long-standing gap between research and routine clinical advice,” lead study author Dr. Eirini Dimidi said in an email. “That will help clinicians give clearer, more targeted, and evidence-informed dietary advice, and will allow people to self-manage their symptoms more effectively.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgvd8qeb000m3b6nf4r7xob5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The guidance applies to healthy adults with &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2013/08/28/health/gi-disorders-ibs-cic"&gt;chronic idiopathic constipation&lt;/a&gt; and “did not focus on constipation secondary to other conditions (e.g., neurological disease, pregnancy), so while some recommendations may be applicable, they should be used with caution in these groups, as well as in children,” said Dimidi, an associate professor in nutritional sciences at King’s College London.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgvd8qeb000n3b6ngxw8q3z0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The guidelines did not include a general recommendation for increased fiber intake in a patient’s diet. Rather, they focused on specific foods that could be beneficial, Dimidi added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgvd8qec000o3b6nks0tyjjn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Certain &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/4059-constipation" target="_blank"&gt;lifestyle choices or situations&lt;/a&gt;, such as low fiber intake, dehydration, lack of exercise, or stress, can cause constipation. As a result, clinicians focus most treatment on dietary changes.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgvd8qec000p3b6nkiu9v0bf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Previous dietary advice was broad, such as telling patients to eat more fiber. But these new guidelines, Dimidi said, suggest “incorporating evidence-based foods and drinks in your diet, such as consuming 2-3 kiwifruits a day.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgvd8qec000q3b6nyrl7zt33@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Unlike other recommended food such as prunes, kiwifruit is simple to incorporate into your diet.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgvd8qec000r3b6nhaw2jqlr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “With kiwifruit, because it’s so well-tolerated, you usually can just step right into that dose, as opposed to prunes, for example, where you want to more gradually work up to that dose of six to eight prunes per day,” said Dr. William Chey, professor and chief of gastroenterology and hepatology at the University of Michigan. He was not involved in the new research.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgvd8qec000s3b6n5y2tb07c@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6267416/" target="_blank"&gt;Kiwis can increase stool bulk&lt;/a&gt; and water content, enhance protein digestion, and smoothen the movement of food, fluids and waste in the digestive tract. The small fruits also improve the amount of time it takes for waste to pass through your intestine and have natural prebiotic effects, such as improved digestion and reduced gut inflammation.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgvd8qec000t3b6nmt66pxhb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kiwis are also palatable and soft, which makes them easy to eat, said Dr. Cuckoo Choudhary, the Dorrance H. Hamilton Professor of Medicine at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital in Philadelphia. She was not involved in the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgvd8qec000u3b6nh9jy0heg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            You can also eat a kiwi’s skin or peel, which has extra fiber. But avoid heating a kiwi, since high temperatures destroy the enzyme that smoothens gut movement, Choudhary added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgvd8qec000v3b6nmkmvq1n0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Foods such as prunes, rye bread, flaxseeds, oranges, yogurt, beans and oatmeal &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2015/05/18/health/foods-for-constipation"&gt;can also help&lt;/a&gt; with chronic constipation.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgvd8qec000w3b6ncyd4t6et@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For those who like dairy, you could “take a cup of yogurt, make it 8 ounces, any yogurt of your choice because all yogurts have probiotics, and take a heaped tablespoon full of crushed flaxseeds,” said Choudhary, an expert with the American Gastroenterological Association.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgvd8qec000x3b6n9ozxl3ub@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Other alternatives include dietary supplements, such as &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/drugs/18922-psyllium-powder-for-solution" target="_blank"&gt;psyllium&lt;/a&gt;, which helps your intestine move stool along and reduces your body’s cholesterol absorption from food.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgvd8qec000y3b6n2x0au123@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “That dosage is at least 10 grams of fiber per day. And again, the general rule is, start low and go slow. So start with 3 grams and gradually work your way up to 10 plus grams per day of psyllium to achieve the benefits,” said Chey, incoming president of the American College of Gastroenterology.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgvd8qec000z3b6nt9lvzh94@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11583288/" target="_blank"&gt;Physical activity&lt;/a&gt; is also an important lifestyle change that patients with chronic constipation can incorporate.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgvd8qec00103b6n7ov5pipc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Even something as simple as walking&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;increases the effectiveness of the digestive tract&lt;strong&gt;, &lt;/strong&gt;Choudhary said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgvd8qec00113b6npxjdgcii@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The new recommendations were based on findings of four systematic reviews and meta-analyses that looked at over 75 randomized controlled trials of dietary interventions for chronic constipation.
    &lt;/p&gt;

Navigating this while traveling becomes trickier. We are perpetually inundated with single-use plastic options. The plethora of plastic water bottles stacked at every airport shop, kiosk, or roadside convenience store comes with a hidden cost: microplastics. These tiny particles, often invisible to the eye, are increasingly found in bottled water, tap systems, and even the food we eat.

According to Brandon, “I needed a water bottle that was small and could fit in my purse and wouldn’t get gross during my travels. It’s made of 65 percent recycled materials, including 90 percent recycled stainless steel. As a bonus, every purchase funds the cleanup of 1,000 ocean-bound plastic bottles.”

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It’s not the double-wall stainless steel construction that sets this bottle apart from the pack; it's the dual-filter system that takes care of bacteria, parasites, microplastics, chlorine, odors, and more. Even better, the membrane lasts up to 1,000 gallons, which is more than enough to provide years of reliable service. And the filter is replaceable when the time comes or when your next destination may have questionable water sources.

To further protect it from accidental slips and bumps, the bottle sports a protective non-slip silicone sleeve, while the leak-proof stainless steel lid eliminates leaks. For those with more discerning taste buds, there is no metallic aftertaste and zero chemical concerns. It’s dishwasher safe and comes in an array of vibrant colors.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_56-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; I first became acquainted with Lifefactory through its glass water bottles that came wrapped in a silicone sleeve. Fast-forward a decade or more, and the brand is back in my quiver of reusable water bottles with its &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/LIfeFactory-Stainless-Vacuum-Insulated-Bottle-Desert/dp/B09KXB4VPM?tag=travelandleisure-onsite-backup-20" data-component="amazon" data-source="affiliate" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="sponsored nofollow noskim"&gt;stainless steel style&lt;/a&gt;. And while this sports bottle also comes in 16-, 20-, and 24-ounce models, I really like the larger size as it helps me attain my daily hydration goals with the higher capacity. And while the screw-on cap is comprised of BPA-free, durable, and food-safe polypropylene, Brandon recommends always hand-washing the tops and not leaving them out in the sun, as UV light can break down even the best plastics.

At 34 ounces, the double-walled construction provides reliable cooling for up to 24 hours and keeps those hot beverages warm for up to 12 hours. And, there is zero plastic contact inside. The leakproof lid is topped with bamboo to round out the sustainable look and feel of the bottle. The bottle also comes with a natural bristle brush for cleaning, all while helping you further eliminate microplastics from your life.

Granted, the plastics used now are much safer than those that I used over 40 years ago. Made in the U.S., the newest iterations of this classic wide-mouth bottle are manufactured with BPA and BPS-free food-safe Tritan plastic. And, this iconic and nearly indestructible water bottle is paired with a built-in filter that removes up to 99.99 percent of tap water contaminants—including microplastics.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_79-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Travel often disrupts our daily habits, and hydration is one of the first routines to change. When you’re rushing through an airport or exploring a new city, grabbing a bottle of water is often the most convenient choice. But research has shown that bottled water can contain far higher concentrations of microplastics than tap water.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_80-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_81-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; According to Brandon, single-use bottled water is one of the most common sources of plastic trash, as well as one of our biggest sources of microplastic consumption. On average, there are 60 times more microplastics in bottled water than in tap water. And a lot of that plastic is from the bottle and the cap itself! Each twist of the cap can produce 500 microplastics.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_82-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_83-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Studies have shown that microplastics are present in over 90 percent of sampled bottled water, making it a hidden but widespread concern for travelers worldwide,” states Jean-Luc Madier, Director of Engineering at &lt;a href="https://lifestraw.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="sponsored nofollow noskim"&gt;LifeStraw&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_84-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_85-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Single-use plastics are about 40 to 50 percent of the plastic waste problem in general (numbers vary), which is huge,” Brandon added. “And then, when you think about microplastics, they are a huge part of the problem, because they are made of very cheap plastic, so they are not made to last. Not all plastic is the same. Single-use plastic is thinner and cheaper, and will break down into microplastics a lot faster than plastic that is made to be used for a long time.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_86-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_87-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This is why choosing a safe, reusable water bottle isn’t just about sustainability—it’s also about reducing the ways microplastics find their way into your body. There is good news, though: By educating yourself about what to carry and how to use it, you can cut down your risk dramatically, no matter where your trip takes you.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_88-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-choosing-the-right-water-bottle-to-avoid-microplastics"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_89-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block travelandleisure-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; Choosing the Right Water Bottle to Avoid Microplastics &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_90-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; According to Brandon, not all reusable bottles are created equal. There is a significant difference in quality between the plastic used in a Hydro Flask or Nalgene versus the cheap plastic of an athletic squirt bottle or a free reusable plastic bottle you'd get at a conference or festival. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_91-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_92-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As mentioned earlier, the material matters most. &lt;strong&gt;Stainless steel&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;glass bottles&lt;/strong&gt; are generally considered the safest choices since they don’t shed particles or leach chemicals, even when exposed to heat or frequent washing. If you prefer plastic for its lighter weight, look for high-quality, BPA-free options and replace them as soon as they show scratches, cloudiness, or wear—signs that microplastic shedding could be occurring.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_93-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_94-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Stainless steel is very safe and durable,” states Brandon. “Glass is incredibly safe, but obviously a bit more breakable. BPA-free plastic is important because BPA is an endocrine mimic-er that can affect our hormone levels, causing reproductive issues, metabolic disorders, and may increase rates of breast cancer and other types of cancer. But there are other additives in plastic besides BPA, so that is not the only thing to look out for.” 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_95-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_96-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Filtration is another key feature to consider, particularly for international travel. Some brands now offer built-in filters that can remove not only bacteria, viruses, and protozoans, but also reduce microplastic levels from tap water and other questionable sources. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_97-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_98-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Finally, care plays a big role. Brandon says, “Washing your bottle by hand with mild soap and avoiding extreme heat (like dishwashers) will extend its life and reduce the risk of particle breakdown. I would recommend always hand-washing the tops and dishwashing the bottles (as relates to the stainless steel and glass bottles). And don't leave them out in the sun. Ultraviolet  light will always start to degrade even the best plastics.”
&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;A generous drizzle of &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/food-and-drink/features/extra-virgin-olive-oil-cult-essential/"&gt;extra virgin olive oil&lt;/a&gt; (EVO) may help reduce harmful bacteria that contribute to dental plaque, say scientists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A cornerstone of the Mediterranean diet, olive oil is brimming with antioxidant and antimicrobial compounds, such as oleic acid and oleanolic acid, which have been shown to reduce inflammation markers and prevent bacteria forming dental plaque.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One study in the &lt;em&gt;International Journal of Clinical Pediatric Dentistry&lt;/em&gt; found oil pulling – swilling EVO around the mouth for 5-10 minutes a day – reduced plaque and gingivitis after a month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Mediterranean diet is also abundant in omega-3 fatty acids, from oily fish such as salmon and mackerel, plus nuts and seeds. “The body converts omega-3s into DHA and EPA, compounds with direct anti-inflammatory effects,” says Reeves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plant-based sources include flaxseed oil, walnuts, avocados, and seeds. “Sprinkle nuts and seeds over salads or breakfasts, and drizzle raw oils on to cooked pasta or warm salads,” she suggests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;5. Feast on fermented foods&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A healthier gut means a healthier mouth. “When your gut microbiome is out of balance, the gut wall becomes more permeable, triggering inflammation that can potentially worsen periodontal disease,” says Reeves. “Improving your gut microbiome reduces that inflammation, supporting oral health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study in &lt;em&gt;Nutrients&lt;/em&gt; found a Mediterranean-style diet helps protect the intestinal barrier. Variety is key – eat a wide range of plant foods, including fermented staples such as yogurt, cheese, kefir and sourdough bread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Live yogurt is especially beneficial. Rich in protein, calcium and phosphorus, it can help remineralise enamel, repair gum tissue and neutralise acids. Its probiotic cultures may also inhibit harmful bacteria&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“&lt;/em&gt;Yogurt can support your oral microbiome by introducing beneficial bacteria that compete with pathogenic types,” says Belle Amatt, a nutrition consultant at &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://w-wellness.co.uk/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;W-Wellness&lt;/a&gt;. “It may help reduce bacteria involved in cavities, lowering inflammation in gum tissue.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;6. Eat real food&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Avoiding ultra-processed foods (UPFs) benefits your gums as well as your waistline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Fibrous foods that require more chewing – such as wholegrains, raw vegetables and nuts – stimulate saliva, which washes away food particles and neutralises harmful acids,” says Casas. “Chewing also boosts blood flow to the gums, supporting tissue resilience.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By contrast, UPFs tend to be soft, sweet and easy to eat, encouraging bacteria growth and raising the risk of gum disease and tooth decay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;7. Cut down on red meat&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We all know that sugar is bad news for our teeth, but eating too much red meat may be harmful too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The King’s College London study found a higher red meat consumption was strongly linked to severe gum disease. A separate paper in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Clinical Periodontology&lt;/em&gt; found that people who ate more red meat had worse gum health, with more bleeding and deeper periodontal pockets – spaces between teeth and gums, caused by inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re yet to pinpoint the exact cause, but saturated fat, heme iron and advanced glycation end-products – harmful compounds created when meat is cooked – can promote inflammation,” says Prof Nibali. “They increase oxidative stress, impair immune regulation and disrupt the oral microbiome.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another factor is dietary displacement – heavy &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/diet/nutrition/healthy-guide-to-meat-every-vegan-should-read/"&gt;meat eaters&lt;/a&gt; tend to consume fewer fibre-rich, anti-inflammatory foods, adds Prof Nibali.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you do eat meat, avoid high-temperature methods such as deep-frying, pan-frying, grilling and roasting, which generate more of these compounds. “Opt for moist-heat cooking like steaming, stewing or braising, which keep temperatures lower,” says Reeves.&lt;/p&gt;

The research suggests that the cognitive process of making novel associations—called associative thinking—helps explain why people with high creativity tend to perform better on learning tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Creativity is often considered essential in education and professional life. Past research has shown that creativity is positively linked to academic achievement. However, less is known about how creativity actually supports learning at the cognitive level. The authors of the new study proposed that associative thinking might play a key role. This is the ability to connect different ideas or concepts, which is often seen as a hallmark of creative thought. They suspected that this same ability could also help people learn, particularly when it comes to tasks that require forming new associations, like matching a foreign word with its English translation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the theoretical connection, no previous research had directly tested whether associative thinking is the link between creativity and learning. The researchers aimed to fill this gap by testing whether students who show higher levels of associative thinking also do better at learning tasks. They also wanted to see whether this effect holds even when controlling for general intelligence, which is known to influence both learning and creativity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Creativity has often been linked to academic learning, yet little is known about the mechanisms underlying their relationship,” said study author &lt;a href="https://www.simoneluchini.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Simone Luchini&lt;/a&gt;, a PhD student at Penn State University and an incoming postdoctoral researcher at the Paris Brain Institute. “In our work, we wanted to explore if associative thinking could underlie this link. Associative thinking involves connecting distant concepts or ideas in memory. For example, the concepts of ‘dog’ and ‘cat’ are highly related, while ‘dog’ and ‘plane’ are less related. Does the ability to generate these distant connections allow creative individuals to learn better?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To explore these questions, the researchers conducted two studies with undergraduate students. In both, participants completed a language learning task that required them to memorize pairs of Lithuanian and English words. They were then tested on how well they remembered the word pairs after 24 hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the first study, 146 students completed the language learning task and a word association test that measured associative thinking. In this test, they were shown a series of nouns and asked to come up with verbs that were meaningfully connected but not commonly linked with the noun. For example, given the word “boot,” a creative response might be “travel” instead of a more typical response like “wear.” These responses were analyzed using a computational model that scores how semantically distant the noun-verb pair is. The greater the semantic distance, the more novel the association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results showed that students who generated more semantically distant associations recalled more word pairs, both immediately and after a 24-hour delay. This held true even after accounting for their scores on tests of fluid and crystallized intelligence. These findings suggest that associative thinking plays a distinct role in learning beyond general mental ability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second study included 145 new participants and extended the investigation in several ways. In addition to the language learning and word association tasks, students also completed creative tasks, such as writing short stories and drawing sketches. These tasks were scored using automated systems that assess the novelty and integration of ideas in text and images. The researchers again found that students who performed better on the associative thinking task recalled more words after 24 hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, the second study distinguished between two kinds of associations: free association, where participants responded with any related verb that came to mind, and goal-directed association, where they were instructed to think creatively and produce more novel connections. The researchers found that only goal-directed associative thinking predicted learning outcomes. This suggests that intentional creative thinking is more relevant for learning than simply making quick or obvious connections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also looked at whether creativity influenced learning through associative thinking. Statistical modeling showed that associative thinking partly explained the link between creativity (measured by the drawing and writing tasks and personality measures related to openness) and learning. When they controlled for intelligence, the data indicated that associative thinking fully accounted for the relationship between creativity and learning. In other words, creativity helped learning primarily through the ability to form distant, meaningful associations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We find that associative thinking mediates the link between creativity and learning,” Luchini told PsyPost. “In other words, how good a person is at connecting these distant concepts in memory determines whether their creativity can translate into better learning.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings also point to a distinction between spontaneous associations and more deliberate creative thinking. While people can often make quick associations without much effort, it is the more thoughtful, inventive connections that appear to help with memory and learning. This may have implications for education, suggesting that encouraging students to think in more creative and flexible ways could improve their ability to retain new information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the study provides new insight into how creativity supports learning, it comes with some limitations. The research relied on a specific type of learning task—memorizing foreign vocabulary—which may not represent all forms of learning. It is unclear whether the same findings would apply to learning in other areas, such as math, science, or visual-spatial tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also used a college student sample from psychology courses, which may limit how widely the results can be applied. Future studies could test whether the findings hold in other age groups, educational settings, or cultural contexts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our study was conducted online, so we want to extend our research to a more realistic setting by testing students in their classrooms,” Luchini noted. “We hope that our work will inform classroom practices. This kind of research can be used to facilitate learning, by treating each student as an individual with their own strengths and weaknesses.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors also suggest that future studies explore the neural basis of these effects. Understanding the brain mechanisms involved in associative thinking could help explain why some people are better at learning through creativity than others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“To clarify, we think of creativity as a standard measure of individual differences, much like intelligence or personality,” Luchini explained. “While creativity is certainly malleable, there is a stable degree of creative ability that we capture with our psychological tests, which then informs our research questions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41539-025-00334-1" target="_blank"&gt;Creativity supports learning through associative thinking&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Simone A.

In Asia, the flu has made an early comeback, and quickly swelled to epidemic proportions in Japan and Taiwan. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And stateside, some experts are sounding the alarm about continued lower uptake of the flu vaccine. There’s also the possibility of a &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-09-03/as-covid-wave-washes-over-california-some-health-officials-urge-residents-to-mask-up"&gt;seasonal COVID-19 wave&lt;/a&gt; — the likes of which didn’t materialize last winter, but had been commonplace since the pandemic — as well as a simultaneous rise in &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-11-22/what-to-know-about-the-new-rsv-shot-for-babies"&gt;respiratory syncytial virus&lt;/a&gt;, or RSV. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;California health officials have previously &lt;a class="link" href="https://youtu.be/JfEbRVAvIys?si=Kh5upr2sXpQFulQk&amp;amp;t=354" target="_blank"&gt;forecast&lt;/a&gt; that this fall-and-winter’s respiratory virus season is expected to be similar to last year’s. If that’s the case, flu would again be the dominant virus fueling hospital admissions compared to COVID-19 and RSV. During the winters of 2022-23 and 2023-24, COVID made up the majority of California hospital admissions caused by respiratory viruses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Having people get vaccinated is going to be really key for influenza,” said Dr. Peter Chin-Hong, a UC San Francisco infectious diseases expert. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While flu, COVID and RSV are currently at low levels in California, there are signs that respiratory virus season is starting to gear up as temperatures drop and people spend more time indoors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compared to rates recorded in the summer, the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health has seen increases in people reporting cough, fever, chills, aches, sore throat and runny nose, officials said, citing a text-based health &lt;a class="link" href="https://ph.lacounty.gov/acd/respwatch/#Angelenos" target="_blank"&gt;survey&lt;/a&gt;. The test positivity rate for rhinoviruses and enteroviruses, which typically cause the common cold, is 19.87%. That’s higher than that of the virus that causes COVID-19, 4.2%; or the flu, 1.04%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In San Francisco, doctors have seen the number of colds being reported in the hospital double, Chin-Hong said. Some workplaces in the Bay Area have seen a number of employees call out sick. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With RSV, flu and COVID-19 rates expected to climb by the holidays, “this is a perfect time to get immunized,” the L.A. County Department of Public Health said in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fall and winter of 2024-25 brought the nation’s &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/whats-new/2025-2026-influenza-activity.html#:~:text=The%20Centers%20for%20Disease%20Control,of%20the%202024%E2%80%9325%20season" target="_blank"&gt;worst&lt;/a&gt; flu season in many years, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The number of children who died from flu last season was the highest since the H1N1 swine flu pandemic season of 2009-10, according to a recent &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7436a2.htm" target="_blank"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; published in the CDC’s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. Officials reported 280 confirmed deaths among children last season, and about 9 in 10 of those kids were not vaccinated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials became particularly concerned about reports of a rare, severe complication that targets the brain — influenza-associated encephalopathy, or &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7436a1.htm" target="_blank"&gt;IAE&lt;/a&gt;, which was reported in 109 children nationally last season. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three in four children with IAE needed intensive care treatment. The median age of children with IAE was 5, and 55% of those diagnosed with the condition had no underlying health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of those children, 37 had acute necrotizing encephalopathy, or ANE, a particularly severe form of the disease that results in rapid neurologic decline. Two in five children with ANE died. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only 1 in 6 of the kids with IAE who were eligible to be vaccinated had gotten the flu shot, health officials say. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC recommends that everyone age 6 months and up get a flu vaccine. New this year, officials are allowing people to order &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-nasal-spray-influenza-vaccine-self-or-caregiver-administration" target="_blank"&gt;FluMist&lt;/a&gt; to be mailed to them at home. FluMist is approved for people ages 2 through 49 and administered by nasal spray rather than injection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors have been concerned about declining flu vaccination levels. As of late April, just 49.2% of children had gotten a flu shot, lower than the 53.4% who had done so at the same point the previous season, according to preliminary national &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluvaxview/dashboard/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;survey results&lt;/a&gt;. Both figures are much lower than the &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluvaxview/interactive/general-population-coverage.html" target="_blank"&gt;final flu vaccination rate&lt;/a&gt; for vaccine-eligible children during the 2019-20 season, which was 63.7%. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among adults, 46.7% had gotten their flu shot, slightly down from the 47.4% at the same point last season, according to the preliminary survey results. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Before the COVID-19 pandemic, flu vaccination coverage had been slowly increasing; downturns in coverage occurred during and after the pandemic. Flu vaccination levels have not rebounded to pre-pandemic levels,” the CDC &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluvaxview/dashboard/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early data from the Southern Hemisphere indicate that the flu shot’s effectiveness was decent this season — cutting the risk of &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7436a3.htm?utm_source=substack&amp;amp;utm_medium=email" target="_blank"&gt;hospitalization&lt;/a&gt; by 50%. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asia is already reporting plenty of flu cases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For influenza right now, it’s raging in Asia,” Chin-Hong said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flu is considered to be at epidemic levels in &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/16071642" target="_blank"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt; — where news reports say this was the second-earliest start to the season in 20 years — and in Taiwan. Hong Kong health officials have described the flu situation in September and October, before shots became widely available, as “&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/health-environment/article/3329312/hong-kong-faces-relatively-severe-summer-flu-outbreak-health-authorities-warn" target="_blank"&gt;relatively severe&lt;/a&gt;.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The situation there could provide a glimpse of how the flu season will play out in California and beyond. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the San Francisco Bay Area, officials are also closely monitoring “high” levels in wastewater of a &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-09-14/la-oc-health-departments-warn-about-enterovirus-ev-d68"&gt;specific kind of cold virus&lt;/a&gt; — enterovirus D68, or EV-D68. In rare cases, that virus can cause polio-like paralysis in children called acute flaccid myelitis, or AFM. High levels were reported in a large swath of the Silicon Valley and San Francisco, according to &lt;a class="link" href="https://data.wastewaterscan.org/?charts=CjEQACABSABaBUVWRDY4cgoyMDI1LTA5LTA1cgoyMDI1LTEwLTE3igEGNTY3MWZjwAEB&amp;amp;selectedChartId=5671fc&amp;amp;plantId=c8d357b9&amp;amp;target=EVD68&amp;amp;selectedLocation=%7B%22label%22%3A%22San%20Jose,%20CA%22,%22level%22%3A%22plant%22,%22value%22%3A%22c8d357b9%22%7D" target="_blank"&gt;WastewaterSCAN&lt;/a&gt;. High levels have also been found in sewage in western San Bernardino County, including Ontario, Chino and Fontana. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The L.A. County Department of Public Health has not yet detected increased signals of EV-D68, and no cases of AFM have been reported this year in Los Angeles or Orange counties. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That virus can transmit through an infected person’s saliva and mucus and likely spreads “when an infected person coughs, sneezes or touches a surface that is then touched by others,” the CDC said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parents should call a doctor if their child suffers any symptoms of &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/non-polio-enterovirus/about/about-enterovirus-d68.html" target="_blank"&gt;AFM&lt;/a&gt;, which include slurred speech, difficulty swallowing, difficulty moving the eyes, drooping eyelids, pain in the neck, back, arms or legs, weakness in the arm or legs or facial droop. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To protect yourself against respiratory viruses, experts recommend getting vaccinated, washing your hands often, keeping rooms well-ventilated, wearing face masks in crowded indoor public settings, and staying away from sick people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The California Department of Public Health &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/publichealth4all/vaccines.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;recommends&lt;/a&gt; updated COVID-19 vaccines for everyone age 6 months to 23 months, seniors age 65 and up; as well as older children, teenagers and adults who either have risk factors for severe COVID, or are in close contact with at-risk people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Children who have never been inoculated against COVID-19 should also get the vaccine, as should pregnant women and anyone else who wants to get the shot, the state says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RSV immunizations are recommended for everyone age 75 and up, babies younger than 8 months, and pregnant women between 32 weeks to 36 weeks of gestation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The immunizations are also recommended for adults age 50 to 74 with risk factors, as well as babies with risk factors between 8 months and 19 months. Older adults who have been previously immunized against RSV generally don’t need to get another vaccine, according to current guidelines.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Los Angeles Times</author><pubDate>Mon, 20 Oct 2025 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMioAFBVV95cUxQWnVtWDhxeTRmMC0zT2l1TzNkSFpJR3NCQi1QcFhwMENFQjVpUFBhTDVadFg5M3RNYmRwSjFKbEgzZTdUeHp5dm0tRE9MbGpWRWotUmJYeC1ReWxrZjN2d2c0QUdVNlRkenBJc0M1RnREeU5hVUdfc2lPd0h1cy1IaFkzSjRYRTVOQms1d1pOUzdSR1FQQWJ0U1dYWG90OS14</guid></item></channel></rss>
