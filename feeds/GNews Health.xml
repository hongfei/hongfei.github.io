Nutrient-packed foods can make a difference, and one fruit has been getting a lot of attention in this regard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the researchers investigating this fruit’s benefits is &lt;a href="https://hhd.psu.edu/contact/mary-jane-de-souza" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Dr. Mary Jane De Souza&lt;/a&gt; from Penn State. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her work focuses on how it contributes to muscle mass and bone structure, especially in people over 45 who are facing the natural changes that come with menopause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-muscles-and-bones-need-extra-help"&gt;Muscles and bones need extra help&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A gradual loss of lean tissue can affect physical performance. Reduced bone density can also leave a person more prone to fractures. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Individuals who want a balanced and enjoyable life after 45 often look for reliable dietary strategies that fit into a simple routine. Some studies have begun to explore how particular &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/black-gold-the-vitamin-packed-fruit-that-regulates-blood-sugar-and-blood-pressure/"&gt;fruits&lt;/a&gt; might fill that need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prunes contain a significant amount of nutrients, including vitamins and polyphenols. &lt;a href="https://www.chhs.colostate.edu/krnc/monthly-blog/what-are-polyphenols-another-great-reason-to-eat-fruits-and-veggies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Polyphenols&lt;/a&gt; are chemical compounds linked with antioxidant properties that may support healthy cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers have suggested that prunes might not only aid digestion but also help keep muscles and bones in decent shape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-prunes-help-bones-and-muscles"&gt;Prunes help bones and muscles&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The discussion around prunes often highlights fiber, but that’s not the only draw. Experts have pointed out that prunes carry components that are important for muscle support. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some references have also shown they can increase levels of &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9526830/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;IGF-1&lt;/a&gt;, which plays a role in normal bone development and muscle growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is also a natural compound known as sorbitol, and certain acids that can influence blood sugar management. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prunes appear to slow sugar absorption while helping the body handle glucose. Some studies connect these qualities to better energy balance throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-the-latest-research-found"&gt;What the latest research found&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is the first randomized controlled trial to look at three-dimensional bone outcomes with respect to bone structure, geometry, and estimated strength,” said Dr. De Souza. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists at &lt;a href="https://www.psu.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Penn State&lt;/a&gt; tested how prunes affect bone structure in postmenopausal &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/plant-based-diet-improves-health-in-women-with-breast-cancer/"&gt;women&lt;/a&gt;. Their data suggests that a daily serving of prunes seems to slow typical bone changes seen in women after they stop having menstrual cycles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In that investigation, people who ate at least four to six prunes per day saw noticeable stability in bone density measurements. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study showed that many participants who consumed prunes preserved bone quality over the course of a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-prunes-help-women-after-menopause"&gt;Prunes help women after menopause&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For women past 45, menopause means shifting hormone levels and a greater chance of bone mineral density loss. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38349471/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;trial&lt;/a&gt; revealed that routine prune intake kept certain bone markers stable in this group. One portion of research also highlighted how prunes help support cholesterol and antioxidant capacity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further data has shown that prunes are tied to a better gut environment. Some participants appeared to experience fewer changes associated with inflammation when adding prunes into their diets. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists theorize that healthy gut microbes and reduced inflammatory markers might have an important link to bone strength.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers found that not everyone responds to prunes the same way. In one study, women with more diverse &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4290017/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;gut microbiomes&lt;/a&gt; were more likely to benefit from the fruit’s bone-supporting effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-many-prunes-should-you-eat"&gt;How many prunes should you eat?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some experts encourage daily consumption of around 50 grams of prunes, which equals five or six pieces. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This moderate serving size seems enough to deliver benefits without too many extra calories or sugars. People can easily add prunes to salads, cereals, or just enjoy them on their own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many individuals in research studies were also advised to take in enough calcium and vitamin D. That suggests a broader approach to diet and daily habits is still essential. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet, prunes have a particular identity as an easy snack that adds fiber, minerals, and certain vitamins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some participants in the control group, who didn’t eat prunes, still improved their bone density. These women tended to have a higher &lt;a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/calculate-your-bmi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;body mass index (BMI)&lt;/a&gt; and more body fat overall, which may have played a role in protecting their bones through increased weight-bearing pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, higher BMI can also lead to health issues like &lt;a href="https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/diabetes/overview/what-is-diabetes/prediabetes-insulin-resistance" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;insulin resistance&lt;/a&gt;, which were seen in these participants. The prune group, on the other hand, gained bone support without relying on excess weight or related metabolic risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-prunes-bones-and-muscle-health"&gt;Prunes, bones, and muscle health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While prunes are no substitute for medication or a doctor’s advice, some researchers see real potential in this fruit. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also emphasize getting a healthy mix of exercise, which might help maintain lean mass and &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/organic-molecules-collagen-discovered-in-66-million-year-old-dinosaur-bones/"&gt;bone&lt;/a&gt; density as people age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Continued research points to a strong connection between natural compounds in prunes and measurable differences in skeletal support. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More studies may clarify how prunes influence healthy gut bacteria or whether certain individuals benefit more than others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnut.2024.1389638/full" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Frontiers in Nutrition&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Jun 2025 15:13:47 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqgFBVV95cUxOZkh6c2FOVVMtbGJWWHNtaEVNVUxsZEZ5eWwwNXctVmtvU0huelJya0xjWGl6Tk4wTllyRmVUeENFRzRDb0VZSnJ3WEt0c1lTOVhFRGU5ZDZqdmVRcUlXUXl2bC1zN2tvVUZra0FVcWtrX0ROclg4elJ0emd0d0pHZEgxa2hZQVNsS1h1SHZGcEJmMkxpQy0yME0taDJhZkVPdDZxckFkVktvUQ</guid></item><item><title>在RFK Jr.单方面限制接种后， CDC顶级新冠疫苗专家辞职- Ars Technica | Top CDC COVID vaccine expert resigns after RFK Jr. unilaterally restricts access - Ars Technica</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiuwFBVV95cUxNVFFWTjhSSlRpWGFBaVBMY2RFcTNGM0F4akZjcmo3bU1nRVNVN1BQQ3VTS0ZQZXh2YlNNUDJQV0JwNUxOWVRrYTN6bEhUdHA5cnNyWHpXSGlaWGdpSVZ5UlZidWhhLW84YkxvQnItMmVrcENBanIxVnNCY3BtUDVsSFF6TldISDFTUkR5ejBDbFBWSEtRUWpnMmN1bjNzbkZCblhhQnYzdTJ4OXFzM2Y5eVdzc20wcndHYTJj?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
                      
                      
          &lt;p&gt;A top expert at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention who was overseeing the process to update COVID-19 vaccine recommendations resigned on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The resignation, first reported by &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/cdc-expert-resigns-covid-vaccines-advisory-role-sources-say-2025-06-03/"&gt;The Associated Press&lt;/a&gt; and confirmed by &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cdc-official-overseeing-covid-19-vaccine-recommendations-resigns/"&gt;CBS News&lt;/a&gt;, comes just a week after health secretary and anti-vaccine advocate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. unilaterally &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/05/anti-vaccine-advocate-rfk-jr-axes-covid-shot-guidance-for-pregnant-people-kids/"&gt;revoked and altered some of the CDC's recommendations for COVID-19 vaccines&lt;/a&gt;, restricting access to children and pregnant people. The resignation also comes three weeks before CDC's experts and advisors are scheduled to meet to publicly evaluate data and discuss the recommendations for this season—a long-established process that was disrupted by Kennedy's announcement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The departing CDC official, Lakshmi Panagiotakopoulos, a pediatric infectious disease expert, was a co-leader of a working group on COVID-19 vaccines who advised experts on the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). She informed her ACIP colleagues of her resignation in an email on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"My career in public health and vaccinology started with a deep-seated desire to help the most vulnerable members of our population, and that is not something I am able to continue doing in this role," Panagiotakopoulos wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Unilateral changes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previously, the CDC and ACIP recommended COVID-19 vaccines for everyone ages 6 months and up. Experts have emphasized that pregnant people in particular should get vaccinated, as pregnancy suppresses the immune system and puts pregnant people at high risk of severe COVID-19 and death. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists states that "COVID-19 infection during pregnancy can be catastrophic." Further, &lt;a href="https://gh.bmj.com/content/9/4/e014247"&gt;dozens of studies have found&lt;/a&gt; that the vaccines are safe and effective at protecting the pregnant person, the pregnancy, and newborns.&lt;/p&gt;

The study’s authors found that plunging your limbs into icy water after lifting weights slows blood flow to muscles, hampering their ability to recover and grow, potentially reducing the benefits of the workout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="NAJUHVAIN5GXLN37ROMWYQJKGM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“It looks like it’s not a great idea” to soak in freezing water after lifting weights, said Milan Betz, a doctoral student at Maastricht University in the Netherlands, who led the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="VEUD4SUYT5C3NMDLMOU2EG5VCU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The findings add to mounting evidence that ice baths may undermine the effects of lifting and also raise the provocative issue of when, if ever, ice baths are a great idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="JHRPQAZOAJBRNESUQ4HEYEMY74" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="JHRPQAZOAJBRNESUQ4HEYEMY74" data-testid="article-header"&gt;Muscles that are 20 percent smaller&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="6675K6JXONF4XNFBVTFASXJC3E" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Fans of cold plunging typically say the practice is beneficial for both body and mind, lifting moods, building grit, soothing aches and stiffness, and, perhaps above all, speeding up and intensifying recovery from exercise, so you get more from each workout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="OQSPKRIEONAD3JV7ZDNHXDXXUY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But little science has supported the purported benefits of ice baths, and in recent years, studies have frequently undercut them. In a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26174323/" target="_blank"&gt;2015 experiment&lt;/a&gt;, for instance, scientists in Australia asked 21 men to lift weights twice a week. Half of the men cold plunged after every session; the others didn’t. After three months, the cold plungers’ muscles were nearly 20 percent smaller and weaker than the other men’s, although everyone followed the same exercise routine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="MZHU57IHZ5GEDP56W36V5OWBHA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Similarly, a &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ejsc.12074" target="_blank"&gt;2024 review&lt;/a&gt; of prior research, cheekily titled “Throwing Cold Water on Muscle Growth,” concluded that the best available research indicated cold plunges after resistance training can “attenuate hypertrophic changes.” In other words, your muscles won’t grow as much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="JVBZ6KA5NNFI3EL4HDE6APG4U4" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="JVBZ6KA5NNFI3EL4HDE6APG4U4" data-testid="article-header"&gt;What happens to blood flow after a cold plunge&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="4M2QYTIMC5FABHWS2PVWLHUQ5E" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;How would cold water undo resistance exercise? The review’s authors speculated that frigid temperatures shrink blood vessels, impeding blood flow to muscles. Blood carries nutrients, including protein, that muscles rely on to rebuild and bulk up after draining exercise. Less blood flow means less protein and a feebler recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="2XBE5CRTA5AHFOTIEQFQBSUGDE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But no study had yet shown that process in action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="FH25FO64CBH5PM3VB2LIX6HMZY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Enter Betz and his colleagues. They wanted to see what happens to blood flow after ice baths, so they recruited 12 healthy young men and used portable ultrasound machines to track baseline blood flow in their legs as they rested at the lab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="LC4YHNYITBGXVH4TIRUPFDJBHA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The volunteers then sweated though a tough session of leg press and leg extension exercises, before immediately clambering onto a bicycle-like contraption with large buckets where the pedals should be. One contained tepid 80-degree water, the other icy 30-degree water. The men slid a leg into each bucket, so one limb cold plunged, the other didn’t, and stayed there for 20 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="WM5I5ZUCQRAU7MHSCN5MSPESKY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Afterward, the volunteers drank a recovery shake containing protein molecules marked with a biochemical tracer. Researchers could track the tracer to see whether the proteins wound up in muscles or not. The scientists also checked blood flow with an ultrasound several more times over the next few hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="FPQK7UCVO5AJJKXVSIBQG6WYNQ" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="FPQK7UCVO5AJJKXVSIBQG6WYNQ" data-testid="article-header"&gt;Cold plunges may undo benefits of weight training&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="W54OQLHMSVDPRBAT5ZROEE5PQQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;What they found was that blood flow dropped substantially in the volunteers’ cold-plunged leg, compared to their other limb, and stayed low for hours. The muscles in that chilled leg consequently received and absorbed far less protein from the shake. Over time, this reduced protein intake would likely mean blunted gains in strength and muscle mass from the lifting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="MDGYNPPXQVACVMNU6OFTHF72O4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The results “provide confirmatory evidence” that cold plunges can alter the desired effects of weight training by reducing blood flow and protein uptake, said Brad Schoenfeld, an exercise scientist at Lehman College in New York, who studies resistance training and co-wrote the 2024 review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="SWTLBP6TGVDJXMONGHDIKQX23I" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But this was a single, small study, and many questions remain unanswered. Would ice bathing likewise affect recovery from other exercise? “I would think you’d see similar effects with other sports” such as running, cycling and team sports, Betz said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="HWIVTTIIGVGJ3CNKBDH5EC2XCI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;What about the effects on women and older people, who weren’t studied here? Betz said he believes, again, the impacts would be much the same in almost everyone, but those studies need to be done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ZUTSNPKQZJHW3EMRKCQE527ZOM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;It’s also unclear whether and to what extent timing and other details matter, said Denis Blondin, a professor of health sciences who studies metabolism and cold exposure at the University of Sherbrooke in Canada. He wasn’t involved with the new study. Maybe ice baths several hours after a workout would have different effects on muscles, he said, as might tweaking how long you soak, how much of your body is submerged and the water’s exact temperature. More large-scale research is needed to understand the nuances of cold soaks and exercise response, Blondin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="IOOP36Y4YVDXROSJN3CX4XZOMM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Some people also ice bathe for reasons unrelated to exercise recovery, including to make themselves feel mentally stronger and more resilient. The new study did not consider psychological outcomes from chilling out, Betz said, and, if you find comfort in cold plunges, “there’s no reason to change your mind.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="YXJIJFRIPNGSDPL5WZODKVX53M" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But, to get the most gains from weight training, he said, the bulk of the available evidence, including the new study, suggest you should probably skip an ice bath soon afterward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="NJCSBX3EJZEXHDPDBGOTAQKI3I" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Do you have a fitness question?

That’s how it’s supposed to work in theory. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But slaughterhouses operate at a rapid, hectic pace, with animals sometimes stunned improperly and butchered while still alive and conscious. If a cow remained conscious once they got to Tom — as was the case with this cow in particular, whose calf was partially hanging out of her birth canal — he was unable to stop the line to ensure they were properly killed. So, as the cow kicked at him, mid-birth, he had no choice but to skin her alive. The calf didn’t survive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“It takes 25 seconds&lt;strong&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt;“ to skin them, he said in&lt;em&gt; The Dying Trade&lt;/em&gt;, “but it stays with you for the rest of your life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Tom, who calls himself a “devout animal lover,” said that it’s “very difficult watching animals being killed.” But the job desensitizes you: “You become a robot.” Other slaughterhouse workers have made &lt;a href="https://law.lclark.edu/live/files/32165-24-2-hemenwaypdf"&gt;similar remarks&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--block-placement _80slsf1 _80slsf0 duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_1agbrixj"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--media--caption xptnl10"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup xkp0cg2 xptnl12"&gt;Ducks hang upside down from a processing line as workers hang more animals on the line at a duck farm’s on-site slaughterhouse in Portugal that also slaughters animals from nearby farms.&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;cite class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup xkp0cg2 xptnl11"&gt;Human Cruelties/We Animals&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;To cope, Tom spent most of his slaughterhouse career as a functioning alcoholic, drinking as soon as he got off work until he went to bed. He took magic mushrooms on weekends to escape. He also dissociated at work, spending much of his time on the production line “thinking I was on holiday…I would dream I was in Spain somewhere — just anywhere but what I was doing.” Now, he said, he lives like a hermit and still dreams about slaughterhouses six to seven nights a week. He also has violent thoughts of hurting people, which he had never had prior to working in meat processing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“I suffer with PITS as a result,” Tom said, referring to &lt;a href="https://perpetrationtrauma.org/"&gt;perpetration-induced traumatic stress&lt;/a&gt;, a subcategory of post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD, in which the cause of the trauma is being a perpetrator of violence — in this case, slaughtering animals for food — rather than being a victim of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;a href="/future-perfect/405972/trump-slaughter-line-speed-poultry-pork"&gt;Physical injury rates are high in slaughterhouses&lt;/a&gt;, making it one of the more dangerous occupations. But much less is known about the mental and emotional toll of slaughterhouse work. Psychology researchers have difficulty accessing slaughterhouse worker populations, and so we’re left with a handful of &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/15248380211030243"&gt;small studies&lt;/a&gt;. As a result, it’s unknown exactly what share of the world’s millions of slaughterhouse workers suffer from PTSD or other mental health conditions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But what’s certain is that many do — surveys of slaughterhouse workers show high rates of anxiety and depression, and &lt;a href="https://metro.co.uk/2017/12/31/how-killing-animals-everyday-leaves-slaughterhouse-workers-traumatised-7175087/"&gt;many&lt;/a&gt; have &lt;a href="https://law.lclark.edu/live/files/32165-24-2-hemenwaypdf"&gt;shared&lt;/a&gt; stories of &lt;a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2024/10/06/denver-slaughterhouse-ban-ordinance-309/"&gt;mental health struggles&lt;/a&gt; with researchers and &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/stories-50986683"&gt;journalists&lt;/a&gt;. The problem is likely to worsen in the years ahead, as more and more slaughterhouses are built around the world to &lt;a href="https://www.oecd.org/en/publications/2023/07/oecd-fao-agricultural-outlook-2023-2032_859ba0c2.html"&gt;satisfy increasing meat consumption&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Two years ago, the American Medical Association’s Journal of Ethics even devoted an &lt;a href="https://journalofethics.ama-assn.org/issue/meat-and-health"&gt;entire issue&lt;/a&gt; to the meat industry’s effects on societal health, including its impact on workers. &lt;a href="https://journalofethics.ama-assn.org/article/how-should-clinicians-respond-patients-experiencing-ongoing-present-traumatic-stress-industrial-meat/2023-04"&gt;One article&lt;/a&gt; by social psychologist &lt;a href="https://rachelmacnair.com/"&gt;Rachel MacNair&lt;/a&gt;, who coined the term PITS, put the psychological toll of slaughterhouse work — and society’s complicity in the problem — in blunt terms: “Public demand for meat creates ongoing, present, and future exposure to trauma and continual retraumatization.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="what-we-know-about-the-psychological-toll-of-slaughterhouse-work" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What we know about the psychological toll of slaughterhouse work&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The concept of PTSD stems from studies of combat veterans, research that accelerated in the post-Vietnam War era in the US. It was officially recognized by the American Psychiatric Association as a mental health condition in 1980.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But it took time for psychologists to recognize that being the one who perpetrates violence — as opposed to experiencing or witnessing it — can also be highly traumatic, or even more so. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;In a 1998 study, MacNair told me, she observed that Vietnam War veterans who directly killed people had higher trauma scores than those who only witnessed killing. In 2002, she published the first book on the issue — &lt;a href="https://www.bloomsbury.com/us/perpetrationinduced-traumatic-stress-9780313012501/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Perpetration-Induced Traumatic Stress: The Psychological Consequences of Killing&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — which went beyond war and into other arenas of violence, including policing, death penalty executions, torture, homicide, and slaughterhouse work. The idea has since expanded how psychologists think about traumatization from violence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Slaughterhouse work can also deeply impact those who don’t directly kill animals but still play a critical role in meat production, like David Magna, a former slaughterhouse inspector for the Canadian government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;For six years, Magna worked at a major chicken plant, where one of his jobs entailed standing behind employees on the slaughter line — which operated at the breakneck speed of 180 birds per minute — to check for signs of disease and other issues. He also inspected crates of chickens as they were unloaded to be slaughtered; sometimes, hundreds would arrive dead from &lt;a href="/future-perfect/414338/chick-usps-animal-transport-meat"&gt;exposure to extreme heat or cold&lt;/a&gt; during transportation from the factory farm. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;After six years at the chicken slaughterhouse, Magna developed severe respiratory problems, requiring him to take time off (it’s not uncommon for poultry workers to complain about the &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/at-chicken-plants-chemicals-blamed-for-health-ailments-are-poised-to-proliferate/2013/04/25/d2a65ec8-97b1-11e2-97cd-3d8c1afe4f0f_story.html"&gt;toxic, bacteria-killing chemicals used in slaughterhouses&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Over the next decade, Magna went on to work as an inspector at other plants along with a desk job in which he reviewed animal welfare violation reports, including a number of disturbing cases. In one, a farmer branded some of his pigs a dozen or so times each with a hot iron all over their bodies, but was only penalized with a fine and was allowed to continue to raise animals for meat. In another case, a truckload of pigs froze to death after a driver fell asleep. One report involved a pregnant dairy cow who gave birth on a slaughterhouse-bound truck. Because the trailer was so crowded, the calf’s head was smashed in by other cows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--block-placement _80slsf2 _80slsf0 duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_1agbrixl"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--media--caption xptnl10"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup xkp0cg2 xptnl12"&gt;Pigs lie dying on a bloody slaughterhouse floor in Canada as a worker stands over them before pushing them into a scalding tank.&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;cite class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup xkp0cg2 xptnl11"&gt;Jo-Anne McArthur/We Animals&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“I’m a shell of what I was when I walked in that [first] day,” Magna told me. Throughout his career, he’d try to improve conditions, but the deck was stacked against him: regulations are weak, violators face little to no penalties, and higher-ups often didn’t take his concerns seriously. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Like Tom, the slaughterhouse worker in Europe, Magna drank excessively to cope. He also had dreams in which he was a chicken packed in a crate and then slaughtered. His mother, who had briefly worked on the slaughter line, had similar dreams. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Objects like a plate of meat or a truck can trigger flashbacks for Magna. He’s dealt with suicidal ideation, and a few years ago, he was diagnosed with PTSD and bipolar disorder. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Gathering broader data on the experiences of people who work in slaughterhouses has proven difficult, but there is some. A few years ago, a &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/15248380211030243"&gt;literature review&lt;/a&gt; by psychologists Jessica Slade and Emma Alleyne at the University of Kent found slaughterhouse workers have higher rates of anxiety and depression, and a higher propensity for physical aggression. A &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.3402/qhw.v11.30266#d1e614"&gt;small study&lt;/a&gt; of slaughterhouse workers in South Africa found that each had recurring nightmares, like Tom and David, and &lt;a href="https://awakenwfu.com/2023/04/21/the-human-cost-of-animal-slaughter/"&gt;some workers&lt;/a&gt; have reported &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228141419_A_Slaughterhouse_Nightmare_Psychological_Harm_Suffered_by_Slaughterhouse_Employees_and_the_Possibility_of_Redress_through_Legal_Reform"&gt;high rates of alcoholism&lt;/a&gt; in the workplace. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But there’s been no large-scale study investigating PTSD rates among slaughterhouse workers, and there’s a good reason why: It would be hard to conduct such a study without cooperation from meat companies. And many slaughterhouse workers are undocumented immigrants who might be reluctant to share their stories, even if they were anonymous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="this-system-oppresses-everyone" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“This system oppresses everyone” &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Some people who live near factory farms, which produce &lt;a href="/future-perfect/395967/iowa-factory-farm-pollution-sacrifice-state"&gt;vast amounts of animal manure that pollutes the air and water&lt;/a&gt;, call their communities &lt;a href="https://www.greatplainsaction.org/single-post/end-stage-iowa"&gt;“sacrifice zones”&lt;/a&gt; for the meat and agricultural industries. In low-income and disproportionately immigrant communities, the meat industry has found its sacrifice &lt;em&gt;populations&lt;/em&gt; — people with few economic opportunities who must kill animals for hours on end and suffer whatever physical or psychological trauma may come.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“It is unnatural and inhumane for someone to kill for hours every day,” Susana Chavez, a former slaughterhouse worker in Mexico, &lt;a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/opinion/openforum/article/My-first-job-was-slitting-the-throats-of-chickens-17017934.php"&gt;wrote in a 2022 op-ed&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--block-placement _80slsf2 _80slsf0 duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_1agbrixl"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--media--caption xptnl10"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup xkp0cg2 xptnl12"&gt;Former slaughterhouse inspector David Magna holding Peter, a rescued pig, at Dara Farm Sanctuary in Ontario, Canada.&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;cite class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup xkp0cg2 xptnl11"&gt;David Magna&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;And as MacNair has noted, our high demand for cheap meat creates ever more trauma — trauma that is outsourced to these sacrifice populations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;And killing isn’t the only potential source of trauma. Employees can also experience physical or sexual violence from colleagues, something &lt;a href="https://inthesetimes.com/features/women_meatpacking_industry_workplace_sexual_harassment_investigation.html"&gt;some women&lt;/a&gt; in slaughterhouses &lt;a href="https://sentientmedia.org/slaughterhouse-work-exploited-labor/"&gt;have reported&lt;/a&gt;, and experience or witness severe accidents among other workers. In &lt;em&gt;The Dying Trade&lt;/em&gt;, Tom recalled a time when a coworker got stuck in a machine and was essentially cut in half: “I can still hear him screaming.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Magna, along with &lt;a href="https://www.upc-online.org/fall04/virgil.htm"&gt;many other&lt;/a&gt; former &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xSoedh_J9w"&gt;meat industry workers&lt;/a&gt; (including Chavez), has since become vegan — and an &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/the_40_yearoldvegan/?hl=en"&gt;animal rights activist&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Activism “has given me a new lease on life,” he said. “I’m fortunate; I got out of this system. For whatever reason, I’m here today doing this, and I think of the people that aren’t so lucky.” He mentioned a former coworker, Maria, who had to get carpal tunnel surgery like many other slaughterhouse workers, due to intense wrist pain from making repetitive cuts to animal carcasses. When Magna asked her why she’s still working at the plant, she told him that because she doesn’t speak English, she doesn’t have many options. She said she has to continue on to provide for her kids — that her own life doesn’t matter. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“This system,” Magna said, “oppresses everyone.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;A version of this story originally appeared in the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="/future-perfect"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Future Perfect&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; newsletter. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="/pages/future-perfect-newsletter-signup"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sign up here!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>vox.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Jun 2025 12:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikgFBVV95cUxPYVBwYUtGZkJlbXVpY0txTGdDdjdPelZma3Jtd3FZY3B3SnYwTlhsbTN2UHliWTQ5cTc0bmJuVTBVTUdDTEhhMXhGYi0waFZpMjdsU3ozWlNHcE9BSk9hY2U2ZnNhVldGZnBOeEY2RlFHZ0VqVWowNFpfYTYyUWFOTzE5RURzc08wejZvM2R0VGtjZw</guid></item><item><title>疾病预防控制中心健康咨询称，这种“持续风险”使旅行者在飞机、火车、公共交通等方面处于弱势-旅行+休闲 | CDC Health Advisory Says This 'Ongoing Risk' Leaves Travelers Vulnerable on Planes, Trains, Public Transport, and More - Travel + Leisure</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimwFBVV95cUxNNlJFd3NnelVWSThUZS02MzBCTEtYSGF3LXJvN0pWQmQ5X0xEX1Z2azVyNnd2UHZITURzcEFEcWE0SUUxYWUwVDVtNHJVS0VqTWMtR2VUMUJQUk5KbnNiQ1U0NmxmQnNnYnhwaXlwdEhZRkVxUFg5SmhfMW00Ml85dktDbjk0MHV6czlESzNTajhJYWV4dHFROUVhMA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="travelandleisure-sc-page_1-0" class="comp travelandleisure-sc-page mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block travelandleisure-sc-block-callout--summary mntl-sc-block-universal-callout--tips mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-summary callout--bordered" data-text="Key Points" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;
&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A surge of measles cases has caused the CDC to update its advisory.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The CDC recommends that travelers should get vaccinated to prevent measles before traveling internationally.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There are at least 1,088 confirmed cases of measles in the United States, according to CDC data.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A recent outbreak of measles has caused a leading health authority to update guidance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently updated its &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/level1/measles-globe" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;travel advisory&lt;/a&gt; and is encouraging international travelers to get vaccinated (or confirm their vaccination status) against the measles virus before heading abroad. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
“Measles is an ongoing risk around the world, and more international travelers are getting infected,” the CDC advisory reads. “Travelers can catch measles in many travel settings including travel hubs like airports and train stations, on public transportation like airplanes and trains, at tourist attractions, and at large, crowded events.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In response to the ongoing risk, the CDC advises all travelers going to or from an international destination to be fully vaccinated against measles. For travelers who are not yet vaccinated or unable to get vaccinated, the government agency encourages people to consult a medical professional and consider postponing their trip until the risk is assessed. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The advisory was last reviewed on May 28 by the CDC.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Denver International Airport is one site that health authorities have closely monitored as a source of several recent measles cases. At least four passengers on a recent Turkish Airlines flight reportedly caught measles, according to the &lt;a href="https://cdphe.colorado.gov/press-release/colorado-public-health-officials-release-additional-locations-for-potential-measles" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
“Public health officials are notifying members of the public of additional areas for potential measles exposures, as a result of these confirmed cases,” the Colorado advisory states. “The adults are unrelated, but were at Denver International Airport around the same time on Wednesday, May 14.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
There have been 1,088 confirmed cases of measles in the United States in 2025, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;. Ninety-six percent of the cases have been unvaccinated or whose status was unknown, and only 12 percent of cases have required hospitalization. According to &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cdc-measles-travel-warning-spread-in-airplane/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;CBS News&lt;/a&gt;, a CDC spokesperson said there have been 62 cases of measles that tie back to international travel thus far in 2025.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The virus spreads through coughing and sneezing, and can remain in the air for up to two hours, the CDC advisory states.&lt;br&gt;

Klatt discussed the study with Nadolsky while it was ongoing, and many aspects concerned him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Klatt brought up issues of undisclosed biases to the Lundquist Institute, the host of the trial, along with Dave Feldman’s “strongly vested interest” in the results of the study that was not properly disclosed, claiming he was “a conflicted party with no training in the biomedical sciences.” His email to the Institute about these issues went unanswered. “I think this study has gotten to the point of being extremely unethical,” Klatt says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;“All authors adhered to the conflicts-of-interest disclosure guidelines the journal required,” Soto-Mata says. “Our study was independently reviewed, approved, and monitored by an expert Research Ethics committee, all its recommendations were followed, and all its standards were met.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;While some researchers and physicians are tearing the study apart, or using it to show that keto can have adverse effects, Klatt doesn’t draw any strong conclusions. “People are talking past each other,” he says. Generally speaking, there are two clear camps, with one thinking the traditional lipid hypothesis holds up, and another thinking the new lipid energy model might work. Klatt puts himself in a third camp, asking: “Why are we trying to interpret this study at all?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;“I’m an editor at the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition,” Klatt says, “and I would like to believe that we would have rejected this outright without even sending it out for peer review, because it has so many obvious issues.” He is worried about people using this flawed study as proof the consensus on the risks of LDL cholesterol has been “debunked,” which it has not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;One of the study’s coauthors, Matthew Budoff, a professor of medicine at UCLA as well as an investigator at the Lundquist Institute, acknowledged in an email to WIRED that there had been “incredible scrutiny of the data on social media, which is more than expected based on my prior publications.” He noted the research team is seeking to have the paper incorporate corrections, but that this is ultimately at the discretion of the journal. A response to the Letter to the Editor from the coauthors clarifies some of the issues, he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;That reply to the Letter to the Editor &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.jacc.org/doi/10.1016/j.jacadv.2025.101862" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.jacc.org/doi/10.1016/j.jacadv.2025.101862"}' href="https://www.jacc.org/doi/10.1016/j.jacadv.2025.101862" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;has now been published&lt;/a&gt;—and reveals that the study’s data may support the conventional position on the risk of cholesterol after all. The study’s authors share that the “pooled median change” in NCPV in the participants—the rise in the type of plaque the study was set up to investigate, but which originally wasn’t explicitly quantified in the paper—was an alarming 42.8 percent. The reply goes on to state that the study’s findings were “compatible with a causal role of ApoB in atherosclerosis”—the build-up of fat in the arteries—which they’ve “acknowledged and supported in previous publications.” The letter says that not mentioning this percentage increase in NCPV “was a sincere oversight, not intentional selective reporting.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;But this concession comes after the horse has bolted. Feldman’s hypothesis is already appearing in laypeople’s research—with the keto diet having been &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9312449/"&gt;among the most Googled diets&lt;/a&gt; in recent years, and keto products a growing multibillion-dollar industry. Answering the query “What is special about Lean Mass Hyper-Responders,” ChatGPT provides the lipid energy model, Feldman’s argument against the consensus on cholesterol, among the initial explanations for why there is so much controversy and interest. There is also a &lt;em&gt;Cholesterol Code&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a data-offer-url="https://x.com/realDaveFeldman/status/1875961842885091414" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://x.com/realDaveFeldman/status/1875961842885091414"}' href="https://x.com/realDaveFeldman/status/1875961842885091414" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;documentary&lt;/a&gt; in the works—which covers Feldman’s personal experience and his research, including this study—which Feldman predicts will be available on a major streaming service sometime this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WIRED</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Jun 2025 11:18:35 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipwFBVV95cUxPZnJLZ3JGVmlxTzZQVXVFU0dDUXRXajNLTUx0YzZibmstNXpjZnZyRFdvdGpXWjZvQWhZbFA1U3c3bHpJRko2S2E1MnpTNjFHNllEYnhCQWd1aDRNRURkLS0zMmxDa2lFd2RVcThhYzloc2hvM0lFQl9VSU1mMUVzbUpxajUta0tFUTNlREdrOEZRbVZEblZGTHdwYmR5X3B6anNVZDJYWQ</guid></item><item><title>紧急健康警告，因为在美国购物中心检测到地球上最具传染性的疾病-每日邮报 | Urgent health warning as most contagious disease on Earth is detected at Mall of America - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;An urgent warning has been issued following the discovery of world's most infectious disease at America's largest shopping mall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Health officials have revealed that a child who visited the Mall of America - which is about the size of 78 football fields - in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/minnesota/index.html" id="mol-e0dbf930-4096-11f0-83cb-973ee3fa2d45"&gt;Minnesota&lt;/a&gt; on May 24 has tested positive for measles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The unvaccinated child from Dakota County, who has not traveled outside of Minnesota in the last month, visited the mall's theme park and they were infectious at the time.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People who were at the mall on May 24 between 5pm and 9pm may have been exposed as a result.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14772281/US-map-measles-MMR-vaccine-rate-study.html"&gt;The state's health department &lt;/a&gt;warned symptoms of measles - including a blotchy rash, fever and cough - could develop as late as June 14 in those who were exposed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They highlight that &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14766243/cdc-americans-cancel-flights-worlds-infectious-disease-planes.html"&gt;unvaccinated people&lt;/a&gt; are most at risk and should watch for signs of the viral disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another case of measles has also been confirmed in Minnesota but it is not &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-10924717/Measles-Minnesota-Child-hospitalized-second-isolating-home.html"&gt;said to be related.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This case involves a Washington County adult whose vaccination status is unverified. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;An urgent warning has been issued following the discovery of world's most infectious disease at America's largest shopping mall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The individual was exposed to the virus during domestic air travel outside of Minnesota and is currently recovering at home, as is the child who was infected. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These incidents bring Minnesota's confirmed measles cases up to four in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Minnesota Department of Health is now working with local health departments and other Twin Cities locations to contact those who were exposed to either case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Jessica Hancock-Allen, the infectious disease division director at MDH, says the case detected at the Mall of America is particularly concerning as there is currently 'no known source'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She explained: 'Anytime we confirm a case of measles unrelated to travel that has no known source it is worrying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This is because it could be a sign that measles is spreading in the community undetected by public health and healthcare systems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It is uncertain where the child was exposed and whether others may have been exposed.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Minnesota cases come as measles cases in the US &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-6695579/More-100-cases-measles-confirmed-nationwide-outbreak-fueled-anti-vaxxers-CDC-says.html"&gt;continue to spike&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Out of studied counties, 78 percent or 1,614 counties reported drops in MMR vaccination rates&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Currently there have been 1,088 confirmed measles cases and at least three deaths reported by 33 states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Of these cases, three-quarters are in children under the age of 19. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In an updated advisory, the CDC is warning that people can get infected with measles during travel or at crowded events, unless they are fully &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-7571481/Measles-warning-travelers-flew-Philadelphia-airport.html"&gt;vaccinated or have had the disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The notice reads: 'Travelers can catch measles in many travel settings, including travel hubs like airports and train stations, on public transportation like airplanes and trains, at tourist attractions, and at large, crowded events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Infected travelers can bring the disease back to their home communities where it can spread rapidly among people who are not immune.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The government agency recommends that all travelers be fully vaccinated against measles before traveling to an international destination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The last time measles was this rife in the US was in 2019, when there &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-6753425/How-completely-avoidable-measles-cases-continue-climb.html"&gt;were 1,274 cases reported for the entire year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Prior to that, the biggest outbreak was in 1990, with numbers spiking to more than 27,000. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Measles was officially eradicated in the US in 2000 amid a successful vaccination campaign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Cold-like symptoms, such as a fever, cough and a runny or blocked nose, are usually the first signal of measles&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At the time, the &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/centers-for-disease-control-and-prevention-cdc/index.html" id="mol-e13a1760-4099-11f0-83cb-973ee3fa2d45"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt; described achieving measles elimination status in the US as a 'historic public health achievement'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, a recent study found uptake of the vaccine among children declined in eight in 10 US counties last year, which is being &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-6063419/Measles-outbreak-sweeping-CDC-reveals.html"&gt;signaled as the cause of the measles resurgence&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Overall, vaccine rates fell three percent across the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It means that merely 91 percent of children are vaccinated against measles, which is well below the 95 percent need to prevent the disease from spreading and causing death.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Johns Hopkins University researchers warned that if vaccination rates continue to fall, measles is likely to completely return and become a common infection among Americans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;A majority of those infected as well as the all of the deceased had not received their MMR vaccine - primarily due to vaccine hesitancy and misinformation, experts say. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Without the MMR vaccine, which is 97 percent effective at stopping infections, measles is thought to be the &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14668283/major-usa-airport-red-alert-passenger-virus-chicago.html"&gt;most infectious disease in the world&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It causes tiny white spots inside the mouth, flat red spots on the neck, torso, arms, legs, and feet, ear infections and an intense fever. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In terms of when to get vaccinated, experts say children need two doses of MMR vaccine: the first dose at age 12-15 months, and the second dose at age 4-6 years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Babies ages 6-11 months should get an early dose if traveling internationally. Adults should also check to see if they are immune to measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Jun 2025 11:08:41 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>当心癌症幽灵-切割 | Beware the Cancer Ghosts - The Cut</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijgFBVV95cUxQZ2RWaVNGN2xaLVVFYm9ER0syWks2Mnh6eV9NOGxJSkxHRkVueERZQ19OVVhzNDlfdmZHNjRHazVnSFdTSlkzQ0NPWHFRWmtkMXlpWjNCUkNUUmNpNUx3ZFNQMWhnRDRmR2IxcjBCWnNkaVJGcklQeFdCbzlKOGxXWVQtSElMUXZXNFI1bGN3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="wwwthecut-zephr-anchor" class="article-content special-feature" data-editable="content"&gt;

People I considered very close might disappear altogether. They would be my “cancer ghosts.”&lt;/p&gt;

I had never known anyone my age with cancer or been close to someone going through treatment. How could I expect the people around me to know what to say or do when &lt;em&gt;I &lt;/em&gt;didn’t even know? I had no idea how to talk to someone with cancer, which questions were okay to ask, what advice (if any) to solicit. If I were my friend, I wouldn’t know what to say to me, either.&lt;/p&gt;

That my connections after cancer would remain more or less the same as they had been before. But it didn’t work; the ghosts materialized anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

Naturally, that made me feel worse. But we talked it through and moved on. Then, after all my hair was gone, that friend began drifting into the background until they disappeared entirely. &lt;em&gt;Poof!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb850ik4002f3b77ybo9kwuu@published" data-word-count="70"&gt;When he became a ghost, he also severed my connection to his world — the &lt;em&gt;collateral cancer ghosts,&lt;/em&gt; I call them&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; They were the mutual friends we shared, the ones who were more his than mine but still familiar staples in my life. His partner, whom I loved. His family, whom I had grown up with. It’s been almost two years now and I haven’t heard from that friend since.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb850n45002o3b77lyo7quon@published" data-word-count="105"&gt;Somewhere along the drift, I’d asked, “Had I done something wrong? Was there a deep-rooted issue we needed to process together?” My ghost told me it was nothing like that. They admitted the timing wasn’t great — me being in chemo and all — but said they were focusing on themselves these days and needed to be selfish and set a boundary. “I don’t owe you an explanation,” they had said. That left no room for discussion. &lt;em&gt;Wasn’t I just a bridesmaid at your wedding? &lt;/em&gt;I thought anyway. &lt;em&gt;Why was I not owed an explanation? We’ve been friends since we were 12. Also, I am bald. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb850t0j002x3b77mp9q3z0l@published" data-word-count="102"&gt;In my pursuit for answers, I reached out to other survivors to ask if they had been through something similar, if they had an explanation, a theory, anything that could be the &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; I was looking for. It wasn’t long before their stories poured in — of course they did. As Kristie Redfield, a therapist specializing in oncology and cancer survivorship, points out, the fact that there’s a name for this particular type of friendship breakup “reflects its ubiquity. I hope people enduring cancer see the term as evidence that cancer ghosting is a phenomenon, not an isolated, personal failing,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb8511nc00363b77ob34bucv@published" data-word-count="129"&gt;Emily, a young breast-cancer survivor, told me that while one of her best friends offered vague gestures of support, she never showed up in any substantial way. “I definitely made excuses for her absence, thinking that everyone handles things differently, and that I’m sure she had a reason she didn’t call or come visit,” Emily says of her ghost. Then, Emily’s chemo treatments kept her from attending her friend’s son’s birthday party. “Chemo symptoms come in cycles, and there are some days you feel great and some days you feel like crap,” she says. “I decided on one of the good days to plan a trip to Disneyland. This upset her because she didn’t understand why I could go to a theme park but not her son’s birthday party.”&lt;/p&gt;

That’s what happened to Natasha, 37, a skin- and breast-cancer survivor who lost “a close co-worker, whom I considered a friend.” The sudden drop in communication, she says, particularly stung given that they had been frontline nurses together during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. “I was saddened by the experience,” she tells me, “because as nurses, we don’t leave our people behind, as we understand the intricacies of having an illness like this.”&lt;/p&gt;

But more often, people didn’t leave with a bang. They became transparent so slowly that it was almost imperceptible, until one day, they were inexplicably gone. “The absence happened so gradually that I barely noticed at first: a missed text here, a canceled coffee there. Soon, a day became a week, a week became a month,” Trish, 35, says of a college friend who ghosted her as her breast-cancer treatment intensified.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb84zi8b000k3b77ykd9z56s@published" data-word-count="75"&gt;The heartbreak of losing friends, co-workers, and childhood besties was widely felt among the women I spoke with, but another theme also emerged: the loss of casual connections. These were the mid-tier friendships; the people they grabbed drinks with, bumped into at parties, or shared spontaneous plans with. Because cancer often demands lifestyle shifts, like &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/alcohol-cancer-risk-surgeon-general.html"&gt;cutting back on alcohol due to its link with recurrence&lt;/a&gt;, those changes can reshape how, and with whom, we connect.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb84zi9d000l3b77dj75ttht@published" data-word-count="87"&gt;Before her breast-cancer diagnosis, 37-year-old Julie worked at a restaurant where her social life revolved around the bar and nightlife scene. While her friends used to regularly invite her out to shows and parties, after cancer, the invites stopped coming. “I think we just never figured out anything else to do together after that, since I was trying to keep drinking to a minimum,” she says. “And, honestly, it feels a little lazy, because you can absolutely find things to do with people that don’t involve drinking.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb84ziav000m3b773jmvqmjj@published" data-word-count="36"&gt;Or, as Trish puts it, “Was my value tied solely to my ability to meet for mimosas or dance until dawn? Was my breast cancer simply ‘not a vibe’ for [my ghost’s] carefully curated social calendar?”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb84zic7000n3b77ckoeodgp@published" data-word-count="122"&gt;Perhaps some of these friendships simply were not what they seemed to be in the first place. Caroline, 43, now suspects that the bond between her and her ghost was never really there. She and her then-friend had bonded quickly after she had moved to the neighborhood. Caroline says their dynamic developed into “the kind of besties usually reserved for friendships forged in childhood, someone you’ve known forever.” For close to a year, they spoke multiple times a day, watched each other’s kids, and spent time with each other’s parents. They leaned on one another in emergencies. “We couldn’t believe how much we had in common and how similar we viewed the world,” says Caroline. But then Caroline was diagnosed with breast cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb852aep00483b77ixzu9e1e@published" data-word-count="64"&gt;Her friend showed up just in time for the photo ops, wearing “Team Caroline” shirts and posting supportive selfies on social media. But once Caroline’s breast-cancer treatment ended and the cameras were gone, her friend also disappeared. To Caroline, this was simply a performance of morality rather than authentic friendship: “A good word to describe how the whole experience made me feel is &lt;em&gt;disposable&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb852c95004h3b779ukf5mlr@published" data-word-count="78"&gt;When I asked Redfield why she believes cancer ghosting happens, she offered a few ideas. “It’s possible a person ghosts because they don’t know what to say or do, or they worry that what they can offer is inadequate,” she explains. “It’s also possible that a person ghosts because of fears of their own fragility and mortality — &lt;em&gt;If you can get cancer, I can get cancer &lt;/em&gt;— which may be especially pronounced when young people are diagnosed.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb852gzw004q3b77uwl0etge@published" data-word-count="161"&gt;Asha, 41, believes “it happens when people confuse their discomfort with your pain as a reason to disappear.” Natasha thinks that some people may simply not have the space to take it on: “Maybe she just did not have the capacity to be in the ‘dark’ with me. Maybe it was just too close to home for her and she couldn’t tolerate bad news.” Or maybe it’s because people are just bad at engaging in tough situations. “Society rarely equips us with tools for these difficult conversations, and my friend’s inability to face my illness created a chasm too wide to cross,” says Trish. Redfield suspects that our struggle to meaningfully engage in tough situations may stem from a cultural discomfort with openly discussing illness and death. “Showing up for another requires recognition of shared humanity and vulnerability, which many of us are encouraged to avoid in our day-to-day lives,” she says. “We might lack practice or not see it as a priority.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb852p6e004z3b778cmnn5vx@published" data-word-count="69"&gt;I worry I have cancer ghosts because cancer has changed me &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; much — that it’s made me harder to relate to, that I’ve drifted too far from the person I used to be, and that I may never fully find my way back. I skip restaurant dates because I’m not gainfully employed. Like Trish and Julie, I can’t go out drinking with my friends like I could before.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb8531xv005h3b773it4ties@published" data-word-count="102"&gt;“Finishing treatment was, in some ways, the hardest part,” Julie told me, and I knew just what she meant. We spoke about how being in active treatment (surgery, chemo, and radiation) was like having a visible disability, which made it easier in some ways. Our missing hair and eyebrows were visual markers so universally understood that even strangers gave us that hand-over-heart gesture of “knowing” we must really be going through &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt;. There was a level of compassion and understanding built in without us having to explain anything at all. There was community and people ready to surround us, no questions asked.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb852zzi00583b77iy44awz7@published" data-word-count="120"&gt;But once the hair grew back and people congratulated us for being done, they left. We were far from “done,” though. For young women like Julie and me, breast-cancer treatment involved being put into medically induced menopause for five to ten years, a jarring reality nobody had prepared us for. And unlike a highly visible bald head, our menopause symptoms were invisible, so we were left to navigate that part of the journey alone. While my friends are beginning to build their families, debating whether or not they should have kids, my reality feels worlds apart. My biggest question isn’t if I want children — it’s whether the few eggs I managed to freeze before chemotherapy could become viable embryos.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb853927005q3b77c82spees@published" data-word-count="114"&gt;I had tried to keep my bar low, thinking if I didn’t change too much, my friendships wouldn’t either. In fact, sometimes I worry that cancer didn’t change me enough — that I didn’t walk away with the profound life lessons I was supposed to, that I didn’t learn to love my body the way facing mortality &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; have taught me to. Why am I still so obsessed with my weight? Why am I still just as frugal as I was before, hesitating to burn a gifted candle because it feels like burning money? Shouldn’t I have learned to &lt;em&gt;live&lt;/em&gt; a little? But even while I do feel fundamentally the same, I &lt;em&gt;am&lt;/em&gt; different.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb84zidv000o3b77hr78ymyy@published" data-word-count="147"&gt;I now know what it’s like to face my mortality, to make impossibly difficult decisions about my body, to advocate for myself as a patient, and to navigate complex medical and insurance systems. I’ve learned just how much support and care matter during such times. I’ve also come to realize that, maybe, there were &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; going to be some people in my life who could not hold space for me in my most vulnerable moments, regardless of the height of my bar. “If someone disappears from your life because you have cancer, it speaks to their capacity, not your worthiness,” assures Redfield.&lt;br&gt;The loss of close friendships during cancer is difficult to reconcile, and I might never have clear answers as to why it happened to me. All I can do is shift my perspective to highlight the good, because there really &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; a whole lot of it.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb853fyw005z3b77simsq52g@published" data-word-count="165"&gt;There are the cancer ghosts, but there are also angels. Of course, there were friends and family who never wavered before, during, and after, and those connections have only strengthened and deepened over time. But there were also people I never would have predicted would become my pillars, who came to my side in ways that humble me still. I formed unexpected bonds with so many people, like some of my friends’ mothers — women in a more common age bracket to have gone through breast cancer and menopause themselves. Like my tax guy’s mom, for example. I was doing taxes the same week I was diagnosed, and he offered to introduce me to his mother, a breast-cancer survivor. Karen and I talked on the phone almost every day for a year despite our 30-plus-year age difference and having never met in person. These women understood me in a way few others could, and they now make up a part of my new community post-cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb853m0t00683b77f7xt1xsv@published" data-word-count="45"&gt;Now, nearly two years out from active treatment, I look at my community with a complicated kind of gratitude. The ghosts remain — some I still grieve, some I’ve made peace with — but they no longer haunt me or overshadow the ones who stayed.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb853stf006h3b77y3509hqr@published" data-word-count="53"&gt;Trish now calls cancer the “ultimate friendship filter,” separating those who could sit with discomfort from those who fled from it. Her own cancer ghost “felt like another amputation alongside my surgery,” she says. “But it cleared space in my life that has since filled with people whose compassion runs deeper than convenience.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb853ubk006q3b77fd8n4ahq@published" data-word-count="115"&gt;I know what she means. Cancer can force a reckoning that’s not easy for anybody, and those left standing with us till the end know that well.&lt;br&gt;I’ve lived through challenges most people avoid talking about or only encounter much later in life: menopause, infertility, a changing body, the loss of libido, the loss of health. We all will eventually face these things in one form or another; I just happened to confront them much earlier than expected. It has not only helped me develop a deeper, more expansive understanding of what it means to be human, but to appreciate the depth of support we will all one day need at some point in our lives.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb853yxt006z3b77ai7eqrkb@published" data-word-count="72"&gt;I would still warn anybody going through it, whatever their “it” may be, to &lt;em&gt;beware the ghosts&lt;/em&gt;. But I would also tell them to, more importantly, look out for the living who are still around. Because, in the end, a natural kind of rebalancing tends to unfold when unexpected people step up in the place of those who left. It’s what keeps us moving forward — and, sometimes, that can mean everything.&lt;/p&gt;

Stock image&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Eating fat before the carbohydrates didn't lower the blood sugar spike but did delay it from happening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This suggests that eating fibre-rich foods like vegetables, and proteins like eggs before tucking into carbohydrates could prevent rocketing blood sugar that leads to a hunger-inducing crash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Professor Michael Snyder, an expert in genetics author of the study, said diners should try to eat their meals in a specific order.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Eating carbohydrates later in a meal is still a good idea even though it has not yet been sorted out whether it is best to eat protein, fat or fibre before carbohydrates,' he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Eat your salad or hamburger before your French fries.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers also noted that the impact of fibre, protein and fat on blood sugar levels was less significant among participants with signs of pre-diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The authors, who published their findings in the journal &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1085535?"&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, said this was an area in need of further research.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Carbohydrates, a group that includes rice, potatoes, bread and pasta, are energy dense foods that are quickly converted to sugar in our blood, giving us the resources we need to function.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The NHS says carbohydrates should make up about a third of a person's daily diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Officials urge people to eat wholegrain varieties like brown bread or potatoes with the skin on as these come with higher levels of fibre and nutrients, and can slow the release of sugar in our bloodstream, maintaining fullness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Almost 6million Britons have diabetes, of which 90 per cent is type 2, but charities estimate 1.2million are living with the disease undiagnosed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While nationally, an estimated eight per cent of the population of England has the disease, this rises to &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/news/article-14472619/The-diabetes-capital-10-cent-suffer-condition-health-experts-warn-sign-worsening-obesity-crisis.html"&gt;over one in 10 people in some parts of the country&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Type 2 diabetes occurs when the body doesn't make enough insulin or the insulin it makes doesn't work properly. Insulin is a hormone critical to controlling blood sugar levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Having high blood sugar levels over time can cause heart attacks and strokes, as well as problems with the eyes, kidneys and feet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sufferers may need to overhaul their diet, take daily medication and have regular check-ups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Symptoms of the condition, which is diagnosed with a blood test, include excessive thirst, tiredness and needing to urinate more often. But many people have no signs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Jun 2025 09:33:16 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikAFBVV95cUxPTlZOWVRLR3RFZUlza21odUtPeEhxLU52NFFJN3NqU0Y3aUxRanJvZEFtTzBXN3B5ZUEyU3NOVXdiWUt4dkxwUy15WmN4LXBrbGUyaWU1N1J0LW04LUhoUkJRR3pVczF6ems1U0dGVV9MNTF1UnB1WFhLU3p0QTlBc1NUTjljR3pZVDdzR2JGdGjSAZYBQVVfeXFMTy11c2tKaUhjeURHZDdSSU04b3NqaUpHYzVuRjAtRjllN1RQazhBNXNxbXVYWWVWTVN3SVhWNWpVMmhNMEt5bmMxVnljejRzUmNhdG9VS2M2S0g2cFFJaFNaNHJwQWtieGNmNmJuM2psQXlyOXV2VUxTTzJHTGlfQjhmSjRRQ0Y4aWpia1ZUeENqUUdkbE1R</guid></item><item><title>“问题比帮助更多” ：对抗抑郁药越来越不信任的背后- Salon.com | "More problems than it was helping”: Behind the growing distrust of antidepressants - Salon.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMitAFBVV95cUxNeElRZlBHZzMzS21DT3NMMlI2WFhQamxpQWZNUlk4Tlg1RG12anlfTjhJLWwxZm9jSjlFbERYYUlnR012cGlYU0owNHQ5Z2Y3MzR2RGRNcU0tUFpQWkFITjdtelAzOVljTlNJWkJWNnR5a2RWQXUtVXV0MWRMUkhJb3NzV1NJZU9mZWlJaWo2Y0dwSXdvZmNJUUtqR2U4U1pUYzlnY0VGbUsxVU9RZ3VXdGxVYnA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article class="article-content"&gt;
								&lt;input type="hidden" id="article_url" value="2025/06/04/more-problems-than-it-was-helping-behind-the-growing-distrust-of-antidepressants/"&gt;
																	
																
								&lt;p&gt;In 2017, Julie moved to Massachusetts to start a new job in biotech. She was maintaining her relationship with her partner long distance, and starting a new position in an unknown city alone had her distressed. Her psychologist and doctor recommended she start taking the antidepressant &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2025/05/23/decades-on-ssris-remain-mired-in-mystery-and-debate_partner/" target="_blank"&gt;Prozac&lt;/a&gt; (fluoxetine) to feel better, and it helped her function — for a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then years went by, and she started to develop other symptoms. Her &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/topic/insomnia" target="_blank"&gt;insomnia&lt;/a&gt; got worse. She felt oddly detached from herself and she started to have thoughts about suicide that she had not had before. During this time, she was processing traumatic experiences from her childhood in therapy, but she felt like these symptoms were being exacerbated by Prozac. So in 2022, Julie started tapering off of her medication after talking with her primary care doctor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I just continued taking it, sort of without questioning,” Julie, who is using a pseudonym to protect her privacy, told Salon in a phone interview. “I came to believe that Prozac was causing more problems than it was helping.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Antidepressants like Prozac were a major breakthrough in psychiatry when they were first marketed in the 1980s. However, their use has become so widespread in the U.S. that some argue they are now being overprescribed. In fact, an entire internet subculture has developed to help people get off of their antidepressants, which doctors warn can be dangerous if not performed under the medical supervision of a health care provider. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/02/establishing-the-presidents-make-america-healthy-again-commission/"&gt;executive order&lt;/a&gt; issued in February, President Donald Trump said the administration would “assess the prevalence of and threat posed by the prescription of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors,” referring to SSRIs, a common class of antidepressants and other psychiatric medications. During his testimony at the Senate Finance Committee, secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. also said that antidepressants were &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3O4z_UbxlY"&gt;harder to get off than heroin&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="right_quote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"At the same time we have people overtreated, we also have people who are untreated."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antidepressants can be &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2012/06/hey-lets-not-get-carried-away-anti-depressants-really-do-help-people/257976/"&gt;life-saving&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/i-was-wary-of-antidepressants-but-they-helped-when-nothing-else-could"&gt;life-enhancing&lt;/a&gt; for many people, but for most people with mild or moderate forms of depression they are not intended for long-term use. The drugs can also carry side effects that can significantly impact a person’s quality of life, including weight gain, sexual dysfunction and &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28628765/"&gt;emotional blunting&lt;/a&gt;, in which people feel fewer positive emotions along with negative ones. While Kennedy is wrong — antidepressants are not harder to stop using than heroin — the withdrawal process can come with its own side effects as well, which some &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/may/30/antidepressant-withdrawal-symptoms-doctors-side-effects"&gt;argue&lt;/a&gt; is an underrecognized problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These are very individualized things,” said Dr. Mark Olfson, a psychiatrist at Columbia University. “There is no one-size-fits-all in terms of how people make trade offs between the burdens of staying on the medication versus the protection the medication offers some individuals.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most commonly used antidepressants today are SSRIs like Prozac, which came on the market in 1988. In the decades that followed, the prevalence of SSRI prescriptions continued to increase year over year to a climax in the pandemic when the proportion of the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/covid19/pulse/mental-health-care.htm"&gt;U.S. population taking antidepressants approached 25%&lt;/a&gt;. This more than &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3162179/"&gt;tripled the proportion of people on them in 1990&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depression has also increased over the years, or at least has been detected in more people. Yet the proportion of the population with depression remains lower than the proportion on antidepressants, in part because these medications are also commonly prescribed for other conditions like obsessive-compulsive disorder, eating disorders, insomnia and anxiety — which has also &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32905958/"&gt;increased in the U.S. in recent decades&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, some believe they are inappropriately prescribed for too long, or in cases when lifestyle changes or psychotherapy should be tried first. However, many people with depression and severe anxiety who could benefit with antidepressants are also not getting the help they need, Olfson said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I do think there was and maybe still is overprescription,” he told Salon in a phone interview. “But at the same time we have people overtreated, we also have people who are untreated.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although antidepressant use is still on the rise, a &lt;a href="https://psychiatryonline.org/doi/10.1176/appi.ajp.20240492"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; Olfson co-authored last month found that, for the first time since these drugs were introduced, the use of psychotherapy increased at a higher rate than medication alone. This may in part be due to the increased availability of telehealth counseling, he explained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It's still the case that most people with depression or anxiety who receive treatment receive antidepressants, but in the last few years, a rising proportion of them are receiving psychotherapy and the growth of psychotherapy has occurred more quickly than the growth of antidepressants,” Olfson said. “This change is coming after years and years of medications just sort of dominating mental health care in America.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, psychotherapy remains steeped in stigma and inaccessible to many. This may be one reason that antidepressants are prescribed when other strategies could work as well. Sometimes a person’s only point of contact with a medical professional who could help them with depression is their family doctor, who could refer them to a psychologist. But if they are not available or too expensive, patients are left with few options other than antidepressants, explained Dr. Awais Aftab, a psychiatrist at Case Western Reserve University, who said we often end up using antidepressants “as a matter of structural convenience."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“However, if you look at the &lt;a href="https://www.apa.org/depression-guideline/guideline.pdf"&gt;practice guidelines&lt;/a&gt;, they recommend that for mild to moderate depression, it is better to start with psychotherapy and lifestyle change and reserve antidepressants for cases of mild to moderate depression that are not getting better or those of more severe intensity,” Aftab told Salon in a phone interview.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Julie struggled to find an affordable psychiatrist in her area that could help guide her through the process of getting on antidepressants back in 2017. Her primary care doctor ended up overseeing her prescription, but once she got on Prozac, they didn’t really discuss it anymore, she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aftab said this can happen often: “They just put people on antidepressants and then they kind of forget about it and it just keeps getting refilled,” he said. Then, the discussion about whether the medication is working or if they need to stay on it "doesn't really happen,” he explained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the problem with staying on antidepressants longer than necessary is that &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39394455/"&gt;withdrawal symptoms can be more difficult the longer you stay on them&lt;/a&gt;. If someone is stopping antidepressants, it's recommended to wean off them slowly and under medical supervision because doing so too quickly and without the right dosage can be dangerous. It can lead to side effects such as a symptom called "brain zap" in which patients feel sudden shocks in their head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depending on a range of factors including the dosage and medication, it can take months or more. Julie did it in eight weeks, but she experienced symptoms that were worse than the original depression she felt, she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My biggest symptom after that was extreme anhedonia, like a feeling of not being myself or getting pleasure from anything — almost not feeling human,” she said. “Along with extreme physical fatigue, both of those symptoms lasted for about two years.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="left_quote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The evidence for the serotonin theory of depression was weak and inconsistent but the general public thought it wasn't just a theory."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes the withdrawal from antidepressants can be mistaken for the return of the original depression it was intended to treat. This could lead some people to go back on medication, if the feeling is so uncomfortable that being on the medication ends up providing relief, Aftab said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, there is &lt;a href="https://karger.com/pps/article/94/1/3/916620/Hidden-Costs-The-Clinical-and-Research-Pitfalls-of"&gt;relatively limited research&lt;/a&gt; exploring the right protocol to get off of antidepressants and how to avoid the symptoms of withdrawal, Aftab said. There is even still much debate about what causes depression in the first place. In 1967, an English psychiatrist named Alec Coppen proposed the &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-022-01661-0"&gt;“serotonin theory,”&lt;/a&gt; suggesting a chemical imbalance of serotonin in the brain caused depression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response, the pharmaceutical industry developed Prozac, the first SSRI. However, in the decades that followed, some &lt;a href="http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/view/exploring-the-star-d-controversy" target="_blank"&gt;questions were raised about the trials&lt;/a&gt; used to demonstrate the effectiveness of SSRIs. Around the same time, researchers started to question the serotonin theory that had been publicized as a potential cause of depression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joanna Moncrieff, a professor of critical and social psychiatry at University College London, co-authored a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-022-01661-0"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; in Nature in 2022 that concluded there was “no consistent evidence of there being an association between serotonin and depression.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We can’t conclude that depression is related to serotonin abnormality,” Moncrieff told Salon in a phone interview. “The evidence for the serotonin theory of depression was weak and inconsistent but the general public thought it wasn't just a theory: They thought it was an established scientific fact.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moncrieff’s paper received significant backlash, with five responses published in the journal along with a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-023-02095-y"&gt;comment&lt;/a&gt; authored by 35 academics that challenged Moncreiff’s findings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s likely that the cause of depression is far more complex than something operating on a single neurotransmitter like serotonin, said Philip Cowen, a professor of psychopharmacology at the University of Oxford and one of the co-authors on the comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, that doesn't mean these drugs don't help people. For one, it's common for medications to not target the direct cause of illness. Instead, many are designed to alleviate symptoms and suffering, Cowen explained. For example, asthma inhalers activate receptors, which relax the airways to help facilitate breathing. This helps with asthma symptoms but does not treat the direct cause of asthma, which is ultimately an allergic reaction. A similar thing may be happening with antidepressants, Cowen said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“[The serotonin theory] is a simplistic view and it can't be right,” Cowen told Salon in a phone interview. “Taking SSRIs might make you feel better for various psychological reasons, but it doesn't necessarily mean it's working on a fundamental problem with serotonin.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although these medicines are still not fully understood, the fact remains that antidepressants do help many people feel better. Yet the back and forth within the medical community about the efficacy of antidepressants and the cause of depression might be &lt;a href="https://aeon.co/essays/why-the-constant-trashing-of-antidepressants-is-absurd" target="_blank"&gt;why some have grown to mistrust them&lt;/a&gt;. Other &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/jun/08/antidepressants-addictive-has-been-debunked-psychiatry-depression-withhdrawal-symptoms"&gt;false claims in the media and some scientific papers&lt;/a&gt; have stated that antidepressants can be addictive like alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add on misleading criticisms from the White House, and more people are likely to get off of them, said Rifaat El-Mallakh, a psychiatrist who leads the Mood Disorders Research Program at the University of Louisville Depression Center. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When you have your leaders saying things like, 'it's harder to get off an antidepressant than it is to get off heroin,' you say, ‘Oh my god, I better get off now before I'm stuck on this forever,’” El-Mallakh told Salon in a phone interview.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As distrust grows and it remains challenging for many people to access psychotherapy or medical treatment, many are seeking advice online. In fact, there is an entire &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/17/health/laura-delano-psychiatric-meds.html"&gt;subculture online&lt;/a&gt; where people talk about getting off of their psychiatric medications. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Julie did talk with her primary care doctor about getting off her medication, she felt there were more resources on the internet, she said. As she explained: “Most of the support I got through that process was just through online forums.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the difficulty of the withdrawal process, Julie has been tempted to go back on them again during challenging parts of her life. If she is ever in a place where she feels like her own safety is threatened by her mental health, she would consider it, she said. At the same time, she questions whether she actually needed them in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I wish we had a different culture in the medical care community around recommending antidepressants,” she said. “If they were treated more as a last resort, then maybe I would have made a different choice.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, Julie feels more stable these days and developed strategies in the process of the antidepressant withdrawal that help her move through challenging moments, she said. Some of her symptoms, like problems with her libido, have not fully recovered. But she has started exercising again and feels like her body is more responsive to lifestyle changes she implements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think getting better is now a bit more under my control,” she said. “So there is potential for things to keep improving.”&lt;/p&gt;

Seminole’s outbreak didn’t deter the group, which &lt;a href="https://x.com/ChildrensHD/status/1892697323580592382" target="_blank"&gt;wrongly&lt;/a&gt; suggested it had been caused by a local vaccination campaign and then &lt;a href="https://x.com/ChildrensHD/status/1894036984814883242" target="_blank"&gt;floated other&lt;/a&gt; contradictory theories: that the vaccines were failing, shedding the measles virus, or perhaps working too well, leading somehow to a super virulent strain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Myrick watched her neighbors repeat these distortions in a local Facebook group, “Seminole TX Residents NEED to KNOW,” sometimes naming her directly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“Every doctor that pushes the jabs gets commission from the big Pharma,” one woman wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;In late February, the Gaines County library posted a flyer “kindly” asking that unvaccinated and measles-sick patrons not come in.

Run on about $2 million in grants a year, the health department’s responsibilities are broad — vaccines and family planning, but also disaster response, fire protection, food safety, landfills, inspections, permits and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Holbrooks didn’t see measles coming, though he is quick to say he probably should have — vaccine exemptions in Gaines County had more than doubled in the last 10 years, and about 1 in 5 kindergarteners were now skipping the shots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;When the first cases were confirmed at the end of January, “my heart sank,” Holbrooks said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The district kept only a couple of doses of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccines on hand — enough for new families moving into the area, not to meet the sudden need of an outbreak. The two epidemiologists Holbrooks had on staff were immediately overwhelmed by case investigations. Holbrooks also didn’t have outreach materials in Low German or a relationship with the Mennonite community, which he now urgently needed a way into.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;He turned to the state, which brought in nurses, testing supplies and vaccines. He set up a vaccine and testing clinic outside Seminole Hospital District; a spray-painted arrow on unfinished plywood signaled where to go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Jun 2025 09:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipwFBVV95cUxQTkZhclNBRFVWU3lzTGV3STFVVV9DRGJENzVhQ3k4SnZnbWs2bm9FY2puSFlsMVo2OXFXTGZkbS1NakxWci1ZbVFmdjBQVWNTenFqV1VueFdVR1kxMWdraTVqVGJPMFdPbG1Ed1VOSDJIaDBaTzdvckNxTElDczk0QXBaNi1EU0lrVzM4cWtRbEhLODhDLUdvSWQ1ZEJlZlFvb2oxeXNfONIBVkFVX3lxTFB4V1dON2V1Q3Z6aFp2UmV6Z3ViWnhVUXV1ZjdJTXA0UHRlMEtkT1NYd1JKR0JfLThXekRkVE8zOHpfNFZRZG1DdFE0d0tBeFNJRXVNa0RR</guid></item><item><title>科学家发现有前途的新型阿尔茨海默氏症治疗方法- SciTechDaily | Scientists Discover Promising New Alzheimer’s Treatment - SciTechDaily</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihwFBVV95cUxOdk1VZ254bjAycUVXeVpBMTBwUXdWWmxYcGZrbzFxQ2ZQelJXNzdDSmIxQng5YjN3MVQ1cGFTNWVDM2dMUjJTbDhfOV80SlMtSmZBTzc1ZFpWeTQzc05FVm0wZ2liV25DS2QxSXdhRzNyU3d3c2RDcG9VeGNDT0UySlZIaVpOTW8?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SciTechDaily</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Jun 2025 08:41:53 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihwFBVV95cUxOdk1VZ254bjAycUVXeVpBMTBwUXdWWmxYcGZrbzFxQ2ZQelJXNzdDSmIxQng5YjN3MVQ1cGFTNWVDM2dMUjJTbDhfOV80SlMtSmZBTzc1ZFpWeTQzc05FVm0wZ2liV25DS2QxSXdhRzNyU3d3c2RDcG9VeGNDT0UySlZIaVpOTW8</guid></item><item><title>拆除疾病预防控制中心的慢性病中心对公共卫生专家来说“看起来相当具有破坏性” - statnews.com | Dismantling CDC’s chronic disease center ‘looks pretty devastating’ to public health experts - statnews.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiwwFBVV95cUxNNEtNOGtHcjEwenFSS1lFMk1NMXA0UzJ3ZEQwV3p2MWVpVkdUUDRqbHJPdnVGeUEyUkh1dzd1NTEyeVBsY19nc2pSM3lHVGdvMzR6T21iMEZzQXhYQjVpSEJwOXBFVTVuc3drZGNydV9aMjZIbURJUzVKQURxbi12bUE0dkNJNHpBVWRvdWc3ZDlYMW5MSER1MGlrVy03ZXMtb3d4Q1EzYkpROGZSR2Z1MGN0RFpTaHlNQm1ISjNEakI0N1U?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content the-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-flow wp-block-post-content-is-layout-flow"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chronic disease isn’t going away, but a national center devoted to its prevention may be, a prospect that is alarming agency insiders and public health officials across the country.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Department of Health and Human Services’ &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/fy-2026-budget-in-brief.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;budget for 2026&lt;/a&gt;, released Friday, proposed $14 billion in discretionary funding for programs that aim to reverse the &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/05/20/kennedy-maha-commission-report-chronic-disease-new-data-how-to-prioritize/"&gt;chronic disease epidemic&lt;/a&gt;, but it would also abolish the CDC’s National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If this center is eliminated, state and local departments lose core prevention funds. And they lose the workforce for schools, chronic disease prevention, data collection, surveillance systems,” a senior official at the CDC chronic disease center told STAT on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution. “If folks care about kids, schools rely on this.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Federal health leaders want to fold the chronic disease center into the Administration for a Healthy America, a new entity within HHS that will also bring other centers under its umbrella: the Health Resources and Services Administration, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health, and the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences. The proposal asserts these moves will strengthen the response to chronic illness.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“AHA will administer $14.0 billion in discretionary funding for programs that aim to reverse the chronic disease epidemic,” the proposal reads. “It will prioritize prevention — a missing piece in the American health system — primary care, maternal and child health, mental health, substance use prevention and treatment, environmental health, HIV/AIDS, workforce development, and policy, research, and oversight.”&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;That leaves the current chronic disease center in limbo, its budget diminished, its &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/04/01/cdc-rif-2400-layoffs-rfk-jr-hhs-reorganization-rapid-response-capability-weakened/"&gt;workforce&lt;/a&gt; disbanded by &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/04/11/hhs-layoffs-analysis-health-impact-nih-cuts-cdc-rif-fda-reduction-in-force/"&gt;layoffs&lt;/a&gt; contested in court, and its location to be determined as its surviving programs are scattered. The president’s funding requests tend to undergo big changes before Congress passes a budget, but for now, public health experts are expressing puzzlement about how this proposal might harmonize with health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/05/22/rfk-jr-maha-commission-report-key-takeaways-ultraprocessed-foods-environmental-toxins-overmedicalization/"&gt;Make America Healthy Again agenda&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It looks pretty devastating for chronic disease when they’re saying that they’re really interested in prioritizing chronic disease,” Philip Huang, a physician and director of Dallas County Health and Human Services, told STAT. “And then that MAHA report that came out — I mean, it’s a very limited agenda that they’re talking about in terms of how to address chronic disease.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Moving prevention to AHA may give rise to more problems than it solves, Adriane Casalotti, chief of government and public affairs for the National Association of County and City Health Officials, told STAT. Part of that is uncertainty about which programs may survive.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“That other agency does not exist right now,” she said. “You’re not just shifting the work. That would be something that has to get built up. So we’re losing the people who do the work right now. We don’t really know where the programs would pop up again when, and who will do the work.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A spokesperson from HHS defended the decision, saying complex, duplicative health programs have led to fragmented efforts that dilute taxpayer resources and their impact on Americans. Some CDC programs will continue under AHA, the message emailed Tuesday also said, adding, “We must end this wasteful and inefficient model of health programming in favor of strategic, coordinated approaches. The creation of AHA does not eliminate priorities or functions; instead, it unites previously independent programs to work together to Make America Healthy Again.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Not visible on the AHA agenda: the CDC’s program to encourage smoking cessation, which has already &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/04/14/cdc-closing-office-smoking-health-called-gift-to-big-tobacco-by-former-osh-director/"&gt;fallen to the budget ax&lt;/a&gt;, a decision that makes no sense to Huang, who, years ago in his role as chronic disease director for Texas, traveled the state to urge restaurants to go smoke-free. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“For them to have eliminated the Office on Smoking and Health is absolutely insane if you say you’re trying to address chronic disease,” he said. Among preventable causes of chronic disease, “tobacco is the most blatant.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The CDC official also called smoking cessation one of public health’s most effective interventions, “like smallpox elimination for chronic disease.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A new generation of young people, exposed to pitches selling e-cigarettes and tobacco pouches, might hear messages only from advertisers and not campaigns foundational to preventing heart disease, stroke, and cancer, the CDC official added. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Huang was struck by Kennedy’s answer when asked to name the leading preventable cause of death among Americans. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“What he’s saying are the primary drivers of chronic disease are ultra-processed foods, environmental toxins, technology, and medications, including vaccines,” Huang said. “They may be factors, but we know a lot of what causes these chronic diseases. Tobacco is the No. 1 preventable cause of disease, and he couldn’t even identify that during his hearing.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Conservative voices have been &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/03/11/cdc-dismantle-trump-administration-00146035" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;calling for the CDC&lt;/a&gt; to return to its roots, narrowing its scope to infectious diseases like the one that inspired its creation and its location in the southeastern United States: malaria.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Since its founding in 1946, the CDC’s expertise and activities have grown deeper and wider, as the “prevention” in its name implies, to include a multitude of diseases, studying their origin, treatment, prevention, and prevalence. The agency’s knowledge, standards, and investigations are shared around the world and in all U.S. states and territories.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The list of noncommunicable diseases is long, including cancer, heart disease, diabetes, maternal mortality, obesity, mental illness, epilepsy, and dementia. So is the tally of causes in addition to tobacco: high blood pressure, unhealthy diet, limited physical activity, poor access to cancer screening. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If the CDC’s footprint shrinks to communicable disease outbreaks, the chronic disease center’s program will be splintered. The pain would be felt far from headquarters in Atlanta, the CDC official said. That’s because 80% of the dollars funding the center at CDC now flow to state, territorial, and local health departments.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Prevention as a whole is being deprioritized, so that will put pressure on clinics in the health care delivery system to do what they’re not doing now: prevention outside the clinic, in neighborhoods, to prevent heart disease, diabetes, cancer.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The budget plan would provide $500 million “to tackle priority activities to Make America Healthy Again,” of which $260 million would fight chronic illness by addressing nutrition and environmental impacts.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That would include $119 million for a new Prevention Innovation Program, which the proposal said would improve the health of Americans through reliable broadband technology integration, “ensuring access to nutrition services and physical activity venues, and reducing dependence on medication.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A May 22 &lt;a href="https://www.warnock.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/FY26-CDC-Approps-Letter-_Final-Signed.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;letter from 29 U.S. senators&lt;/a&gt; in response to President Trump’s budget proposal urged lawmakers to protect robust funding for the CDC as a whole while singling out its chronic disease center.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The elimination of the CDC’s chronic disease prevention office also contradicts the Administration’s stated goal of addressing the chronic disease epidemic in our country,” the letter said. “These cuts will not make Americans healthy.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One of the national center’s major roles is to provide the comprehensive data collection and analysis to public health departments across the country, a division of labor that allows small staffs to do more.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Jason Orcena, public health commissioner for Union County, Ohio, said there’s a valuable synergy between the CDC and his office, which serves 70,000 people in a county that includes both suburban and rural areas with differing health needs. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;“There’s a heavy reliance on those national surveillance tools to help frame the work we do locally as part of our local community health assessments and community health improvement plan,” he said. “That’s one of the things the center and CDC in general does and the state does as well. We rely on them through that economy of scale to have truly experts in these areas because I can’t afford to have someone be an expert in all things.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Asked what disease or condition concerns him the most, Orcena said, “the one I don’t know about yet.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association, pointed out that there are 3,300 departments across the country, some with hundreds of employees and some with just two.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We’re the gap filler for people to make sure that even within the traditional medical system, things don’t fall through the cracks,” he said about individual public health systems. “If you start seeing a new cancer developing, that’s going to be picked up by the chronic disease center.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Case in point: HIV was initially recognized after a rare cancer related to the infection began showing up in men who had sex with men, later linked to the disease that became an epidemic. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This is the division that’s going to figure that out. It’s not NIH,” Benjamin said about the chronic disease center at CDC. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the state and local level, public health officials are facing confusing messages on funding for individual projects. Earlier this year they weathered the &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/04/01/hhs-layoffs-local-officials-react-rif-impacts-public-health/"&gt;loss of money to pay for Covid-19 programs,&lt;/a&gt; many of which had pivoted to cover health needs beyond Covid. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Because chronic disease has long been underfunded and underappreciated, partnerships between local health departments and a national system is crucial, NACCHO’s Casalotti said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Bringing all these parts together could move us towards a place so we can focus more on these diseases,” she said. “Right now, what they’re seeing and experiencing is actually pulling back from this work, not necessarily pushing it forward. And so I think that’s where the field needs to go: We need to be pushing forward together.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;STAT’s coverage of chronic health issues is supported by a grant from &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg Philanthropies&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. Our &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/supporters/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;financial supporters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; are not involved in any decisions about our journalism.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

But I still do it. Quite a bit, actually. I can quickly get lost in thought while vacuuming or walking to the grocery store, and those thoughts can lead to new ideas or weird musings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-wbgwfj"&gt;Sometimes, I miss my subway stop. But on the whole, daydreaming &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/04/well/mind/daydreaming-benefits-brain.html"&gt;is a positive thing&lt;/a&gt;, a portal to more happiness and innovative thinking. We could probably be getting more out of it, though, said Madeleine Gross, a research scientist at the University of California, Santa Barbara, who studies curiosity and creativity. “Our minds wander for a substantial portion of the day, and we’re often passive passengers,” she said. “That feels like a missed opportunity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-wbgwfj"&gt;People who are inherently creative &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10400419.2022.2120286?src=recsys"&gt;tend to daydream more&lt;/a&gt;. Higher rates of daydreaming go hand in hand with performing well on divergent thinking tasks, Dr. Gross said. (Remember the circle activity from &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/well/creativity-drawing-art.html"&gt;Day 1&lt;/a&gt;?)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-wbgwfj"&gt;But it works both ways. “Daydreaming can also make you more creative,” she said. The key is following a few rules. That might sound nuts — it’s daydreaming! — but think about how often your mind wanders right to your stressful to-do list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-wbgwfj"&gt;Dr. Gross encourages what she calls “intentional daydreaming,” which is nothing more than doing it purposefully, with a few preparations to set you up for success. In the best-case scenario, it can lead to a eureka moment that gets you past a sticking point in your life or work. &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/human-neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2014.00215/full"&gt;Research shows&lt;/a&gt; that taking time away from a problem to let your thoughts “incubate” in the background can prompt surprising solutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-wbgwfj"&gt;But more broadly, intentional daydreaming helps to make you more curious. “Curious people tend to enjoy their daydreaming more,” she said. “They have more engaging, more meaningful and more novel thoughts.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-wbgwfj"&gt;Ready for your next exercise?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="g-wrapper  svelte-dk6paf g-needs-margin-block"&gt;   &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/section&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The New York Times</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Jun 2025 02:35:25 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimgFBVV95cUxOOVY3RG9qMW9WcXRGTTF0OWp6a3JqM1hId0p6SnV3bG5vekVYTzBVMm1RalhWN09STnJ0YXU0YWhLLTVpOHBYbXZHc0dGeU1fcEY3dG5LVE9ocEN1VGFzeVR4XzROcm8wd2M1VmdseTQyeU1PaGsxbi1ZcGY1eHIxalJMNlJkU3FSNHoyUGZCSUpDZjdUOU94YTJB</guid></item><item><title>定期锻炼可将结肠癌死亡率降低37% ，研究发现- ScienceAlert | Regular Exercise Reduces Death From Colon Cancer by 37%, Study Finds - ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimwFBVV95cUxPb2VYdGJaSHY1OWtqSG1VdnNqWG9sMkFvSS1KVDlxTFkzbkhYRjlxTFY3TUlWcXM5Qzh1V3V2ZzBqLXZLYnFkVXlpdnVjeEZ4dW1YUkZtUzNJSTNNakMzRkJ1UDNVbnUzMWNqWmJVU2tXbml5NGp1ek9OQUxjSEY3U3F1WEs4RV9lNzBqM3lKbl92Ymk0SE5PNkFvVQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;New evidence has linked physical activity with improved colon health, underscoring the &lt;a href="https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/coping/physically/exercise-guidelines"&gt;vital role of exercise&lt;/a&gt; in  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="163578" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; prevention and care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The landmark international trial – the Challenge study – showed that structured exercise programmes can dramatically improve survival rates for colon cancer survivors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study was unveiled at the meeting of the &lt;a href="https://www.asco.org/annual-meeting"&gt;American Society of Clinical Oncology&lt;/a&gt;. Each June, cancer specialists from around the world convene in Chicago for the conference where new research is announced that pushes the boundaries of cancer treatment and this year's conference featured a wealth of exciting discoveries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conducted across six countries and published in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2502760"&gt;New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, the Challenge study tracked 889 patients for several years following chemotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants were randomly assigned to one of two groups: one received standard post-treatment care, while the other took part in a three-year coaching programme that included personalised exercise plans and regular check-ins with fitness professionals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results were striking. Those in the exercise group experienced 28% fewer cancer recurrences and 37% fewer deaths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the programme, people slowly built up how much they exercised, with most choosing to go on brisk 45-minute walks four times a week. Ninety per cent of the people who exercised stayed cancer free for five years, compared with just 74% of those who didn't.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study provides the first strong evidence that exercise not only correlates with better outcomes but directly improves survival rates in cancer patients. While &lt;a href="https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/early/2025/04/22/bjsports-2024-109392"&gt;earlier observational studies&lt;/a&gt; found a link between being active and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9454950/"&gt;better cancer outcomes&lt;/a&gt;, this first randomised controlled trial helps show causation, meaning that exercise can directly benefit the survival of cancer patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don't know yet if the same goes for other cancers like breast, prostate or lung, but it's a big step forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The programme's success hinged on consistent support. Participants met with fitness coaches every two weeks at first, then monthly, which helped them stick to their routines even after treatment ended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While minor injuries such as muscle strains were slightly more common among those who exercised (19% compared to 12% in the control group), researchers emphasised that these issues were manageable and far outweighed by the significant survival benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Potential downsides to exercise?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast to the encouraging findings on structured exercise, a separate study presented in Chicago has &lt;a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-14768309/colon-cancer-running-asco-2025.html"&gt;raised questions&lt;/a&gt; about the potential downsides of extreme endurance training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers tracking marathon runners found a higher rate of polyps (small growths in the colon that can sometimes develop into cancer) compared with the general population. This unexpected finding has sparked a fresh debate about the effect of high-intensity exercise on long-term colon health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, context is needed. The study did not find higher cancer rates among runners, and most of the detected polyps were low risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_163587" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-163587" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/marathon_642.jpg" alt="marathon runner" class="wp-image-163587 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/marathon_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/marathon_642-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/marathon_642-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-163587" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Marathon runners are found with more polyps, but the reasons might be complicated. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MAEJL_wthPo/"&gt;vgajic/Getty Images Signature/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several possible explanations have been offered: endurance athletes may simply undergo more frequent screenings, leading to increased detection, or intense exercise might temporarily raise inflammation markers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crucially, the overall risk of cancer remains lower in active people than in those who are more sedentary, reinforcing the well-established protective benefits of regular exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This apparent contradiction highlights the medical community's evolving understanding of the "dose" of physical activity. While moderate exercise is consistently linked to &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/obesity/physical-activity-fact-sheet"&gt;significant health benefits&lt;/a&gt;, emerging data from endurance athletes suggests that extreme, high-intensity training may place different kinds of stress on the body's systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers also suggest that factors such as dehydration during long-distance runs, changes in gut function, or the use of certain nutritional supplements common among endurance athletes could play a role in polyp development. These findings don't diminish the well-documented benefits of physical activity, but instead point to the importance of personalised, balanced health strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For cancer survivors, the structured exercise study provides a message of practical hope. Participants aimed for the equivalent of about three hours of brisk walking per week, gradually increasing their activity levels over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The programme's social support was key, with fitness coaches helping participants tailor their routines to match their abilities and recovery needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exercise is believed to &lt;a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/health-and-wellbeing/cancer-exercise-treatment-study-b2762054.html"&gt;affect key biological processes&lt;/a&gt; – including insulin sensitivity, inflammation and immune function – that &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/colon-cancer-survival-rates-exercise-study/"&gt;play important roles&lt;/a&gt; in cancer development and progression. Ongoing research is analysing participants' blood samples to better understand these mechanisms and eventually create personalised exercise "prescriptions" based on an individual's genetic profile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the findings from marathon runners are less conclusive, they still offer practical takeaways. The research suggests that although vigorous exercise is generally beneficial, high-intensity athletes may face a higher risk of developing polyps and should therefore consider regular colonoscopies as a precaution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the general public, these findings reinforce that combining moderate exercise with timely screenings offers the best protection against colon cancer, a disease that remains the fourth most common worldwide and is &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/colon-cancer-rates-are-rising-among-young-people-could-changes-to-childrens-gut-bacteria-explain-why-255176"&gt;alarmingly increasing among young people&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For both patients and athletes, these findings highlight a central truth: movement matters, but the right approach is crucial. Colon cancer survivors now have proven tools to reduce recurrence through structured exercise, while endurance enthusiasts gain motivation to pair their training with preventative care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As science continues unravelling the intricate dance between activity and biology, one message remains clear: whether recovering from illness or chasing personal bests, informed exercise combined with medical guidance is the most reliable path to long-term health.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/257983/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They’re pumping protein — and guzzling sugar bombs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Fairlife’s Core Power protein shakes — beloved by fitness fanatics and &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/06/03/health/drugs-like-ozempic-can-affect-your-fertility-dietitian-warns/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Ozempic users&lt;/a&gt; alike — have just been crowned the unhealthiest bottled beverage in America, despite their muscle-boosting reputation, according to &lt;a href="https://www.eatthis.com/unhealthiest-bottled-drinks-ranked/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Eat This, Not That!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Shakes like these are a “great way to start the day without having to sit down and have a full breakfast,” gushed Elise Ramer, a 42-year-old PR pro in Florida, &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/06/22/us-news/ozempic-mounjaro-users-drink-protein-shakes-to-beef-up-muscles/"&gt;previously reported&lt;/a&gt; on by The Post. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ramer said she puts Core Power in her coffee while taking the &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/05/22/health/fda-cracking-down-on-ozempic-copycats-potentially-slimming-options-for-consumers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;weight-loss drug Mounjaro&lt;/a&gt; — since users need to focus on their protein intake due to the possible muscle loss side effect. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But nutrition experts are throwing a red flag on the play.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I put these first [as the unhealthiest bottled drink in the U.S.] because they are so highly marketed as a great source of protein and a healthy food when in reality they are a disaster to your metabolic health,” registered dietitian Mary Sabat recently told Eat This, Not That!&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Experts warn that protein shakes — a hit with many Ozempic users (above) — are hyped as health drinks but are actually a metabolic meltdown in a bottle. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;myskin – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Core Power protein shakes may seem like a convenient post-workout drink, but a closer look at the ingredients reveals several health concerns.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The shakes are made by Fairlife, owned by Coca-Cola, and boast up to 42 grams of protein per bottle — but that muscle comes with a side of controversy. According to Sabat, it’s &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/11/12/health/what-ozempic-like-drugs-may-treat-beyond-obesity-diabetes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;not just about sugar.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“They use non-organic, conventional dairy, which often comes from cows fed GMO corn and soy and may contain residues of hormones and antibiotics — unlike grass-fed dairy, which is higher in omega-3s and CLA and free from harmful residues,” she told the outlet.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The addition of carrageenan, a thickening agent linked to gut inflammation and irritation, further detracts from its health profile.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sabat also slammed the inclusion of artificial sweeteners like sucralose and acesulfame potassium, warning they’ve been “associated with gut microbiome disruption and potential carcinogenic effects in animal studies.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The shakes, churned out by Coca-Cola-owned Fairlife, pack a whopping 42 grams of protein — but that muscle boost comes with a side of scandal. And it’s not just sugar, warns Sabat. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Jammy Jean – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She added, “Lastly, the label includes ‘natural flavors,’ a term that can encompass up to 100 different undisclosed chemical additives, many of which are far from natural. Together, these ingredients make Core Power far less healthy than its marketing implies.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That hasn’t stopped the protein craze. Thanks to the Ozempic effect, these shakes are flying off shelves faster than a gym bro’s tank top.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sales of protein and meal-replacement drinks surged 11.1% to a whopping $4.7 billion last year — and it’s the Ozempic army leading the charge, retail tracker SPINS revealed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As The Post previously reported, Rila Global Consulting found 13% of those on GLP-1 drugs like Ozempic and Mounjaro had consumed protein shakes in the past two years.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;But some experts warn that overloading on protein — especially the highly processed kind — can backfire.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;As The Post previously reported, 13% of Ozempic and Mounjaro users have chugged protein shakes in the past two years, according to Rila Global Consulting. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Tobias Arhelger – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dr. Joseph Antoun, CEO of longevity company L-Nutra, &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/05/28/health/how-much-protein-you-need-and-what-happens-if-you-eat-too-much/"&gt;previously told The Post&lt;/a&gt; that too much animal protein can raise IGF-1 levels, a hormone linked to accelerated aging, cancer and diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The goal isn’t to just build muscle — it’s to live long enough to use it,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, maybe stick to a protein-packed egg — and leave the mystery “natural flavors” to the lab rats.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;With recent advancements in technology, the Internet of Things and wireless devices are in high demand. However, these innovations also raise concerns about prolonged exposure to electromagnetic radiation (EMR), which may pose potential risks to eye health.&lt;/p&gt;


										      
																																	&lt;p&gt;MXenes, a class of two-dimensional transition metal carbides/nitrides, have shown promise in shielding against EMR. However, their poor adhesion and susceptibility to oxidation have limited their applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a recent breakthrough, researchers led by Professor Takeo Miyake from the Graduate School of Information Production and Systems, Waseda University, Japan, have developed stable MXene-coated contact lenses with remarkable optical and EMR shielding properties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their novel fabrication method ensures optimum adhesion and prevents oxidation of the MXene coating, overcoming previous limitations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study was a collaborative effort between Waseda University, Kyoto University, and Yamaguchi University Hospital, bringing together expertise in nanofabrication, 2D materials, and ophthalmology to ensure eye safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings are published in the journal &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/smsc.202400628" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Small Science&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This research was co-authored by Dr. Lunjie Hu from the Graduate School of Information Production and Systems, Waseda University; Associate Professor Jun Hirotani from Kyoto University; Professor Kazuhiro Kimura from Yamaguchi University Hospital; Assistant Professor Atsushige Ashimori from Yamaguchi University Hospital; and Assistant Professor Saman Azhari from the Graduate School of Information Production and Systems, Waseda University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Smart contact lenses with built-in electronic components are getting a lot of attention as the next big thing in wearable devices. For the first time, though, this means we'll be placing wireless circuit lenses directly on our corneas, exposing them to &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/electromagnetic+waves/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;electromagnetic waves&lt;/a&gt; around the clock. Inspired by breakthroughs in 2D materials and device fabrication technologies, we came up with highly functional protective contact lenses," says lead author Prof. Miyake.&lt;/p&gt;

																																						&lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
    
     
&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="8188791252"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
																																			&lt;p&gt;To fabricate these highly functional contact lenses, the research team started by preparing dispersions of MXene, which were vacuum filtered with mixed cellulose ester (MCE) membranes to produce MXene-based films.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The films were then coated onto commercial soft contact lenses through a wet transfer approach using acetone. The prepared lenses were then analyzed extensively for physical properties, conductivity, and safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We chose a wet-transfer method for the effortless attachment of MXene nanosheets to the unconventionally shaped surface of soft contact lenses, which ensures scalability," adds Prof. Miyake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fabricated contact lenses showed remarkable results with &amp;gt;80% visible light transmission, high conductivity, dehydration protection, and high biocompatibility with &amp;gt;90% cell viability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deposited layers of MXene showed variable thickness based on the concentrations of the dispersions, and the adhesive properties of the dissolved MCE membrane ensured optimum attachment of MXene. Additionally, the MCE layer also protected the MXene from oxidizing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prof. Miyake discusses the significance of their method, saying, "Our research can have a multifaceted impact. First, the stable and effortless coating of MXene nanosheets via wet transfer broadens the possibilities for commercial applications. Secondly, our method is simple yet effective in preventing MXene oxidation, turning a commonly overlooked challenge—MXene oxidation—into a resolved obstacle."&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;

    
&lt;/div&gt;
																																			&lt;p&gt;To assess electromagnetic shielding, the MXene-coated lenses were tested on porcine eyes exposed to microwave heating and thermal imaging. The lenses exhibited a rapid temperature rise, indicating strong EMR absorption and dissipation, which prevented direct heating of the eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When exposed to high-frequency microwaves, MXene effectively absorbed electromagnetic energy and released it as thermal radiation, thereby protecting the porcine eyes from direct heating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the researchers confirmed a robust electromagnetic shielding efficiency of up to 93%, representing the highest reported specific shielding effectiveness for biocompatible materials at the same thickness level, offering substantial protection against high-frequency radiation. The lenses demonstrated strong protection against high-frequency EMR, ensuring optimal eye health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With high electromagnetic protection and reliable properties, this breakthrough in &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/smart+contact+lenses/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;smart contact lenses&lt;/a&gt; represents a significant advancement toward safer wearable technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By leveraging the unique properties of MXene nanosheets, the lenses provide effective protection against high-frequency radiation while maintaining comfort and usability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond eye health, this breakthrough paves the way for the integration of advanced nanomaterials in smart wearables, medical implants, and bioelectronics, addressing both safety and functionality.&lt;/p&gt;

                        &lt;p&gt;SALT LAKE CITY — Health officials in Utah opted not to notify the public about a measles case that entered the state last month, citing low risk and prior vaccination. The case first came into public light Monday afternoon, during a &lt;a href="https://summitcounty.granicus.com/player/clip/923?view_id=1&amp;amp;redirect=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Summit County Board of Health meeting&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Utah Department of Health and Human Services confirmed that the individual had previously been vaccinated, significantly reducing the risk of transmission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This individual had previously been vaccinated and posed a low risk of infection to others,” DHHS said in a statement Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;May 19 – traveler arrives in Utah, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;May 23 – traveler returns to Salt Lake City&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On May 19, an international traveler flew from Canada to Salt Lake City and rented a car to drive to southern Idaho. Utah health officials emphasized that the person did not make any stops in Utah before leaving the state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During their stay in Idaho, the individual then became symptomatic and was diagnosed with measles, and all exposure concerns were in Idaho, according to DHHS. A few days later, the individual returned to Utah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“On May 23, that same individual came back to Salt Lake, again didn’t make any stops but did get on board an airplane while symptomatic,” said Derek Moss, Summit County Nursing Director.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Public health response &amp;amp; passenger notifications&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The DHHS explained that the individual had been cleared by public health to fly, as they were deemed past their infectious period before boarding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Salt Lake County health officials contacted passengers from the flight and provided resources to prevent infection, and at this point, no additional measles infections have been reported among exposed passengers, though health officials continue to monitor those who may have been exposed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“State and local health officials are staying in touch with those individuals, and none of them has developed a measles infection. The typical incubation period is 1-3 weeks.” said DHHS in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clarifications on public health procedures&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The DHHS addressed several points of misinformation Tuesday after information about the case became public during the Summit County Board of Health meeting:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The traveler was never placed on a “do not board” list, contrary to some reports, as they were past their infectious period by the time of their flight.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While one of the vaccines they received is not approved in the U.S., health officials emphasized that any dose of an MMR vaccine significantly decreases the risk of spreading measles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why didn’t officials issue a public health advisory?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When asked about its decision to withhold a public advisory, the DHHS provided the following explanation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Public health officials weigh many factors when we decide whether to notify the public about a situation. In low-risk situations, when we are able to address the issue in a more focused and isolated manner, broad public messaging is not always warranted. Additional information would be released if the situation changes or more data suggests an increased risk.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Measles prevention &amp;amp; summer travel advisory&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the limited risk in this incident, measles remains highly contagious. Due to increasing cases across North and South America, health officials urge Utah residents to verify their vaccination status before traveling this summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We encourage Utahns to talk to a pharmacist or healthcare provider to verify their vaccination status prior to summer travel,” said DHHS in its statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MMR vaccine remains one of the most effective measures against measles and is recommended for anyone planning to travel in regions experiencing outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;span class="js-subbuzz__title-text"&gt;Raw cheese is aged. “FDA regulations require raw cheese to be &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/sampling-protect-food-supply/microbiological-surveillance-sampling-fy14-16-raw-milk-cheese-aged-60-days" target="_blank"&gt;aged at least 60 days&lt;/a&gt;,” says Rao. “During this time, harmful bacteria are often neutralized by natural cultures and lactic acid, making the cheese safer.”&lt;/span&gt;
    
  &lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s not just romantic old-world tradition; it’s science-backed risk mitigation. So yes, raw Brie de Meaux, aged Roquefort, or Manchego? &lt;i&gt;Bon appétit.&lt;/i&gt; But raw milk straight from the udder? That’s a different story.&lt;/p&gt;

It suggests a troubling link to sugar specifically. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Emma Schatoff, a medical oncologist from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center who led the study, told the Daily Mail: 'Young people were coming in with metastatic disease, or cancer that had spread everywhere — it was in their liver, lungs, other organs - and they were very surprised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We looked at anything that could have raised their risk level. We looked at inflammatory bowel disease and medication use, but found no difference there. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Then we looked at diet, and found no link with processed foods or red meat. But we did find a link with high sugar foods in stage four patients diagnosed with the disease for the first time.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Heather Candrilli (left) was diagnosed with stage 4 colon cancer last spring at 36 years old&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She added: 'We defined a high sugar diet as daily consumption of high sugar foods, such as a [single] soda or a candy.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is thought that sugar can cause damaging changes to the gut microbiome, which can lead to mutations in cells that result in tumors forming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;An estimated 63 percent of Americans aged 18 or older report consuming at least one soda a day, according to the CDC. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study included 303 colon cancer patients under 50 years old, of which 112 had stage four disease and 191 had stages one to three disease.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Each filled in a dietary questionnaire to allow researchers to analyze their consumption and detect any possible links between their diets and disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Patients were asked: 'Two to five years before diagnosis, how often did you have one serving of high sugar foods (eg soft drinks, candy).'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Overall, 45 percent of stage 4 patients reported daily consumption of high sugar foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;By comparison the share was 29 percent in the group with less advanced cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Consuming high sugar drinks could raise your risk of being diagnosed with advanced colon cancer, a study suggests &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study concludes: 'In a single center study, in early-onset colon cancer patients, high sugar diets may be associated with de novo [new] metastatic disease.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It was presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology's annual conference in Chicago, Illinois, the biggest gathering of cancer researchers in the world, which is attended by 40,000 people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The results have been published &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://meetings.asco.org/abstracts-presentations/244792"&gt;as an abstract&lt;/a&gt;, and not yet in a scientific journal where they will be reviewed by other scientists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists say that regularly consuming sodas can cause sugar to build-up in the colon when it cannot be fully absorbed, changing the gut microbiome and potentially boosting levels of inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also say sugar can be used as fuel for tumor cells which may cause the cancer to grow faster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A study published last year found that diets low in fiber and high in sugar spark the proliferation of a bacteria called Fusobacterium in the gut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This causes widespread inflammation in the gut, which has been shown to age cells, making them more vulnerable to cancer-causing mutations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Bailey Hutchins of Tennessee, pictured, died of colon cancer at just 26 years old&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the new study 51 percent of patients were female. All had no previous cancer diagnosis and were under 50 years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Individuals diagnosed with stage four were younger, at an average age of 41 years, compared to 43 years in the other group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Colorectal cancer is the fourth most common cancer in the US and the second-leading cause of cancer deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The American Cancer Society estimates that 154,270 Americans will be diagnosed with colon cancer this year and 52,900 will die.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the UK 44,063 cases are diagnosed per year and the nation experiences 16,808 deaths every year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Since the 1990s early-onset colon cancer has increased by 50 percent and rates are expected to double between 2010 and 2030.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

They see a rich color on the crust and feel reassured by words like wholegrain or freshly baked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sustainweb.org/realbread/about_us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Chris Young&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href="https://www.sustainweb.org/realbread/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Real Bread Campaign&lt;/a&gt; notes that the color alone doesn’t always match what’s actually inside the loaf. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some manufacturers add caramelized ingredients for a darker hue, which can create the appearance of a more wholesome, wheat bread product than it really is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s been growing focus on how certain ingredients might affect our health. One example is &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature14232" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;emulsifiers&lt;/a&gt;, which are additives that change the texture of bread and extend its shelf life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research has revealed that these substances can disrupt our &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4290017/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;gut microbiome&lt;/a&gt;. This concern is one of the reasons people pay extra for options that look better on the surface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The likes of ‘wholegrain’, ‘sourdough’, ‘ancient grains’ and ‘freshly baked’ provide no guarantee of how, where, or when a product was made, or with what,” said Chris Young. Empty claims can appear on “wheat” bread packaging. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-wheat-bread-pitfalls"&gt;Wheat bread pitfalls&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of us want a loaf of bread that’s genuinely wholesome, yet it can be tricky to know what’s in that bag. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Some manufacturers add caramelized brown sugar or molasses to enhance the depth of color,” said &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Duane-Mellor-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Duane Mellor&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian and senior lecturer at &lt;a href="https://www.aston.ac.uk/hls/aston-medical-school" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Aston Medical School&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This step can mislead people, who might mistake color for genuine nutritional benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whole grains provide many nutrients, including fiber and vitamins. For a healthier option, a dietitian named &lt;a href="https://zoe.com/learn/sammie-gill" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Sammie Gill&lt;/a&gt; recommends looking for a loaf with fewer ingredients. That suggestion can help people skip the extras that make bread soft but may not promote wellness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-sourdough-confusions"&gt;Sourdough confusions&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enthusiasm for tangy, longer-fermented bread is on the rise. True sourdough usually starts with a live bacterial culture and no baker’s yeast, which can slow digestion of carbs and help regulate blood sugar levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If the product is named or marketed using the word sourdough, but the ingredients list reveals the use of baker’s yeast, a chemical raising agent, or any additive, it’s sourfaux,” said Chris Young. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mislabeled products do pop up. A quick label check is often enough to tell which one is genuinely fermented.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fermentation stage takes longer, so true sourdough can cost more. Some brands cut corners by adding yeast to speed things up and still call it sourdough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-fiber-and-fermentation-matter"&gt;Why fiber and fermentation matter&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bread that’s higher in dietary fiber helps feed the good bacteria in your gut, which in turn can support digestion, immune function, and even mental health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wholemeal and rye &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/freezing-bread-could-make-it-healthier/"&gt;breads&lt;/a&gt; naturally contain more of this fiber compared to white bread, making them more effective at supporting a balanced microbiome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fermented breads like real sourdough can take that one step further. The long fermentation process produces compounds that promote short-chain fatty acids, which help reduce inflammation in the gut. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These effects are strongest when breads are made without additives and use traditional sourdough starters, not shortcuts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-choosing-the-healthiest-option"&gt;Choosing the healthiest option&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are many types of bread on the market, from rustic rye to seeded whole wheat bread. Those that contain more authentic whole grains tend to have higher levels of fiber, protein, vitamins, and minerals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rye bread is well liked for its dense texture and earthy taste. It can also contain a solid amount of fiber, which can aid digestion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most experts suggest blending your grain choices, since each type provides different nutrients. Some days might call for sourdough, while others might be better suited for a traditional wholemeal loaf.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-about-gluten-free-breads"&gt;What about gluten-free breads?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who avoid gluten often reach for gluten-free breads expecting similar benefits to wholegrain loaves. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But many of these products are ultra-processed and contain added starches, gums, and stabilizers that don’t offer the same fiber or nutrient profile. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While they’re helpful for those with &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/celiacdisease.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;celiac disease&lt;/a&gt; or gluten intolerance, they’re not always healthier by default.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specialty &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/how-bread-wheat-gave-rise-to-civilization/"&gt;breads&lt;/a&gt; like those made with ancient grains, such as spelt, einkorn, or teff, can offer additional nutritional value. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These grains often contain more protein and minerals than standard &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/u-s-wheat-market-has-been-remarkably-resilient-amid-climate-change/"&gt;wheat&lt;/a&gt;, and some people find them easier to digest. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, label reading remains important, since not every “ancient grain” loaf is made with a significant amount of the grain it advertises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-closing-thoughts"&gt;Closing thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also matters how many slices you eat. Two slices of wholemeal bread in a day can help meet part of a suggested three daily servings of whole grains. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some folks vary with wholegrain cereals, brown rice, or popcorn, which helps feed different kinds of gut microbes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The wrap-up is that color alone won’t guarantee a loaf’s &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/forests-provide-different-health-benefits-based-on-their-structure/"&gt;health benefits&lt;/a&gt;. A little time spent scanning labels can reveal whether a brown loaf is plain white bread in disguise or a truly beneficial staple.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666833524002028" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Future Foods&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Jun 2025 23:10:41 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiswFBVV95cUxOOTFXek9PMlRMcVZianJFb3hhN0hhalpKUzAyTlMzTWNhX051dkF3ZHJaelpWZW1sTy1oNmZCbHZZSXdBaVpGb1UyajlTZHJWdURjTVhpdTFKVDhwcUYtNFl4NEFUSXpDRTVBeF9MZHI4Y0g5Nkx2cDQtTHFLcHBSUG15Q1ZmWVRmeDJMbUUzcHRURERSdl9MQlBBZzBPZ2NHUS1lSEgyT0lla015YUtDWlpBZw</guid></item><item><title>的确，减少卡路里摄入量会让你感到沮丧-泰晤士报 | It’s true, cutting calories will make you depressed - The Times</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikwFBVV95cUxQZ2RjWUJXZ0l0bUNsTVVjal9tNnNZMEQteUdGdlBtQXFUcF82TUd2SS1RcDV1eFhfNlFiaC1fYWxJSWxyRmVHYnRTNk1lMllwZERudjlKaXA2T0pfak04YjNjZmxqYl9WR2VCbkdtOG9PU3E3cU5fVmlPVnJtNHJ3UG9haEVYMXBDWTNtTER5NWd3NEU?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="responsive__ArticleContent-sc-15gvuj2-8 kuowVf"&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Anyone who has ever attempted to forgo the biscuit tin in favour of carrot sticks will know that dieting can be a miserable experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Now a study has confirmed that cutting calories really is linked to a heightened risk of depression — especially if you are a man.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Researchers based at the University of Toronto examined data from 28,528 adults in the United States who were followed for a decade. They completed surveys on their typical daily food intake and any diets they were following, as well as clinical assessments of depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Participants on low-calorie diets scored more highly for depressive symptoms, including feeling tired, having difficulty concentrating or “little interest or pleasure in doing things”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;The authors of the study said this may be&lt;span class="paywall-EAB47CFD"&gt; because restricting food results in “nutritional deficiencies” in protein and vitamins, which can worsen brain function and result in low mood. “Lack of weight loss or weight cycling while dieting in a real-world setting may lead to worsening depressive symptoms,” they added.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="paywall-EAB47CFD"&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;The impact was greater in men than women, which may be due to their “greater nutritional needs” and the fact men tend to find diets harder than women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Writing in the journal in BMJ Nutrition Prevention &amp;amp; Health, the researchers said: “Our study suggests that caloric-restricted diets are the only dietary pattern that is associated with significantly increased depressive symptom scores compared with those not on a diet.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Brain health depends on getting enough glucose for energy and enough omega-3 fatty acids to help it function. Diets may therefore “worsen brain function”, they said. They noted that “real-life calorie-restricted diets and obesity often result in nutritional deficiencies and induce physiological stress, which can exacerbate depressive symptoms”. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Participants completed a standardised clinical depression survey called PHQ-9, which provides a score out of 27. Nearly one in ten were on a calorie-restrictive diet, and on average these people scored 0.29 points higher in their depressive scores than those not on a diet. Men experienced more severe symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;The researchers said: “We hypothesise that, because biological men typically have higher caloric needs, restrictive diets may pose unique challenges that influence mood differently compared with biological women.” They added that “men tend to prefer fatty meals and frequent fast-food restaurants more than women”, meaning that going on a diet is more likely to lead to a depressed mood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;The study was observational and did not examine cause-and-effect. Experts said further trials were needed to assess the link between diets and mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Professor Sumantra Ray, of the NNEdPro Global Institute for Food, Nutrition and Health, said: “This study adds to the emerging evidence linking dietary patterns and mental health, raising important questions about whether restrictive diets which are low in nutrients considered beneficial for cognitive health, such as omega-3 fatty acids and vitamin B12, may precipitate depressive symptoms.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="last-paragraph" class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;She cautioned that the effect sizes were small and “further well-designed studies” were needed to assess the link between diets and depression. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p id="paywall-portal-article-footer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Jun 2025 22:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikwFBVV95cUxQZ2RjWUJXZ0l0bUNsTVVjal9tNnNZMEQteUdGdlBtQXFUcF82TUd2SS1RcDV1eFhfNlFiaC1fYWxJSWxyRmVHYnRTNk1lMllwZERudjlKaXA2T0pfak04YjNjZmxqYl9WR2VCbkdtOG9PU3E3cU5fVmlPVnJtNHJ3UG9haEVYMXBDWTNtTER5NWd3NEU</guid></item><item><title>研究显示，尽管存在健康风险，但使用大麻的老年人比以往任何时候都多-福克斯新闻 | More seniors are using cannabis than ever before despite health risks, research shows - Fox News</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body"&gt;&lt;div class="featured featured-video video-ct" data-v-5f342d4c&gt; &lt;div class="contain" data-v-5f342d4c&gt;   &lt;div class="info" data-v-5f342d4c&gt;&lt;div class="caption" data-v-5f342d4c&gt; &lt;p data-v-5f342d4c&gt;Senior medical analyst Dr. Marc Siegel discusses advancements in artificial intelligence aimed at predicting an individual's future risk of breast cancer and the increased health risks from cannabis as users age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div id="beyondwords-wrapper" class="beyondwords-wrapper"&gt;&lt;p class="info"&gt;&lt;span class="label-bg"&gt;NEW&lt;/span&gt;You can now listen to Fox News articles!
  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="speakable"&gt;New data has revealed that &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/cannabis" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;cannabis use&lt;/a&gt; among older adults is at an all-time high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="speakable"&gt;Researchers at UC San Diego and NYU discovered that marijuana use by Americans aged 65 and older increased by nearly 46% from 2021 to 2023, according to an NYU press release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As more states &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/mental-health/drug-and-substance-abuse" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;legalize marijuana&lt;/a&gt; for recreational use, as well as for medicinal therapies, accessibility to the drug is more widespread, particularly among aging adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/dementia-risk-connected-cannabis-related-hospital-visits-says-study" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DEMENTIA RISK CONNECTED TO CANNABIS-RELATED HOSPITAL VISITS, SAYS STUDY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research, published in JAMA Internal Medicine, found that 7% of 15,000 adults in this age range reported using cannabis in the last month, according to 2023 data from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health. This was an increase from 4.8% in 2021 and 5.2% in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While marijuana use surged in both men and women, it was more prevalent among women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="image-ct inline"&gt; &lt;div class="info"&gt;&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Marijuana use was found to be more prevalent among women in the study.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;(iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research found that increased use was associated with health conditions &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/heart-health/high-blood-pressure" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;like hypertension&lt;/a&gt;, diabetes, cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those with a college or post-grad degree, an annual income of $75,000 or more, married status and residence in a state with legalized medical cannabis were also more likely to partake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Adults with the highest incomes initially had the lowest prevalence of cannabis use versus other income levels, but by 2023, they had the highest prevalence, which may indicate better access to medical cannabis given its costs," the researchers noted in the study discussion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/older-americans-turn-marijuana-better-sleep-pain-relief-heres-what-know" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OLDER AMERICANS TURN TO MARIJUANA FOR BETTER SLEEP AND PAIN RELIEF: HERE'S WHAT TO KNOW&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The substantial increased prevalence in states with legalized medical cannabis highlights the importance of structural educational support for patients and clinicians in those states."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also warned that the use of cannabis products, especially with psychoactive properties, could cause complications in chronic disease management &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/geriatric-health" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;in older adults.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="image-ct inline"&gt; &lt;div class="info"&gt;&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;New reports continue to find cannabis-related health risks in older users, experts warn.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;(iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study did not look at the frequency of cannabis use, cannabinoid type or recreational versus medical use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement sent to Fox News Digital, senior author Joseph Palamar, PhD, associate professor of population health at NYU Langone, noted his concern about cannabis use increasing among older populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/daily-weed-smokers-higher-risk-heart-attack-stroke-american-heart-association-study" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;DAILY MARIJUANA SMOKERS FACE HIGHER RISK OF HEART ATTACK, STROKE, SAYS AMERICAN HEART ASSOCIATION STUDY&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Palamar suggested the increased use is likely due to a combination of greater availability, decreased stigma and previous marijuana users aging into the 65+ cohort.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"My worry is that some of these people may have adverse &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/mental-health" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;psychiatric reactions&lt;/a&gt;, especially if they use edibles," he said. "It's very easy to accidentally eat too much, and then there's no turning back once it's already ingested."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="image-ct inline"&gt; &lt;div class="info"&gt;&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Increased use was associated with health conditions like hypertension, diabetes, cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;(iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a previous interview with Fox News Digital, Dr. Barbara Krantz, medical director at Caron Treatment Centers in Florida, confirmed that she’s seen a "significant uptick" in cannabis use by individuals over 50.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="pull-quote"&gt;&lt;p class="quote-text"&gt;"It is absolutely an active chemical we need to watch out for, and I'm very disturbed that the elderly are using it."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;While polls have shown that most older Americans use cannabis to improve sleep, reduce pain, alleviate mental health issues and to relax, Krantz shared some potential dangers of the habit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those include increased risk of cardiovascular events, such as heart attack, stroke, increased hypertension and tachycardia, as well as worsening of &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/respiratory-health/copd" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;chronic obstructive pulmonary disease&lt;/a&gt; (COPD).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cannabis may also lead to interactions with other medications, which can increase their toxicity or decrease their effectiveness, Krantz cautioned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other potential risks include balance issues, delayed reaction times, increased confusion or cognitive impairment, and &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/mental-health/stress-and-anxiety" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;heightened anxiety&lt;/a&gt;, depression or anger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There could also be surgery-related risks, including complications due to anesthesia and delays in healing, the expert noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Seniors should talk to their healthcare provider and their pharmacist before using any marijuana or cannabis product, because there are very real and specific dangers for older adults when using these substances," Krantz advised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="image-ct inline"&gt; &lt;div class="info"&gt;&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Researchers and experts encourage older adults to discuss cannabis use with their doctors.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;(iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fox News senior medical analyst Dr. Marc Siegel commented on these findings during an appearance on "America’s Newsroom" on Tuesday, noting that regular use of cannabis can be dangerous if not tracked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You might use a gummy to go to bed, and then the next thing, you're using two gummies, or three gummies, and it could increase anxiety, it can increase discombobulation, you're not thinking clearly, ER visits are on the increase," he cautioned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/apps-products?pid=AppArticleLink" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We know about problems with &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/respiratory-health" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;the lungs&lt;/a&gt;," Siegel added. "It can accelerate dementia and can affect behavior."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The doctor likened the use of marijuana to the effects of smoking cigarettes in terms of damage to the heart and lungs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="image-ct inline"&gt; &lt;div class="info"&gt;&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;One doctor likened the use of marijuana to the effects of smoking cigarettes in terms of damage to the heart and lungs.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;(iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is absolutely an active chemical we need to watch out for, and I'm very disturbed that the elderly are using it," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We've completely jumped the gun [on legalization] because people are going to the ER with psychosis. They're going there with &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/digestive-health" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;vomiting disorders&lt;/a&gt;.

that try to reduce amyloid plaques in the brains of early-stage Alzheimer’s patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And a UVA researcher said their study could help lead to new treatments for Alzheimer’s in as little as 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UVA neuroscience professor John Lukens said STING is an immune defense mechanism in our bodies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“And in terms of evolution, they're thought to be there in an arms race with pathogens,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But STING can also lead to aberrant immune responses that drive neuropathology and inflammation that is characteristic of Alzheimer's disease and most neurodegenerative diseases, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What we basically found was when you genetically delete STING, so basically ablating its function, you can dampen neuroinflammation, amyloid beta, improve cognitive function, and improve neuronal health, suggesting that it is a major player in terms of driving the disease,” said Lukens, the director of UVA’s Harrison Family Translational Research Center in Alzheimer’s and Neurodegenerative Diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pharmaceutical industry has already been working on STING inhibitors for diseases outside the brain, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And that points to the potential for his group’s research, "targeting the dysfunctional immune response," they believe is a culprit in cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lukens mentioned companion studies in ALS, Parkinson's, traumatic brain injury and a few other neurological disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And Lukens said STING inhibitors could potentially be developed from this research to address age-related problems with multiple body systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are potential risks with blocking STING, including higher susceptibility to certain infections and an undetermined possibility of cancer increasing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next step is screening various STING inhibitors for safety and efficacy in mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If that all looks good, we could potentially see clinical trials in humans, Lukens said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>KIMA</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Jun 2025 21:39:29 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi6gJBVV95cUxOVk9zOEhYaDFBODNMWFRzb3laMG5JdS1JMmY2TVZwR011ZExQSW9nSzlrdTh4NEQtNUppZlgyTVB3X1FQRUVkNHVYZ0NORk81cktOZmRKbF91ekxGYlQ2VHJ6UXhWbG9Ja2ZBZjdOSTRuOFlLaHhtb2RlMFNIVkI4OWdRN3JaSFN1QUhmaUtUUDVDSHZrcG1PM3lLVkNYUDhqaHBuTkFyRWVtS0owMmNROXJJd3BlWFFyTG1JdzBCNWxFOHFrRVBFQk5BQy1TZ1ZOZnBMT3NGQ3hMOVFiY2xyZ08za1N3MWRrYm5EYTY1ajZTYXNkaXNvZkplTDJDUlRMdzVLM0FaY2ZkZVBQalpLN1ExWEdnSFlLNTdqNmJncDdCNmdJb0tRcFE3ZVJNYzdzLXFXc2RKWnc5aHc2T0RISTl5X1JJd09BbElnQWJ1SmE5cWVSZXhqODJOU1hwVDNlZkFkWW9SZG9pdw</guid></item><item><title>与帕金森病早期症状相关的热门加工食品- SciTechDaily | Popular Processed Foods Linked to Early Signs of Parkinson’s Disease - SciTechDaily</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimAFBVV95cUxOOHhQR0pwa1JocTZ6dEhRV1licTE0MDJ4RzRfUUpnSWRoSWNkaUFibVdoekJJWEZQc1pnUUlBbURPem4yUW5vVmpiWXNPS3dpY0tjb2lxSVFsRmxJS2ZfU0hCQU14T2RnMlp2dGNGOENra0ZzQmRWYVVsS1N1bzRjb3JzZVNqZDFSNVJ3bURZUE1qY0Q0REJIQQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SciTechDaily</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Jun 2025 21:38:10 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimAFBVV95cUxOOHhQR0pwa1JocTZ6dEhRV1licTE0MDJ4RzRfUUpnSWRoSWNkaUFibVdoekJJWEZQc1pnUUlBbURPem4yUW5vVmpiWXNPS3dpY0tjb2lxSVFsRmxJS2ZfU0hCQU14T2RnMlp2dGNGOENra0ZzQmRWYVVsS1N1bzRjb3JzZVNqZDFSNVJ3bURZUE1qY0Q0REJIQQ</guid></item><item><title>休眠干细胞可能是恢复嗅觉的关键-神经科学新闻 | Dormant Stem Cells May Hold Key to Restoring Sense of Smell - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZkFVX3lxTFBBX0FYY1p3ME9RZmhpQVZMQUtGdm9SdE5QMnJyMHV3QzhDeGJFWjNkbzdlSEdGLWpTaGl5S1pJVXNYZjdHeS1ObjNUQVJlYzI2cFU1OGFnc0ljU2FJdllIdUNPNy0zZw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;Researchers have created a 3D mouse organoid model to study how neurons in the nose regenerate, revealing that a type of stem cell once considered dormant may be crucial for repairing olfactory tissue. The team found that horizontal basal cells (HBCs), marked by KRT5, actively support new neuron generation alongside globose basal cells (GBCs).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This model helps explain how aging or viral infections like COVID-19 impair smell by disrupting stem cell function. The easy-to-use system is designed to be accessible for labs with limited resources and may pave the way for future human organoids to test therapies for smell loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hidden Helpers:&lt;/strong&gt; HBCs, once thought inactive, are critical to olfactory neuron regeneration.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aging Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; Older mouse cells showed reduced neuron formation, likely due to GBC decline.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Practical Tool:&lt;/strong&gt; The model is low-cost and adaptable for widespread research use in smell disorders.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Tufts University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Using a newly devised, three-dimensional model to study the regeneration of nerve tissue in the nose, researchers at Tufts University School of Medicine and the Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences (GSBS) and colleagues have discovered that one type of stem cell thought to be dormant may play a more significant role in preserving the sense of smell than originally believed.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike cells in the central nervous system, sensory neurons in the nasal cavity have a remarkable ability to regenerate throughout life despite near constant exposure to the outside environment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Viral infections such as COVID-19, exposure to toxins, or even aging itself can diminish their function or the ability of these cells to replicate, which can lead to a partial or complete loss of smell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-110633"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/stem-cell-olfaction-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/stem-cell-olfaction-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/stem-cell-olfaction-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/stem-cell-olfaction-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/stem-cell-olfaction-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/stem-cell-olfaction-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/stem-cell-olfaction-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/stem-cell-olfaction-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a woman smelling a flower." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/stem-cell-olfaction-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/stem-cell-olfaction-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/stem-cell-olfaction-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/stem-cell-olfaction-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/stem-cell-olfaction-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/stem-cell-olfaction-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/stem-cell-olfaction-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The ultimate goal is to use this mouse-tissue model of olfactory sensory neurons as a pathway to developing a human organoid that can be used to screen drugs to treat people whose sense of smell is significantly diminished or gone. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team of researchers devised a new, easy-to-create, three-dimensional olfactory tissue mouse model or organoid to help scientists better study how neurons are continually formed in the nose and why this process might decline in disease and aging. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their research, published recently in &lt;em&gt;Cell Reports Methods&lt;/em&gt;, uses this mouse model to show how two types of stem cells in the nose, called horizontal basal cells (HBCs) and globose basal cells (GBCs), communicate and support each other to develop new smell-sensing nerve tissue. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our research suggests that these two stem cells may be interdependent,” says Brian Lin, senior author on the study and a research assistant professor in the Department of Developmental, Molecular and Chemical Biology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One type that we thought was largely dormant— HBCs—may actually play a crucial role in supporting the production of new neurons and the repair of damaged tissue.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using this model, the team identified a specific subpopulation of HBCs, marked by their production of the protein KRT5, that actively support the generation of new olfactory neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers observed that these particular HBCs play a key role in the formation of the organoids, and they found that when these cells were selectively depleted from the organoid cultures, the generation of new neurons was significantly impaired.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results suggest that these stem cells, once thought to be dormant, are essential players in the regenerative process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We also looked at cells from mice of different ages and grew them in the model,” Lin says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We found a decline in the ability of the older mice cells to generate new neurons. We think this is due to a decrease in the GBC population as we age, but we need to do more work to test this hypothesis and if so, develop ways to rejuvenate them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;An Easy-To-Use Model &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lead author of the study, Juliana Gutschow Gameiro, a former Ph.D. student visiting GSBS, came to Tufts from the State University of Londrina, Parana, in Brazil. Lin says she was dedicated to developing a model that was easy to create in labs with limited funds and equipment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Because loss of smell is associated with COVID-19, as well as with Parkinson’s disease and other conditions, a much larger number of researchers from a variety of different fields have begun researching olfactory epithelial cells in the last few years,” says Lin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We wanted to develop an easy-to-use model so that non-stem cell biologists and those working in labs with limited resources could use it to better understand how olfactory neurons regenerate and what happens that causes that process to diminish or fail completely,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Next Step: A Human Organoid &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ultimate goal is to use this mouse-tissue model of olfactory sensory neurons as a pathway to developing a human organoid that can be used to screen drugs to treat people whose sense of smell is significantly diminished or gone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Organoids make pre-clinical trial research quicker, less expensive, and potentially more effective than using whole animals or existing human cell cultures. Organoids have already been developed for lungs, kidneys, and other organs, but not for human olfactory tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s challenging to get pure olfactory tissue from humans,” Lin says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Individuals are anesthetized and a brush similar to a COVID test wand is pushed deep into the nasal cavity. Unlike in their mouse model, human respiratory stem cells and olfactory stem cells collected in this process are difficult to separate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team’s next challenge is to develop a simple, inexpensive technique for separating out the human olfactory stem cells and coaxing them to grow in the lab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;Research reported in this article was supported by the National Institutes of Health under award numbers R21 DC018681-01 and R01 DC017869-03, the Coordenaҫão de Aperfeiҫoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior – Brasil, and the German Research Foundation (DFG) under the Walter Benjamin Program, and by the Fritz Thyssen Foundation.

Yet aging has continued its steady, unyielding course. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, researchers are taking a bold new direction. Instead of focusing solely on how we live, they’re investigating how we die. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They’re zeroing in on something called “necrosis” – a violent, uncontrolled form of cell death once seen as nothing more than &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/organ-aging-can-predict-diseases-decades-in-advance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;biological wreckage&lt;/a&gt; – and uncovering its surprising potential to reshape how we understand disease, degeneration, and the future of &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/human-life-expectancy-faces-a-triple-threat/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;human longevity&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-necrosis-disrupts-healthy-cell-function"&gt;Necrosis disrupts healthy cell function&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cells typically renew themselves through controlled processes. This renewal helps replace old cells and keep tissues functional. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Necrosis occurs when cells die in an abrupt, uncontrolled manner, usually in response to injury, infection, or severe stress. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike apoptosis, the body’s carefully programmed &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/healthy-aging-how-some-people-live-past-100-years/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;process of cell death&lt;/a&gt;, necrosis unleashes chaos. The cell swells, ruptures, and spills its contents into surrounding tissue, triggering inflammation and damaging nearby cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This destructive cascade often leads to chronic disease and tissue degeneration, especially when the body cannot repair the affected area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A global team of scientists looked at the role necrosis plays in many age-related conditions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Nobody really likes talking about death, even cell death, which is perhaps why the physiology of death is so poorly understood,” noted &lt;a href="https://profiles.ucl.ac.uk/76122-keith-siew" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Dr. Keith Siew&lt;/a&gt;, one of the study’s authors, hailing from &lt;a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/medical-sciences/divisions/medicine/departments/centre-kidney-and-bladder-health" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;UCL Centre for Kidney &amp;amp; Bladder Health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-kidney-heart-and-brain-diseases"&gt;Kidney, heart, and brain diseases&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/kidney-failure/symptoms-causes/syc-20369048" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Kidney problems&lt;/a&gt; affect many people in their later years. This organ filters toxins, and when enough kidney cells die, there is a higher chance of needing dialysis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If necrosis is a major factor in triggering kidney damage, then targeting it might keep kidneys healthier for a longer time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/health-statistics/kidney-disease" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; shows that by 75 years old, nearly half of all individuals may experience some level of kidney disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0753332222005923" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Studies&lt;/a&gt; also suggest that necrosis may play a part in conditions like heart disease and &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/stopping-alzheimers-before-it-starts-early-treatment-shows-potential/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Alzheimer’s&lt;/a&gt;. When cellular breakdown releases harmful molecules, surrounding tissues can become inflamed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As these tissues struggle, the effects may ripple through the body. Even mild inflammation can wear down the body’s ability to &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/daily-doctor-recommended-regimen-that-could-slow-aging/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;repair&lt;/a&gt; itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-astronauts-and-necrosis"&gt;Astronauts and necrosis&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Space &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/humans-in-space/living-in-space/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;health experts&lt;/a&gt; find necrosis interesting because low gravity and cosmic radiation can strain human organs. Astronauts experience accelerated aging during long missions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kidneys are especially vulnerable because reduced fluid regulation and radiation exposure may affect how well they &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/universal-rule-of-biology-sai-proposed-to-explain-aging-and-how-to-control-it/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;function&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea that interrupting necrosis could protect these vital organs has sparked new questions about maintaining astronaut health for extended journeys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Targeting necrosis offers potential to not only transform longevity on Earth but also push the frontiers of space exploration,” said &lt;a href="https://pure.southwales.ac.uk/en/persons/damian-bailey" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Professor Damian Bailey&lt;/a&gt;, from the &lt;a href="https://www.southwales.ac.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of South Wales&lt;/a&gt; and the European Space Agency Life Sciences Working Group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-stopping-necrosis-may-protect-cells"&gt;Stopping necrosis may protect cells&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If we could prevent necrosis, even temporarily, we would be shutting down these destructive cycles at their source,” said Dr. Carina Kern, CEO of &lt;a href="https://www.linkgevity.com/about" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;LinkGevity&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some researchers believe that if necrosis can be paused, it might stop a domino effect of tissue damage. By preserving cells that are on the brink of failure, the body would have a better chance to carry out self-repair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One hypothesis suggests that keeping calcium levels under control within cells could be essential. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/amaranth-seeds-rich-in-calcium-and-iron-prevents-tumors-and-keeps-bones-strong/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Calcium&lt;/a&gt; often acts as a switch, turning on or off important cellular functions. If too much enters a stressed cell, that cell can rupture. Scientists hope that preventing this surge might halt large-scale tissue breakdown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-improving-quality-of-life"&gt;Improving quality of life&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/aging-hotspot-found-in-the-brain-may-hold-the-key-to-longevity/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Age-related disorders&lt;/a&gt; come with gradual but significant loss of function. Necrosis appears in conditions affecting not just the kidneys but also the brain, heart, and other organs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When cells burst and release debris, surrounding tissues may endure ongoing inflammation. Interrupting this pattern could reduce suffering and add productive years for many individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This approach might also allow doctors to address multiple health problems at once. Rather than chasing each disease individually, limiting necrosis may let the body maintain its own equilibrium. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the population grows older, ideas like these could open up new possibilities for health management and medical innovation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-blocking-harmful-cell-death"&gt;Blocking harmful cell death&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers around the world are investigating whether necrosis-blocking drugs or gene-based therapies can be used safely. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They aim to determine if these approaches can work without disturbing beneficial types of cell death that clear out defective or excess cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Untangling these processes could be tricky, but the concept of sparing healthy tissues and preventing irreversible damage has captured wide attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With more teams studying these pathways, the prospects for harnessing necrosis control are expanding. For now, public interest and continued clinical trials may help clarify how this form of cell death can be targeted effectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Special thanks to clinicians from the &lt;a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/medical-sciences/divisions/medicine" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;UCL Division of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.brighamandwomens.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Brigham and Women’s Hospital&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="https://www.esa.int" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;European Space Agency&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41388-025-03431-y" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Oncogene&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Jun 2025 21:23:30 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiswFBVV95cUxOMnFOSlZfZUNqUHN5SVU5UUNreExMTGNnS2h0WWN2dU11dG1vcFA5SlJkWkUxUEdyWklWcHJNZ2p6WXpzZjBBOHZfaXptWWRkSmlfcFo0XzU1UU8wV0t0Nzd2cXpySmllWXRkSmtEdzR6UTg0WE9pUGJ2dzlNcXYtMUNEYnNXakNuRFlBMVUyZlF1Rk83Y0NXU0ZHV1FITGppMkloZ1N2R1p4MlB1TEdpYXZtMA</guid></item><item><title>无论您是吸烟还是食用可食用的食物，杂草都可能对您的心脏有害- Live Science | Weed may be bad for your heart, whether you smoke or consume edibles - Live Science</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMisgFBVV95cUxQbGswdmxPT1JvY0RZSlVKV2JWZmlsRklfNUZucjFRaDNINHdRX1IwR3lxQUQ3bkVDOFgtaDBDSThybXM1NFVKR2FnN1JEQlZHS3laaDNpbHVjYWJ4UXcxVWhrcHRtdjJsWlJ2Y0tQQWI4dS04UHJ2bG5oWFc4ajZTT1RtSjJXbHNiZU9mWldkeXRaSWJKS2NuSHh3UHd4NXBCZ24tbElSS2c0NVdEanc0czhB?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-body" class="text-copy bodyCopy auto"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because eating a cannabis-infused brownie or gummy does not involve inhaling smoke, it may be tempting to think of edibles as a relatively harmless high. However, new research suggests that similar to smoking cannabis, consuming edibles containing the compound &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/64886-thc-cbd-marijuana-therapeutic-effects.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/64886-thc-cbd-marijuana-therapeutic-effects.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; may worsen cardiovascular health over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study found that "chronic smokers of marijuana have poorly functioning blood vessels similar to chronic smokers of tobacco," said &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://profiles.ucsf.edu/matthew.springer" target="_blank" data-url="https://profiles.ucsf.edu/matthew.springer" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Matt Springer&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a cardiovascular researcher at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) whose lab led the new study.

To isolate the effects of habitual cannabis smoking or edible use, the study focused on cannabis users who reported using the drug at least three times a week, exclusively through their preferred method.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study's lead author &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://profiles.ucsf.edu/leila.mohammadi" target="_blank" data-url="https://profiles.ucsf.edu/leila.mohammadi" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dr. Leila Mohammadi&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a physician-scientist at UCSF, noted that their study's strict recruitment criteria resulted in a small sample size, which could somewhat limit the findings. However, it also enabled them to rule out other factors that could affect people's blood vessels, such as tobacco use or underlying health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-MjrHSh5q6xJZR7vLouhrt4" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-MjrHSh5q6xJZR7vLouhrt4 slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;To gauge each participant's vascular function, the authors temporarily blocked blood flow to the brachial artery — located in the upper arm — with an inflatable forearm cuff. They used ultrasound imaging to measure the artery's diameter before and after releasing this pressure. This measure is reflected as the percentage of diameter change from the baseline measurement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Springer said this test offers a "window into the future" because if blood vessels cannot dilate properly in response to increased blood flow, that's linked to a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.109.864801" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.109.864801" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;higher risk of poor cardiovascular disease outcomes&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, such as heart attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the participants who did not consume cannabis, the researchers measured an average vessel dilation of 10.4%. By comparison, cannabis smokers and edible users had an average dilation of 6.0% and 4.6%, respectively. This decrease in dilation is similar to what the researchers observed in an &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/ATVBAHA.121.317749" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/ATVBAHA.121.317749" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;earlier study&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of chronic tobacco smokers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The more cannabis people used — as defined by the number of smoking sessions or milligrams of THC consumed via edibles per week — the more dramatic their impairment in dilation was.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To uncover clues as to why cannabis might cause this change in function, the researchers ran a laboratory study to see how the participants' blood samples affected endothelial cells. These cells line blood vessels and release compounds, such as nitric oxide, that spur vascular dilation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This vessel-widening process can be triggered by a substance called vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). But when the researchers exposed endothelial cells in lab dishes to blood samples from cannabis smokers, they found that the blood hampered VEGF-stimulated nitric oxide production in the cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, blood from edible consumers and cannabis nonusers had no effect on the cells' nitric oxide release. That suggests that cannabis smoke and ingested THC affect the cardiovascular system via separate mechanisms. That idea is in line with a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27464788/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27464788/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;prior study from the same team&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which found that secondhand cannabis smoke that was stripped of THC still affected the blood vessels of rats that breathed it in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new study revealed only an association between cannabis use and vascular function, not definitive proof of how the drug affects blood vessels, Springer acknowledged. Meanwhile, one of his collaborators &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://faseb.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1096/fasebj.2020.34.s1.08998" target="_blank" data-url="https://faseb.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1096/fasebj.2020.34.s1.08998" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;previously reported&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that cannabis appears to harden blood vessel walls but does not affect vascular dilation, whereas the current paper reports the opposite findings. So there's more research to be done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Springer added that because they only recruited habitual users of the drug, people who consume cannabis less frequently may not be affected the same way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cannabis is becoming available to a growing number of consumers thanks to efforts to legalize the drug at the state level. However, research into its health effects has not kept up, Kloner said. Because the drug is still illegal at the federal level, cannabis studies remain constrained by strict regulation, making the drug more difficult to study, he noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-freeText-MjrHSh5q6xJZR7vLouhrt4-GV4ePPhK2MtVdyEdpVFSiLX1pXwNG91N" class="slice-container freeText-wrapper freeText-MjrHSh5q6xJZR7vLouhrt4-GV4ePPhK2MtVdyEdpVFSiLX1pXwNG91N slice-container-freeText"&gt;&lt;div class="info-block"&gt;&lt;p class="infoDisclaimer"&gt;This article is for informational purposes only and is not meant to offer medical advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Using an advanced imaging technique called NODDI, scientists mapped the organization of neural pathways that govern emotional processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found that specific brain tracts were linked to increases in either positive or negative emotionality by nine months. Infants with more complex microstructure in the left cingulum bundle displayed more positive emotions and better self-soothing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Early Emotional Forecasting:&lt;/strong&gt; White matter structure at 3 months predicts emotional patterns by 9 months.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Distinct Pathways:&lt;/strong&gt; Forceps minor linked to negative emotionality; cingulum bundle linked to positive growth.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Imaging Standard:&lt;/strong&gt; NODDI imaging provides detailed insight into infant brain development previously unseen.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Genomic Press&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In a comprehensive Genomic Press research article, scientists have uncovered remarkable insights into how the earliest brain connections shape infant emotional development, potentially offering new ways to identify children at risk for future behavioral and emotional challenges.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The groundbreaking study, led by Dr. Yicheng Zhang and Dr. Mary L. Phillips at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, examined 95 infant-caregiver pairs using advanced brain imaging techniques. Researchers discovered that the microstructure of white matter tracts – the brain’s information highways – at just 3 months of age could predict how infants’ emotions and self-soothing abilities would evolve over the following six months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-110629"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/emotion-neurodevelopment-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/emotion-neurodevelopment-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/emotion-neurodevelopment-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/emotion-neurodevelopment-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/emotion-neurodevelopment-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/emotion-neurodevelopment-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/emotion-neurodevelopment-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/emotion-neurodevelopment-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a baby and a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/emotion-neurodevelopment-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/emotion-neurodevelopment-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/emotion-neurodevelopment-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/emotion-neurodevelopment-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/emotion-neurodevelopment-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/emotion-neurodevelopment-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/emotion-neurodevelopment-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The study also highlights the importance of the first year of life as a critical period for brain development. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decoding the Infant Brain’s Emotional Blueprint&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team employed sophisticated Neurite Orientation Dispersion and Density Imaging (NODDI), a cutting-edge MRI technique that provides unprecedented detail about brain tissue organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This technology allowed scientists to peer into the developing brain’s architecture with remarkable precision, revealing how the arrangement of neural fibers influences emotional trajectories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What we’re seeing is that the brain’s structural organization in early infancy sets the stage for emotional development,” explains the research team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study focused on critical white matter pathways connecting regions responsible for self-awareness, attention to important stimuli, and cognitive control – networks that form the foundation of emotional processing throughout life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Discoveries Shape Understanding of Emotional Development&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings revealed distinct patterns linking brain structure to emotional outcomes. Infants with higher neurite dispersion in the forceps minor – a bundle of fibers connecting the brain’s hemispheres – showed greater increases in negative emotionality between 3 and 9 months. This suggests that certain patterns of brain connectivity might predispose infants to heightened emotional reactivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conversely, infants with more complex microstructure in the left cingulum bundle, which connects regions involved in executive control, demonstrated larger increases in positive emotions and improved self-soothing abilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These discoveries raise intriguing questions about whether early interventions could potentially influence these neural pathways to promote healthier emotional development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Implications for Early Detection and Intervention&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ability to identify infants at risk for emotional difficulties before behavioral symptoms emerge represents a significant advance in developmental neuroscience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous research has established that high negative emotionality in infancy correlates with increased risk for future anxiety and behavioral disorders, while low positive emotionality links to later depression and social difficulties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Phillips notes the potential impact: “Understanding these early neural markers could transform how we approach infant mental health, allowing for targeted interventions during critical developmental windows.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team validated their findings in an independent sample of 44 infants, strengthening confidence in these brain-behavior relationships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advanced Imaging Reveals Hidden Patterns&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study’s use of NODDI technology marks a significant methodological advance in infant brain research. Traditional imaging methods often struggle to capture the nuanced organization of developing brain tissue. NODDI’s ability to separate different tissue components provides researchers with a clearer picture of how neural pathways mature and organize during this crucial period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research examined three major white matter tracts: the forceps minor, cingulum bundle, and uncinate fasciculus. Each plays a vital role in connecting brain regions essential for emotional processing and regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How might variations in other brain connections influence infant development? What role do environmental factors play in shaping these neural pathways?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bridging Neuroscience and Clinical Practice&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings have immediate relevance for pediatric care and early childhood development. By identifying objective neural markers of emotional development, clinicians could potentially screen for risk factors before behavioral problems emerge. This proactive approach could lead to earlier, more effective interventions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team accounted for multiple factors that might influence brain development, including caregiver mental health, socioeconomic status, and infant characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This comprehensive approach strengthens the study’s conclusions and suggests that brain microstructure represents a fundamental contributor to emotional development independent of environmental influences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Future Directions and Unanswered Questions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While these findings represent a significant advance, they also open new avenues for investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How stable are these early neural patterns throughout childhood? Can targeted interventions modify white matter development to promote emotional resilience?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team’s ongoing work aims to address these questions through longitudinal studies following infants into later childhood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also highlights the importance of the first year of life as a critical period for brain development. During this time, rapid changes in white matter organization lay the foundation for lifelong emotional and behavioral patterns. Understanding these processes at a neural level could inform everything from parenting practices to public health policies supporting infant development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A New Era in Developmental Neuroscience&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research exemplifies the power of advanced neuroimaging to reveal previously hidden aspects of brain development. As technology continues to evolve, scientists gain increasingly sophisticated tools to understand how the brain’s earliest organization shapes human behavior and experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The University of Pittsburgh team’s findings contribute to a growing body of evidence suggesting that many aspects of emotional and behavioral development have roots in the brain’s earliest structural patterns. By identifying these patterns, researchers move closer to developing targeted interventions that could prevent or mitigate future mental health challenges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The implications extend beyond individual children to broader questions about human development. How do genetic and environmental factors interact to shape these early brain patterns? What evolutionary advantages might different patterns of emotional development confer? These fundamental questions drive continued research in this rapidly advancing field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study demonstrates that even in the earliest months of life, the brain’s structural organization profoundly influences emotional development. This knowledge opens new possibilities for supporting healthy development from the very beginning of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this emotion and neurodevelopment research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#d9b4b8b5b0f7aeb6b7be99bebcb7b6b4b0baa9abbcaaaaf7bab6b4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Ma-Li Wong&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://genomicpress.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Genomic Press&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Ma-Li Wong – Genomic Press&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.61373/gp025a.0026" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Early infant white matter tract microstructure predictors of subsequent change in emotionality and emotional regulation&lt;/a&gt;” by Yicheng Zhang et al. &lt;em&gt;Genomic Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Early infant white matter tract microstructure predictors of subsequent change in emotionality and emotional regulation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are rapid changes in negative and positive emotionality (NE, PE) and emotional regulation (e.g., soothability) during the first year of life. Understanding the neural basis of these changes during maturation can enhance the understanding of the etiology of early psychopathology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our goal was to determine how measures of white matter (WM) microstructure in tracts connecting key emotion-related neural networks, including the forceps minor (FM), cingulum bundle (CB), and uncinate fasciculus interconnecting the default mode network (DMN), salience network (SN), and central executive network (CEN), can predict developmental change in infant emotionality and emotional regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We used Neurite Orientation Dispersion and Density Imaging (NODDI) measures together with conventional diffusion tensor metrics to examine WM tract microstructure and fiber collinearity in the primary sample (&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 95), and modeled each WM feature with caregiver-reported infant NE, PE, and soothability, with infant and caregiver sociodemographic factors as covariates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 3-month infants, higher neurite dispersion and lower longitudinal fiber alignment in the FM were associated with a larger increase in NE from 3 to 9 months of age, suggesting that greater integration of the DMN, SN, and CEN leads to a larger subsequent increase in NE; while higher neurite density and dispersion as well as lower WM longitudinal alignment in the left CB were associated with a larger increase in PE, suggesting that greater integration within the CEN leads to increasing PE over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, higher neurite dispersion and lower WM longitudinal alignment in the left CB were associated with a larger increase in soothability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Associations among diffusion tensor measures and changes in infant emotionality and emotional regulation measures were replicated in an independent test sample (&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 44).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings suggest that early infant WM microstructural features support infant emotionality and emotional regulation development and could represent early biomarkers of future emotional and behavioral disorders.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Jun 2025 20:23:52 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibEFVX3lxTE00czRQRHVHbF9uQk0xM0hhNjhIV0xFODFXUXAwQzZTUVhEU1hkQUFvRE9jUWt6N3dDdUYxRkpxUkxmeDVfX1JkYUtCd1JlMjc0SUduLXFFTHZkNlUtTU5XSE9NRk1JcjltcnpPaw</guid></item><item><title>专家刚刚发现了最有效的新型减肥药物-而且它不是Ozempic - AOL.com | Experts Just Discovered The Most Effective New Weight Loss Drug—And It's Not Ozempic - AOL.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifkFVX3lxTE1ldGxNOXZrVmF3VEZPWGdYTGZzZUNGMXhrc0hpRDVhSVRPckNKNnhZWHhNM1NiQW13MFBETVhab1haYW9uUWxmSWQ4LUxtODktdG16LW9fb2h4TzNMRm1mbFUwRjBCTmFtU0dkYTJvQ0pDb1p3TjhrS0JTZDVGQQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="caption"&gt;Experts Just Discovered The Most Effective WL Drug&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A new study looked at the effect of semaglutide vs. tirzepatide on weight loss over a 72 week period.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;At the end of the 72 weeks, people who took tirzepatide lost an average of 50 pounds. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here's what the new study can tell us. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;The term “&lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a63213937/how-to-build-muscle-on-ozempic/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Ozempic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Ozempic&lt;/a&gt;"may be synonymous with all things related to &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/weight-loss/a42623753/weight-loss-drugs-future-ozempic-wegovy-mounjaro/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:weight-loss drugs;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;weight-loss drugs&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s certainly &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a63788221/glp1-alcohol-use-disorder-clinical-trial-results/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:not the only option out there;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;not the only option out there&lt;/a&gt;. New research suggests it might not even be the best choice for reaching your weight-loss goals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study, which was published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2416394" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The New England Journal of Medicine,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;The New England Journal of Medicine,&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; found that tirzepatide (Zepbound) is more effective for weight loss in a head-to-head trial with semaglutide (Ozempic, Wegovy). It's important to point out that the study was funded by the company that makes Zepbound. But experts aren't surprised by the findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, if you’re interested in taking a weight-loss medication, it’s fair to wonder if Zepbound might be a better choice. Here’s what the study found, plus what a weight-loss doctor wants people to keep in mind when taking in this new information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meet the expert:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.memorialcare.org/providers/mir-b-ali" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mir Ali;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mir Ali&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;u&gt;,&lt;/u&gt; MD, is a medical director of MemorialCare Surgical Weight Loss Center at Orange Coast Medical Center in Fountain Valley, CA&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What did the study find?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the study, researchers had 751 people with obesity (but without type 2 diabetes) take either the maximum tolerated dose of tirzepatide or the maximum tolerated dose of semaglutide once a week for 72 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the end of the 72 weeks, people who took tirzepatide lost an average of 50 pounds or about 20.2 percent of their body weight. Participants who took semaglutide lost an average of 33 pounds or 13.7 percent of their body weight. People who took tirzepatide also had bigger reductions in waist size compared to those who took semaglutide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Among participants with obesity but without diabetes, treatment with tirzepatide was superior to treatment with semaglutide with respect to reduction in body weight and waist circumference at week 72,” the researchers wrote in the conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why is Zepbound more effective?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.memorialcare.org/providers/mir-b-ali" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mir Ali;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Mir Ali&lt;/a&gt;&lt;u&gt;,&lt;/u&gt; MD, medical director of MemorialCare Surgical Weight Loss Center at Orange Coast Medical Center in Fountain Valley, CA, isn’t shocked by the findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Zepbound operates on two receptors that suppress the appetite and slow motility in the gastrointestinal tract—the GLP-1 and GIP receptors,” he explains. “Semaglutide only affects the GLP-1 receptor.” So, since Zepbound acts on more than one receptor “it makes sense that it would have a stronger effect on appetite and ultimately work better,” Dr. Ali says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who makes Zepbound?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zepbound is made by &lt;a href="https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/zepboundtm-tirzepatide-now-available-us-pharmacies-adults-living" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Eli Lilly,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Eli Lilly,&lt;/a&gt; which also makes fellow tirzepatide medication Mounjaro.

From there, you can either fill it at your local pharmacy or purchase vials from &lt;a href="https://lillydirect.lilly.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:LillyDirect;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;LillyDirect&lt;/a&gt;, a self-pay pharmacy that Eli Lilly recently launched.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the side effects of taking Zepbound?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers noted in the study that the most common side effects in people who took Ozempic and Zepbound were &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a62870573/ozempic-overdose/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:gastrointestinal;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;gastrointestinal&lt;/a&gt;. They also pointed out that most side effects were “mild to moderate” and that they occurred most often when people ramped up their dosage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-new-medication-chronic-weight-management" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Food and Drug Administration;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Food and Drug Administration&lt;/a&gt; (FDA), those side effects can include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nausea&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diarrhea&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vomiting&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Constipation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stomach discomfort and pain&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Injection site reactions&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fatigue&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Allergic reactions like fever and rash&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Burping&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hair loss&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The side effects with tirzepatide are very similar to semaglutide,” Dr. Ali says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re interested in taking Zepbound or any weight-loss drugs, Dr. Ali recommends talking to your doctor. “They’re designed for people who are considered obese or almost obese with other comorbid conditions like high blood pressure,” he says. “This is not for patients that just have a couple of pounds to lose.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Jun 2025 20:02:17 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifkFVX3lxTE1ldGxNOXZrVmF3VEZPWGdYTGZzZUNGMXhrc0hpRDVhSVRPckNKNnhZWHhNM1NiQW13MFBETVhab1haYW9uUWxmSWQ4LUxtODktdG16LW9fb2h4TzNMRm1mbFUwRjBCTmFtU0dkYTJvQ0pDb1p3TjhrS0JTZDVGQQ</guid></item><item><title>一名妇女在冲洗鼻窦后感染了一种致命的脑食性阿米巴。以下是如何避免这种情况-《独立报》 | A woman contracted a fatal brain-eating ameba after rinsing her sinuses.

Out of the 164 known people who got infected with PAM in the U.S. from 1962 to 2023, only four survived. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC confirmed that Naegleria fowleri was found in the woman’s cerebrospinal fluid.

The CDC says these recommended practices are “critical to reducing the risk for illness.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Naegleria fowleri thrives in warm freshwater lakes, rivers and hot springs, so it’s important to take some actions to reduce the risk of exposure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC recommends holding your nose or wearing a nose clip when jumping or diving into fresh water. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-ii" class="sc-looa6c-0 cPCVUJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You should also always keep your head above water in hot springs, according to the agency. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC also advises against digging in shallow water as the ameba is more likely to live there. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Jun 2025 19:40:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiowFBVV95cUxQOURsVzhJZFNXWmlrdWs4NExVTHlQbHVtb095Z2NjWl8zVW9adkIwVUZmV0c3WV9kWFFKUXdYaFFUTUN1OG5jZEN5dU0zeVpIZTdDS2hqcXNHMGN3ODlwVllwX216dkp3T0oxbXZvbVBFUERUVDVtTXNBTlJaOWxhV1lhOXZIYmNGUlVkS2gwZ28wdzBOQ19BdE44R3NXd2tPV2Vz</guid></item><item><title>研究发现，南加州的大多数淡水鱼携带能够感染人类的入侵性寄生虫- Phys.org | Most freshwater game fish in Southern California carry invasive parasites capable of infecting humans, study finds - Phys.org</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigAFBVV95cUxPTDBnYzdnR1ZUdWZTVmpnak40Nk5CYXJJaFhiVG5fcXdvUmJPczNKWlluSXJPQTBoZTRtejFIR3NDeDVLVWFMam1rNk8walVmUjd5SGF5RzM0X0dHcVNsUDhybnhoY1lXTW5MWll1bDRzbHVSbk83SVpMU3A5NzhfcdIBf0FVX3lxTE1NVjFfMWpKQ0thd3FaMlpPX2FJWEpsWEZwQ0VvYUQ5VWZfRTlESVN0ZjlMMGQ0bkc3c1FfTGFTZ3cwZTlnOUZrNmpnZ0dLaTVwbWg5VzMybnBWYXVacTNZekFOdFBaWjJySTdsTnFla2NNREYycXRuY0wtTDdLMnc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="mt-4 article-main"&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 90% of popular freshwater game fish in Southern California contain an introduced parasite capable of infecting humans, according to a new study by researchers at UC San Diego's Scripps Institution of Oceanography.&lt;/p&gt;


										      
																																	&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/parasites/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;parasites&lt;/a&gt; found in the study—two species of flatworms called trematodes—typically cause gastrointestinal problems, &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/weight+loss/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;weight loss&lt;/a&gt; or lethargy when they infect humans. In some rare and severe cases, the parasites have caused strokes or heart attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings, &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/jid/advance-article/doi/10.1093/infdis/jiaf180/8154770" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;i&gt;Journal of Infectious Diseases&lt;/i&gt;, suggest that these parasites pose a previously unrecognized public health risk in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Americans don't usually think about parasites when they eat freshwater fish because it hasn't historically been an issue here," said Ryan Hechinger, an ecologist and parasitologist at Scripps and the study's senior author. "But these trematodes have now been widely introduced in the U.S. and that means that doctors and the public should be aware."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hechinger emphasized that there is "no need to panic" as the risks posed by these parasites are easy to mitigate: Fully cooking fish or freezing any intended to be eaten raw for at least one week should kill the trematodes, per Food and Drug Administration guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But a social media survey included in the study suggested that people in the U.S. are likely consuming freshwater fish without taking these precautions, which can dramatically increase the odds of infection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="8188791252"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
																																			&lt;p&gt;The study identified two species of parasitic trematodes—&lt;a href="https://phys.org/news/2024-07-biologists-human-infecting-parasite-sterile.html"&gt;Haplorchis pumilio&lt;/a&gt; and Centrocestus formosanus. These trematodes have historically infected people in Southeast Asia and likely arrived in the U.S. more than a decade ago inside the bodies of one of their hosts: an invasive aquatic snail commonly known as the &lt;a href="https://nas.er.usgs.gov/queries/factsheet.aspx?SpeciesID=1037" target="_blank"&gt;red-rimmed melania or Malaysian trumpet snail (Melanoides tuberculata)&lt;/a&gt;. The invasive snail has spread to 17 American states and Puerto Rico.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trematode's life cycle involves parasitizing three hosts: first a red-rimmed melania snail, then a fish and then, finally, a warm-blooded vertebrate, like a bird or a human, that consumes the infected fish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://scripps.ucsd.edu/news/parasites-associated-eating-fish-showing-southern-california-fishing-locales" target="_blank"&gt;Previous work&lt;/a&gt; led by Hechinger showed that the red-rimmed melania and its associated trematode parasites are widespread in California.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the present study, Hechinger said he and his co-authors wanted to determine whether fish that Americans commonly catch and eat carry these infectious parasites, and whether people are consuming these fish in ways that increase their odds of infection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2023, the researchers examined 84 fish from seven different species, including largemouth bass and bluegill, collected from five popular fishing locations in San Diego County.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;

    
&lt;/div&gt;
																																			&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that 93% of all the fish in the study were infected with the Haplorchis pumilio parasite, with some individual fish harboring thousands of the parasites. The second parasite, Centrocestus formosanus, was found at two of the five locations where it occurred in 91% of the fish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"These parasites are here in the U.S., and they're infecting fish that people are eating," said Hechinger. "We hope this study can help make public health officials, doctors and the public more aware."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the study authors conducted a survey of 125 YouTube videos with a total of nearly 5 million views, and found 65% did not mention the proper cooking or freezing of the fish, which promotes the transmission of the parasites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Nearly 5 million views shows there is widespread interest and possibly a widespread practice of folks eating freshwater fish raw," said Emma Palmer, a marine scientist at the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center who conducted the study during her graduate studies at Scripps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Properly cooking or freezing fish before consumption kills the parasites, and minor infections shouldn't cause serious harm. Greater health risks come from chronic, repeated infection over many months or years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers emphasize that public education about the risk of infection and proper fish preparation is crucial, particularly among people who may rely on &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/freshwater+fish/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;freshwater fish&lt;/a&gt; for food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="8188791252"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
																																			&lt;p&gt;The study authors plan to share their results with public health officials in several Southern California counties to increase awareness. The researchers also hope the study will reach &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/medical+practitioners/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;medical practitioners&lt;/a&gt;, who might not think of these trematodes as a possible cause of gastrointestinal complaints or other problems in their patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"There haven't been any reported cases of these parasites infecting Americans," said Hechinger, "but nobody is looking for cases and doctors aren't required to report them."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To facilitate more accurate tracking, the study authors recommend that fish-borne trematode infection be added to the list of diseases doctors are required to report to public health officials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This kind of research is so important to identifying new public health threats," said Hechinger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to Hechinger and Palmer, the study was co-authored by Daniel Metz of the University of Nebraska.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;After years of largely predictable &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/norovirus-cases-surging-parts-of-us-cdc-data/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;norovirus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; waves, the emergence of a new strain might have disrupted the seasonal pattern of outbreaks from this notorious stomach bug, suggests a new report by the &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/tag/centers-for-disease-control-and-prevention/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In previous years, the U.S. usually saw norovirus outbreaks increase around December. That marked the start of the season for the virus. But last year's season started in October, as a new norovirus strain &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/new-norovirus-strain-us-wave-stomach-bug/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;called GII.17&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; drove a record wave of outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Continued surveillance is needed to determine if this genotype remains the dominant genotype, as well as whether the norovirus season continues to start earlier than previous years," wrote two of the CDC's top norovirus researchers, in &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/7/25-0524_article" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;an article&lt;/a&gt; published this month by the agency's Emerging Infectious Diseases journal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outbreaks have &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/norovirus/php/reporting/norostat-data.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;since slowed&lt;/a&gt; to usual levels. But with GII.17 now identified in more than 3 in 4 outbreaks in the U.S., its displacement of the GII.4 strain that had previously been dominant is raising questions about whether norovirus season could arrive early again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"GII.4 viruses are the main driver for norovirus seasonality. With the decrease of GII.4 outbreaks since 2024, whether GII.17 viruses will continue to cause an earlier onset of the norovirus season cannot yet be determined," the CDC researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

    
&lt;p id="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" data-ad="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" class="ad-mpu-plus-outstream-middle ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='"mpu-plus-outstream-middle"'&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several other countries also saw unusually large or shifted waves of norovirus this past year, after GII.17 surged to dominance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In England, norovirus reports &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/health-protection-report-volume-19-2025/hpr-volume-19-issue-2-news-27-february-2025#:~:text=27-february-2025-,Update%20on%20increasing%20levels%20of%20norovirus%20activity%20in%20England%2C%20February,2)%20(Figure%201)." target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;reached&lt;/a&gt; levels more than double recent seasons. GII.17 was the most frequently reported genotype of norovirus &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/national-norovirus-and-rotavirus-surveillance-reports-2024-to-2025-season/national-norovirus-and-rotavirus-report-week-19-report-data-to-week-17-data-up-to-27-april-2025" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;through April&lt;/a&gt;, far above GII.4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Japan, where GII.17 &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/23/8/16-1138_article" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;previously drove&lt;/a&gt; a wave of infections a decade ago, local health authorities in Tokyo &lt;a href="https://idsc.tmiph.metro.tokyo.lg.jp/diseases/gastro/gastro/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; a steep wave of infectious gastroenteritis — most from norovirus — that peaked weeks later than previous seasons and remains above recent years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.erasmusmc.nl/en/research/researchers/graaf-miranda-de" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Miranda de Graaf&lt;/a&gt;, a scientist at Erasmus University Medical Center in the Netherlands coordinating the global &lt;a href="https://www.rivm.nl/en/noronet" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;NoroNet&lt;/a&gt; network of norovirus researchers, said the Dutch nation did not see an earlier start to its norovirus season. But the country did see higher numbers of norovirus outbreaks, including a few large outbreaks in between when the usual seasonal surges occurred.&lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="leader-plus-inc3" data-ad="leader-plus-inc" class="ad-leader-plus-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["leader-plus-inc",3]'&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GII.4 was still being detected around the world, meaning it was possible that GII.17's dominance could be short-lived, de Graaf said. Researchers had &lt;a href="https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES2015.20.26.21178#html_fulltext" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;previously wondered&lt;/a&gt; if GII.17 could permanently take over, only to see GII.4 cases continue to remain dominant. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"GII.17 only replaced GII.4 last year, and there has not been another seasonal peak after that. Therefore it is not clear if these shifts will last, or if GII.17 will be the predominant strain next winter season," de Graaf said in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://sph.emory.edu/faculty/profile/index.php?FID=benjamin-lopman-8568" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Benjamin Lopman&lt;/a&gt;, an epidemiology professor at Emory University who previously worked for the CDC's viral diseases division, said shifts in norovirus strains happen "when new variants find ways around the immunity that people have built up" to previous strains. He said that new strains usually trigger more frequent outbreaks earlier in the season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I expect we'll see outbreak patterns return to more typical levels and seasonal patterns in the coming years, though it's always challenging to predict how these viruses will behave," Lopman said in an email.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;A dangerous fungal pathogen has proven no match for what may be one of the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2023.1200269"&gt;most useful plants in nature&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists studying the chemical properties of cannabis have found it kills one of the most dangerous fungal pathogens in the world – in a laboratory setting, at least.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptococcus_neoformans"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Cryptococcus neoformans&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a species of fungus behind &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/cryptococcosis/about/index.html"&gt;cryptococcosis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.health.vic.gov.au/infectious-diseases/cryptococcosis"&gt;cryptococcal meningitis&lt;/a&gt;, appears to be vulnerable to topical treatment with cannabidiol and cannabidivarin, compounds found in the plant &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabis_sativa"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Cannabis sativa&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"When &lt;i&gt;Cryptococcus neoformans&lt;/i&gt; gets to your central nervous system, it causes life-threatening meningitis," &lt;a href="https://www.scimex.org/newsfeed/cannabidiol-shows-promise-as-treatment-for-fungal-infections"&gt;explains biologist Hue Dinh&lt;/a&gt; of Macquarie University in Australia. "The mortality rate is very high, and it's really hard to treat."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 youtube-iframe relative"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0ygtX2nyexo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fungal pathogens pose a pretty significant threat to human health, with &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/nmicrobiol.2017.120"&gt;around 300 species&lt;/a&gt; known to cause diseases in humans, with varying levels of severity. Because pathogens such as fungi and bacteria &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaad.2018.04.059"&gt;continually develop resistances to drugs&lt;/a&gt;, new treatment options are continually needed to keep them at bay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One strategy is to look at medications that have already been approved for human use for other ailments. Dinh and her colleagues turned their research to cannabis, isolating five compounds to test on &lt;i&gt;C. neoformans&lt;/i&gt; and a range of other pathogens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They isolated the fungal species in a lab, and applied the compounds. Cannabidiol (CBD), which is non-psychoactive, and cannabidivarin (CBDV), which is psychoactive, both killed &lt;i&gt;C. neoformans&lt;/i&gt; adroitly, acting even faster than current antifungal treatments. They were also effective at eradicating the fungal pathogens responsible for such conditions as jock itch and athlete's foot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Proteomics analysis revealed that the antifungal activity of CBD and CBDV was linked to destabilization of the membrane, alterations in ergosterol biosynthesis, disruption of metabolic pathways, as well as selective involvement of mitochondrial-associated proteins," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0013081"&gt;the researchers wrote in their paper&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's one thing to kill a fungus in a petri dish, but quite another to observe the treatment working in a living system. To test their findings further, the researchers turned to &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galleria_mellonella"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Galleria mellonella&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the greater wax moth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 youtube-iframe relative"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/w-dxMTDzMLY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/21505594.2015.1135289"&gt;larvae of this moth&lt;/a&gt; possess an innate immune response that is similar to that of mammals. They are also inexpensive to obtain, have short lifespans, and require no special equipment to keep, making them an excellent model for large-scale studies of infectious pathogens and the treatments thereof.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moth larvae were given small burn wounds, and then divided into groups. One group was left alone with just the burn wounds as a control; the remainder were infected with &lt;i&gt;C. neoformans&lt;/i&gt;, and treated with different medicaments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One group was treated with CBD dissolved in dimethyl sulfide. Another group was treated with dimethyl sulfide without the CBD. Finally, the last group was treated using Amphotericin B, a medication used to treat serious fungal infections in humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results were striking. The survival rate of the larvae treated with CBD was significantly higher than the survival rate of the larvae treated with the dimethyl sulfide alone, and also higher than the survival rate of the Amphotericin B group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_163523" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-163523" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/worms-burn.jpg" alt="" class="size-full wp-image-163523" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/worms-burn.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/worms-burn-600x198.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-163523" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The survival rate of larvae infected with &lt;em&gt;C. neoformans&lt;/em&gt; and given various treatments. (Dinh et al., &lt;em&gt;PLOS NTDs&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, it was nearly as high as the survival rate of the control group – the larvae that had not been infected with the fungus at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the treatment of infections that reach the lungs and brain is a bit more complicated, the result suggests that, at the very least, the topical application of cannabidiol might be effective at treating a range of fungal skin infections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"If we can demonstrate that these ones work well for common infections," &lt;a href="https://www.scimex.org/newsfeed/cannabidiol-shows-promise-as-treatment-for-fungal-infections"&gt;Dinh says&lt;/a&gt;, "you could actually just get some CBD oil and then rub it on your skin to treat it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0013081"&gt;&lt;i&gt;PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

She then realized that the blood came from her anus and thought it was a hemorrhoid. When she went in for a doctor to address it, she learned some worrisome news — she had Stage 3 anal cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“The surgeon, she said, ‘It’s cancer and we found out it was not just one but two tumors,” DeVillers says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-e9cff2" class="body-heading"&gt;Fatigue and bleeding &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;In March 2022, DeVillers noticed she was bleeding a lot. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“I was bleeding when I was going to the bathroom. At first, honestly, I thought perimenopause,” she explains. “I didn’t know the bleeding was coming from my tush. I thought I was getting my period again.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;She also felt exhausted, but thought it was to due being busy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“I had started feeling more fatigued, but I was also traveling for work, so I chalked it up to that,” she says. “I was both fatigued and scared about why I was bleeding.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;When DeVillers noticed the blood was coming from her anus, she reached out to her doctor, who consulted with a gastrointestinal doctor. They suspected DeVillers had a hemorrhoid and recommended Devillers try hemorrhoid cream. If her symptoms did not improve in three months, she should visit the GI doctor. Yet the intensity of the bleeding worried her and she wanted a solution. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“It wasn’t non-stop. All of a sudden, I would have a gush of blood,” she says. “I really begged them to put me on a waiting list.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The office was able to schedule DeVillers for surgery to have the hemorrhoid removed in May 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“When I came out of it, I was really groggy from the anesthesia, but I remember my husband was holding one hand and my doctor was holding the other hand,” DeVillers says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;That’s when the doctor broke the news that DeVillers had cancer. After determining that she had Stage 3 anal cancer because it had spread to her lymph nodes, doctors came up with a treatment plan that included IV chemotherapy “every couple of weeks,” plus radiation and oral chemotherapy for five days a week for six weeks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“It’s really intensive,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii styles_portrait__NEQhG" id="anchor-f695a4"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-06/Julia-DeVillers-cancer-mc-250603-02-9af3fe.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-06/Julia-DeVillers-cancer-mc-250603-02-9af3fe.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-06/Julia-DeVillers-cancer-mc-250603-02-9af3fe.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-06/Julia-DeVillers-cancer-mc-250603-02-9af3fe.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-06/Julia-DeVillers-cancer-mc-250603-02-9af3fe.jpg" alt=" Julia DeVillers"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;While in the intensive care unit, Julia DeVillers didn't remember much of her stay.

My whole system collapsed.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;DeVillers spent the next five weeks in the intensive care unit. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“I remember about two of them and the first week I think went fairly well. I was lucid. I was talking,” she says. “They were figuring out what’s going on, pumping me with fluids.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;By the second week, doctors noticed her blood cell counts had plummeted and called her children because they were unsure how much time DeVillers had left. They also enlisted hospice care. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“That was horrible for my family,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;She felt her “body shutting down.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“I saw this dark tunnel and it had two pricks of white light,” she says. This lasted “a day or two and I felt darkness. I was very depressed.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;She received a blood transfusion. Soon, DeVillers began feeling better, and “the tunnel got lighter and lighter.” While she was in the ICU, she did not continue with chemotherapy. She lost about 30 pounds while there and was “really weak, very frail.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“Even as sick as I was, they wheeled me into radiation,” she says. “My radiologist, I’ll forever be grateful for him. He said, ‘If we stop now, it could come back. But if we keep going to radiation … that’s what’s going to get rid of the tumor.’” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Three months after she finished treatment in August 2022, doctors told her they had “cautious good news” that there were no signs of cancer remaining, but they still worried about a lymph node that caused a visible bump on her abdomen. Six months after treatment, she was cancer-free. It took all that time for her to rebuild her strength from being in the ICU. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“I had in-home health care for months because I was hooked up to a food IV bag and I was still not allowed to eat,” she says. “I stayed in bed a lot but I could get up and walk. So that was wonderful.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-bf8430" class="body-heading"&gt;Anal cancer &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Anal cancer differs from colorectal cancer even though they share some symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“Colorectal cancer comes from the cells that line the inside of your GI tract, while anal cancer comes from the skin cells that are the same as the skin that is covering the rest of your body,” Dr. Emily Huang, a colon and rectal surgeon, and the Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, where DeVillers received treatment, tells TODAY.com. “The vast majority of anal cancers are associated with HPV.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii" id="anchor-3bd01b"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-06/Julia-DeVillers-cancer-mc-250603-04-fe57db.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-06/Julia-DeVillers-cancer-mc-250603-04-fe57db.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-06/Julia-DeVillers-cancer-mc-250603-04-fe57db.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-06/Julia-DeVillers-cancer-mc-250603-04-fe57db.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-06/Julia-DeVillers-cancer-mc-250603-04-fe57db.jpg" alt=" Julia DeVillers"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;Julia DeVillers experienced complications from treatment. Even when she was in the ICU and weak, she kept going to radiation, which helped eliminate her cancer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;Courtesy Julia DeVillers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;HPV, otherwise known as the human papillomavirus, is a common virus often spread through skin-to-skin contact. It can cause six types of cancer including anal, cervical, vaginal, vulvar, penile and throat cancer, according to past &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/disease/cancer-vaccine-hpv-rcna195393?search=HPV" target="_blank"&gt;TODAY.com reporting&lt;/a&gt;. But these cancers can be prevented. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“We do a lot to prevent HPV-associated cancers through things like vaccination,” Huang says. “We do screening for HPV-related cancers.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The HPV vaccine is 97% effective at preventing cancers associated with the virus because it protects people from developing six high-risk strains of HPV likely to cause cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“One of the things that (we) can do is actually get someone who’s not already vaccinated, vaccinate,” Huang says. “It gets the immune system revved up to help fight the infection that is the root cause for the cancer.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Symptoms of anal cancer are similar to colorectal cancer signs. Anal cancer symptoms include: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="break-above body-ul body-list-el"&gt;&lt;li&gt;A lump or mass on the anus &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul class="break-above body-ul body-list-el"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Treatment for anal cancer includes radiation. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“The good news about anal cancer is that it is actually very, very effectively treated by radiation therapy, specifically chemo radiation,” Huang says. “Those types of skin cells are highly responsive to radiation and so the majority of people who are diagnosed with anal cancer and undergo chemoradiation actually have a complete cure.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Anal cancer “is pretty uncommon, though we don’t know with the rise of HPV-related cancer, in general, whether that’s going to change.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;With the increase in colorectal cancer, Huang says patients are more comfortable talking about bleeding or bowel changes. Still, there’s a stigma associated with anal cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“I frequently get patients who come into clinic saying, ‘I was embarrassed to even talk about this,’” she says. “These bothersome and slightly embarrassing symptoms might be easy to chalk up to something much simpler (like hemorrhoids).” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-7254a0" class="body-heading"&gt;Overcoming the stigma&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;As a writer, DeVillers shied away from bawdy humor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“I’m a children’s book author, and people would say, ‘Oh add a fart to the book.’ I’m like ‘Oh I’m squeamish. I don’t want to talk about farts and butt jokes,’” she says. “I’ve changed obviously my whole attitude for both awareness and dark humor of the situation.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;At first, she “felt really embarrassed,” when she was diagnosed with anal cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii" id="anchor-ca3fe5"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-06/Julia-DeVillers-cancer-mc-250603-05-1fd554.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-06/Julia-DeVillers-cancer-mc-250603-05-1fd554.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-06/Julia-DeVillers-cancer-mc-250603-05-1fd554.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-06/Julia-DeVillers-cancer-mc-250603-05-1fd554.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-06/Julia-DeVillers-cancer-mc-250603-05-1fd554.jpg" alt=" Julia DeVillers"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;At first, Julie DeVillers felt ashamed of having anal cancer and called it 'tush cancer' or anything that sounded less embarrassing. Soon, she realized the importance of speaking up about anal cancer as rates of HPV related cancers are increasing. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;Courtesy Julia DeVillers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;When people asked her about it, she would say, “’Yeah, I’ve got tush cancer.’ ‘Yeah, I’ve got ass cancer.’ Anything so I didn’t have to say anal and then I learned anal cancer is a different animal from rectal or colon cancer.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;It’s been three years since her diagnosis, and DeVillers scans and bloodwork have all been normal, which is “cause for a small celebration.” She joined the board of the HPV Cancer Alliance to raise awareness of the various cancers caused by the virus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“Women get it. Men get it,” she says. “It’s all directly related to getting HPV.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;She recently published her first book since her diagnosis, “Meet Me at Wonderland,” which has themes that came from her ICU stay. Doctors would ask her questions, such as, ‘What do you do for work,’ to test her lucidity. She answered she worked at Chuck E. Cheese, a job she held in high school when she often wore the rat costume. While telling her agent this story, she recalled an embarrassing anecdote that became the foundation for the meet cute at the beginning of her latest novel. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“I went into the break room, and I took off my rat head and there was a very cute boy sitting in front of me filling out his job application. I remember thinking, ‘Oh no, I can’t meet a boy like this,’” she says. “It’s not like I wanted my next book idea to come because I’m on my deathbed, but it did.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>TODAY.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Jun 2025 17:17:50 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinwFBVV95cUxQdE5CRE1zSWZwOGNZWXZKWS1ueVhRZTdiTk51cDVmMWhIeGR5REZCT2Nqc2t6T0N5QmNXakdGMy1fZHVqQ2JkTzRtc0tmYUFNQmo4UlJ0QkJBS196a2ZKcEpkS2pBcE43VEVQaVVxYlJkYXdWOEl6dUhsclFqMEF3NlgwRm41SGJLNlU2anlWX3hLV1ZhNGttNGFhUU94dEHSAVRBVV95cUxPSklxa0dJdkkycm5nUE1NTllGRl96eExMTkFBRU5GdnMzdnc3cmRUOC1GczJ6aGhIc2tmWXFxUUJpUTN1LS1ONmR4cWVrZENuSWdJbEE</guid></item><item><title>医生发现预防心脏病和糖尿病的食物…… 90%的美国人吃得不够--《每日邮报》 | Doctors discover food that prevents heart disease and diabetes... and 90% of Americans don't eat enough of it - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqAFBVV95cUxNbE5NMmNSeEREcUZlZm5TTXVHZTdZRS00RlJxZlB0cE90VnFaU2JjOGRUbDVGUkJURFc2bk9hM2RMMExwcWdrY0RncnB5Nm1Hd3lpazRsTFZMNF9EX29YSUtiNUpZUnp2anpueFhCeTFHLXpFZnZGR2psNmREWFI0dlM4alRydXIxR0pUUVFSMGZwYWhnS2RSY2VpWmVaZWNQT0cyLVhqcFPSAa4BQVVfeXFMTmxaR2VZTWVCZXZvYVpsa0xHemNEc05ObkZYVEZXaHBkdmFEMVVZUEp6eDNyQkVPbkwtQU8yOGZvVURQS1FfVV9LUUMtNnBjckhETGRCMFZEb2tqQy14UGd1dEJkNFY2TndvLTlmaGppU1pXOTZXTWpfU3ZhSXNJVnN0MS16OVZDWTkyUHBDVzJ4OFFRcGhQdXVDTWZRYmdMbXE0aEN4OVJiOF9hcHVn?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Regularly eating a combination of fruits, vegetables, nuts and whole grains may reduce your risk of developing two of the most deadly chronic diseases, a study suggests. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A group of American researchers discovered phytosterols, a compound found naturally in a variety of foods like nuts, seeds, grains and vegetable oils, can help improve metabolism and reduce inflammation - keeping both heart disease and type 2 diabetes at bay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, up to 90 percent of Americans don't eat the recommended daily serving of fruits, vegetables, nuts and whole grains. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Phytosterols are compounds similar to cholesterol and are promoted as a way to improve heart health and decrease blood levels of LDL (bad) cholesterol as they are known to absorb the fat-like substance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now, the new study suggests high phytosterol intake can also improve insulin regulation, reduce heart inflammation and contribute to a healthy metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Type 2 diabetes is the most common form of diabetes globally and &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/news/article-14365571/Coffee-reduce-type-2-diabetes.html"&gt;over 37million American adults suffer from it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The American Heart Association reports about 48 percent of Americans are living with some type of cardiovascular disease and CVD is the number one killer in the US - accounting for about one in five deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Fenglei Wang, lead author and research associate at Harvard University, said the findings support claims that eating a healthy plant-based diet with plenty of vegetables and whole grains can be beneficial for humans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Regularly eating a combination of fruits, vegetables, nuts and whole grains may reduce your risk of developing heart disease and Type 2 diabetes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While phytosterols are found in all plant foods, the highest concentrations are found in unrefined plant oils, including vegetable, nuts and olive oils. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nuts such as almonds, pistachio and cashews; seeds such as pumpkin, sunflower and watermelon; whole grains such as oats and barley as well as legumes such as chickpeas, lentils and soybeans are also good dietary sources of phytosterols. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The compound is also found in vegetables such as artichokes, broccoli, green beans, sweet potatoes and cauliflower as well as fruits such as pineapples, oranges, berries and bananas. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers followed over 200,000 American adults for 36 years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The participants were asked to periodically answer questionnaires on dietary intake to measure how much phytosterol-rich food they were consuming. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Their answers were then evaluated using a variety of statistical models to discover their likelihood of developing Type 2 diabetes and heart disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;During the follow-up period, the researchers noted over 20,000 study participants developed Type 2 &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/diabetes/index.html" id="mol-d7287a20-4079-11f0-84c9-e91538c4e9b7"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; and nearly 16,000 developed heart disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The researchers suggest that eating a healthy diet rich in plant-based foods can help to prevent or delay heart disease&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Results showed those who consumed about five servings of vegetables, three servings of fruit, two servings of whole grains and half a serving of nuts - all of which are high in phytosterols - per day were about 10 percent less likely to develop either conditions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But nearly no American reaches these benchmarks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers also analyzed metabolites - products of metabolism - and other metabolic biomarkers present in blood samples from about 40,000 people to understand the effect of phytosterols on the calorie-burning process. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group floatRHS"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pictured: Dr Fenglei Wang, lead author and research associate at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They discovered those who consumed phytosterols had better metabolism - which helped control insulin levels and inflammation around the heart. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Wang noted the results showed consuming phytosterols may reduce the risk for Type 2 diabetes by reducing insulin resistance in the body and stave off heart disease by preventing inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The foods studied as part of the research are recommended as part of a healthy and well-rounded diet and have been linked to multiple health benefits also because of their antioxidants and fiber.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The scientists in the most recent study, however, did not specify how they observed the benefits stemmed from the consumption of phytosterols specifically. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study was presented today at the Bioactives for Brain and Cardiometabolic Health session in Orange County, Florida and will later be published in the journal Nutrition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Dr. Benjamin Han, a geriatrician and addiction medicine specialist at the University of California, San Diego, tells his students a cautionary tale about a 76-year-old patient who, like many older people, struggled with insomnia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“She had problems falling asleep, and she’d wake up in the middle of the night,” he said. “So her daughter brought her some sleep gummies” — edible cannabis candies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“She tried a gummy after dinner and waited half an hour,” Han said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feeling no effects, she took another gummy, then another — a total of four over several hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Han advises patients who are trying cannabis to “start low; go slow,” beginning with products that contain just 1 or 2.5 milligrams of tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, the psychoactive ingredient that many cannabis products contain. Each of the four gummies this patient took, however, contained 10 milligrams. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The woman started feeling intense anxiety and experiencing heart palpitations. A young person might have shrugged off such symptoms, but this patient had hypertension and the heart arrhythmia called atrial fibrillation. Frightened, she went to an emergency room. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lab tests and a cardiac workup determined that the woman wasn’t having a heart attack, and the staff sent her home. Her only lingering symptom was embarrassment, Han said. But what if she’d grown dizzy or lightheaded and was hurt in a fall? He said he has had patients injured in falls or while driving after using cannabis. What if the cannabis had interacted with the prescription drugs she took? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As a geriatrician, it gives me pause,” Han said. “Our brains are more sensitive to psychoactive substances as we age.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thirty-nine states and Washington, D.C., now allow cannabis use for medical reasons, and in 24 of those states, as well as Washington, D.C., recreational use is also legal. As older adults’ use climbs, “the benefits are still unclear,” Han said. “But we’re seeing more evidence of potential harms.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A wave of recent research points to reasons for concern for older users, with cannabis-related ER visits and hospitalizations rising, and a Canadian study finding an association between such acute care and subsequent dementia. Older people are more apt than younger ones to try cannabis for therapeutic reasons — to relieve chronic pain, insomnia or mental health issues. But evidence of its effectiveness in addressing those conditions remains thin, experts said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an analysis of national survey data &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2834781?guestAccessKey=6fb7097a-4590-4b78-b8a5-b21f5b00def4&amp;amp;utm_source=For_The_Media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;amp;utm_term=060225" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;published Monday in the medical journal JAMA&lt;/a&gt;, Han and his colleagues reported that “current” cannabis use (defined as use within the previous 30 days) had jumped among adults 65 and older to 7% of respondents in 2023 from 4.8% in 2021. Back in 2005, he pointed out, less than 1% of older adults reported using cannabis in the previous &lt;em&gt;year&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What’s driving the increase? Experts cite the steady march of state legalization — use by older people is highest in those states — while surveys show that the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8440375/" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;perceived risk of cannabis use&lt;/a&gt; has declined. One national survey found that a growing proportion of American adults — 44% in 2021 — &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37566411/" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;erroneously thought it safer to smoke cannabis daily than cigarettes&lt;/a&gt;. The authors of the study, in JAMA Network Open, noted that “these views do not reflect the existing science on cannabis and tobacco smoke.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cannabis industry also markets its products to older adults. The Trulieve chain gives a 10% discount, both in stores and online, to “wisdom customers” 55 and older. RISE Dispensaries ran a yearlong “cannabis education and empowerment” program for two senior centers in Paterson, New Jersey, including field trips to its dispensary. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The industry has many satisfied older customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liz Logan, 67, a freelance writer in Bronxville, New York, had grappled with sleep problems and anxiety for years, but the conditions grew particularly debilitating two years ago, as her husband was dying of Parkinson’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’d frequently be awake until 5 or 6 in the morning,” she said. “It makes you crazy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="userMessagingInset" class="user-messaging animate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking online for edible cannabis products, Logan found that gummies containing cannabidiol, known as CBD, alone didn’t help, but those with 10 milligrams of THC did the trick without noticeable side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I don’t worry about sleep anymore,” she said. “I’ve solved a lifelong problem.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But studies in the United States and Canada, &lt;a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/programs/engaging-cannabis-legalization-regulation-canada-taking-stock-progress/document.html" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;which legalized nonmedical cannabis nationally in 2018&lt;/a&gt;, show climbing rates of older people seeking medical treatment for cannabis-related issues, both &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2820100" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;in outpatient settings and in hospitals&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In California, for instance, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36622838/" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;cannabis-related ER visits by those 65 and older rose&lt;/a&gt; to about 395 per 100,000 visits in 2019, from 21 in 2005.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Ontario, acute care (meaning emergency visits or hospital admissions) resulting from cannabis use increased fivefold in middle-aged adults between 2008 and 2021, and &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40227745/" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;more than 26-fold among those 65 and older&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s not reflective of everyone who’s using cannabis,” cautioned Dr. Daniel Myran, an investigator at the Bruyère Health Research Institute in Ottawa and lead author of the Ontario study. “It’s capturing people with more severe patterns.” &lt;/p&gt;      &lt;p&gt;But since other studies have shown &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39112780/" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;increased cardiac risk &lt;/a&gt;among some cannabis users with heart disease or diabetes, “there’s a number of warning signals,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, a significant proportion of older veterans who currently use cannabis screen positive for &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2833976" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;cannabis use disorder&lt;/a&gt;, a recent JAMA Open study found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As with other substance-abuse disorders, such patients “can tolerate high amounts,” said the lead author, Vira Pravosud, a cannabis researcher at the Northern California Institute for Research and Education. “They continue using even if it interferes with their social or work or family obligations” and may experience withdrawal if they stop. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among 4,500 older veterans (average age: 73) seeking care at Veterans Affairs health facilities, researchers found that more than 10% had reported cannabis use within the past 30 days. Of those, 36% fit the criteria for &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9590423/#:~:text=DSM-5%20CUD%20criteria%20include,6)%20social%2C%20occupational%2C%20or" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;mild, moderate or severe cannabis use disorder&lt;/a&gt;, as established in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;VA patients differ from the general population, Pravosud noted. They are much more likely to report substance abuse and have “higher rates of chronic diseases and disabilities, and mental health conditions like PTSD” that could lead to self-medication, she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Current VA policies don’t require clinicians to ask patients about cannabis use. Pravosud thinks that they should.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="userMessagingPostscript" class="user-messaging animate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, “there’s increasing evidence of a potential effect on memory and cognition,” said Myran, citing his team’s study of Ontario patients with cannabis-related conditions going to emergency departments or being admitted to hospitals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It showed that compared with others of the same age and sex who were seeking care for other reasons, these patients (ages 45 to 105) had 1.5 times the risk of a dementia diagnosis within five years, and 3.9 times the risk of the general population. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even after adjusting for chronic health conditions and sociodemographic factors, those seeking acute care resulting from cannabis use had &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40227745/" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;a 23% higher dementia risk&lt;/a&gt; than patients with noncannabis-related ailments, and a 72% higher risk than the general population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of these studies were randomized clinical trials, the researchers pointed out; they were observational and could not ascertain causality. Some cannabis research doesn’t specify whether users are smoking, vaping, ingesting or rubbing topical cannabis on aching joints; other studies lack relevant demographic information. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s very frustrating that we’re not able to provide more individual guidance on safer modes of consumption and on amounts of use that seem lower risk,” Myran said. “It just highlights that the rapid expansion of regular cannabis use in North America is outpacing our knowledge.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="pull-quote-embed embed-container u-border-light-gray u-border-b u-border-t u-tc mv-40 pt-10 pb-15"&gt;&lt;p class="pull-quote-content"&gt;It’s very frustrating that we’re not able to provide more individual guidance on safer modes of consumption and on amounts of use that seem lower risk. It just highlights that the rapid expansion of regular cannabis use in North America is outpacing our knowledge.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;— Dr. Daniel Myran, an investigator at the Bruyère Health Research Institute in Ottawa&lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, given the health vulnerabilities of older people, and the far greater potency of current cannabis products than the weed of their youth, he and other researchers urge caution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you view cannabis as a medicine, you should be open to the idea that there are groups who probably shouldn’t use it and that there are potential adverse effects from it,” he said. “Because that is true of all medicines.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New Old Age is produced through a partnership with KFF Health News.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p id="userMessagingIn-story"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;A woman’s practice of nasal irrigation led to her death via brain-eating amoeba. In a recent case report, health officials described how she contracted a fatal infection of &lt;em&gt;Naegleria fowleri&lt;/em&gt; through tainted tap water sourced from a recreational vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Federal and local health officials in Texas &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7419a4.htm"&gt;detailed&lt;/a&gt; the unusual death last week in the CDC’s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. The 71-year-old woman developed neurological symptoms days after using a nasal irrigation device and died only a week later. These infections, while rare, can be prevented through practical safety measures, such as only using sterilized water for nasal irrigation, officials say.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;N. fowleri&lt;/em&gt; is a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/naegleria/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;shapeshifting amoeba&lt;/a&gt; that lives in soil and warm freshwater. It typically feeds on bacteria and isn’t dangerous to humans when it’s simply ingested. But when the amoeba enters our body through the nose, it can end up in the brain. Once there, the amoeba will literally feast on brain cells and trigger massive inflammation, causing a severe brain infection known as &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8469197/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;primary amebic meningoencephalitis&lt;/a&gt;, or PAM.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the MMWR report, the previously healthy woman sought medical care with fever, headache, and altered mental status. Four days earlier, she had irrigated her nose with tap water from an RV’s water system at a campground in Texas. Doctors quickly suspected PAM, but even with treatment, she developed seizures and died eight days after her symptoms began. The bizarre nature of her death then prompted an investigation by the Texas Department of State Health Services and the CDC.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Officials tested both the water from the RV’s portable water tank and the nearby municipal water system the RV may have been connected to during the trip. Neither source tested positive for the amoeba, and officials were only able to sample the water 23 days after the woman’s exposure, so the environmental conditions may have simply changed by then. But they did find evidence that the RV’s water system wasn’t properly disinfected to prevent contamination, likely explaining how the amoeba found its way into the woman’s tap water.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“This case reinforces the potential for serious health risks associated with improper use of nasal irrigation devices, as well as the importance of maintaining RV water quality and ensuring that municipal water systems adhere to regulatory standards,” the officials wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;PAM is very rare, with only around &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/naegleria/graphs.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;150 cases&lt;/a&gt; reported since the amoeba was discovered in the 1960s, but it’s nearly always fatal once symptoms start. Most infections are typically caught when people get water up their nose while swimming in warm lakes. But the amoeba can also survive in drinking or recreational water systems, especially if they’re not properly sterilized. And there have been several cases of people getting infected through using contaminated tap water for nasal irrigation (irrigation is usually performed to clear the sinuses in people with allergies or respiratory infections).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The report authors say that PAM can be easily prevented through recommended nasal irrigation practices, which include only relying on distilled, sterilized, or boiled and cooled tap water for irrigation. This latest case also highlights the unique danger posed by improperly cleaned RV water systems. So Texas and federal health officials have now created an &lt;a href="https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/178019#tabs-3the"&gt;infographic&lt;/a&gt; for RV users to follow so they can lower their risk of PAM and other waterborne illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

Instead of looking at gene expression broadly, they zoomed in on the exon level—the building blocks that influence how proteins are made.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found that gene activity differences were only apparent at this finer scale, not at the whole-gene level. The study revealed that disruptions in stress hormone regulation, dopamine signaling, and circadian rhythms are common to multiple disorders, including schizophrenia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exon-Level Insights:&lt;/strong&gt; Psychiatric patients showed differences from healthy individuals only at the exon level, not the whole-gene level.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shared Pathways:&lt;/strong&gt; Disruptions in circadian rhythm, cortisol release, and dopamine pathways were common across disorders.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Toward Precision Psychiatry:&lt;/strong&gt; Findings support classifying psychiatric disorders by biological mechanisms, not just symptoms.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Max Planck Society&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Researchers at the Max Planck Institute of Psychiatry, Helmholtz Munich and the University of Sydney identified biological mechanisms that are shared across psychiatric disorders. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To do so, the team analyzed postmortem brain tissue samples from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This area of the brain is the center for reasoning and emotions in the brain, and is often implicated in psychiatric disorders. Samples from affected individuals, most of whom were schizophrenia patients, and healthy controls were included in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What makes this study special: The research team combined several different layers of genetic data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In contrast to studies that look at gene expression as a whole, we analyzed the exon level to better understand the structure of the genes. This detailed approach gave us a better understanding of how genetic variation influences disease risk”, first author Karolina Worf explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exons are the essential, information-containing segments of a gene. In addition to providing the blueprint for building proteins, they also determine which versions of a protein ultimately arise from a gene. This happens through alternative splicing, a process that occurs in over 95 percent of human genes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Differences at the exon level&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Including the exon level in the analysis was an important step: While samples from psychiatric patients and healthy controls were not significantly different at the gene level, they were significantly different at the exon level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The risk of developing a psychiatric disorder seems to therefore not just depend on what genes you have, but how your genes are expressed”, Janine Knauer-Arloth, leader of the Project Group Medical Genomics at the Max Planck Institute of Psychiatry, explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team integrated different genetic data, including variations in individual base pairs of DNA (single nucleotide polymorphisms), rare genetic variants and polygenic risk scores, which summarize a person’s disease risk by aggregating all relevant genetic variants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This way, the researchers discovered disruptions in pathways related to the circadian rhythm, the release of the stress hormone cortisol, and the neurotransmitter dopamine — across all three included disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results show that psychiatric disorders share a common biological basis. In the long-term, this knowledge can help researchers to classify psychiatric disorders not only based on symptoms, but also based on biological mechanisms. This paradigm shift is significant a step towards more precise diagnoses and treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this genetics and mental health research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mpg.de/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Anke Schlee&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mpg.de/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Max Planck Society&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Anke Schlee – Max Planck Society&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41398-025-03366-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Exon-variant interplay and multi-modal evidence identify endocrine dysregulation in severe psychiatric disorders impacting excitatory neurons&lt;/a&gt;” by Janine Knauer-Arloth et al. &lt;em&gt;Translational Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exon-variant interplay and multi-modal evidence identify endocrine dysregulation in severe psychiatric disorders impacting excitatory neurons&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bipolar disorder (BD), major depressive disorder (MDD), and schizophrenia share genetic architecture, yet their molecular mechanisms remain elusive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both common and rare genetic variants contribute to neural dysfunction, impacting cognition and behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study investigates the molecular effects of genetic variants on human cortical single-cell types using a single-exon analysis approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Integrating exon-level eQTLs (common variants influencing exon expression) and joint exon eQT-Scores (combining polygenic risk scores with exon-level gene expression) from a postmortem psychiatric cohort (BD = 15, MDD = 24, schizophrenia = 68, controls = 62) with schizophrenia-focused rare variant data from the SCHEMA consortium, we identified 110 core genes enriched in pathways including circadian entrainment (FDR = 0.02), cortisol synthesis and secretion (FDR = 0.026), and dopaminergic synapse (FDR = 0.038).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional enriched pathways included hormone signaling (FDRs &amp;lt; 0.0298, including insulin, GnRH, aldosterone, and growth hormone pathways) and, notably, adrenergic signaling in cardiomyocytes (FDR = 0.0028). These pathways highlight shared molecular mechanisms in the three disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Single-nuclei RNA sequencing data from three cortical regions revealed that these core set genes are predominantly expressed in excitatory neuron layers 2–6 of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, linking molecular changes to cell types involved in cognitive dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our results demonstrate the power of integrating multimodal genetic and transcriptomic data at the exon level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This approach moves beyond symptom-based diagnoses toward molecular classifications, identifying potential therapeutic targets for psychiatric disorders.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Jun 2025 15:59:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidEFVX3lxTFBTYkNLTUJVWFdaT3k2cmliUzY3SThoUVFmUTNzLVFLQXpnb0lEUVBTanFFUzctUFl0cWUzRTd2S2ZYSkZLbFhEQjk4V3JLUF9fczFlUk1OdkhzQ3ZwV1N0UHRvNWVfMDBnSEtPcXBjOERvNkpU</guid></item></channel></rss>
