When it’s acute, it tends to start suddenly, with an obvious cause (like a broken bone) and a standard fix. But chronic pain, experienced by 1 in 5 adults in the United States, persists for more than three months (or beyond an injury’s expected healing time). And it sometimes doesn’t have a clear cause. So if you have chronic pain, how can you find relief and improve your quality of life? “We’ve learned a lot in recent years about the major differences between acute and chronic pain, which require vastly different approaches,” says Kimeron Hardin, a clinical psychologist and president of the American Association of Pain Psychology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-subscribe-cta" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="T2HA77FFDZG33OOI756EFKY7TQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Chronic pain goes beyond the sensory experience of “how much does it hurt and where does it hurt?” says Steven P. Cohen, an anesthesiology professor and vice chair of research and pain medicine at the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago. Our thoughts, emotions and behavior can significantly affect the physical sensation of chronic pain, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="GZWA7WCR7BFKDNRVYSXOSVNZYA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Medication, physical therapy, steroid injections and implanted devices may be helpful, but newer research has discovered that techniques that target the psychological aspects of pain can also provide relief. In this article, we look at three such treatments. Ask your primary care provider if any of these might be an option. They can refer you to a licensed mental health professional who specializes in chronic pain. You can also find specialists at &lt;a href="http://aapainpsychology.org/" target="_blank"&gt;aapainpsychology.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="EBXF2LD3GFDFJEGFHECI3RR7EI" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="EBXF2LD3GFDFJEGFHECI3RR7EI" data-testid="article-header"&gt;Cognitive behavioral therapy&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="AAIGDAFO5ZBK3LMVRARSNABZFQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;This is a form of talk therapy that helps people identify negative thoughts and behaviors and develop skills to change them. For people with chronic pain, expecting the worst or focusing on the pain can actually increase the discomfort they feel. “Many people have fear-based or catastrophic thinking around pain that can make pain worse,” Hardin says. “CBT can help you understand patterns that might be exacerbating your pain and teach you how to recognize and replace those thoughts with something that’s soothing, comforting and even more accurate.” A &lt;a href="https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD007407.pub4/full" target="_blank"&gt;2020 Cochrane Review&lt;/a&gt; found that CBT led to a small but significant reduction in disability and distress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="J64GJMVRBRGCRPZOE3CQWX2CIU" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="J64GJMVRBRGCRPZOE3CQWX2CIU" data-testid="article-header"&gt;Acceptance and commitment therapy&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="RNP5PMQVUZDUZKPCR45VAKDW4A" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;This has some things in common with CBT but adds in mindfulness techniques. And while CBT focuses on changing the way people think about their pain, ACT helps people accept their pain and commit to lifestyle changes that will lessen its effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="GMJ53ZGQWRHALABKTY4REUBFYM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Such changes are standard advice for conditions like high blood pressure, and they can be helpful for treating chronic pain, too. Physical inactivity, stress and poor sleep are all linked to more severe chronic pain. ACT also helps people distill what matters most to their quality of life, such as family time, and then figure out which actions can facilitate that despite the pain. A &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35228207/" target="_blank"&gt;2022 review of 25 trials&lt;/a&gt; found that ACT helped reduce disability and depression and improve quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="ZZXFKSFJXVFSHL5EI2X7BKMS2E" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="ZZXFKSFJXVFSHL5EI2X7BKMS2E" data-testid="article-header"&gt;Pain reprocessing therapy&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="GCZF2MXEX5CH7LDTRA2TML5KEU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;People with chronic pain that has no identifiable cause — such as fibromyalgia and some back pain — may become overly sensitive to stimuli such as pressure or heat, a process called central sensitization. Pain resulting from altered pain processing “means there’s no clear injury or nerve damage,” says Christopher Robinson, a physician-scientist in the department of anesthesiology, perioperative and pain medicine at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="Y35EODHFTNFE3DEXTGICPHBYCE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Pain reprocessing therapy is an emerging technique that helps the brain “unlearn” this type of pain. Therapists have people engage in movement they fear will cause pain — such as bending — while training them to perceive their sensations as a result of nondangerous brain activity rather than tissue damage. It aims to silence what may be thought of as a false alarm from the nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="DYPWMUBXW5A2FGNPR63ZFFM34Y" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8482298/" target="_blank"&gt;2021 clinical trial&lt;/a&gt; found that two-thirds of people with chronic back pain who received four weeks of pain reprocessing therapy were pain-free or nearly pain-free after treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p id="MX42FHQYCNA47FRI3ZJH4W7M4Q" class="wpds-c-esEUdQ wpds-c-esEUdQ-hyvuql-isBold-true wpds-c-esEUdQ-ieHKbcq-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="MX42FHQYCNA47FRI3ZJH4W7M4Q" data-testid="article-header"&gt;Copyright 2025, Consumer Reports Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p id="NGIOUE72HRGJHDJS2MZ36HBWDU" class="wpds-c-esEUdQ wpds-c-esEUdQ-hqvHjm-isBold-false wpds-c-esEUdQ-ifBuccc-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="NGIOUE72HRGJHDJS2MZ36HBWDU" data-testid="article-header"&gt;Consumer Reports is an independent, nonprofit organization that works side by side with consumers to create a fairer, safer and healthier world.

			&lt;p&gt;The passage of time may be linear, but the course of human aging is not. Rather than a gradual transition, your life staggers and lurches through the rapid growth of childhood, the plateau of early adulthood, to an acceleration in aging as the decades progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, a new study has identified a turning point at which that acceleration typically takes place: at around age 50.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After this time, the trajectory at which your tissues and organs age is steeper than the decades preceding, according to a study of proteins in human bodies across a wide range of adult ages – and your veins are among the fastest to decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Based on aging-associated protein changes, we developed tissue-specific proteomic age clocks and characterized organ-level aging trajectories. Temporal analysis revealed an aging inflection around age 50, with blood vessels being a tissue that ages early and is markedly susceptible to aging,"&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2025.06.047"&gt; writes a team&lt;/a&gt; led by scientists from the Chinese Academy of Sciences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Together, our findings lay the groundwork for a systems-level understanding of human aging through the lens of proteins."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Related: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/study-finds-humans-age-faster-at-2-sharp-peaks-heres-when?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Study Finds Humans Age Faster at 2 Sharp Peaks – Here's When&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Humans have a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/how-long-could-the-human-lifespan-get-the-answer-may-surprise-you"&gt;remarkably long lifespan&lt;/a&gt; compared to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/an-animals-lifespan-hints-at-how-well-it-copes-with-climate-change-says-study"&gt;most other mammals&lt;/a&gt;, but it comes at some costs. One is a decline in organ function, leading to a rise in risk of chronic disease as the years mount up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We don't have a very good understanding of the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/one-major-feature-of-aging-might-not-be-universal-after-all"&gt;patterns of aging&lt;/a&gt; in individual organs, so the researchers investigated how proteins in different tissues change over time. They collected tissue samples from a total of 76 organ donors between the ages of 14 and 68 who had died of accidental traumatic brain injury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These samples covered seven of the body's systems: cardiovascular (heart and aorta), digestive (liver, pancreas, and intestine), immune (spleen and lymph node), endocrine (adrenal gland and white adipose), respiratory (lung), integumentary (skin), and musculoskeletal (muscle). They also took blood samples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team constructed a catalogue of the proteins found in these systems, taking careful note of how their levels changed as the ages of the donors increased. The researchers compared their findings to a database of diseases and their associated genes, and found that expressions of 48 disease-related proteins increased with age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These included &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/forever-chemicals-could-be-putting-us-at-greater-risk-of-cardiovascular-disease"&gt;cardiovascular conditions&lt;/a&gt;, tissue fibrosis, fatty liver disease, and liver-related tumors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most stark changes occurred between the ages of 45 and 55, the researchers found. It's at this point that many tissues undergo substantial proteomic remodeling, with the most marked changes occurring in the aorta – demonstrating a strong susceptibility to aging. The pancreas and spleen also showed sustained change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_169242" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-169242" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/times_aging_organs_642.jpg" alt="Study Reveals Turning Point When Your Body's Aging Suddenly Accelerates" class="wp-image-169242 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/times_aging_organs_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/times_aging_organs_642-428x415.jpg 428w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/times_aging_organs_642-600x581.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-169242" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Your body's organs according to ages they're most sensitive to aging. (Ding et al., &lt;em&gt;Cell&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test their findings, the researchers isolated a protein associated with aging in the aortas of mice, and injected it into young mice to observe the results. Test animals treated with the protein had reduced physical performance, decreased grip strength, lower endurance, and lower balance and coordination compared to non-treated mice. They also had prominent markers of vascular aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/study-finds-humans-age-faster-at-2-sharp-peaks-heres-when"&gt;Previous work by other researchers&lt;/a&gt; showed another two peaks in aging, at around 44, and again at around 60. The new result suggests that human aging is a complicated, step-wise process involving different systems. Working out how aging is going to affect specific parts of the body at specific times could help develop medical interventions to make the process easier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our study is poised to construct a comprehensive multi-tissue proteomic atlas spanning 50 years of the entire human aging process, elucidating the mechanisms behind proteostasis imbalance in aged organs and revealing both universal and tissue-specific aging patterns," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2025.06.047"&gt;the researchers write&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These insights may facilitate the development of targeted interventions for aging and age-related diseases, paving the way to improve the health of older adults."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2025.06.047"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Cell&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Some people can't start their day without a big breakfast first thing while others prefer to eat the most food at dinnertime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-eb39e7" class="body-graf"&gt;Typically, most people split their daily calorie intake up between three meals: breakfast, lunch, dinner (plus some snacks). Does it matter which &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/largest-meal-of-the-day-rcna219174" target="_blank"&gt;meal is the most caloric?&lt;/a&gt; Should you eat most of your calories for the day during a certain time window?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-bf328f" class="body-graf"&gt;In TODAY's expert tip, Collin Popp, Ph.D., dietitian and assistant professor at the NYU Grossman School of Medicine, reveals how to time your daily calorie intake for the most health benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-ec8f9e" class="body-heading"&gt;Dietitian Tip of the Day: Eat Majority of Your Calories Before Sunset&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f12a27" class="body-graf"&gt;Most healthy adults should aim to get the majority of their calories earlier in the day, between the morning and early evening, about 5–7 p.m., Popp tells TODAY.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3ed13a" class="body-graf"&gt;If you eat three main meals a day, that would mean breakfast and lunch are your largest or most caloric meals, compared to dinner and late-night snacks, Popp explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-5f341c" class="body-graf"&gt;If you tend to eat many smaller meals throughout the day, then try to shift these earlier so you only eat a minority of calories past the evening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-749330" class="body-graf"&gt;This timing of calorie intake, which Popp calls “front-loading," can be beneficial for your metabolic health, energy, blood sugar, and sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-b3b45d" class="body-heading"&gt;Why It Matters&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-8441a1" class="body-graf"&gt;Eating most of your calories earlier in the day is optimal because it better aligns with the body’s 24-hour internal clock,  aka circadian rhythm, which regulates our sleep-wake cycle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f8d1f2" class="body-graf"&gt;Our circadian rhythm also regulates our metabolism, hunger and energy levels. The goal is to eat the majority of calories between the morning and early evening because our metabolic response is greater, so we're able to utilize more energy from food, says Popp. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-989e99" class="body-graf"&gt;In healthy people, their insulin sensitivity — how well the body responds to the hormone insulin, which regulates blood sugar — is also higher in the morning, he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-27e7af" class="body-graf"&gt;Front-loading calories can also help fuel our body and brain to get through the day and curb hunger, which may prevent overeating at night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-fbea66" class="body-graf"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28701389" target="_blank"&gt;Research suggests&lt;/a&gt; people who eat the majority of their calories at breakfast or lunch are more likely to lose weight than those who eat the most at dinnertime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-af7003" class="body-graf"&gt;Consuming the majority of calories later in the day or during the night is not optimal for health for several reasons, says Popp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3513af" class="body-graf"&gt;First, back-loading calories at night can interfere with sleep and disrupt digestion. By not aligning with our circadian rhythm, the body may not metabolize food and use energy as efficiently. Eating the majority of calories at night is associated with weight gain and unstable blood sugar levels, especially for people with diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-0b83e4" class="body-heading"&gt;How to Get Started&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-56d5c5" class="body-graf"&gt;If you want to get a sense of how many calories you should be eating each day to maintain your current weight, you can use &lt;a href="https://www.niddk.nih.gov/bwp" target="_blank"&gt;this calculator from the National Institutes of Health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-0ba68f" class="body-graf"&gt;Counting calories isn’t for everyone — fortunately, this tip only requires timing the&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;majority (more than 50%) of your calories, says Popp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-fedddf" class="body-graf"&gt;Here's an easy way to break down your daily calories:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul id="anchor-7663ad" class="break-above body-ul body-list-el"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Breakfast is 25-40%.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/healthiest-lunch-to-lose-weight-rcna171471" target="_blank"&gt;Lunch&lt;/a&gt; is 30-40%.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dinner is 15–20%.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Snacks make up the remaining.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-bf277e" class="body-graf"&gt;During each meal — but especially breakfast and lunch — aim to get enough protein, healthy fats and fiber, says Popp. Try to eat &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/protein-grams-per-meal-rcna197039" target="_blank"&gt;20–30 grams of protein per meal&lt;/a&gt; and 8-10 grams of fiber per meal (based on a recommendation of &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/longevity-expert-tip-fiber-chronic-disease-rcna208086" target="_blank"&gt;25-30 grams of fiber per day&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-370567" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.today.com/expert-tip-of-the-day" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TODAY’s Expert Tip of the Day&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;series is all about simple strategies to make life a little easier.

It was June 2021, and after months of virtual kindergarten, they sent their then-almost-6-year-old daughter to a summer program at a local school. The camp would be a brief reprieve before Amelia, an only child, started first grade, and Laura was sure she would love it. She was outgoing, the kind of kid who didn’t hesitate to approach someone new on the playground and start a game.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdjizur1000q3b7877axe2h5@published" data-word-count="78"&gt;So Laura was surprised when, after the first day, Amelia told her she didn’t want to go back. At pickup a few days later, she pleaded again not to return. She said the woman who ran the camp often yelled and, at lunchtime, wouldn’t let Amelia leave the table until she finished all her food. Laura spoke to the woman — Amelia didn’t need to eat every morsel, she told her — and assumed the problem was resolved.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdjizuug000r3b78squ06w6x@published" data-word-count="91"&gt;Camp ended, but over the next 12 months, Amelia would sometimes stuff her mouth with food, panic that it was too much to swallow, and spit it out. Laura told Amelia she needed to chew her food properly or she could choke. Amelia asked what would happen next. Two close family members had fallen severely ill with COVID, and one of them had died. Amelia became fixated on death. She wanted to know: What happens when you choke? You can’t breathe? Well, what happens if you can’t breathe? Then you die?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdjizuy2000s3b78q31jebpw@published" data-word-count="181"&gt;Amelia hadn’t been an anxious child, but she became increasingly sensitive to the world around her. She tensed up when people talked sternly; once, when a substitute instructor shouted in gymnastics class, Amelia rushed over to Laura and, through tears, begged to leave immediately. Her clothes started to bother her. At first, she didn’t want to wear dresses. Then she would wear only certain pants and a select few shirts. By the start of 2023, she was down to one outfit that Laura and Mark washed daily: a pair of fuzzy blue Cat &amp;amp; Jack pajamas with stars and planets and the cotton underwear she insisted felt more comfortable than all the others. When she tried to put on school clothes, “she’d work herself into a panic attack,” said Mark. “She’d say, ‘It’s too itchy. It’s too scratchy. It’s too tight. I can’t wear it. It hurts.’” At night, Amelia resisted falling asleep, convinced that if she closed her eyes, she might not wake up. Mark and Laura took turns in her room until she drifted off, which left everyone drained.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdjizv1i000t3b78fs3ofxoz@published" data-word-count="102"&gt;Her parents had her evaluated for autism, but doctors determined that while Amelia was hypersensitive, her behavior was rooted in anxiety. This made sense to Mark and Laura: Studies suggest that generalized anxiety disorder may run in families, and Laura had been diagnosed years earlier. As a child, she had an outsize fear of death; in adulthood, she tended to operate as though “everything is a fire drill,” she told me. If it took Amelia too long to get her shoes on or eat breakfast, Laura would grow frantic, worried that her daughter would be late for school and get in trouble.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdjizv4q000u3b78gr5lctu9@published" data-word-count="103"&gt;One day in January 2023, Amelia overheard Mark and Laura discussing the sign-up deadlines for different summer camps and began to fret. That evening, while eating a chicken nugget, she yelled out to Laura that she was choking. She had recently watched an episode of &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Baby-Sitters Club&lt;/em&gt; in which a character chokes on her dinner. That part of the scene lasts only ten seconds, but the camera focuses on the girl’s terrified face while she struggles to breathe. Amelia wasn’t actually choking — she could speak — but her whole body had clenched and made her feel as though she couldn’t swallow.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdjizv8z000v3b78t19j76t4@published" data-word-count="110"&gt;Previously, Amelia ate a wide-ranging diet, but after the chicken-nugget incident, she began to refuse solid foods. Within a week, she would consume only yogurt and liquids. “We would buy every drink that she could possibly want — chocolate milk, juice. We were desperate,” said Laura. “And it got worse every single day.” Amelia cut out the yogurt, convinced she would choke on it. A couple of weeks later, she rejected liquids, too. She began spitting into a napkin, unable to swallow her own saliva. It felt like something was stuck in her throat, Amelia said. She believed if she did try to swallow, she would choke, suffocate, and die.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdjizvc7000w3b786clevvhe@published" data-word-count="153"&gt;Dinner turned into a nightly standoff: Amelia on one side of the table, growing thinner and frailer, Mark and Laura on the other, their panic mounting. Sometimes, they tried coaxing her. Other times, they couldn’t help but yell. “We didn’t know how to deal with it. Like, ‘Why can’t you eat?’” said Laura. It felt like a failure. They tried to quiet their terror by leaning on what one may believe to be a biological fact — that humans are wired for survival and, eventually, a child will get hungry and want food. “I kept thinking, &lt;em&gt;Mother Nature’s going to kick in here,&lt;/em&gt;” said Mark, who asked that his family’s names be changed owing to the detailed account of his daughter’s medical history being shared. (Some other names have also been changed.) Instead, Amelia’s hunger response seemed to have shut off. If they tried to feed her, she would spit out the food.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdjizvf9000x3b78wz9fk4xj@published" data-word-count="84"&gt;Doctors looked for a physical explanation for Amelia’s sudden inability to swallow. At urgent care, providers said they didn’t see any obstruction and told Mark and Laura to contact Amelia’s pediatrician, though when they called to set up an appointment, the pediatrician had no immediate availability. An ear-nose-and-throat specialist suggested Amelia might have eosinophilic esophagitis, a chronic inflammatory condition that can be triggered by allergies or acid reflux. That doctor sent them home with nasal spray and antacids and suggested they see an allergist.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdjizvoc000y3b78uugeipcs@published" data-word-count="77"&gt;By the end of that February, roughly a month after she had stopped eating normally, Amelia weighed 37 pounds. Mark and Laura called doctor after doctor, including multiple psychologists, but those listed under their insurance no longer accepted their plan, didn’t treat patients that young, or couldn’t see them for six months. Amelia, increasingly malnourished, began screaming, cursing, and throwing things. “She was just turning into an animal,” said Mark. “We did not recognize our own daughter.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdjizvrs000z3b788fmjf2sa@published" data-word-count="153"&gt;The morning of February 22, Mark and Laura took Amelia to the emergency room. Doctors were alarmed — a blood test showed Amelia was in danger of heart failure. They transferred her to a hospital with a pediatric department, where a gastroenterologist inserted a feeding tube up her nose and into her stomach, allowing her to consume a nutrient-rich formula without swallowing. An endoscopy again confirmed the absence of a physical obstruction or abnormality. Finally, a doctor sat down with Mark and Laura and gave them a name for what their daughter was experiencing. They suspected that Amelia had &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/arfid-childrens-eating-disorder-vs-picky-eating.html"&gt;ARFID&lt;/a&gt;, or avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder, a psychiatric diagnosis, often emerging in childhood, that can range from eating a very limited number of foods to refusing food altogether. Like many other parents, Mark and Laura hadn’t heard of ARFID. It seemed the numerous doctors who had seen Amelia over the past month hadn’t either.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdjizvvh00103b78pa36oqi3@published" data-word-count="156"&gt;ARFID is a fairly new addition to the modern parenting lexicon: A behavior far more severe than pickiness, it’s an eating disorder provoked not by the desire to change one’s body but by the fear of food itself. Only in the past few years has the acronym begun circulating on playgrounds and in school nurses’ offices, and it’s not uncommon for parents to first stumble upon it on their own — on Reddit threads, in Facebook groups, on Instagram or TikTok. (This month, &lt;em&gt;Real Housewives of Orange County&lt;/em&gt; star Emily Simpson shared that her 10-year-old son has the disorder.) One mother told me she’d learned about ARFID after searching online, “Why is my 5-year-old eating absolutely nothing?” “&lt;em&gt;Bulimia&lt;/em&gt; came up. He doesn’t have bulimia,” she said. “Then I saw &lt;em&gt;anorexia,&lt;/em&gt; and I was like, &lt;em&gt;He doesn’t have anorexia.&lt;/em&gt; And then I scrolled more and it said, ‘Does your child have ARFID?’ And he had every symptom.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdjizvyp00113b783u8i4nop@published" data-word-count="164"&gt;Doctors who specialize in eating disorders say they have seen an increase in diagnoses over the past several years, and a recent study found that, among children, the number of inpatient hospital discharges in which ARFID was the chief diagnosis doubled from 2017 to 2022. “There was this explosion almost six years ago, when we had a bunch of cases coming into the hospital,” said Heather Kertesz-Briest, a clinical psychologist who used to work at Children’s Hospital Los Angeles. Equip, a telehealth company specializing in eating disorders, treated more than 1,000 ARFID patients in 2024 — a 144 percent bump from the previous year. And Beat, a U.K.-based charity that runs eating-disorder hotlines, reports that there were nearly seven times as many calls about ARFID in 2023 than in 2018. There is limited data available, but one review estimates that up to 5 percent of the population has it, and a 2023 screen of 50,000 adults suggests it may be as common as anorexia.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdjizw7q00123b78f0nsw6ni@published" data-word-count="130"&gt;While classified as an eating disorder, ARFID may be more easily understood in many children as an anxiety disorder that centers on food. Its rise coincides with a pediatric diagnostic boom in mental-health conditions as more and more children are treated for generalized anxiety disorder, autism spectrum disorder, and ADHD — raising the question of whether they are a generation maladapted to the world around them or the first generation to be thoroughly understood. ARFID often orbits these diagnoses, a disorder that can become the most physical manifestation of what’s happening in a child’s mind. “That primal instinct to feed your kid, that is millions of years of evolution,” Mark said. “It’s scary for your kid to not eat and not drink and to not understand, &lt;em&gt;What’s going on here?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;

For decades, health professionals working in hospitals and eating-disorder clinics encountered patients who were severely underweight from not eating but who didn’t qualify for an anorexia diagnosis because they weren’t trying to lose weight or grappling with body dysmorphia — instead, they were disinterested in food, felt disgusted by it, or feared it. Twenty years ago, “the way we thought about some cases was that maybe the patient has anorexia secretly but they have a lack of insight into it,” said Jennifer Thomas, a psychologist and co-director of the Eating Disorders Clinical and Research Program at Massachusetts General Hospital.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdjizwhm00153b784h3w8l2g@published" data-word-count="179"&gt;Until 2013, the year ARFID entered the fifth edition of the &lt;em&gt;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders,&lt;/em&gt; the closest label was “feeding disorder of infancy or early childhood,” a code for children under 6. But the age cap made the label inapplicable to many patients, and it wasn’t widely used or researched. Unable to find meaningful literature on the condition, authors of the &lt;em&gt;DSM-5 &lt;/em&gt;spoke with psychologists and doctors who worked with eating-disorder patients and identified a specific patient profile: a person with sufficient access to food who wasn’t concerned with altering their body shape, and who restricted or avoided eating to a point where they lost significant weight, didn’t get enough nutrients, and/or experienced mental and social distress. These patients were, on average, younger and more likely to be male than those with anorexia. They lived not just in North America and Europe but also in Oceania, Southeast Asia, and Japan. When Thomas and her colleague eventually published a treatment manual for ARFID, they quickly got requests for editions in other languages, including Turkish, Italian, and Spanish.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdjizwkv00163b783dzfcu73@published" data-word-count="109"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;DSM-5&lt;/em&gt; authors identified three presentations of ARFID, which themselves can feel like different diagnoses, though some patients fall into more than one category. One subgroup is made up of those who are simply uninterested in food, often from birth. Many were, as newborns, admitted into neonatal-intensive-care units, where they were put on feeding tubes. The tubes are lifesaving, but they bypass the tactile experience of eating, which can lead to an oral aversion. Some tube-fed babies struggle to develop hunger cues or learn the mechanics of swallowing. Years later, they may still lack the two major motivators to eat: They don’t feel hunger, and they don’t enjoy food.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdjizwo100173b78geng0sur@published" data-word-count="95"&gt;A second category is made up of people who have a sensory aversion: They tolerate certain tastes, smells, temperatures, and textures and feel disgusted by most everything else. Many of these patients are neurodiverse, and while it’s common for people with autism to have sensory sensitivity to food, “where ARFID rears its head is when the sensory experience is so discordant, so displeasurable, that it creates a full-body anxiety response,” said Matt Zakreski, a clinical psychologist who specializes in neuropsychological developmental disorders. “It’s analogous to the difference between having seasonal allergies and having anaphylactic shock.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdjizwy200183b7850acp2vk@published" data-word-count="178"&gt;The most sudden ARFID cases fall into a third group: children like Amelia who develop a fear around eating, often after experiencing a traumatic event. Kellee Lanza-Bolen, a mother in Virginia, said her 8-year-old daughter stopped eating after choking on gummy candy she got in her Christmas stocking. The next month, her daughter was admitted to the hospital, where she was eventually diagnosed with ARFID and put on a feeding tube. Lanza-Bolen was confused; she had seen videos of Hannah Lea, a 9-year-old girl who chronicles her life with ARFID on Instagram and TikTok. But Hannah has sensory-processing issues. “When I heard ARFID, I said, ‘Well, no, because my kid doesn’t have sensory issues,’” Lanza-Bolen said. Her understanding of the disorder shifted once she learned it can be a response to a harrowing experience, similar to a person who becomes terrified of driving after a car accident. She now compares her daughter’s anxiety around swallowing to “the same fear that keeps you from getting too close to the edge of a balcony or the top of a building.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdjizx1o00193b78ekjy0eyx@published" data-word-count="213"&gt;As the disorder gained recognition, diagnoses naturally increased. The way Zakreski sees it, the embrace of the label stems from clinicians developing a more holistic understanding of the brain. “For a long time, we treated mental health through the medical model: You have a broken ankle, that’s it. You have pneumonia, that’s it,” he said. “Now, we know that any change to the brain predicts a lot of other changes, that one neurodivergence predicts other neurodivergences at a significantly higher rate.” One study, for example, suggests more than half of ARFID patients have autism, a disorder with a strong hereditary link and rising diagnostic rates. In Kertesz-Briest’s practice, nearly every single child with ARFID she sees also has an anxiety disorder, the most common mental-health diagnosis in adolescents. Meanwhile, food allergies, which can make eating feel like a fearsome game of roulette, are increasingly common among children, and William Sharp, the director of the Multidisciplinary Feeding Program at Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta, said it’s no coincidence that more than 30 percent of his patients with a food allergy likely also have ARFID. Premature birth is also a known risk factor for feeding problems that can develop into ARFID, and as of 2023, nearly 10 percent of newborns are admitted into a neonatal-intensive-care unit.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdjizx4r001a3b788wp8nj7n@published" data-word-count="104"&gt;ARFID, in other words, is poised at the juncture between the physical and the psychological, the genetic and the environmental — both something that’s existed under parents’ noses all along as well as a consequence of our contemporary age. And at a time when parenting culture is more attentive and anxiety-ridden than ever, the mystery ARFID presents mirrors the larger questions at the top of every parent’s mind today: How much control do we have over our children, or how much control should we exert? When does our vigilance contribute to our children’s anxieties, and when is it the only thing keeping them alive?&lt;/p&gt;

The clinic was disorienting. Amelia was the only 7-year-old there, and in the waiting room, her family found themselves sitting between toddlers with feeding issues and tween and teen girls. Mark gazed at the other parents, all of whom looked “like a bomb had gone off,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

Their marriage, bruised by the past few months, began to buckle. “We had a ton of angst about, &lt;em&gt;How did we mess up our daughter?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;” said Mark. “When your kid gets cancer, you can’t blame your spouse. When your kid has something more psychological, you start asking, &lt;em&gt;Did I cause this? Was this something I did or said? Was it something my spouse did or said?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;” Laura worried that Mark’s frustration with Amelia — he had gone from being the calm, steady parent to raising his voice — had unnerved her. Mark worried that it was Laura’s anxiety that had rubbed off. “Why did you tell her she’s going to die from choking?” he asked. Meanwhile, at the hospital, Amelia was in constant agitation. She tried to rip out her feeding tube. She screamed and spit, asking why the doctors weren’t helping her. Her mind was still making her body believe she couldn’t swallow.&lt;/p&gt;

Many children with the disorder will eat but only from a very short list of foods. Those with a sensory aversion in particular tend to have rigid preferences, almost always gravitating toward carbohydrates. Jennifer Thomas, the psychologist who published the ARFID treatment manual, said this is true across cultures: In Boston, where she is based, the food of choice is Annie’s macaroni and cheese, while colleagues in Mexico see a preference for tortillas, and in Asia and the Middle East, rice. Processed and packaged foods — consistent in shape, size, and taste — are also deemed “safe” by children with ARFID, and doctors in the U.S. see a strong proclivity for McDonald’s chicken nuggets and frozen dinosaur-shaped nuggets. The difference between “safe” and “unsafe” can be minute — at Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta, kids getting treated for ARFID stopped eating the puréed chicken nuggets they had been consuming for weeks when the brand the hospital used tweaked its recipe.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdjizxmt001f3b78nn4rgp6a@published" data-word-count="101"&gt;In many ways, these cases can prove the most challenging to navigate. A child who won’t eat at all presents a clear crisis, while a child who eats a few specific foods and isn’t in imminent danger of starvation leaves more room to question what’s pathological and what’s not, what may just be a child asserting their independence and what warrants medical attention. Plenty of general practitioners still aren’t aware of ARFID, and one study found it can take almost three years to get a diagnosis after the onset of symptoms, more than double the average time for someone with anorexia.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdjizxq4001g3b78oyb13tpi@published" data-word-count="189"&gt;Sarah, a mother in New York, was alarmed to learn from a teacher that her daughter, then in preschool, had been eating only apples for lunch and refusing everything else. The pediatrician assured her and her husband it would pass — in the doctor’s office, “the philosophy was ‘Well, she’ll eventually get hungry and eat the food that’s on the table,’” Sarah said. Maybe, they thought, their daughter was simply strong-willed. They agreed that accommodating her increasingly specific food requests would reinforce the behavior. Her diet moderately expanded. But when she was 8, she was being bullied at school, the family’s nanny left, and suddenly she wanted only applesauce for two weeks, saying anything else “hurts my body.” One night, when getting her daughter dressed for bed, Sarah was startled to see how thin she had gotten. At an eating-disorder clinic, Sarah’s daughter was diagnosed with ARFID. Later, after a full psychological evaluation, she was also diagnosed with ADHD and generalized anxiety disorder and flagged for possible autism. Now, Sarah stays alert to when her daughter wants more applesauce than usual, mindful that it could be a warning sign.&lt;/p&gt;

When Tania of Perth, Australia, got pregnant at 38, she decided motherhood “would be my next career.” She took courses on sleep training, read parenting books, learned how to blend her own purées. But after a traumatic birth that broke her son’s collarbone, followed by a series of respiratory infections and a tonsillectomy, her son, now 5, didn’t take to food, accepting only milk and bread. When she put blueberries on his plate, he would pretend to eat them before throwing them on the floor. Instead of bonding with her son at mealtimes as she had envisioned, Tania began to anticipate his resistance. Once, she said, “I put the food on the table and burst into tears.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdjizxx9001i3b78uf58xq9h@published" data-word-count="82"&gt;Tania and her son’s world grew smaller. Mommy-and-me classes were stressful; he tired out easily from not eating enough, and she felt embarrassed when other parents pulled out lunch boxes with fresh fruit while her child ate only puffed snacks. Finally, a dietitian recommended a book called &lt;em&gt;Helping Your Child With Extreme Picky Eating,&lt;/em&gt; which described ARFID and included a chapter on parents blaming themselves for their child’s difficulty with food. Upon reading it, Tania said, “weights were lifted from my shoulders.”&lt;/p&gt;

They worry that fellow parents think they’re lazy and don’t want to cook or that their whole family must subsist on Goldfish and chicken nuggets. (Some patients who eat a rigid diet of high-fat or high-carb foods may even be overweight. In a private ARFID Facebook group, a few parents post about their children being diagnosed with diabetes.) “Parents say to me, ‘Well, you just need to make sure they eat variety,’” said Sarah. While her daughter has ARFID, her other child eats almost anything. “I’m like, &lt;em&gt;We have all the fresh fruits and vegetables. My kids were raised exactly the same.&lt;/em&gt; In terms of nature versus nurture, their nature is completely different.” One Christmas Eve after being pressured to eat, her daughter with ARFID began hyperventilating at the table in front of their extended family. A relative pulled Sarah aside and told her such a disturbance can never happen again. “They think it’s misbehavior, that we aren’t disciplining her,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdjizy4l001k3b78vzebq596@published" data-word-count="103"&gt;Eventually, some parents told me, friends and family stopped coming over for dinner. “You could tell they didn’t want to be around it,” said Stacia Kareh, a parent in Nashville. As a newborn, her son had been put on a feeding tube; at 5, he suddenly stopped eating the short list of foods he had once tolerated. Mealtimes became “a fight to get every calorie into him. It was begging, pleading,” she said. Even after undergoing treatment, her son, now 7, still negotiates every bite. “He argues with us, like, ‘Well, if I eat this, how long will that give me to live?’”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdjizy7v001l3b780zh1mx7j@published" data-word-count="173"&gt;To an outsider, these cases may look like choosiness or defiance, but “ ‘picky eating’ undermines how severe this is,” said Sharp, the director at Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta. “We’re seeing kids with autism who only eat two foods. These kids develop rickets; they develop scurvy.” In extremely rare instances, the malnutrition can become fatal. Lucy Morrison, a mother in the U.K., told me about her son, Alfie, who had nonspeaking autism and restricted his eating for his entire life, primarily consuming baby crackers and porridge. In 2021, Alfie fell off a small bench at school and began limping, then grew increasingly lethargic. A week later, he had stopped eating anything, but the pediatrician told her, “He’s acting like that because of his autism.” A few days later, Alfie, 7, went into cardiac arrest and died. Only two years later was it determined that the malnutrition brought about by ARFID had caused his heart to stop. Lucy said the first person to tell her the diagnosis was the coroner tasked with investigating his death.&lt;/p&gt;

Grace ordered soup and a coffee, but her son, then 10, had already eaten his standard morning meal of glazed doughnuts from the Dunkin’ near their home; he says he can tell when a doughnut is made at other locations. The boy, who has been diagnosed with ARFID, ADHD, and generalized anxiety disorder, was polite and matter-of-fact. He described how he lives with an almost constant, vague stomach discomfort that makes it hard to tell when he’s hungry. It’s exacerbated by the appetite-suppressing effects of the Ritalin he takes for ADHD and the constipation from his diet of processed foods.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdjizylh001o3b78orxfah3c@published" data-word-count="175"&gt;Until he was 3, Grace told me, her son ate everything from mashed vegetables to pea soup to sausages. But when he started day care, he refused to eat the provided lunches, holding out even as the teachers encouraged him with increasing desperation. Grace, who was working full time, started giving him packaged snacks on the drive home. Her son developed a strong affinity for them and began rejecting most other food — a behavior that worsened over time. Now, while the rest of the family has dinner, he eats his own meal of McDonald’s chicken nuggets and French fries with Sprite. At school, the smells in the lunchroom are sensory overload, so his safe foods are kept in the nurse’s office: gummy bears and sour gummy worms, Cheez-Its, Oreos, and Pirate’s Booty. He takes multivitamins to supplement nutrients. Grace has two degrees, one in psychology, and she knows how this sounds. Still, she said, what else can she do? Her son doesn’t have hunger cues, and without his preferred foods, he simply won’t eat.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdjizype001p3b78kl9oj7mc@published" data-word-count="223"&gt;ARFID’s emergence as a diagnosis coincided with a seismic shift in parenting culture. “We know so much more about the brain now than we did 30 to 40 years ago, and we’re raising our kids with a better understanding of how their brain develops, including their emotional-regulation skills and sensory processing,” said Kertesz-Briest, the clinical psychologist. Behaviors that past generations of parents might have viewed as “bad” and warranting punishment are today apprehended through a more compassionate lens. One woman I spoke with, who has a son with ARFID and generalized anxiety disorder, often thinks of the way her parents got her sister to eat when they were young. Her sister was picky, and their parents did “the same thing any parent in the ’80s did, which was to say, ‘Sit here and finish your food, and you can’t leave the table until you do.’” It would be a disaster with her son, she said. Studies show that parents’ forcing children to eat at mealtime can make them want to eat even less, and, for her son, “it would turn into a panic attack,” the mother said. “He would cry, he would vomit. It wouldn’t be about food anymore. It would be about torturing someone who isn’t trying to perpetrate a power struggle. He’s just refusing the food because he’s terrified of it.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdjizysl001q3b784lii0w44@published" data-word-count="115"&gt;When a child won’t eat, it’s a natural reflex to find something — anything — that might give them sustenance. Many parents dealing with ARFID learn to anticipate their child’s reactions before a meal, trying to solve for every outcome: What can I serve that my child won’t refuse? What if she eats nothing? Will it turn into a fight? Parents of children with a sensory aversion to food describe going to great lengths to remove, say, a brown spot from a French fry or to mix pancake batter in just the right ratio and pour it into the only acceptable shape, all to provide the consistency that might make their child want to eat.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdjizyzy001r3b789gl3yufr@published" data-word-count="154"&gt;But while applying pressure can be counterproductive, specialists say that accommodating a child’s preferences entirely can lead to more rigidity, too. When ARFID appears with anxiety, the cycle, Kertesz-Briest said, goes like this: “We experience the fear stimulus, we avoid it, we feel better. We face it again, we avoid it, we feel better. The more we avoid, the scarier something becomes. In the case of ARFID, even avoiding one bite of one food one time can be what knocks it off the safe-food list.” She continues, “For parents who have kids with anxiety disorders, sometimes unknowingly we collude with the anxiety or we collude with the ARFID. The parent thinks, &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; know my kid will eat this one food, so I’m giving only this food to them,&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;I don’t want my kid to feel scared or uncomfortable, so I remove the discomfort right away.&lt;/em&gt; It’s a hard cycle to break out of.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdjizz4r001s3b784emuxshg@published" data-word-count="180"&gt;Parents don’t cause ARFID, but in their hypervigilance, their pursuit to help or protect their children, they can sometimes entrench it. “This is a very anxious parenting generation,” Zakreski, the clinical psychologist, told me. “You could make the argument that we are too attuned to our kids, that we are not really willing to challenge them in ways previous generations were.” (He’s not immune to this either, he admits — sometimes, he makes pasta three different ways for the same meal to appease his two children.) The modern food landscape doesn’t help. Restaurants, no matter the cuisine, attract parents with kids’ menus: a reliable list of mac ’n’ cheese, pizza, hot dogs, and chicken fingers. At the grocery store, entire shelves are dedicated to packaged snacks created specifically for children. “If you were somebody who had a tough time with milk and you were growing up in the ’80s, you were on your own,” said Zakreski. “Now, it’s like, ‘Do you want the oat milk? The almond milk?’” For some children, he said, more options increases the risk of ARFID.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdjizzax001t3b785nfku3q3@published" data-word-count="93"&gt;Meanwhile, doctors are increasingly aware of how other family dynamics — especially parents’ stress about their child not eating — can reinforce the disorder. During mealtimes, “the kids feel the parent’s anxiety, even if the parent is trying to contain it,” said Wendy Nash Moyal, a psychiatrist who specializes in autism, OCD, ADHD, anxiety, and learning disorders. “So the child with ARFID experiences whole-body tension — the feeling that their throat is going to close up more. The child’s anxiety and the parent’s anxiety, both things are going to exacerbate the ARFID symptoms.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdjizze8001u3b78jqbso40a@published" data-word-count="119"&gt;Sharp of Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta has also observed how a parent’s trepidation around their child’s eating can “spill over” onto that child. Two years ago, he saw a young patient with a severe food allergy. The boy had long restricted his diet, but after getting a stomach bug, he stopped eating his safe foods altogether. “The dad said, ‘I think I created this,’” Sharp recalled. Long before the stomach bug, his son had gone into anaphylaxis, and the father, terrified, became extremely vigilant about the foods his son ate. Now, he worried his vigilance might have contributed to his son’s anxiety. “And I said, ‘It’s not your fault. You didn’t know what to do, and this is scary.’”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdjizzhf001v3b78vnofpz13@published" data-word-count="145"&gt;At the restaurant, Grace acknowledged that she and her husband “do accommodate. We bend more than I guess a regular parent would.” Still, her pediatric endocrinologist is more concerned with her son’s growth than with his nutrition; blood tests show the boy has started puberty and, already short for his age, has grown only an inch in the past year — half of the minimum expected. “She’s panicking,” Grace said. For the better part of seven years, she has been taking her son from specialist to specialist without much improvement. She suspects there are people who blame her, but she also knows that while her son may not be eating a healthy, balanced diet, he’s not in a hospital, not on a feeding tube, and not relying on shakes for sustenance. “So if it’s just me feeding him lots of junk food, I don’t care.”&lt;/p&gt;

She still wouldn’t swallow anything, including water, so nurses met with Mark and Laura and trained them in how to use the feeding-tube equipment. Amelia’s psychiatrist prescribed an antipsychotic medication that balances dopamine and serotonin in the brain, along with an anti-anxiety medication. Drugs are not always used with ARFID patients, but in some cases, they can address a separate issue, like severe anxiety, that may be adding to the patient’s restrictive eating. Laura is a former pharmacist who is “very anti-drug” — the idea of putting their already small and weak daughter on psychiatric medication with potential side effects was scary, but ultimately she and Mark decided it was necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdjizzr6001y3b78ee21jtvq@published" data-word-count="178"&gt;Amelia was 40 pounds when she walked into school for the first time in a month. She was allowed to keep a small trash can next to her desk to spit in, and Mark would come in at lunchtime to give her food, fluids, and medication. At home, she continued the treatments she had begun in the hospital. With Kertesz-Briest, who is her psychologist, Amelia underwent cognitive behavioral therapy, a common treatment for other eating disorders that is currently one of the most promising interventions for ARFID. In CBT, a patient identifies their fears around eating, is exposed to different foods and tested on their negative predictions, and learns coping skills for periods of distress. She also attended regular feeding-therapy sessions, which, depending on the patient, can focus on the mechanics of chewing and swallowing or the sensory experience of eating — the way different foods smell or feel. In one session, Amelia cut pictures of food from magazines and organized them from easiest to swallow to most difficult to swallow, then made them into a game board.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdjizzue001z3b78p6sss2ss@published" data-word-count="88"&gt;Laura and Mark participated in the family- and feeding-therapy sessions too. They learned to serve small portions so as not to overwhelm her, to tell her she was safe when she struggled to eat rather than to pressure her, and to allow some distractions, including an iPad, which can be a helpful diversion for ARFID patients even if it goes against today’s no-screens mantra. They learned to adjust their language around eating, like coming up with a code word for dinner to alleviate some of the negative associations.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdjizzxk00203b78b1nmd6dc@published" data-word-count="97"&gt;Separately, Laura and Mark worked on their own reactivity to avoid the familiar spiral of Amelia refusing to eat, her parents getting frustrated, and everyone becoming upset. Laura had been devastated to learn that, several months earlier, Amelia hadn’t wanted to leave the hospital — she felt scared at home with all the yelling. Laura, for her part, had begun to feel as though she and Mark had lost their ability to communicate; she had been thinking about divorce. At Mark’s suggestion, they started couples counseling. For the first time, Laura took medication for her own anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdjj003000213b78abxdtz82@published" data-word-count="133"&gt;Most families turn to some combination of CBT and feeding therapy to help a child with ARFID, but because the diagnosis is relatively new, researchers are still exploring ways to treat it. In a recent trial for ARFID patients ages 5 to 9, Nancy Zucker, a clinical psychologist and director of the Duke Center for Eating Disorders, focused on acknowledging and repairing the trauma experienced by both the child &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; the parent as a result of the child not eating in order to ease their anxiety around mealtimes. For one of the activities, she had them cook together but not with the aim of taking a bite. With each positive experience, the child was instructed to put a marble in a jar. “It’s like the kid’s giving the parent a sticker,” Zucker said.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdjj006g00223b78erf75a65@published" data-word-count="121"&gt;Some weeks, Amelia showed improvement, taking the smallest sip of water. Then she would regress and refuse even that. In therapy, she was learning coping mechanisms, breathing exercises, and new vocabulary to articulate how she was feeling. But she wasn’t putting them into practice in a way that resulted in the ultimate goal of eating or drinking. Mark and Laura, increasingly desperate and exhausted, started to make plans to readmit Amelia into an inpatient facility, and in August, a spot opened up at a highly regarded eating-disorder clinic. By then, Amelia’s psychiatrist had recommended weaning her off her existing medications and putting her on an SSRI. After more weeks of no improvement, he gradually increased the dosage until it was double.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdjj009p00233b78sl5ivzcp@published" data-word-count="75"&gt;Before they broke the news to Amelia that she would be going back to the hospital instead of to school, they decided to go on a hike with friends. It was hot, and the adults carried water bottles as they made their way up the trail. Amelia’s hydration still came from her feeding tube, taped to the small patch of skin below her nose. As they walked, Mark heard a small voice: “Dad, I’m thirsty.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdjj00d200243b78ckf7gwnv@published" data-word-count="76"&gt;He looked around, checking that it hadn’t been one of their friends’ children. It was Amelia. “Oh, do you want some water?” he responded, trying to sound nonchalant. He handed her the bottle and watched in disbelief as she took one sip, then another, then another. The next day, they went to a noodle shop. Laura gave her a half-bowl. As Amelia slurped down her food, Mark and Laura squeezed each other’s hands beneath the table.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdjj00g400253b78lqicf98z@published" data-word-count="127"&gt;Doctors warned them not to get too excited. ARFID can follow young people into adulthood, and regressions are common. Something as simple as a change in packaging can cause a child with ARFID to suddenly distrust a food they’ve been eating. Parents worry about their kid catching a stomach bug or having strep throat, which may set them back. But it was hard for Mark and Laura not to give in to optimism. They called the hospital and canceled Amelia’s upcoming stay and contacted the school to let them know she would be starting third grade. One week later, after Amelia kept asking when she could remove the feeding tube, Mark took it out. When they looked at her reflection in the bathroom mirror, they both cried.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdjj00j300263b7803rssnr5@published" data-word-count="68"&gt;In his view, the SSRI calmed Amelia’s anxiety to the point where she was finally able to use the skills she had been learning for months in therapy. Nearly two years later, she’s still taking the medication, but her doctor has lowered the dosage. Mark is determined to get her off it altogether; one side effect of the higher SSRI dose was that Amelia started wetting her bed.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdjj00m500273b78fotdl409@published" data-word-count="129"&gt;Amelia eats more now — pasta, fruits, and even beef, pork, and fish — but she still has anxiety. They have stopped the feeding therapy, wanting to let her go back to just being a kid. The family is still uncovering the full extent of what they’ve been through; last year, Amelia stiffened when the Kylie Minogue track “Padam Padam” came on — it was one of the songs on the radio during her months in treatment. The word &lt;em&gt;choking&lt;/em&gt; is banned from their household. Amelia is happy at a new camp this summer. She loves anime and playing &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; and dancing to K-pop. But Mark hasn’t shaken the fear that this isn’t the end. “Even talking about this now,” he said hesitantly, “I don’t want to jinx it.”&lt;/p&gt;

            If you needed another reason to get your daily steps in, science just handed you one.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdm8m8ji00023j6oy5rjmspn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A new study shows that &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/24/health/walking-full-body-exercise-wellness"&gt;walking daily&lt;/a&gt; can reduce the risk of cognitive decline — especially among those with a genetic predisposition for Alzheimer’s disease.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdm8m8ji00033j6o56wbk3gs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Almost 3,000 participants between the ages of 70 and 79 reported their daily walking habits over the course of 10 years, according to research that will be presented Tuesday at the annual &lt;a href="https://aaic.alz.org/overview.asp" target="_blank"&gt;Alzheimer’s Association International Conference&lt;/a&gt;. Those who reported maintaining or increasing their walking habits over the years showed greater improvements in processing speed and executive function.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdm8m8ji00043j6o8jzswg20@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The benefits of walking were especially noticeable among those with a genetic predisposition for developing Alzheimer’s disease, according to the preprint, which has not been peer-reviewed or published in a professional journal.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdm8m8ji00053j6oqnxkfta1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We know sedentary behavior increases as you get older, and physical activity decreases,” said senior study author Dr. Cindy Barha, an assistant professor of kinesiology at the University of Calgary in Alberta. “So we recommend reducing your sedentary behavior by introducing small bouts of walking in between those times you have to be sitting down.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdm8m8ji00073j6oj0qrlo8d@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/07/health/alzheimers-dementia-ornish-lifestyle-wellness"&gt;Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/a&gt; is a severe form of dementia thought to be caused by a buildup of harmful plaques in the brain that interfere with how the nerve cells communicate, eventually leading to their death, Barha said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdm8m8ji00083j6o19b74beb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As more nerve cells die, people with Alzheimer’s can develop progressive memory loss, confusion, personality changes and physical decline. Eventually, the disease can be fatal, and there is no known cure.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdm8m8ji00093j6oe2xvz34b@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Genetics are thought to play a major role in the disease. Specifically, genotypes called APOE affect the metabolism of plaque and other fats throughout the bloodstream. One specific kind, APOE4, is known to make it harder for the brain to clear the plaques and is linked to a higher risk of cognitive decline.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdm8m8ji000a3j6oi5yu2y8i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            About 15% to 25% of people have this version of the APOE gene, and the only way to find out is from a genetic test, &lt;a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/alzheimers-causes-and-risk-factors/alzheimers-disease-genetics-fact-sheet#:~:text=APOE%20%CE%B54%20increases%20risk%20for,to%205%25%20carry%20two%20copies." target="_blank"&gt;according to data&lt;/a&gt; from the US National Institutes of Health.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2 class="subheader inline-placeholder subheader-elevate vossi-subheader vossi-subheader--size-h2" data-editable="text" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/subheader/instances/cmdm8okjn000v3j6owd9vzwd1@published" data-component-name="subheader" id="the-mind-body-connection" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
        The mind-body connection
&lt;/h2&gt;

            Although the new study did not test a uniform walking regimen, Barha suggests walking multiple times daily to break up sedentary behavior and maintaining consistent walking habits year to year to prevent cognitive decline.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdm8m8jj000d3j6o7y7cgthn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “More research is really needed to determine how many steps that really takes, but more is definitely going to be better,” she said. “The next steps would be to actually try to figure out the minimum amount of walking for different subgroups, (such as) females versus males, APOE4 carriers versus non-carriers.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdm8m8jj000e3j6obiw601kc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/06/health/step-dementia-risk-wellness"&gt;2022 study&lt;/a&gt; found that even people who walked about 3,800 steps per day at any speed cut their risk of dementia by 25%.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdm8m8jj000f3j6oapy6jy8s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            What might be going on between the brain and the rest of the body? Experts have several theories.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdm8m8jj000g3j6od0n57aq9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For one, regular exercise has been shown to help the body produce more of a protein called brain-derived neurotrophic factor, or BDNF, which is like fertilizer for your brain, helping it grow more cells and form new connections, Barha explained.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdm8m8jj000h3j6o9fam138e@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We’re thinking there’s proteins released from the muscle that travel to the brain and, either across the blood-brain barrier or at the blood-brain barrier, start a reaction that eventually leads to increases in BDNF within the brain,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdm8m8jj000i3j6o3mqudc22@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Another theory is that exercise reduces neuroinflammation, a common symptom of Alzheimer’s disease.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdm8m8jj000j3j6ot4wu7eot@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The brain sends immune cells called microglia to attack plaque buildup, but this can backfire, explained Dr. Christiane Wrann, an associate professor of medicine at the Cardiovascular Research Center at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School. Chronic inflammation can lead microglia to begin attacking healthy brain cells as well, damaging the brain’s connections.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdm8m8jj000k3j6oig1ocd7v@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “If you exercise, you actually strengthen the gene expression program that microglia need to function properly,” Wrann said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdm8m8jj000m3j6og7pczdpw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The researchers were surprised to find that walking provided the greatest benefit to those with the APOE4 gene compared to those without it. To understand why this is, more research will be needed — but Barha has a theory.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdm8m8jj000n3j6ou7c2ehtr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Before the study started, we think APOE4 carriers had more room to grow in terms of cognition, since they may already have been experiencing some cognitive decline,” she said. “They also have more room to show improvement.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdm8m8jj000o3j6o3ohj2zz2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s possible that the study itself also motivated participants with APOE4 genes to walk more than they had been beforehand, slowing their rate of decline.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdm8m8jj000p3j6ogfdj711b@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “This is a very strong example (that) it’s never too late to start exercising,” Wrann said. “Every step counts, and it’s much better to do an exercise regimen that you actually like, that you can actually stick to.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            For two decades, Washington, D.C., pediatrician &lt;a href="https://appointments.childrensnational.org/provider/olanrewaju-omolayo-falusi/2359516" target="_blank"&gt;Lanre Falusi&lt;/a&gt; has counseled parents about vaccine safety, side effects, and timing. But this year, she said, the conversations have changed.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdjceg0y002d3b6nltjw1v2t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “For the first time, I’m having parents of newborns ask me if their baby will still be able to get vaccines,” Falusi said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdjceg0y002e3b6nhxgzdj6l@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Throughout the country, pediatricians say anxious parents are concerned about access to routine childhood immunizations, especially those with children on Medicaid, the government insurance program for low-income families and people with disabilities. Medicaid covers 4 in 10 children in the U.S.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdjceg0y002f3b6nzxtnuic0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It really became an issue when RFK Jr. stepped into the role of HHS secretary,” said &lt;a href="https://palmettopediatric.com/downtown-office.php" target="_blank"&gt;Deborah Greenhouse&lt;/a&gt;, a pediatrician in South Carolina.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdjceg0y002g3b6nlkzbre0z@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The concern accelerated after the shake-up of a key Centers for Disease Control and Prevention &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/06/09/nx-s1-5428533/rfk-jr-vaccine-advisory-committee-acip" target="_blank"&gt;vaccine advisory body&lt;/a&gt; in June, raising fears that millions of American families could soon have to pay out-of-pocket for shots now covered by their health insurance.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdjceg0y002h3b6ny9cwgp35@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime anti-vaccine activist, removed all 17 members of the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, the panel responsible for recommending which shots are included in the nation’s adult and childhood immunization schedules.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdjceg0z002i3b6nv24fxm96@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy replaced the panelists with new members aligned with his views, &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/kennedy-rfk-vaccine-panel-acip-cdc-hhs-immunizations/" target="_blank"&gt;prompting alarm&lt;/a&gt; among medical professionals and public health experts.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdjceg0z002j3b6ni13kizyf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “People should be worried about what’s going to happen to the availability of vaccines for children,” said Jennifer Tolbert, deputy director of the Program on Medicaid and the Uninsured at KFF, a national health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdjceg0z002n3b6n2qhz7rz4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Under the Affordable Care Act, health insurers &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/other/issue-brief/acip-cdc-and-insurance-coverage-of-vaccines-in-the-united-states/" target="_blank"&gt;are required&lt;/a&gt; to cover all ACIP-recommended vaccines. States and other jurisdictions use the childhood vaccine schedule to set immunization requirements for schoolchildren. ACIP’s recommendations also determine which vaccines get covered by the Vaccines for Children Program, a CDC-funded initiative that provides free immunizations to low-income and uninsured children. Half of children in the U.S. are eligible for the VFC program.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdjceg0z002o3b6nur26x8sd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If the new ACIP members withdraw support for a particular vaccine and the CDC director agrees, Tolbert said, the consequences would be immediate. “It would automatically affect what is covered and therefore which vaccines are available to children on Medicaid,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdjceg0z002p3b6necu9jqrs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Health insurance companies have not yet said how they would alter coverage, but Tolbert said such a move would open the door for private insurers to refuse to cover the vaccine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdjceg0z002q3b6ngymy1ga1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Pediatricians worry about a future where parents might have to choose — pay hundreds of dollars out-of-pocket for shots or leave their kids unprotected.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdjceg0z002r3b6neeu37hbg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The &lt;a href="https://www.ahip.org/" target="_blank"&gt;health insurance industry group AHIP&lt;/a&gt; said that health plans “continue to follow federal requirements related to coverage of ACIP-recommended vaccines and will continue to support broad access to critical preventive services, including immunizations.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdjceg0z002s3b6nunlid0fk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Pediatricians say news about President Donald Trump’s new budget law, which is expected to reduce Medicaid spending by about $1 trillion over the next decade, also prompted questions from parents.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdjceg0z002t3b6nivdzf180@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            While parents may be worried about losing their Medicaid, the law doesn’t mention vaccines or change eligibility or benefits for children’s Medicaid, Tolbert said. But less federal funding means states will have to make decisions about who is covered and which services are offered.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdjceg0z002u3b6ngtfjmwi8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            To raise the revenue needed to pay for Medicaid, states could raise taxes; move money earmarked for other spending, such as education or corrections; or, more likely, reduce Medicaid spending.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdjceg0z002v3b6ne7p3s8jd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “And they may do that by cutting eligibility for optional populations or by cutting services that are optional, or by reducing payments to providers in the form of provider rates,” Tolbert said. “It’s unclear how this will play out, and it will likely look different across all states.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdjceg0z002w3b6n26yaf9tt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In May, Kennedy announced in a &lt;a href="https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1927368440811008138" target="_blank"&gt;post on X&lt;/a&gt; that the CDC is no longer recommending the covid-19 vaccine for healthy children and pregnant women. The move &lt;a href="https://downloads.aap.org/AAP/PDF/FiledSuit.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;prompted a lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; by the American Academy of Pediatrics and other physician groups that seeks to freeze Kennedy’s directive.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdjceg0z002x3b6n7q5c7k3q@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In June, the new ACIP members appointed by Kennedy voted to recommend that adults and children no longer receive flu vaccines with thimerosal, a preservative rarely used in some flu vaccines. Anti-vaccine activists, including Kennedy, have &lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/what-is-thimerosal-what-the-research-says-about-the-vaccine-preservative-under-fire-by-rfk-jr" target="_blank"&gt;rallied against thimerosal&lt;/a&gt; for decades, alleging links to autism despite no evidence of any association.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdjceg0z002y3b6n5koy05t4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There is no cause for concern,” Department of Health and Human Services spokesperson Emily Hilliard said in a statement. “As Secretary Kennedy has stated, no one will be denied access to a licensed vaccine if they choose to receive one.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdjceg0z002z3b6nrb50i5v9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “When the ACIP committee met last month, they reaffirmed that flu vaccines will remain accessible and covered, and they emphasized safety by ensuring these vaccines are mercury-free,” Hilliard wrote. “The Vaccines for Children (VFC) program continues to provide COVID-19 vaccines at no cost for eligible children when the parent, provider, and patient decide vaccination is appropriate. Medicaid will continue to reimburse the administration fee.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdjceg0z00303b6nt5158eyb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But the possibility that a vaccine could be restricted or no longer covered by insurance is already changing how parents approach immunization. In Falusi’s practice, parents are scheduling appointments to coincide precisely with their child’s eligibility, sometimes making appointments the same week as their birthdays.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdjceg0z00313b6nxuwdnsmu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://journey-pediatrics.com/our-team/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://journey-pediatrics.com/our-team/" target="_blank"&gt;Melissa Mason&lt;/a&gt;, a pediatrician in Albuquerque, New Mexico, has evaluated some patients who contracted measles during the multistate outbreak that started in neighboring Texas.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdjceg0z00323b6npss52qdr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            She’s concerned that any new limitations on access or reimbursement for childhood vaccines could lead to even more preventable illnesses and deaths.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdjceg0z00333b6ntskcj6b8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Nationally, there have been more than 1,300 measles cases since January, including three deaths, according to the CDC. “We’re seeing this outbreak because vaccination rates are too low and it allows measles to spread in the community,” Mason said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdjceg0z00343b6ng0svx4wa@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Children and teens account for 66% of national measles cases. Mason has begun offering the measles vaccine to infants as young as 6 months old, a full six months earlier than standard practice, though still within federal guidelines.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdjceg0z00353b6nv8bcsbi1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Last year, overall kindergarten&lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/policy-watch/childhood-vaccination-rates-continue-to-decline-as-trump-heads-for-a-second-term/" target="_blank"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/policy-watch/childhood-vaccination-rates-continue-to-decline-as-trump-heads-for-a-second-term/" target="_blank"&gt;vaccination rates fell&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S. At the same time, the number of children with a school vaccination exemption continued to rise.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdjceg0z00363b6nljubxu00@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Pertussis, or whooping cough — another disease that can be deadly to young children — is spreading. &lt;a href="https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/182774" target="_blank"&gt;As of July 5&lt;/a&gt;, more than 15,100 cases had been identified in U.S. residents this year, according to the CDC.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdjceg0z00373b6nbf8ncohz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Mason said pertussis is especially dangerous to babies too young to receive the vaccine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdjceg0z00383b6nw0xbvs1c@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For now, pediatricians are trying to maintain a sense of urgency without inciting panic.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdjceg0z00393b6nrhuzytyk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In Columbia, South Carolina, Greenhouse used to offer families a flexible age range for routine vaccinations.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdjceg0z003a3b6nsn3y5lbo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I’m not saying that anymore,” the pediatrician said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdjceg0z003b3b6n2v1zwybg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            She now urges parents to get their children vaccinated as soon as they are eligible.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdjceg0z003c3b6neie8f6yj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            She described anxious parents asking whether the HPV vaccine, which helps &lt;a href="https://www.acog.org/womens-health/experts-and-stories/the-latest/what-i-tell-every-patient-about-the-hpv-vaccine" target="_blank"&gt;prevent cervical cancer&lt;/a&gt;, can be administered to children younger than the recommended age of 9.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdjceg0z003d3b6nz6esnh2j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I actually had two parents today ask if their 7- or 8-year-olds could get the HPV shot,” Greenhouse said. “I had to tell them it’s not allowed.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdjceg0z003e3b6nttavj3ru@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            With the vaccine requiring multiple doses months apart, Greenhouse fears time may run out for families to get the series covered by insurance. If they have to pay out-of-pocket, she’s afraid some families may choose not to get the second dose. A second dose could cost &lt;a href="https://www.gardasil9.com/patient-a/cost/" target="_blank"&gt;about $300&lt;/a&gt; if no longer covered by insurance.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdjceg0z003f3b6nmt8xu05o@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I cannot be 100% sure what the future looks like for some of these vaccines,” Greenhouse said. “I can tell you it’s a very scary place to be.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdjceg0z003g3b6ndc59iljn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy’s newly appointed vaccine advisory committee is expected to hold its next &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/meetings/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;public meeting&lt;/a&gt; as soon as August.

It can lead to severe plaques that narrow the artery and limit blood flow, or to a crack in the artery wall that can trigger blood clot formation, resulting in a &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2023/06/11/heart-attack-symptoms-shoulder-neck-pain/" target="_blank"&gt;heart attack&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-subscribe-cta" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="JQ4IYHQ67FH3PFZO5LF52XS2UM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;While we’ve seen some major advances in treating heart disease, it remains the leading killer in the United States, even though about 80 percent of cases are &lt;a href="https://world-heart-federation.org/what-we-do/prevention/" target="_blank"&gt;considered preventable&lt;/a&gt;. There are evidence-based steps you can take to stave it off.

Physical activity lowers inflammation in the body. Evidence has shown that both aerobic and &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/interactive/2023/strength-training-gym-workout/" target="_blank"&gt;strength training forms of exercise&lt;/a&gt; are important. But only 1 in 4 Americans meet the two activity guidelines from the &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/fitness/fitness-basics/aha-recs-for-physical-activity-infographic" target="_blank"&gt;American Heart Association&lt;/a&gt;: aerobic exercise of 150 minutes per week of at least moderate physical activity, such as walking, bicycling on level ground, dancing or gardening, and &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2023/11/29/weight-lifting-aging/" target="_blank"&gt;strength training&lt;/a&gt; for at least &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/fitness/fitness-basics/strength-and-resistance-training-exercise#:~:text=The%20American%20Heart%20Association%20recommends,protect%20your%20body%20from%20injury." target="_blank"&gt;two sessions&lt;/a&gt; per week, which typically translates to 60 minutes weekly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="NCWIVNQFG5GBPLYBKMWS2NBPPA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The protective benefit of exercise is seen with even relatively low levels of activity, such as around &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/eurjpc/article/30/18/1975/7226309" target="_blank"&gt;2,500 steps per day&lt;/a&gt; (via sustained physical activity, not starting and stopping), and generally increases proportionately with more activity. It used to be thought that people who exercise only on the weekend — known as &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2023/09/15/weekend-warriors-exercise-heart-health/" target="_blank"&gt;“weekend warriors”&lt;/a&gt; — put themselves in danger, but recent data shows the benefits of exercise &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/JAHA.124.039225" target="_blank"&gt;can be derived&lt;/a&gt; from weekend-only workouts, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="476HUNGHJJDDFHWRH66P7JQR4M" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="476HUNGHJJDDFHWRH66P7JQR4M" data-testid="article-header"&gt;2.

On the other hand, &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/07/21/red-meat-cancer-health/" target="_blank"&gt;red meat&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2022/09/27/ultraprocessed-foods/" target="_blank"&gt;ultra-processed foods&lt;/a&gt; are pro-inflammatory, and you should limit your consumption. &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2023/05/24/protein-weight-loss-muscle-facts/" target="_blank"&gt;High protein intake&lt;/a&gt; of more than 1.4 grams per kilogram of body weight per day — around 95 grams for someone who is 150 pounds — has also been linked to promoting inflammation and to atherosclerosis &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42255-024-00984-2" target="_blank"&gt;in experimental models&lt;/a&gt;. That is particularly related to animal-based proteins and the role of leucine, an essential amino acid that is obtained only by diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="JY76QSFOF5ANHEX63J7LNES43U" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="JY76QSFOF5ANHEX63J7LNES43U" data-testid="article-header"&gt;3.

This kind of tissue can increase the risk of heart disease because it stores fat cells, known as adipocytes, which release substances that contribute to inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="4POYIBYCNFAAXE5ZMPTZP4SFLQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In studies, we’ve seen that &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/07/15/glp1-ozempic-nutrition-muscle-loss/" target="_blank"&gt;glucagon-like peptide (GLP-1)&lt;/a&gt; drugs &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1043661822002651#:~:text=It%20is%20conceivable%20that%20GLP,myocytes%20or%20adipocytes%20%5B13%5D." target="_blank"&gt;can reduce inflammation&lt;/a&gt; with weight loss, and a significant reduction of heart attacks and strokes among high-risk patients treated for obesity. Lean body weight also helps protect against atrial fibrillation, the most common heart rhythm abnormality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="EZWP2AERWNFKFL73VQSBOW2YGI" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="EZWP2AERWNFKFL73VQSBOW2YGI" data-testid="article-header"&gt;4. Know and avoid metabolic syndrome and prediabetes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ZYCEYS7EYZDT3KMPNSCJVWLBXY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Tied into obesity, in part, is the problem of insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome. Two out of three people with obesity have this syndrome, which is defined as having three out of five features: high fasting blood glucose, high fasting triglycerides, high blood pressure, low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and central adiposity (waist circumference of more than 40 inches in men, 35 inches in women).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="FPQOFUC3PFHVRPHICZJ5J6EUMA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Metabolic syndrome is also present in a high proportion of people without obesity, about 50 million Americans. Prediabetes often overlaps with it. Prediabetes is defined as a hemoglobin A1c (a measure of how much glucose is stuck to your red blood cells) between 5.7 and 6.4 percent, or a fasting glucose between 100 and 125 milligrams per deciliter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="2GDROICPCZGQXN6YE3CSKRX3SE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Both metabolic syndrome and prediabetes carry an increased risk of heart disease and can be prevented — and countered — by weight loss, exercise and an optimal diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="7AKK4Z26XZEDZAYB2Y45LCD4HA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;As the glucagon-like peptide drug family moves to pills and less expense in the future, these medications may prove helpful for reducing risk in people with metabolic syndrome and prediabetes. For those with Type 2 diabetes, the goal is optimizing glucose management and maximal attention to lifestyle factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="FP747BTMSBFRLAOB34FWUOR4PQ" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="FP747BTMSBFRLAOB34FWUOR4PQ" data-testid="article-header"&gt;5. Keep your blood pressure in a healthy range&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="OHDSJGNOAFH5XPOVOVGA7GXUEU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Hypertension is an important risk factor for heart disease and is exceptionally common as we age. The optimal blood pressure is 120/80 mm Hg or lower. But with aging, there is often an elevation of systolic blood pressure to about 130 mm Hg, related to stiffening of arteries. While common, it is still considered elevated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ZBS4Z3NB4RB7ZOEMFQOP6VF7UE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Ideally, everyone should monitor their blood pressure with a home device to make sure they haven’t developed hypertension. A mild abnormality of blood pressure will typically improve with lifestyle changes, but more substantial elevations will probably require medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="QSUTN4BKDJDELDGD4BT5B4I7HM" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="QSUTN4BKDJDELDGD4BT5B4I7HM" data-testid="article-header"&gt;6. Find out your genetic risk&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="YBLTTNOY7JACHPO25WGR2XBFBA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;We now have the means of determining your genetic risk of coronary artery disease with what is known as a polygenic risk score, derived from a gene chip. The term polygenic refers to hundreds of DNA variants in the genome that are linked to risk of heart disease. This is very different from a family history, because we’re a product of both our mother’s and father’s genomes, and the way the DNA variants come together in each of us can vary considerably for combinations of variants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="YLR4N7RSHZBSRNDZI2RFUHE4NY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;That means you could have high or low risk for heart disease that is different from your familial pattern. People with a high polygenic risk score benefit the most from medications to lower cholesterol, such as statins. A polygenic risk score can be obtained from a number of commercial companies, though it isn’t typically covered by insurance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="N55MTVM6UNGAHJ5NHUBIC3OWK4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;I don’t recommend getting a calcium score of your coronary arteries via a computed tomography (CT) scan. This test is overused and often induces overwhelming anxiety in patients with a high calcium score but without symptoms or bona fide risk. If you have symptoms suggestive of coronary artery disease, such as chest discomfort with exercise, then a CT angiogram may be helpful to map the coronary arteries. It is much more informative than a calcium score.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="6MQLJBMKUJE75AESQOP5GFJCQU" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="6MQLJBMKUJE75AESQOP5GFJCQU" data-testid="article-header"&gt;7.

While lifestyle improvements can help, significant elevation typically requires medications such as a statin; ezetimibe; bempedoic acid; or injectables such as evolocumab (Repatha), alirocumab (Praluent) or inclisiran (Leqvio). The higher the risk, the more aggressive LDL lowering may be considered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="34SN3RVQYVDJTG2MN6I7B2FTBE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;It should be noted that the use of potent statins, such as rosuvastatin or atorvastatin, especially at high doses, &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/landia/article/PIIS2213-8587(24)00040-8/fulltext" target="_blank"&gt;is linked&lt;/a&gt; to inducing glucose intolerance and risk of Type 2 diabetes.

Regularity means adhering to a routine schedule as much as possible, and its benefit may be due to our body’s preference for maintaining its circadian rhythm. Sleep quality — meaning with fewer interruptions — and maximal deep sleep can be tracked with smartwatches, fitness bands, rings or mattress sensors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="56Z22G7QYVCGPG32WQXOBUOXPY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Sleep apnea, when breathing stops and starts during sleep, is fairly common and often unsuspected. So if you’re having trouble sleeping or you snore loudly, talk to your doctor about ruling out the condition. Testing for sleep apnea can involve checking for good oxygen saturation throughout one’s sleep. That can be done through a sleep study or at home using rings or smartwatches that include oxygen saturation in their sensors and body movement algorithms that pick up disturbed breathing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="KJI4KCNLWNBBDA7T3RLL4APKJM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Eric Topol, MD, is a cardiologist, professor and executive vice president of Scripps Research in San Diego.

                Today's food environment is saturated with ultra-processed food that is particularly harmful to some children.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Back when &lt;a href="https://ph.ucsd.edu/phd/jdp/directory/faculty/boutelle.html" target="_blank"&gt;Kerri Boutelle&lt;/a&gt;'s children were younger, she remembers watching how kids would eat ice cream cones. She noticed a big difference between some siblings.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"One child would eat half of the ice cream cone and put it down," says Boutelle, who's a psychologist at the University of California, San Diego. Another child would eat their cone extremely fast, grab the leftover cone from the first child, and eat that one, too.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;For more than 30 years, Boutelle has helped children with eating disorders and obesity. This informal experiment, she says, illustrates something Boutelle and other scientists are starting to realize: not all children respond to &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2023/05/25/1178163270/ultra-processed-foods-health-risk-weight-gain" target="_blank"&gt;ultra-processed foods &lt;/a&gt;in the same way.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Some children are born with what scientists call a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4076308/" target="_blank"&gt;strong food reward drive&lt;/a&gt;, says psychologist &lt;a href="https://lsa.umich.edu/psych/people/faculty/agearhar.html" target="_blank"&gt;Ashley Gearhardt&lt;/a&gt; at the University of Michigan. They feel extra strong motivation to eat. They're hungry often, may eat quickly, and they don't easily feel full or satiated. Kids with a strong food reward drive can &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2023/10/30/1208883691/diet-ozempic-wegovy-weight-loss-fiber-glp-1-diabetes-barley" target="_blank"&gt;regulate their eating &lt;/a&gt;with whole or minimally processed foods, she says. But with ultra-processed food, they struggle.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Popular advice around ultra-processed foods probably isn't going to work well when a kid has a strong food reward drive, Gearhardt adds. They need different help and guidance to feel good and stay healthy in our society, where these foods are ubiquitous.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"A strong reward drive served people in times of famine, but it's a nightmare in an ultra-processed food environment," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Does your child have a strong food reward drive?&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Today children in the U.S. obtain nearly 70% of their calories — on average — from ultra-processed foods, which contain ingredients rarely found in your kitchen, such as preservatives, natural flavors and emulsifiers. Too many of these foods are tied to a whole &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2024/03/18/1238939706/ultra-processed-food-junk-food-disease-cancer-anxiety-depression-diet" target="_blank"&gt;host of health problems&lt;/a&gt;, including a higher risk of &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34904160/" target="_blank"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2161831322004628" target="_blank"&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10512104/" target="_blank"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5787353/" target="_blank"&gt;obesity&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;There's a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40513976/" target="_blank"&gt;growing consensus&lt;/a&gt; among scientists that many ultra-processed foods &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-metabolism/fulltext/S1550-4131(19)30248-7" target="_blank"&gt;trigger people to overeat.&lt;/a&gt; "Ultra-processed foods are engineered for people to over-consume them," says psychiatrist &lt;a href="https://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/docs/default-source/events/2022-events/faculties/eating-disorders/dr-agnes-ayton.pdf?sfvrsn=43588ce3_2" target="_blank"&gt;Agnes Ayton&lt;/a&gt; at the Royal College of Psychiatrists in London.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;These foods derail two critical aspects of our eating behaviors, Ayton says. They can prompt people to start eating even when they're not hungry, and they can keep us eating even when we're full.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"In our lab, we see that people are pretty good at understanding their hunger and satiety signals when they're eating real food," Gearhardt says. But once you start putting ultra-processed foods on their plates, she says, many people are really bad at eating what their body needs to maintain their weight.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;And when you have a strong food reward drive, regulating eating around ultra-processed foods becomes even harder.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Let's go back to Kerri Boutelle's experiment with ice cream and look more closely at each child.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The first kid, who ate only half the cone, has a &lt;em&gt;lower&lt;/em&gt; food reward drive. With kids like this, ultra-processed foods don't alter their behavior all that much, Boutelle says. They typically eat when they're hungry and listen to their satiety signals. "They just eat to get full, and then they move on," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;The second child, who ate quickly and grabbed the leftovers, has a strong food reward drive. "They want to eat all the time, and it doesn't matter if they're full," Boutelle says. "Those kids are going to gain weight in today's environment" — unless parents help to protect them from the tricks of ultra-processed food.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I always tell parents, 'the environment today tricks kids into overeating,' " she says. "What you can do as a parent is make your home as safe as it can be for your children."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;How to help kids with a strong food reward drive&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;   1. Don't keep a bunch of ultra-processed foods around and then try to regulate how much children eat.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Some families store ultra-processed foods in their home, such as boxes of crackers, granola bars, pretzels and cookies. Then they try to teach children how to eat only a small amount of them at a time, Boutelle says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"But that's really difficult for children," she says. "And it's setting them up for failure." In fact, that strategy is really difficult for many adults, as well.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;    2. Try to keep ultra-processed foods out of your home, but allow them elsewhere.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A more effective strategy is not to buy these foods in the first place. And we know this is hard because the grocery stores are full of them. "But for some kids, it will really be beneficial," Boutelle says.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Then you can help children learn to make healthy choices around ultra-processed foods when they're outside the home. Our society provides many opportunities to eat these foods, including parties, sporting events and even school, says psychologist &lt;a href="https://www.uwhealth.org/providers/katherine-e-schaumberg-phd" target="_blank"&gt;Katherine Schaumberg&lt;/a&gt; at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;You don't want to forbid these foods entirely, she says. That strategy could backfire. "In our culture, food is connection. Having these foods in social settings can facilitate emotional health," she says. "That can outweigh the physical cost of them."&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;    3. If you can't keep them all out, keep no more than three ultra-processed items in your house.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Studies &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40513976/" target="_blank"&gt;show that variety &lt;/a&gt;increases eating. So, Boutelle says, limit the options in your home to only a few ultra-processed foods. For example, keep one bag of pretzels and one package of granola bars in the pantry, and that's it. "If you have ice cream, have only one kind," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;     4. Bring ultra-processed foods into your home only on special occasions.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;To help her two boys learn healthy eating habits, Ashley Gearhardt at the University of Michigan keeps her home basically free of ultra-processed foods. "We have minimally processed foods available to them anytime, except bedtime," she says. "If they're hungry, I tell them, 'Grab a banana, an apple, or some cashews. Go grab the minimally processed popcorn that we've got going on.' "&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Then she buys ultra-processed foods infrequently and only for special events. "Like, 'Oh, we're having a bunch of friends over. Sure, we'll order a bunch of crappy pizza.' "&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We do not forbid ultra-processed foods, but our baseline is foundationally real food."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;This approach works even with her son who has a strong food reward drive, she says. Because he can regulate easily with real food, and he doesn't have to keep resisting the urge for one more cracker, one more pretzel or one more bite of ice cream.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

								&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;What if entry-level jobs haven’t vanished? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;What if we’re just not equipping young people with the skills those roles now call for? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;For years, we told a generation that their future would be secured if they just mastered coding. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We restructured high schools around tech labs. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://allwork.space/2025/05/the-bard-and-the-boardroom-why-todays-best-leaders-read-more-than-metrics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Diminished humanities&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; departments. Smirked at philosophy degrees. We insisted that fluency in logic, math, and engineering would lead to stable, well-compensated careers. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But now, artificial intelligence is doing the coding. And the jobs we built our education systems around? They’re the first being automated away. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The tough truth: we spent years preparing students to behave like machines, just as machines learned to do their jobs. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The issue isn’t that the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://allwork.space/2025/07/talent-development-in-the-future-of-work-starts-with-a-career-climbing-wall/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;span&gt;first step on the career ladder is gone&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. It’s that it shifted, and we’re still looking for it in the old place. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;A Change We Didn’t Anticipate&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The early-career jobs that once served as stepping stones into roles like analyst, marketer, developer, or support staff are no longer the go-to entry. Employers are now leaning on AI to complete those tasks more efficiently and at lower cost. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The people still succeeding? They aren’t necessarily those with the newest diplomas or technical badges. They’re the ones with insight. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://allwork.space/2025/05/working-smarter-with-ai-why-critical-thinking-is-still-your-superpower/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Judgment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. Human nuance. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;According to the latest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.hiringlab.org/2025/04/01/february-2025-jolts-report-scared-of-our-own-shadow/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt; &lt;span&gt;JOLTS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; numbers, U.S. hiring has dropped to a level not seen in over seven years. And the hit to early-career roles is even steeper — &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reveliolabs.com/news/macro/white-collar-workers-are-getting-the-blues/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Revelio Labs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; found that white-collar entry-level postings dropped 12.7% in the past year. Jobs like software development and business analysis saw declines near 25%. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;And this downturn is gaining speed. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei recently&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/julianhayesii/2025/05/31/ceos-jensen-huang-and-dario-amodei-on-ai-adapt-or-be-replaced/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt; &lt;span&gt;cautioned &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; that we’re “sleepwalking into mass unemployment,” warning that half of today’s entry-level knowledge jobs could be &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://allwork.space/2025/05/anthropic-ceo-warns-ai-will-swiftly-decimate-entry-level-white-collar-jobs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;span&gt;gone in five years&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. These aren’t &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://allwork.space/2025/05/u-s-secretary-of-commerce-says-factory-jobs-for-life-is-the-future-of-work-for-you-your-kids-and-your-grandkids/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;span&gt;manufacturing roles&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. They’re junior-level positions in finance, media, tech, and law — the exact tracks young professionals were steered toward. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This doesn’t signal the collapse of opportunity; it marks a necessary correction. One that exposes what we’ve been missing. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;We Focused on the Wrong Edge&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;AI can’t replicate lived experience. It doesn’t read social signals in a client pitch, weigh complex trade-offs, or assess team dynamics mid-crisis. It doesn’t know when to push, when to pause, or how to build trust across functions. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Those capabilities used to be built gradually — on the job, through exposure, mentorship, and real-world trial and error. But if AI is stepping into roles that once served as that training ground, we now face a new challenge: how to teach the human elements earlier. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;While tech skills are being automated at lightning speed, AI still lacks imagination, empathy, moral reasoning, and contextual awareness. In a world powered by machines, it’s no longer about having the right answer. It’s about knowing the right questions, reading the full picture, and leading people through uncertainty. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We haven’t been preparing students for that. In the U.S., the percentage of degrees in the humanities has&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amacad.org/humanities-indicators/higher-education/bachelors-degrees-humanities" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt; &lt;span&gt;dropped&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; from over 17% in the late 1960s to under 9% in 2022. Since the early 2000s, degrees in fields like English, history, and languages&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://dailynous.com/2024/01/16/demographic-trends-in-the-us-philosophy-major-2001-2022-guest-post/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt; &lt;span&gt;have nearly halved&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. Philosophy majors are now just 0.4% of all college graduates. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We treated this as evolution. As practicality. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Now we’re realizing it was a mistake. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Human Skills Are the Real Competitive Edge&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The most crucial skills in this AI era aren’t “soft” — they’re essential. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Empathy. Persuasion. Ethical reasoning. Cultural literacy. Systems thinking. Creativity in uncertain terrain. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;These skills are honed through literature, political science, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://allwork.space/2025/05/four-commitments-of-successful-anthropological-leaders/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;span&gt;anthropology&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, ethics, philosophy, which are disciplines we’ve steadily pushed to the margins. Not because of nostalgia, but because they’re strategic assets. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Because when AI can produce answers instantly, the advantage goes to those who know what matters, how to frame problems, and how to communicate meaning. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If we want to prepare future workers for a world where machines handle the tasks, we must reinvest in what makes us human. That means restoring the humanities — not as electives, but as core professional competencies. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It means broadening how we evaluate talent to include clarity, curiosity, and adaptability, not just credentials. And it means recalibrating STEM education to include ethics, systems awareness, and human-centered thinking. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This isn’t about going back in time. It’s about catching up with the world we’ve already stepped into. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We trained a generation for technical precision, just as that became commoditized by machines. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Now it’s time to invest in something AI can’t do: being deeply, powerfully human. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Because when the bots deliver the output, the real value lies with the person who sees the bigger story, and knows why it matters. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

What seemed like a harmless appointment quickly turned into something far more serious—one that would eventually land him in the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Christopher Kennedy, 68, went in for a simple X-ray before routine surgery, expecting it to be a quick visit. Instead, doctors spotted scarring on his lungs. Kennedy, a healthy, active retired Air Force tech who trained therapy dogs, had no clue anything was wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Pulmonary Hypertension: Recognizing the critical symptoms&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;But after more tests, he got hit with a tough diagnosis: idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) — a lung disease with no clear cause that slowly robs you of breath, CBS News reported. At first, he thought he could fight it off. But by 2024, his doctors gave him a heartbreaking prognosis: less than a year to live.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later he underwent a lung transplant and his lung capacity is currently 98%. "He is back to spending time with his wife, children and grandkids. He is able to exercise at home and was recently able to take his dog for a walk without losing his breath. He's almost done training the canine, a Bernese Mountain dog named Fini, to be a hospital therapy dog," the report says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis: The lung disease you’ve probably never heard of—but should&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s talk about your lungs—not in a scary way, but in a “this-is-good-to-know” way. There’s a sneaky disease out there called idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, or IPF for short. It sounds like a mouthful, and honestly, it kind of is. But here’s the deal: this condition is serious, underdiagnosed, and affects thousands of people, especially older adults. And the kicker? We still don’t really know what causes it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;So, what exactly is IPF?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At its core, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a disease that messes with your lungs by causing scar tissue to build up inside them. Think of it like slowly wrapping your lungs in shrink-wrap. The more scar tissue, the harder it is to breathe. Over time, people with IPF find themselves gasping for air just doing simple things like walking to the kitchen or climbing a few stairs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The word “idiopathic” basically means “we don’t know why it happens,” which is a frustrating part of this disease. Unlike lung issues caused by smoking, pollution, or working in dusty environments, IPF just shows up uninvited. No clear reason, no obvious trigger. One day your lungs are fine, and the next, they start stiffening up like they’re made of cardboard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What are the signs something’s wrong?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s where things get tricky. The symptoms of IPF are super vague—things like a dry cough that won’t quit or being out of breath more than usual. It’s easy to write these off as just getting older, being out of shape, or dealing with allergies. That’s why so many people get diagnosed late, sometimes when the disease has already taken a major toll.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.lung.org/lung-health-diseases/lung-disease-lookup/pulmonary-fibrosis/introduction/symptoms" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;American Lung Association&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, IPF can sneak up on people because its symptoms often mimic other, more common lung issues. Most folks start noticing signs somewhere between age 50 and 70, but by then, it’s easy to chalk things up to aging or being “a little out of shape.” That’s why it’s crucial to speak up if you feel something’s off—especially if you’re out of breath from basic activities, dealing with a nagging dry cough, or feeling unusually tired. Even symptoms like unintended weight loss, achy joints, or weird changes in your fingertips (called “clubbing”) could be clues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’ve got any family history of lung disease or have worked around chemicals or pollutants, don’t keep it to yourself—tell your doctor. And don’t be afraid to push for answers if your symptoms aren’t improving. PF has many causes, and getting the right diagnosis means seeing a specialist who knows what to look for. Early action can help manage symptoms and give you more control over your health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why IPF deserves more attention right now&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, let’s face it—breathing is kind of a big deal. You don’t want to take it for granted. If you or someone you love is dealing with a mysterious cough or unexplained shortness of breath, it’s worth getting it checked out. The sooner IPF is caught, the more options you have.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Mon, 28 Jul 2025 05:23:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiogJBVV95cUxPNGR2ZkZxc3lfejUtM1hSWEg5TUtMN0Y1alI4MlBYSzVUNlB1cXM0RkRfLTRPRE1tNXF1eFhxNGVKai1sTzFmWWlKbmpjcExGWlFQVXdfWmdpQzdFT2pMRUhHMlV4N0czYzhFa1BJT3l4emd2cVNEb1VudHUzUHh6b0RPMDBzQkFHeGdWTEhGa2M4YjlNTzBLaW1ZSUlJYndQUTREM3ROR2FmOUxTMmJWSEVtQTdvRk5rVjN6UzNla0haWnR3Q2hPTVJuLVdLYi1lbUctN2hkNWpWVXQ0Y1Q5dVMwSDM1cHNVMGtucGNudXZFR1FlaTN5Si1sS3BFZE9wRzNKNHdHMTFOWVVleElhaHMwSWk5c0d5cU54MVlQUWpTdw</guid></item><item><title>为什么6 ‑ 6 ‑ 6步行程序正在传播病毒，以及它如何支持减肥和心理健康-印度时报</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinAJBVV95cUxQQnN2Y2RobDdlUl9fd0piVWNxaEFvMlpVZmk4bzhMdWFXWEM5U1hYMXN5WWhZLVpmWThSX1J4Ri1PcDVjN24yQ3ZnSnlEcGNFbDRURzNJSTRMdV9VaGpiNWc4TkhIRmZrNTRfNDhTMU1hLTQxV1pjTnBZQ3FpNGpuQzZMVVB3Y292QUdZSDBDblp5OFdMNG1sWGpiYjAxWWxjbjV4TXNRTm05NExubExkclNYQ256MEhKeGNKczlFbi1sdmNjbFdQVUEzdVg3anRnQzBkWm44a2w5d2c5STJGYlM2dERlZEtaT1ZSc0xkNkl6NTA1MmtpX0RGdDVvYkp1ZXVUT3I5Ty00MEhKS3BsQmFSRTdoMDdoMlNiNQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 6-6-6 walking challenge has taken over social media, Instagram, and wellness blogs, despite its name sounding a bit ominous. The format is simple: walk for 60 minutes at a brisk pace, with a 6-minute warm-up and 6-minute cool-down, ideally starting at 6 a.m. or 6 p.m. Some people also interpret it as walking 6,000 steps per day for 6 days a week, offering a more flexible version that still builds daily consistency. Its popularity stems from the structure being catchy, easy to remember, and practical. Many find that having a set walking time reduces decision fatigue and makes the habit easier to maintain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why the 6-6-6 walking format helps build healthy habits&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health and fitness coaches say the challenge works because it’s structured but not extreme. Committing to an hour of walking at a fixed time each day helps people incorporate physical activity into their daily routine. Doing it in the morning or evening also means it’s more likely to become a ritual, much like brushing your teeth. This kind of consistency is key for habit formation, especially for those new to fitness or trying to lose weight without joining a gym.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;From right shoes to warming up right: 5 safety rules to follow while walking&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What science says about walking and your health&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walking remains one of the most underrated yet powerful forms of exercise. According to a 2021 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34477847/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;study &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;published in JAMA Network Open, walking at least 7,000 steps a day was associated with a 50–70% lower risk of mortality in middle-aged adults. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 6-6-6 challenge typically pushes you into that beneficial 6,000–7,000 step range within an hour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brisk walking also keeps your heart rate in the “Zone 2” aerobic range (50–70% of your maximum heart rate), which supports fat metabolism and endurance without stressing your joints. As supported by &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6355121/?" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;data &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;from the American College of Sports Medicine, this level of aerobic activity helps improve cardiovascular function, insulin sensitivity, and even mood by lowering anxiety and depression levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Can the 6-6-6 walk help with weight loss?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, but with a caveat. Walking can contribute to fat loss when paired with a calorie-controlled diet. On its own, though, walking an hour daily without adjusting your nutrition may lead to slower results. According to a study published in Obesity, participants who exercised in the morning (between 7 a.m. and 9 a.m.) tended to have lower BMI and waist circumference. However, the researchers noted that these were correlations, not definitive proof that walking in the morning alone causes weight loss. Personal experiences vary. One lifestyle writer reported improved alertness and energy but couldn’t sustain the routine due to fatigue and scheduling issues. Another participant enjoyed clocking over 15,000 steps a day but found the two-hour daily commitment excessive compared to her regular fitness plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Who benefits most from the 6-6-6 walking challenge?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This walking challenge is ideal for beginners, people returning to fitness, or those looking for a low-impact exercise they can do daily. It’s inclusive, requires no special equipment, and can be done anywhere; just lace up your shoes and head outside or hop on a treadmill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, if your schedule is inconsistent or you're already doing intense workouts, the strict daily structure might not be sustainable. Fitness experts suggest adapting the plan: you can split the walk into two 30-minute sessions or do it five days a week instead of six. The goal is to make it fit your lifestyle, not disrupt it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The wellness benefits of sticking to the 6‑6‑6 walking challenge&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The benefits of a consistent walking habit go far beyond calorie burn:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Improves fat metabolism: Brisk walking encourages your body to burn fat more efficiently without the high-impact strain of running.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Improves heart and metabolic health: Regular aerobic activity helps regulate blood sugar, cholesterol, and blood pressure.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Enhances mood and reduces stress: Walking outdoors, especially in the morning, exposes you to natural light, which supports your circadian rhythm and can ease anxiety.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Strengthens muscles and bones: As a weight-bearing exercise, walking supports lower body strength and helps prevent bone density loss.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 6-6-6 walking challenge offers a simple yet effective way to commit to daily movement. It’s backed by research showing the benefits of moderate-intensity aerobic activity and structured routines.

But what if there’s a scan that could tell you your real heart attack risk long before symptoms show up? There is a quick, painless CT scan that looks for calcium buildup in your arteries (a major red flag for heart disease). It’s way more accurate at predicting future heart attacks than just looking at cholesterol alone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The kicker? Most people have never even heard of it. Whether you're in your 40s and feeling fine or just curious about your long-term heart health, this scan might be the wake-up call you didn’t know you needed. Here's what it is, how it works, and why it might just save your life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Heart Attack Warning Signs That Women May Confuse With Menopause Symptoms&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is the &lt;keyword id="28027653" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="Coronary-Artery-Calcium-Test" source="keywords"&gt;Coronary Artery Calcium Test&lt;/keyword&gt;?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CAC test is a simple, non-invasive CT scan (a type of X-ray) that looks specifically for calcium deposits in the coronary arteries the blood vessels that supply your heart muscle with oxygen-rich blood. These calcium spots are essentially hardened bits of plaque resulting from the buildup of fats, cholesterol, and other substances in your arteries (a process called atherosclerosis). The presence and amount of calcium in your arteries signal the extent of coronary artery disease (CAD), which is the main cause of heart attacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div data-type="in_view" class="  "&gt;&lt;div class="EEW3_ timeline_pollWrapper_as " data-scrollga="scroll#poll_view"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="hLnAH"&gt;Poll&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="KEEGr"&gt;What do you think is the most important factor in assessing heart health?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Think of it this way: Your cholesterol test gives you clues, but it’s kind of like guessing what’s inside a wrapped gift. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CAC test is like unwrapping it to see if there’s actually something you should worry about inside your arteries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A coronary calcium scan isn't for everyone, but it's the finest way for those who are uncertain about their heart disease risk to make better decisions about treatment and medications," &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/the-heart-test-you-may-need-but-likely-havent-heard-of" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;says &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michael Blaha, M.D., M.P.H., director of clinical research at the Ciccarone Center for the Prevention of Heart Disease at Johns Hopkins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why is this test a game changer?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people rely on cholesterol levels (LDL, HDL, total cholesterol) and traditional risk calculators to estimate their heart attack risk. But these don’t always tell the whole story. The CAC test:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Detects plaque buildup early often before symptoms appear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Helps predict your actual heart attack risk better than cholesterol numbers alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guides decisions on preventative treatment, especially whether or not you should start or continue statin medications (which lower cholesterol).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gives you a clear calcium score, a numeric value that correlates with your risk level — from zero (no calcium, low risk) to over 1,000 (very high risk).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Who should consider getting a CAC Test?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The test isn’t for everyone. Various health guidelines suggest considering it if you:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Are between 40-80 years old.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Have an intermediate risk of heart disease based on risk factors like age, blood pressure, smoking, diabetes, or family history.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Are unsure whether to start statin therapy or want to weigh benefits versus possible side effects.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Have a family history of early heart disease but otherwise seem low-risk.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your healthcare provider can help you decide if this test makes sense for you. It’s not typically recommended if you have low risk or already have known heart disease, because other tests may be better suited then.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What does the research say?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies in the US consistently highlight how the CAC test improves risk prediction. For example, the MESA study (Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis) showed that CAC scoring can better identify those at risk of heart attack who might have been missed by traditional risk calculators. The test also helps avoid unnecessary statin use in low-risk people scoring zero, reducing overtreatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re worried about your heart health but don’t have clear symptoms, and your cholesterol or risk scores seem “in the middle,” a CAC test can be a powerful eye-opener.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s something wild—Johns Hopkins researchers studied nearly 7,000 people to see how well we’re actually predicting heart risk. They looked at two methods: one used the usual risk factors like cholesterol levels, smoking habits, blood pressure, and diabetes. The other added in results from a Coronary Artery Calcium (CAC) scan—that quick CT scan that checks for calcium buildup in your heart arteries. Turns out, adding the CAC scan seriously sharpened the accuracy. According to a 2013 study published in the European Heart Journal, some people who were told they were at very low risk based on traditional factors actually had high calcium scores—15% of them, in fact. That’s a big deal. Even more surprising? Around 35% of people flagged as high risk had zero calcium buildup, meaning they might not be in as much danger as once thought. Bottom line: the CAC test can change how we see and treat heart risk—big time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s quick, painless, and offers a peek inside your arteries that cholesterol tests simply can’t. The real value? Knowing your risk can save your life by prompting early treatment or lifestyle changes — or putting your mind at ease if your arteries are clean.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="60"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: This information is for educational purposes only and is not medical advice.

The order you eat your food can help control blood sugar. Start with non‑starchy vegetables like salad or stir-fried greens, then move on to protein and good fats like dal, paneer, eggs, nuts or seeds. Finally, finish with carbohydrates such as roti, rice, or millet. Eating this way slows down digestion and helps avoid sudden glucose spikes. It also boosts insulin response, helps you feel full longer, and supports better metabolic health. Perfect for people with pre‑diabetes, type 2 diabetes, or anyone wanting steadier energy levels&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;What is &lt;keyword id="20112381" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="meal-sequencing" source="keywords"&gt;meal sequencing&lt;/keyword&gt; and how it works in controlling blood sugar&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meal sequencing refers to eating your meal components in a specific order:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Vegetables (especially non‑starchy/fiber-rich)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Proteins and healthy fats&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Carbohydrates (grains, starches, or sweets)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eating fiber and protein first slows gastric emptying and reduces the rate at which carbohydrates are absorbed. This helps reduce post-meal blood sugar spikes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;How meal sequencing works&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;1. GLP‑1 release and insulin efficiency: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Protein and fat eaten first increase incretin hormones like GLP‑1, triggering better insulin response and slowing down glucose absorption&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;2. Delayed gastric emptying: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starting meals with fibre and fats slows digestion, leading to a gradual blood sugar rise rather than a sudden spike&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;3. Improved insulin sensitivity: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consistent sequencing may gradually enhance the body's insulin function, benefiting long‑term metabolic health. This can help regulate blood sugar levels more effectively and reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Benefits of meal sequencing&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;By adopting a meal sequencing approach, individuals with diabetes can experience several benefits, including:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Better post-meal &lt;keyword id="20068265" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="blood-sugar-control" source="keywords"&gt;blood sugar control&lt;/keyword&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; Eating vegetables and protein before carbohydrates can slow down the digestion and absorption of glucose, reducing blood sugar spikes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reduced insulin requirements:&lt;/strong&gt; By regulating blood sugar levels, meal sequencing can help reduce the need for insulin medication and improve long-term metabolic health and glycemic control.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improved overall &lt;keyword id="20013370" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="diabetes-management" source="keywords"&gt;diabetes management&lt;/keyword&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;

By controlling blood sugar levels and improving insulin sensitivity, meal sequencing can also support weight loss.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enhanced nutrient absorption:&lt;/strong&gt; Eating a balanced meal with vegetables, protein, and complex carbohydrates can ensure optimal nutrient absorption.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Also read | &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/control-blood-sugar-levels-at-home-with-natural-herbs/articleshow/122810856.cms" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Natural herbs that help regulate blood sugar levels at home&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="js_tbl_readmore_btn" data-ua-type="1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Mon, 28 Jul 2025 04:03:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikAJBVV95cUxOMVBKeFZ2UUN2TVVEOGxBSkNTdV9fTUQyZVh4Yk93U1VtOTEtMjh5c3k0aWFlYU1vRFBVLW9qVGRzMjYwQmJkV3JRMFRLazdHZE9RVkp5ZzlXaTM5dkZMYWhUank3VV9abVphaDNVb3ZONEhjMmk5UkpjNG5ZN2ltY1JOb1JVdlBKbTJtRzdPdUliQkY2TVo0bkRXMEFocjhWRmpSQkRGNUp2M3NVY1JmcUtDcms4dnZ5UnBIdG9IdENKZmJSMmV0SEVlZHBxbWh4VFU3RnFxS0doc0d0ZGxLSVlMOHBaV1dkVE5vUy12aHk2U3Qwbm9rUnpGcVQ0aDhILU9EV2xPWWpoRmh3LWhCZA</guid></item><item><title>我是越来越多的中风年轻人之一， 19岁时瘫痪了……我是如何卷土重来的--《每日邮报》</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipAFBVV95cUxOVG9QX1JQRThyUFBDOWttSGppNVRRYUxiaDc3NTZ3Ulp6OWRlMVVrZEZheFltQnhLa2Q3VG5mUnM2TmVad3poUE9MYWdCQk5kWHVnWWZLd3hET3BmbWVsUXpHbkRaRFhhT0lySmFZNzJtUUtKczdILWVhcXk0SUt3S3poVjYxaGVSM0JZOGVGVEYtMVE3Z0Y3YU5zeVZkZ1pmYVBYbNIBqgFBVV95cUxPQ1ZPQXBpVURXSVZWUUd5ejBOdGFmYW5zX3hGVHhseDhqZk9pWDNvR2tFRVhmMFVCSy1QV3RqOEZSSTdYdmlSWXdUZDFDZUwxbW8xa2JqcmwyNEgtR0E2dkN2QU9lV1VwV3psZXNXSkR5VXd0T3dJa0x2ektNWTV5dTFqQlVXMWJoNTFZSTZjdkwtY0pXcUZmRnVfZXJ2S0tkQXJRVVNHbWU5UQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sophia Gedgaudas was just 19 years old when she suffered a life-changing stroke and was given a 15 percent chance of survival. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2019, Gedgaudas had moved &lt;span&gt;from Kenosha, Wisconsin, to San Francisco&lt;/span&gt; to become a pilot with dreams of also joining an NFL team as a cheerleader.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, on February 5, two days after the &lt;a target="_self" href="/sport/super_bowl/index.html" id="mol-4f6d48e0-6806-11f0-80c7-7b44e4cbf215" class=""&gt;Super Bowl&lt;/a&gt;, Gedgaudas and her family were at her home &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14711513/Doctors-say-silent-mini-stroke-explain-constant-fatigue.html"&gt;when she suffered a stroke&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to Gedgaudas's mother Lily, her parents found her laying on the ground completely paralyzed with her mouth drooping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Gedgaudas told DailyMail.com: 'My entire family had flown in to watch the game and spend the week together.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The aspiring pilot was immediately rushed to the hospital where doctors told her that she had suffered a stroke due to extremely high cholesterol from a hereditary condition known as high lipoprotein (a). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lipoproteins are protein molecules that transport fat in the body, including cholesterol and triglycerides. Elevated levels of these can pose a risk to cardiovascular health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Sophia Gedgaudas, a stroke survivor, is the reigning women's champion at Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW) in Louisville, Kentucky&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;High Lipoprotein (a) is a genetic condition that creates a new form of cholesterol in the body that is similar to LDL (bad) cholesterol but has an additional protein. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This new kind of cholesterol causes a buildup of plaque in arteries, triggering inflammation and increased blood clotting, ultimately hindering blood flow to the heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As a result, people with this condition have a significantly increased risk of cardiovascular disease, including heart attacks and strokes - even if they take precautionary measures such as eating health and not smoking. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About one in five Americans, or around 64 million people, suffer from high lipoprotein(a).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In Gedgaudas's case, her condition created a blood clot in her brain that resulted in a stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the CDC, about 800,000 Americans experience a stroke each year while an estimated 138,000 Americans die from it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While usually associated with older populations, recent data indicates a concerning increase in stroke rates among individuals aged between 18 and 44.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About 120,000 Americans under the age of 50 and 1.5 million young adults worldwide suffer a stroke each year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sedentary lifestyles, poor diet, substance abuse (including smoking and excessive alcohol consumption), and stress are increasingly recognized as major contributors to stroke in young adults. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She told the website: 'It was a complete shock. I've been an athlete my entire life—a state champion gymnast, a black belt in karate, and a competitive dancer and cheerleader. No one ever expected someone like me to have high cholesterol. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'But because of my genetics, my lipoprotein(a) level raised my cholesterol to dangerous levels and that's ultimately what caused my stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'At the time, I was completely paralyzed and could only respond with one word: "yeah." That's all I could say.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Gedgaudas pictured here two days before she suffered a life-changing stroke&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Doctors told her that she had extremely high cholesterol due to a hereditary condition known as high lipoprotein (a)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Gedgaudas's doctors initially prescribed her a tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) - a medication used to treat heart attacks by dissolving blood clots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, due to the large size of the clot, the medication failed to work and she was forced to undergo a thrombectomy, a procedure where doctors insert a catheter into an artery through the groin to remove the clot. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But while doctors were able to successfully remove the life-threatening clot, she was left partially deaf as the stroke damaged parts of her brain responsible for hearing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The intensive surgery combined with the paralysis she suffered left Gedgaudas struggling to recover for three years, relearning how to walk, talk, eat and read. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;During this time, she watched numerous wrestling matches and decided she wanted to pursue the sport rather than becoming a pilot and cheerleader. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;She now battles a hearing disability, another long-term effect of the stroke&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The now 25-year-old said: 'My dad would sit with me in the ICU and put wrestling on the TV. My mom says the first time I smiled after the stroke was while watching wrestling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Later, my brother took me to a live show, and after we left, I said, "That's what I'm going to do."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'There were days I didn't want to get out of bed. I was angry, I was depressed. But watching wrestling made me believe I could do something again. It gave me hope and purpose.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Once being given the green light by her entire medical team in 2022, she began training to be a professional wrestler.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2023, she made her debut and quickly became a standout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now, Gedgaudas is the reigning women's champion at &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/ohio/index.html" id="mol-c39760a0-52c8-11f0-a7ef-eb27e70b591a"&gt;Ohio&lt;/a&gt; Valley Wrestling (OVW) in Louisville, &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/kentucky/index.html" id="mol-c396eb70-52c8-11f0-a7ef-eb27e70b591a" class=""&gt;Kentucky&lt;/a&gt; - where wrestling legends John Cena, Dave Batista, Brock Lesnar and Randy Orton started their road to stardom. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Gedgaudas's condition caused a blood clot in her brain, resulting in a stroke and left her paralyzed&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;For the future, Gedgaudas has global ambitions and hopes to one day wrestle internationally&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She told DailyMail.com: 'Being part of OVW means everything to me. There's so much history here and amazing wrestlers that have come through, and I want to be one of the names. I want to show people a disability shouldn't stop anyone from reaching the top.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Gedgaudas continued: 'For a long time, I was embarrassed that I was partially deaf. I saw it as a weakness and didn't want anyone to think I was limited. But over time, I realized it's just part of who I am - and there's nothing to be ashamed of. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Now, I embrace it. I've learned to adapt in ways that work for me. I've gotten good at reading lips, and in the ring, I naturally turn my good ear toward the sound so I can hear what I need to. Most importantly, I stay super focused. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'By staying locked in, I'm able to catch cues and respond without missing a beat. It's not always easy, but I've found ways to make it work - and even turn it into a strength.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I have to read matches differently, and I rely on instincts and body language. It forces me to be completely in the moment, and I think it makes me a better performer.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To stay healthy and prevent another stroke, Gedgaudas workouts and follows a special diet comprised of fruits, vegetables, whole grains and lean proteins including chicken and fish. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For the future, Gedgaudas has global ambitions and hopes to one day wrestle internationally. But for now, her mission is personal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I want to wrestle in the UK, Japan, anywhere. But more than that, I want to keep helping people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'That's why I do this. Wrestling saved my life, and now I want to help someone else believe they can fight through whatever they're facing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 28 Jul 2025 03:48:59 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipAFBVV95cUxOVG9QX1JQRThyUFBDOWttSGppNVRRYUxiaDc3NTZ3Ulp6OWRlMVVrZEZheFltQnhLa2Q3VG5mUnM2TmVad3poUE9MYWdCQk5kWHVnWWZLd3hET3BmbWVsUXpHbkRaRFhhT0lySmFZNzJtUUtKczdILWVhcXk0SUt3S3poVjYxaGVSM0JZOGVGVEYtMVE3Z0Y3YU5zeVZkZ1pmYVBYbNIBqgFBVV95cUxPQ1ZPQXBpVURXSVZWUUd5ejBOdGFmYW5zX3hGVHhseDhqZk9pWDNvR2tFRVhmMFVCSy1QV3RqOEZSSTdYdmlSWXdUZDFDZUwxbW8xa2JqcmwyNEgtR0E2dkN2QU9lV1VwV3psZXNXSkR5VXd0T3dJa0x2ektNWTV5dTFqQlVXMWJoNTFZSTZjdkwtY0pXcUZmRnVfZXJ2S0tkQXJRVVNHbWU5UQ</guid></item><item><title>新型牙线可替代疫苗针头，研究结果- ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimwFBVV95cUxNRVgtS0tWZGx5Nl9COGJjVUlkTG5ZZXhKT1hRYVN1MW82SE1aaVViY2lfXzExRjU3a3pCZFZLeDZ0Yi1EakVodWlQLWxEczY1eTMyT2xuN3NoM0RuTEw1cHhzdjlOZUNQNjNzVDU4NlBZdU5jYmVkRTFWVnhOSE1JejgzSjA5U1k3TThJdFNUNXJIYkNtc1M0Nno5SQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;A fear of needles is a common reason for avoiding vaccines, even &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1017/S0033291721002609"&gt;among many adults&lt;/a&gt;. Now researchers have come up with a rather clever alternative: dental floss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Led by a team from Texas Tech University, the researchers first identified an often overlooked surface in the mouth as an entry point for vaccines: the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junctional_epithelium"&gt;junctional epithelium&lt;/a&gt; (JE), which sits where the gums meet the teeth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The JE is leaky by design, because it allows &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/this-centuries-old-hack-is-a-proven-way-to-boost-your-health-and-immunity"&gt;immune cells&lt;/a&gt; to move around and defend the oral cavity from bacterial attack. The researchers wondered whether this could also make this part of the mouth a suitable target for vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We hypothesized that this leakiness of the JE could expedite the entry of vaccine antigens, and the abundance of immune cells in this microenvironment could elicit an adaptive immune response," the researchers &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41551-025-01451-3"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;in their recently published paper.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/which-arm-gets-vaccinated-could-play-a-role-in-your-immune-response?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;Which Arm Gets Vaccinated Could Play a Role in Your Immune Response&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Delivering medications to the JE is complicated by the tissue's seclusion within the gumline, which is why it hasn't really been considered as a potential location &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jconrel.2014.05.060"&gt;for introducing vaccines&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's where floss comes in, which is perfect for getting into tight spaces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers tested their hypothesis by coating dental floss with different &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/the-pfizer-and-moderna-vaccines-are-a-breakthrough-here-s-how-they-work"&gt;types of vaccines&lt;/a&gt; and testing them on mice across a period of several weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_169026" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-169026" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/MouseFloss.jpg" alt="Mouse flossing diagram" class="wp-image-169026 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/MouseFloss.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/MouseFloss-600x246.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-169026" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers targeted a specific part of the mouth in mice. (Ingrole et al., &lt;em&gt;Nat. Biomed. Eng.&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were numerous encouraging indicators: strong &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/which-arm-gets-vaccinated-could-play-a-role-in-your-immune-response"&gt;immune responses&lt;/a&gt; were observed in the mouth and throughout the bodies of the mice, and the floss vaccine was effective in protecting mice against a later  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-influenza" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="103478" data-postid="169023" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;flu&lt;/a&gt; infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further tests were conducted on human volunteers using dye rather than a vaccine, since  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/clinical-trials" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73032" data-postid="169023" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; are still some way off. The amount of dye that reached the JE target via flossing was enough to suggest that this really could work in us too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These findings establish floss-based vaccination as a simple, needle-free strategy that enhances vaccine delivery and immune activation compared with existing mucosal immunization methods," &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41551-025-01451-3"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's not the first time scientists have looked beyond the thorough cleaning job that floss does. Earlier this year &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-smart-dental-floss-can-detect-your-stress-from-saliva"&gt;research showed&lt;/a&gt; that floss could also be adapted to measure stress levels in the body, potentially giving doctors another useful diagnostic tool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As well as being potentially less scary for those with a phobia of needles, floss-based vaccines would be easier to transport and store. Doctors and nurses wouldn't be needed to administer them, and they could even be delivered in the post – a real advantage in the case of pandemics &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/here-s-why-some-covid-19-strains-are-spreading-faster-than-others"&gt;such as COVID-19&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers have previously tried to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jconrel.2021.03.017"&gt;deliver vaccines orally&lt;/a&gt; under the tongue and in the cheek, but not enough of the vaccine penetrates the tissue into circulation.

But if you’re munching on the wrong stuff every day, you could be stressing them out big time without even realizing it. Kidney health isn’t just about avoiding alcohol or salty snacks once in a while — it’s about what’s quietly adding up on your plate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some everyday favorites might be silently working against your kidney function. The scary part? You don’t need to have kidney disease for damage to start. In fact, your kidneys can be under pressure long before any symptoms show up. So if you’re serious about preventing kidney damage or just want to be more mindful of your diet, here are the worst offenders hiding in plain sight — and what to eat instead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Salty processed &amp;amp; packaged foods&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Salt is public enemy #1 when it comes to kidney health. The &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/healthy-eating/diabetes-and-kidney-disease-food.html" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;US CDC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; slams high-salt foods, especially the “invisible” salt hiding out in canned soups, frozen dinners, chips, crackers, processed meats (like deli turkey, bacon), restaurant meals, and even sauces and salad dressings. Why? Too much sodium makes your kidneys retain water, raises your blood pressure, and speeds up kidney damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;What to do:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Skip those “convenience” and restaurant meals when you can.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Always eyeball the nutrition facts label—the lower the sodium, the better.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Experiment with herbs, lemon, or vinegar for flavor. Hold the salt shaker!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Sugary drinks &amp;amp; colas&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You guessed it, sugary sodas (especially “dark” colas) are rough on the kidneys. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not only do they contribute to obesity and diabetes (major kidney killers), but colas also sneak in a double whammy with high phosphorus content, which weak kidneys can’t process well. Too much phosphorus ends up damaging blood vessels and bones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surprise sources:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dark colas and some flavored waters.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sweetened iced teas and energy drinks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;What to do:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Choose plain water or unsweetened alternatives.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you must have a soda, switch to clear, caffeine-free versions now and then.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Fast food &amp;amp; packaged dinners&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This one stings, right? Burgers, fries, pizza, and instant noodles are the trifecta of trouble: loaded with sodium, saturated fat, and often sky-high in both phosphorus and potassium (another mineral that can pile up in your blood if kidneys aren’t healthy).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;What to do:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Limit fast food outings.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you do indulge, ask for food with “no added salt” and avoid extra cheese or sauces.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;High-phosphorus foods&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phosphorus is an unsung villain for kidneys—if your body can’t clear it, it’ll steal calcium from your bones and tangle with your heart health. High-phosphorus foods aren’t just colas, but also:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Processed cheese and dairy&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Beans, nuts, whole grain breads, and many &lt;keyword id="20490015" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="processed-foods" source="keywords"&gt;processed foods&lt;/keyword&gt; with “phos-” on the ingredient list.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;High-protein animal foods&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meat-lovers, beware: eating tons of red meat, poultry, eggs, and cheese loads your body with protein that your kidneys need to filter out. Over time, excess protein makes kidneys work overtime, which is rough if you already have kidney risk factors or early CKD. Yes, you need protein, but not more than your body can use. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Potassium bombs&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For most people, potassium is awesome! But when the kidneys are struggling, they can’t balance it, leading to muscle and heart problems. Foods like bananas, oranges, potatoes, tomatoes, avocados, and even some “whole wheat” breads are sneaky sources of potassium that could tip the scales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ultra-processed foods&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anything that’s boxed, bagged, or “ready in minutes” probably contains a cocktail of sodium, phosphorus, unhealthy fats, and advanced glycation end products (AGEs)—chemicals formed during high-temperature cooking and linked to kidney damage in multiple studies. The more ultra-processed foods you eat, the higher your risk for kidney trouble—even if you’re otherwise healthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Disclaimer: This information is for educational purposes only and is not medical advice.

Prostate cancer is one of the most common cancers in American men, second only to skin cancer. And yet, myths and misunderstandings still cloud how we talk about it, test for it, and treat it. From the idea that it only affects "older guys" to the belief that early signs of prostate cancer always come with obvious symptoms (spoiler: they usually don’t), misinformation can be dangerous. Worse, it often leads to delays in diagnosis and prostate cancer treatment—and time matters when dealing with any cancer. Whether you're in your 40s or your 70s, knowing the facts about prostate health is just smart self-care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is Prostate Cancer?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prostate cancer starts in the prostate gland, a small, walnut-sized part of the male reproductive system that sits just below the bladder. But sometimes, the cells in the prostate start growing out of control. That’s when cancer kicks in. The tricky part is that prostate cancer symptoms often don’t show up early. Most guys feel totally fine, no pain, no warning signs, nothing. That’s why regular prostate cancer screening, including PSA tests and yes, the digital rectal exam, matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In many cases, prostate cancer is highly treatable, especially when caught early. But if left undetected, it can spread to bones, lymph nodes, and other areas. That’s why keeping tabs on your prostate health, especially after age 50, is a game-changer. Think of it as part of long-term men’s cancer awareness—your future self will thank you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Prostate Cancer Guide: Expert Reveals Causes and Prevention Strategies&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Myth: “If I don’t have symptoms, I don’t have prostate cancer.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sorry, wish it were true! The sneaky thing about prostate cancer is that in the early stages, it usually has no symptoms at all. Nope, not even a twinge or a peep. When symptoms like trouble peeing or back pain do pop up, it usually means the cancer has already advanced. That’s why screening and talking to your doc (even when you feel perfectly fine) is so important, especially if you’re over 50, African-American, or have a family history of prostate cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Myth: “Only old men get prostate cancer.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sure, risk increases as you get older—most cases happen in men over 65. But younger men can and do get prostate cancer, sometimes even in their forties or fifties. Bottom line: age is a big risk factor, but it’s not a guarantee. No matter your age, be aware of your personal risk and talk it over with your health provider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Myth: “If my dad had it, I’m doomed.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having a father (or brother) with prostate cancer definitely bumps up your risk—about double, in fact. But it’s not destiny; plenty of men with a strong family history never get prostate cancer. And on the flip side, about 90% of prostate cancers pop up in men with no family history at all. Your family history is important to know, but it’s not a crystal ball.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Myth: “Screenings and PSA tests are pointless (or will always lead to unnecessary treatment).”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Screening is controversial, but it’s not pointless! The PSA (prostate-specific antigen) blood test can catch cancer before symptoms show up, but it’s not foolproof. Some cancers are slow, harmless guests; others need action, fast. If you have an elevated PSA, that’s just one piece of the puzzle, not an automatic cancer diagnosis or reason to rush into treatment. Decisions should always be personal, based on your age, health, and family history—and in conversation with your doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Myth: “If I have prostate cancer, I need treatment right now.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not all prostate cancers are aggressive or dangerous. Some are so slow-growing that your doctor may recommend “active surveillance”—keep an eye on things with regular tests and only step in if the situation changes. For many men, avoiding or delaying treatment means fewer side effects, while still staying safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Myth: “Treatments always ruin your sex life and cause incontinence.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Treatments can have side effects, including trouble with erections and urinary issues—you’ve probably heard this a lot. But not every guy who gets treated ends up with long-term problems. Side effects depend on many factors: your age, the specific treatment, and even the experience of your healthcare team. Plus, treatments and support to help manage side effects are better than ever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Myth: “If you don’t eat sugar or take special vitamins, you won’t get prostate cancer.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s clear the air: eating sugar doesn’t cause prostate cancer, and there’s no magic diet or supplement that can prevent it. Obesity is linked to a higher risk of several cancers, including prostate, so eating healthy matters, but skipping sugar or popping vitamins won’t give you a get-out-of-cancer card.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Mon, 28 Jul 2025 01:22:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>即使没有更多的饮酒，重度饮酒者中也会出现严重的肝病-西雅图时报</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiugFBVV95cUxOVnE4M0dKTWIyOXNlaXd4NzhueFlrSC1oa2YxclBlYjhCOUhnWGZKZGtjeFN5ZlkyU0hnMlVObVAtSDJDTHdxMmZOMjJBZUZmOFJFbkJaQ25uSDhjek9IcVJhLUJPMVFzRzEwNUNnOW5zakNucFdOcTRNTDZzLVJXTjdaRUpXSXlQOEJmM09tYm16d1R6VFZ6aEZCdzZaOWFIMHY3aEk4dW00Mk9QQlZlVkd5Z1dGOWxXQ0E?oc=5</link><description>&lt;a href="https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiugFBVV95cUxOVnE4M0dKTWIyOXNlaXd4NzhueFlrSC1oa2YxclBlYjhCOUhnWGZKZGtjeFN5ZlkyU0hnMlVObVAtSDJDTHdxMmZOMjJBZUZmOFJFbkJaQ25uSDhjek9IcVJhLUJPMVFzRzEwNUNnOW5zakNucFdOcTRNTDZzLVJXTjdaRUpXSXlQOEJmM09tYm16d1R6VFZ6aEZCdzZaOWFIMHY3aEk4dW00Mk9QQlZlVkd5Z1dGOWxXQ0E?oc=5" target="_blank"&gt;Serious liver disease is up among heavy drinkers, even without more drinking&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;The Seattle Times&lt;/font&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.google.com/stories/CAAqNggKIjBDQklTSGpvSmMzUnZjbmt0TXpZd1NoRUtEd2lLaGRIbERoR21yN19scGtpZnF5Z0FQAQ?hl=en-US&amp;amp;gl=US&amp;amp;ceid=US:en&amp;amp;oc=5" target="_blank"&gt;View Full Coverage on Google News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;</description><author>The Seattle Times</author><pubDate>Mon, 28 Jul 2025 01:02:09 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiugFBVV95cUxOVnE4M0dKTWIyOXNlaXd4NzhueFlrSC1oa2YxclBlYjhCOUhnWGZKZGtjeFN5ZlkyU0hnMlVObVAtSDJDTHdxMmZOMjJBZUZmOFJFbkJaQ25uSDhjek9IcVJhLUJPMVFzRzEwNUNnOW5zakNucFdOcTRNTDZzLVJXTjdaRUpXSXlQOEJmM09tYm16d1R6VFZ6aEZCdzZaOWFIMHY3aEk4dW00Mk9QQlZlVkd5Z1dGOWxXQ0E</guid></item><item><title>女儿透露，在假期中从小狗身上死于狂犬病的英国母亲“可怕”死亡-每日邮报</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The daughter of a British woman who died of rabies after she was &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/article-14827919/British-mother-killed-rabies-video-dancing-stray-dog-Morocco.html"&gt;scratched by a puppy&lt;/a&gt; on holiday has spoken of her mother's 'horrendous' death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Yvonne Ford, 59, from Barnsley, South Yorkshire, was scratched on the leg by a small stray puppy lying under her sunbed while on holiday in Morocco with her husband in February - but thought nothing of it at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Many months later, the grandmother-of-four started suffering from a 'horrendous' headache and was admitted to Barnsley Hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Within days, she could not walk, talk, sleep or swallow.

She was scratched in February - and died four months later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: 'She and dad were on a holiday in Morocco and they were on a private beach next to the hotel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'There was a puppy underneath mum's sunbed and it scratched her leg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'There was no blood and no evidence of the dog being unwell.

She was hallucinating and had a fear of water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'She couldn't swallow. She was choking on her own saliva. So doctors put her in an induced coma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It wasn't until over a week later that she was diagnosed with rabies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'There's only one outcome for rabies once symptoms develop and it's death every time. So we had to turn off her life support.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The family later found out that it normally takes a few months for rabies symptoms to show - but the deadly disease can incubate for up to two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now, Robyn wants to spread awareness for rabies - and help stop it at the source via a charity mission in Cambodia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The mother-of-two has launched a &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="http://www.gofundme.com/f/in-memory-of-mum-fighting-rabies-in-cambodia"&gt;GoFundMe&lt;/a&gt; and is appealing for help from the public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: 'This is something I need to do. If I can save even one life through this work, or spare one family from going through the pain we have experienced, then it will be turning a terrible negative into something positive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I'm determined to transform my grief into action - helping vaccinate dogs, support surveillance efforts, and deliver life-saving lessons in schools.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 28 Jul 2025 00:29:03 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisgFBVV95cUxPTG1oV2hyMWMwdm1uWGZ4dkxvaXVPeFBrdXBRVzd4OWRiSWxiTklFZDg5eDdnb1VMNlpKX3VRSF9YTkFaTUV6OFJ2cS1xMG9xZXNWbHMtZnlWNlFTOHFKSHhfc2xUcWFvVldMVmVHc2ctclhXSFZDOGhnd3JHbW9xd1h5SV9pOHJEaW1Fa3p3YUJGOHhOYkJWMWFBLXdKaXNRQWdsWUNkTUZoNEdYQk5rODJB0gG3AUFVX3lxTE40djBKTndSLU9kTGtZRXlyWTc5NElrWjR4OTNfaU1Sa28wdEwyM2RWMzFiR3RERDk1dVljVmVlQmVtQ3VNWHQwZzNpRHI3cl95akxIaFhkeEZNaTNyOGYyZUhIZEpfYm5mOEdmcTd1S2VwQ0hRdWlzQ0R5MWYybnE2WXd5UUZoWUl6VkcxbHNTT2piMFNxalEwQlV2RFdEQVEzRUd5cWNUdW8wOWE5d2dFQUlJRS0zQQ</guid></item><item><title>Serious OT: mods please leave. - 247Sports</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipgFBVV95cUxOS1R6VkN5VnFaZXRybnU1SnNBX2pXSkNCVENfcktwd1h1OEdhZjJuVVk5T2FQMWtpTXl3OU8tOFNCZGRpTGZGUnVWZ2FkM0MwMnFPQnFnemh5cnZuZko5bVpMeE8tZ3NwMGd0bE5xeU9fQU1GeWdlNVFwVV83ZldnT2NCeDMyalI2VFJnZG1uTVZsN3EzTVNhLTI3cndjUExTWVp3bHp3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;a href="https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipgFBVV95cUxOS1R6VkN5VnFaZXRybnU1SnNBX2pXSkNCVENfcktwd1h1OEdhZjJuVVk5T2FQMWtpTXl3OU8tOFNCZGRpTGZGUnVWZ2FkM0MwMnFPQnFnemh5cnZuZko5bVpMeE8tZ3NwMGd0bE5xeU9fQU1GeWdlNVFwVV83ZldnT2NCeDMyalI2VFJnZG1uTVZsN3EzTVNhLTI3cndjUExTWVp3bHp3?oc=5" target="_blank"&gt;Serious OT: mods please leave.&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;247Sports&lt;/font&gt;</description><author>247Sports</author><pubDate>Sun, 27 Jul 2025 23:05:29 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipgFBVV95cUxOS1R6VkN5VnFaZXRybnU1SnNBX2pXSkNCVENfcktwd1h1OEdhZjJuVVk5T2FQMWtpTXl3OU8tOFNCZGRpTGZGUnVWZ2FkM0MwMnFPQnFnemh5cnZuZko5bVpMeE8tZ3NwMGd0bE5xeU9fQU1GeWdlNVFwVV83ZldnT2NCeDMyalI2VFJnZG1uTVZsN3EzTVNhLTI3cndjUExTWVp3bHp3</guid></item><item><title>让你的血液对蚊子致命的药丸？它真实有效- SciTechDaily</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMingFBVV95cUxOaEdMX2dpd1doMUNRc3M3SksyaEhvZzNCLWM3RGprSFgwaU1uR1g5ZkNxX0JQQ0hLenN0cDZRYk1ocWp0NWhMMHBHRkpSbTlKME9xZV9xVnoxb1V3Y0ZpRDJ3X01WTzF6NzU4UVBuUWxNelBSWjE3Z0MyTy1OVlRBb3B0Y2szaUd4ck1udmc2R25MT2QxOWpxeklhNE1KUQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SciTechDaily</author><pubDate>Sun, 27 Jul 2025 22:37:56 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMingFBVV95cUxOaEdMX2dpd1doMUNRc3M3SksyaEhvZzNCLWM3RGprSFgwaU1uR1g5ZkNxX0JQQ0hLenN0cDZRYk1ocWp0NWhMMHBHRkpSbTlKME9xZV9xVnoxb1V3Y0ZpRDJ3X01WTzF6NzU4UVBuUWxNelBSWjE3Z0MyTy1OVlRBb3B0Y2szaUd4ck1udmc2R25MT2QxOWpxeklhNE1KUQ</guid></item><item><title>不能达到一万步？原来你不需要- SciTechDaily</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifkFVX3lxTE5FRWpTRmVvelBCUWVjcFd6TTRWLTRidE00dFY0UlBTYWpfdlhkSkdqU09TOVdWUlpfQkhCSEtVN09NQnVFdm5NMktQV0FxZWpIcVJYM1p0Z28zOEJ3WGJxZ2tuT0gzNmpqVFIzdFpVd01fdTlmcVlYYjhsWEJHZw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SciTechDaily</author><pubDate>Sun, 27 Jul 2025 22:12:02 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifkFVX3lxTE5FRWpTRmVvelBCUWVjcFd6TTRWLTRidE00dFY0UlBTYWpfdlhkSkdqU09TOVdWUlpfQkhCSEtVN09NQnVFdm5NMktQV0FxZWpIcVJYM1p0Z28zOEJ3WGJxZ2tuT0gzNmpqVFIzdFpVd01fdTlmcVlYYjhsWEJHZw</guid></item><item><title>可能是血栓迹象的无声症状- AOL.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidEFVX3lxTFBLU0tUeUp5MHZ0M2JORXdxek5FdjFtN2dUSk1KRjJKUHFhMkRJd2NWTnNJTVNGQWw5bUEwQ1B5U3Fnbjk0bHlOY1A1QWEtMHo1X083MVFJeTNtbV9hMGlCYUpfa1NVcUJpSHFLaFVXLWQ5SEpq?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/silent-blood-clot-symptom-according-to-vascular-surgeon" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The Silent Symptom That Could Be a Sign of Blood Clots;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;The Silent Symptom That Could Be a Sign of Blood Clots&lt;/a&gt;

An estimated 60,000 to 100,000 Americans die from blood clot complications annually, making this an important health issue to be aware of. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Awareness of blood clot symptoms is critically important because early recognition can be life-saving,” says&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://wexnermedical.osu.edu/find-a-doctor/jonathan-parsons-md-4884" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Jonathan Parsons, MD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Dr. Jonathan Parsons, MD&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt; a pulmonologist at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center. “Recognizing symptoms early allows for prompt medical treatment.” That can help lower the risk of permanent damage to organs or tissues, he points out.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here’s the problem: Not all symptoms of blood clots are obvious, and one in particular can be easily mistaken for other, much less severe health issues. Here’s what doctors want you to keep in mind about this symptom, why it can be confused with other things and when to take action. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://emojipedia.org/stethoscope" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:🩺;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;🩺&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://parade.com/newsletters/healthy-now" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:SIGN UP for tips to stay healthy &amp;amp; fit with the top moves, clean eats, health trends &amp;amp; more delivered right to your inbox twice a week;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SIGN UP for tips to stay healthy &amp;amp; fit with the top moves, clean eats, health trends &amp;amp; more delivered right to your inbox twice a week&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://emojipedia.org/pill" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:💊;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;💊&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How Do Serious Blood Clots Happen?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before we go over the symptom, it’s important to first go over how blood clots can become serious. Blood clots that happen spontaneously usually start in the legs, explains &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.memorialcare.org/providers/christopher-e-yi" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Christopher Yi, MD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Dr. Christopher Yi, MD&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt; a vascular surgeon at MemorialCare Orange Coast Medical Center in Fountain Valley, California. “They aren’t life-threatening in themselves, but they occasionally dislodge and go to the lungs,” he says. This is called a pulmonary embolism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/worst-habit-for-a1c-levels-according-to-endocrinologists" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Got High A1C Levels? Stop Doing This One Thing ASAP;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Got High A1C Levels? Stop Doing This One Thing ASAP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a pulmonary embolism, a blood clot gets stuck in an artery in the lung and blocks blood flow to part of the lung, Dr. Yi explains. There, it can cause permanent damage to the lungs, low oxygen levels in your blood, and damage to other organs in your body (from not getting enough oxygen), he says, adding, “This can be life-threatening."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Silent Sign of Blood Clots To Know About, According to a Vascular Surgeon&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back to that silent symptom: Shortness of breath is common with pulmonary embolisms. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Shortness of breath is a hallmark symptom of pulmonary embolism because of how the condition affects the lungs and oxygen delivery,” Dr. Parson says. “The blocked artery prevents blood from reaching parts of the lung, so oxygen can't be absorbed into the bloodstream efficiently, resulting in shortness of breath.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This blockage usually comes on suddenly, so the body doesn’t have time to compensate for the lower-than-usual oxygen, he explains. That can lead to sudden and intense shortness of breath. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/best-packaged-foods-for-heart-health-according-to-cardiologist" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:'I'm a Cardiologist, and These Are the 2 Packaged Snacks I Swear By for Heart Health';elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;'I'm a Cardiologist, and These Are the 2 Packaged Snacks I Swear By for Heart Health'&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When Shortness of Breath Is a Sign of a Blood Clot&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shortness of breath can also be a sign of a slew of other things, including being out of shape, having asthma or just having a cold, making this a tricky thing to pin on a blood clot. But doctors say there are a few key differences between “regular” shortness of breath and feeling breathless due to a blood clot.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Standard shortness of breath usually comes with exercise or activity,” Dr. Yi says. “With a blood clot, there is a sudden onset of shortness of breath where you feel like you can’t catch your breath.” You may also start breathing faster than usual, he explains. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Along with coming on hard and fast, shortness of breath from a blood clot tends to get worse with exertion or taking deep breaths, according to Dr. Parson.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://parade.com/1264350/jenniferlarson/what-does-an-asthma-attack-feel-like/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:‘An Elephant on Your Chest’ and ‘Being Trapped Under a Heavy Piece of Furniture’—Here’s What an Asthma Attack Actually Feels Like;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;‘An Elephant on Your Chest’ and ‘Being Trapped Under a Heavy Piece of Furniture’—Here’s What an Asthma Attack Actually Feels Like&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other Signs of a Blood Clot and What To Do&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While sudden shortness of breath alone should raise concerns about a possible pulmonary embolism, there are other blood clot symptoms doctors warn should be on your radar:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fast breathing&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chest pain (it usually gets worse when you cough or take a deep breath)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A faster-than-usual heart rate&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coughing, including coughing up blood&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Very low blood pressure&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feeling lightheaded&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fainting&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;It can be tempting to write these signs off if you have one or two that can be explained away as something more minor. But doctors stress the importance of taking these seriously if you or someone around you has them. “If someone experiences these symptoms, immediate medical attention is critical,” Dr. Parsons says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Up Next:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/everyday-activity-thats-good-for-your-core-according-to-trainers" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Related: Trainers Say This Everyday Activity Is Secretly Amazing for Your Core;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Related: Trainers Say This Everyday Activity Is Secretly Amazing for Your Core&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sources:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/silent-blood-clot-symptom-according-to-vascular-surgeon" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The Silent Symptom That Could Be a Sign of Blood Clots;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;The Silent Symptom That Could Be a Sign of Blood Clots&lt;/a&gt; first appeared on Parade on Jul 27, 2025&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;This story was originally reported by &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/silent-blood-clot-symptom-according-to-vascular-surgeon" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Parade;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Parade&lt;/a&gt; on Jul 27, 2025, where it first appeared.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Sun, 27 Jul 2025 20:48:42 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidEFVX3lxTFBLU0tUeUp5MHZ0M2JORXdxek5FdjFtN2dUSk1KRjJKUHFhMkRJd2NWTnNJTVNGQWw5bUEwQ1B5U3Fnbjk0bHlOY1A1QWEtMHo1X083MVFJeTNtbV9hMGlCYUpfa1NVcUJpSHFLaFVXLWQ5SEpq</guid></item><item><title>人类大脑在疫情中迅速老化，不仅仅是病毒- ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinwFBVV95cUxPUk9GX1BCemxQY2NhTWJyb3g3Ykh4ZDlFQ1pQeFNQSWltSE5hV3ZQckRpSHJud2tpUmp6STZoRjhDWE5UbkZLR2JlcUZYVlQ0LTFPWndLMjd6S1RPdFVFbFVidDd2cUNDVlpLRldFUXd0UGE0bTl6cTU0eXpIM1pWN0xwYlRxTW96UlVDYk5IVzEwRko4TDhGekJnSUpGYnc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The devastation of the COVID-19 pandemic may have left a significant mark on our brains, even if we didn't get sick.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/severe-covid-looks-scarily-like-old-age-in-the-human-brain-study-finds"&gt;Fatal cases&lt;/a&gt; of COVID-19 look scarily like old age &lt;/span&gt;in the brain&lt;span&gt;, and now, new research suggests that the mental, social, and financial stresses of the pandemic may have aged our brains as well.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A team led by researchers at the University of Nottingham trained an AI model to recognize healthy aging in the brain, using the data of more than 15,000 adults in the UK Biobank. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The algorithm was then used to analyze the brain ages of two groups: one that had brain scans taken before the pandemic and another that had brain scans taken both before and during the pandemic. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-brains-youthfulness-or-lack-of-it-could-predict-how-long-you-live?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;Your Brain's Youthfulness (or Lack of It) Could Predict How Long You Live&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;During the pandemic, the average human brain aged five and a half months faster than it did before 2020.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"What surprised me most was that even people who hadn't had COVID showed significant increases in brain aging rates," &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/news/covid-19-brain-age"&gt;&lt;span&gt;says&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; neurologist Ali-Reza Mohammadi-Nejad from Nottingham, who led the study.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"It really shows how much the experience of the pandemic itself, everything from isolation to uncertainty, may have affected our brain health."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The good news is that those changes may be reversible. The study only analyzed brain scans from two time points, which means that there may have been neurological recovery in the years that followed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"We can't yet test whether the changes we saw will reverse, but it's certainly possible, and that's an encouraging thought," &lt;a href="https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/news/covid-19-brain-age"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; neurologist Dorothee Auer from Nottingham.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;What's more, just because a person's brain may have aged at a faster rate during the pandemic, doesn't mean their cognitive function was necessarily impacted. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;In fact, the only individuals in the study who showed decreased cognitive performance were those who were directly infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Still, the findings suggest that a major life event like a pandemic can have a significant impact on the brain, even if you don't get sick.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the first few years of the global pandemic, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2022/05/05/who-nearly-15-million-died-as-a-result-of-covid-19-in-first-two-years-of-pandemic/"&gt;&lt;span&gt;millions of humans&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; died, and billions more dealt with a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/more-than-death-covid-has-unleashed-a-tidal-wave-of-grief-on-america"&gt;&lt;span&gt;tidal wave of grief&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/it-s-okay-to-feel-lonely-right-now-here-s-how-to-recognise-the-symptoms"&gt;&lt;span&gt;loneliness&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/02-03-2022-covid-19-pandemic-triggers-25-increase-in-prevalence-of-anxiety-and-depression-worldwide"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/feeling-stressed-before-you-get-covid-may-increase-your-odds-of-developing-long-covid"&gt;&lt;span&gt;anxiety&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/pandemic-depression-has-persisted-even-after-lockdowns-have-eased"&gt;&lt;span&gt;financial stress&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/covid-is-doing-something-to-our-sleep-and-even-to-our-dreams"&gt;&lt;span&gt;sleep disturbances&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Initial research found teenagers were particularly affected by the global crisis, with the adolescent brain &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/lockdowns-did-something-to-teen-brains-and-we-need-to-talk-about-it"&gt;&lt;span&gt;showing concerning signs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; of accelerated aging after 2020,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/the-brains-of-teenagers-look-disturbingly-different-after-lockdown"&gt;&lt;span&gt;similar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to&lt;span&gt; teens experiencing violence, neglect, or family dysfunction.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_168917" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-168917" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/cortical-thinning-brain-scans.jpg" alt="Corticol Thinning" class="size-full wp-image-168917" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/cortical-thinning-brain-scans.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/cortical-thinning-brain-scans-600x326.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-168917" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Brain scans show accelerated brain maturation in teenagers following the  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/coronavirus" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73041" data-postid="168905" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;COVID-19&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/pandemic" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73047" data-postid="168905" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;pandemic&lt;/a&gt;, with more pronounced effects visible in female subjects.

But the current study among adults found that male brains were more vulnerable to both grey and white matter changes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Signs of accelerated aging were also particularly evident among older people and among socially or economically disadvantaged groups.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous studies have &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/social-isolation-actually-changes-our-brain-structure-neuroimaging-reveals"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; that social isolation can change the structure of the brain, and poverty is also &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/poverty-may-accelerate-brain-aging-study-shows"&gt;linked&lt;/a&gt; to accelerated brain aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both could be factors leading to structural changes in the brain, but it's important to remain cautious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sweeping, long-term studies using brain scans can provide scientists with useful clues as to how major life events, like &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/brains-scans-reveal-a-massive-surge-of-connectivity-when-babies-are-born"&gt;birth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/having-kids-linked-to-younger-looking-brains-later-in-life-study-finds"&gt;parenthood&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-discovered-structural-brain-wide-changes-during-menstruation"&gt;menstruation&lt;/a&gt;, might be impacting our central nervous systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But without closer research, it's impossible&lt;span&gt; to say why these brain regions are changing, or what impact the changes might have on cognitive function, or our behavior.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"This study reminds us that brain health is shaped not only by illness, but by our everyday environment," &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/news/covid-19-brain-age"&gt;&lt;span&gt;concludes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;Auer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"The pandemic put a strain on people's lives, especially those already facing disadvantage."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The study was published in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-61033-4"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chia seeds are rich in fiber, omega-3s, and antioxidants, offering many heart and digestive health benefits.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;They may interact with medications for blood pressure, diabetes, and clotting by amplifying their effects.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Talk to your health care professional before adding chia to your diet if you're on meds, and start with small amounts.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Despite their tiny size, chia seeds pack a powerful, nutrient-rich punch. They provide a boost of vitamins, minerals, healthy fat and fiber to whatever food they’re paired with—whether in a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/gallery/8056553/chia-seed-recipes-that-arent-pudding/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;smoothie bowl&lt;/a&gt;, pancakes or oatmeal bars.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; That’s because chia provides a good plant source of polyunsaturated fatty acids, including &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8035578/omega-3-supplements-benefits/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;omega-3 fatty acids&lt;/a&gt;, which may help reduce blood pressure, improve cholesterol levels and quash inflammation, among many other benefits. Chia seeds are also a good source of antioxidants, which protect against cellular damage linked to chronic disease.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Chia seeds are also high in soluble fiber and form a gel-like substance when they come in contact with liquid—that’s why &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/268739/berry-chia-pudding/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;chia seed pudding&lt;/a&gt; is so creamy. Due to their fiber content—1 ounce contains 10 grams of fiber—chia seeds may help increase satiety, lower LDL cholesterol and improve regularity.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The antioxidants and peptides found in chia seeds may help act like a natural ACE inhibitor (a common class of blood-pressure-lowering drugs) to decrease blood pressure and promote heart health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; That’s a perk on its own, but eating chia seeds while taking antihypertensive medications could decrease your blood pressure more than expected.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Chia seeds may have antiplatelet properties, which prevent clots from entering the bloodstream.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Good news for reducing your risk for heart attack and stroke, but this can be too much if you’re also being treated with blood thinners, which may increase the risk for bleeding. “If you are taking an anticoagulant or an antiplatelet, use caution,” says pharmacist &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ronald-smith-jr-pharmd001/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Ronald Smith, Pharm.D., RPh&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Diabetes Medications &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Chia seeds are a smart choice if you’re &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7833638/foods-to-keep-blood-sugar-in-check/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;managing your blood sugar&lt;/a&gt;, as their fiber helps slow down digestion. There’s evidence that chia may help reduce the rise in blood sugar that occurs after eating, and they may also have the potential to be used in diabetes treatment due to their antioxidant and antiinflammatory properties.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;br&gt;
However, if you’re taking medication to treat diabetes, such as insulin, watch how your blood sugar responds to meals and snacks containing chia, since chia could lower your blood sugar too much. “If you’re new to chia seeds and are on insulin, consult your physician, as you may need to adjust your dosage,” says &lt;a href="https://www.freshmednyc.com/dr-robert-graham-integrative-medicine-nyc" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Robert Graham, M.D., M.P.H&lt;/a&gt;. a board-certified internal and integrative medicine physician and founder of Fresh Medicine.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Overall, because chia seeds have potential blood-pressure-lowering, antiplatelet and blood-sugar-reducing properties, there may be additive effects between chia and the medications that treat these conditions. In other words, your blood pressure or blood sugar may dip too low when you combine the two.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In terms of medication absorption, it’s important to remember that chia is notably high in fiber. In some instances, you may get more fiber from eating chia than from taking a serving of a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/sneaky-signs-you-might-need-a-fiber-supplement-8678377" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;fiber supplement&lt;/a&gt;, depending on how much chia you’re eating. And fiber can slow down the absorption of certain medications. If you routinely eat a lot of chia, ask your provider if you should space out the time between eating chia and taking your medications.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you are taking any of the above medications and want to incorporate chia seeds into your diet, there are a few things to consider.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; First and foremost, consult with your health care professional when making any significant dietary changes, including taking supplements. You can also talk to your local pharmacist about any food-medication interactions you might run into on your current prescriptions, over-the-counter medications or supplements. Don’t be shy about asking if chia seeds are safe for you.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you have never eaten chia seeds before or haven't eaten them since starting any of the above medications, Graham recommends “starting low and going slow.” Consume a small amount of chia seed and gradually increase your intake to a level you can tolerate with no issues. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-our-expert-take"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Our Expert Take &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Chia seeds are a nutrient-packed food rich in omega-3s, fiber and antioxidants. They also may interact with some medications, specifically those prescribed for high blood pressure, other cardiovascular conditions (antiplatelets and anticoagulants) and diabetes. If you are being treated for those health conditions, it doesn’t necessarily mean you should avoid chia seeds. But talk to a health care professional about making chia seeds part of your diet; they may want to monitor you for any interactions or side effects.&lt;br&gt;

Researchers from the &lt;a href="https://www.ku.dk/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Copenhagen&lt;/a&gt; revealed that everyone has their own unique response to insulin, challenging how the condition has traditionally been diagnosed and treated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research takes a deep dive into the molecular makeup of muscle tissue and shows that insulin sensitivity isn’t as black and white as once believed. Instead, it's more like a spectrum—with distinct molecular fingerprints that could change the way we detect, predict, and manage diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="rethinking_a_global_health_crisis"&gt;Rethinking a Global Health Crisis&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 500 million people live with type 2 diabetes around the world, according to the &lt;a href="https://diabetesatlas.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;IDF Diabetes Atlas&lt;/a&gt;. The condition is often diagnosed by elevated blood sugar levels or poor responses to insulin. But now, thanks to new technology, scientists are realizing that the disease is far more complex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;The proteome and phosphoproteome of human skeletal muscle are critical determinants of whole-body insulin sensitivity (CREDIT: Cell) &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="4" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers from Denmark, Sweden, and beyond worked together to examine the underlying differences in how people respond to insulin. Instead of just separating people into "healthy" or "diabetic," they found that individuals show a wide range of &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/new-protein-discovery-could-replace-insulin-for-diabetics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;insulin sensitivity&lt;/a&gt;—even among those with similar diagnoses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="5" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We found huge variation in insulin sensitivity, even among people considered healthy and among those diagnosed with type 2 diabetes," said Associate Professor Atul Deshmukh from the Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Basic Metabolic Research at the University of Copenhagen. "There are even some individuals living with type 2 diabetes who respond better to insulin than healthy individuals."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr class="MuiDivider-root MuiDivider-fullWidth css-1pbb6nf" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/separator" id=""&gt;&lt;hr class="MuiDivider-root MuiDivider-fullWidth css-1pbb6nf" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/separator" id=""&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="7" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This means that your body’s insulin response is much more personal than we thought. And this variation could explain why some people develop complications while others do not—even if they share the same diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="studying_muscle_at_the_molecular_level"&gt;Studying Muscle at the Molecular Level&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="8" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;To reach these findings, the researchers looked closely at muscle tissue, a key site for insulin activity. Using a technology called mass spectrometry-based proteomics, they studied over 120 people. This allowed them to examine thousands of proteins and phosphorylation sites in &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/new-mechanical-pump-regenerates-heart-muscle-at-6x-the-normal-rate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;skeletal muscle&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="9" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;They focused on two groups: one with type 2 diabetes and another with normal &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/health/zinc-levels-linked-to-type-2-diabetes-risk-study-finds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;glucose levels&lt;/a&gt;. Each group underwent detailed testing, including the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp—the gold standard method for measuring insulin sensitivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="10" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team found striking results. Some people with type 2 diabetes showed better insulin sensitivity than those considered healthy. This was true even after accounting for factors like fasting glucose and HbA1c, common blood sugar markers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Proteomic signature of insulin-sensitive and -resistant skeletal muscle (CREDIT: Cell) &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="11" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of finding clear-cut differences, the study revealed a 36-fold range in insulin sensitivity. In simple terms, no two bodies responded to insulin the same way. Even within the diabetic group, the range was massive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="12" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;To make sense of this, researchers analyzed protein and phosphoprotein levels in &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/health/researchers-harness-the-power-of-bacteria-to-regenerate-muscle-tissue/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;muscle tissue&lt;/a&gt;. They discovered that the molecular landscape of skeletal muscle plays a huge role in how your body handles insulin. Certain proteins consistently matched higher or lower insulin sensitivity. These changes could act as early warning signs long before symptoms arise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="4" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="building_the_future_of_personalized_diabetes_care"&gt;Building the Future of Personalized Diabetes Care&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="13" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anna Krook, a professor at Karolinska Institutet in Sweden and co-lead author, believes these results lay the groundwork for personalized treatment. "By learning more about the molecular signatures of insulin resistance, we’re building the foundation for precision medicine in &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/widely-used-drug-for-type-2-diabetes-also-slows-down-aging/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt; tailored to each patient."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="14" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;These so-called "molecular fingerprints" of insulin resistance not only predict how your body reacts to insulin, but they also help doctors understand which treatments might work best for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;The fasting phosphoproteome landscape is a critical determinant of IS (CREDIT: Cell) &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="15" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jeppe Kjærgaard Northcote, another researcher on the team, explained, "When we combine this deep &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/new-mobile-app-clinically-proven-to-treat-tinnitus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;clinical data&lt;/a&gt; with the molecular signatures of insulin resistance, we suddenly understand a lot more about people’s insulin resistance that we can use to design precision medicine."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="16" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The data showed that one protein, BDH1, had a strong positive link to insulin sensitivity. Another protein, HSPA2, showed the opposite. These patterns remained steady across both men and women, even though male and female &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/new-class-of-drugs-target-brain-metabolism-to-treat-alzheimers-patients/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;metabolism&lt;/a&gt; can differ in many ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="5" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="taking_a_closer_look_at_the_science"&gt;Taking a Closer Look at the Science&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="17" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;To perform this study, researchers developed a high-throughput method to prepare tissue samples. Using advanced technology, they ran nearly 500 tests to examine protein levels in muscle. They found more than 29,000 phosphorylation sites across 3,000 proteins—an impressive level of detail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="18" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results showed that insulin resistance is not just about how much insulin you produce or how much glucose you absorb. It’s about the specific proteins in your muscle cells and how they behave. These &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/scientists-discover-natural-antibiotics-hidden-within-human-proteins/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;proteins&lt;/a&gt; are shaped by both your genetics and your environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="4" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Preserved and dysregulated insulin signaling across states of insulin resistance (CREDIT: Cell) &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="19" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the researchers found that these protein patterns were better at predicting insulin sensitivity than traditional blood tests like fasting glucose or HbA1c. Even in a fasting state, the &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/first-ever-study-identifies-the-mechanisms-behind-learning-memory-and-alzheimers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;proteomic data&lt;/a&gt; strongly reflected how a person would respond to insulin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="20" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings suggest that the standard clinical tests might miss early signs of insulin resistance.

By feeding the protein data into a Random Forest model, the team could accurately predict insulin resistance. The model was even more precise than simply grouping people by whether or not they had diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="22" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Principal component analysis further showed that insulin resistance follows a spectrum.

By using detailed protein data, we can better understand how the body responds to insulin. More importantly, this understanding can lead to earlier diagnosis and more effective treatment for millions around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="26" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;With this kind of insight, the path toward personalized care in diabetes becomes clearer.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Oats are the No. 1 whole grain for better gut health, according to a gastroenterologist.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Whole grains like oats pack important nutrients like dietary fiber, protein, vitamins and minerals.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Oats benefit your gut by acting as a prebiotic, supporting immune health and increasing satiety.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Whole grains are the MVP of the carbohydrate family. They pack important nutrients like dietary fiber, protein, vitamins and minerals that play an important role in a healthy diet.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Whole grains are well known for their &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/15297/our-top-15-heart-healthy-foods/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;heart-health benefits&lt;/a&gt;, but they provide a host of benefits for our gut, too.

Based on this data, I would say all whole grains are a great choice, but if I had to choose one, I would choose oats.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Read on to find out why oats top the charts as the No. 1 whole grain to include in your diet for better gut health.

&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; They Support Good Gut Bugs   &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; One of the top reasons oats are such a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/the-best-plant-based-foods-for-gut-health-8716725" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;phenomenal food for gut health&lt;/a&gt;, according to Schopis—they function as a prebiotic. Prebiotics are nonliving organisms that provide food for probiotics, those good bugs that live in your gut. Beta-glucan, a type of soluble fiber found in oats, contributes to the prebiotic function of oats. When fiber in oats is digested, it provides food for the probiotics in the microbiome, in turn supporting the functions they carry out.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; They Improve Gut-Brain Communication &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Your mood is highly connected to the health of the microbiome, thanks to the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8001367/poor-gut-health-increases-anxiety-depression-risk-what-to-eat/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;gut-brain axis&lt;/a&gt;. Feeling off? The pickup you need could be found through feeding your gut. In fact, research suggests that the increase in short-chain fatty acids that are produced through the breakdown of dietary fiber may play a role in &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8018711/gut-bacteria-risk-for-depression-new-study/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;improving mood and disorders&lt;/a&gt; of the central nervous system.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When SCFAs are produced, they support the intricately connected nervous, immune and endocrine systems that work together to keep you healthy, especially when exposed to stressors. Through this action, SCFAs also provide support for the blood-brain barrier, protecting the brain from harmful substances while simultaneously influencing mood.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/author/natalie-rizzo/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Natalie Rizzo, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;, shares, “An important step in supporting a better mood is focusing on feeding your gut. Simple foods, like whole-grain oats, are an easy way to improve your mood and energy levels, in turn supporting a healthier you.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; They Offer Support for Immune Health  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A large portion of your &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/288067/3-surprising-reasons-your-gut-health-matters/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;immune system is housed within the microbiome&lt;/a&gt;, which means supporting gut health may be your ticket to fewer sick days. A recent scientific review explored the research on oats and immune health and found the wide variety of compounds found in oats— including dietary fiber, copper, iron, selenium and zinc—offered pretty impressive benefits when it came to immune health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Additionally, the phytonutrients found in oats have &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8027728/best-budget-friendly-antioxidant-rich-foods/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;antioxidant properties&lt;/a&gt; that help scavenge free radicals (those bad guys that can make you sick over time). Rizzo writes, “Eating oats supports a healthy microbiome that can adapt to changes (like the annual cold and flu season) and keep you functioning at your prime.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Fiber is a key factor that influences satiety, or the fullness factor that comes with eating.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Foods like oats that are high in fiber take longer to digest, meaning they offer more staying power and keep you fuller for longer. &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hannahspencerrdn/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Hannah Ackermann, RD,&lt;/a&gt; writes, “Unlike refined carbs, the fiber in whole grains isn’t broken down in your small intestine. Hours later, it reaches your large intestine, where beneficial gut bacteria ferment it. This delayed release of hormones several hours after eating whole grains is known as the “second meal effect.” Fiber in whole grains provides a lasting sense of satisfaction, helping you manage hunger more effectively throughout the day.”

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While diet certainly plays an important role in your gut health, so does how you move your body, your stress levels and more. Consider these tips to support better gut health, too: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eat a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/small-changes-that-helped-me-eat-more-fiber-11775341" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;variety-filled, high-fiber diet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; Schopis’ best advice: “Consume a diet high in different fibers, which includes whole grains, veggies, fruits, nuts and legumes. Diverse, high-fiber diets have been shown to increase the amount of beneficial gut bacteria and improve metabolic health.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; If you’re not sure where to begin, start with the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/16372/8-ways-to-follow-the-mediterranean-diet-for-better-health/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt;, he suggests.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Limit highly processed foods. &lt;/strong&gt;Not all foods are created equally, even those with fancy marketing slogans. “Focus on eating a variety of foods that are rich in fiber first and foremost, and limited in added sugars, salt and preservatives,” writes Rizzo. This doesn’t mean you can’t rely on convenience foods, like flash-frozen fruits and vegetables or canned beans. Those are A-listers on a diet to support better gut health. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Incorporate regular movement.&lt;/strong&gt; Movement is a star player in keeping your gut happy, healthy and regular. Rizzo encourages clients to find a form of movement they enjoy and fit it in routinely. She writes, “Daily movement is key to keeping your gut healthy and mood balanced. Whether it’s a run, walk or yoga class, find what you love and do it daily.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-sc-block-adslot-inline"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focus on &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/291942/exactly-how-much-nature-time-you-need-to-reap-the-physical-and-mental-benefits/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;daily stress-reduction strategies&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; High stress levels can negatively impact your gut health. Finding a moment to unwind daily is key to managing your cortisol levels and improving your gut health. Rizzo shares, “Stress management shouldn’t stress you out. Find something that feels natural and doable and fit it in daily. For many of my runners, this is even a 10-minute mobility break where they can stretch and breathe all at once.”&lt;/li&gt;

None of them, she felt, truly listened or &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13620287/doctors-gaslighting-dismissing-womens-pain.html"&gt;took her symptoms seriously&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In August 2015, after a year of asking doctors to order her an MRI, one of them finally listened, and what appeared on the scan changed the course of her life entirely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At the emergency room, doctors informed her that &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14738375/Doctors-dismissed-dizzy-spells-swimmers-ear-cancer.html"&gt;she had a tumor&lt;/a&gt; called a meningioma the size of an apple pressing on the left side of her brain so forcefully that both hemispheres were being pushed to the right side of her skull. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While not classified as &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-9f2d4790-68a6-11f0-8228-d723bca0d5ae"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;, meningiomas can be deadly if complications arise, boasting a mortality rate of anywhere from 63 to 90 percent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She underwent multiple surgeries to seal off the blood vessel feeding the tumor in the hopes of preventing it from growing larger, followed by a procedure to remove the mass in its entirety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘It's only when I look back in time and think through those appointments and the conversations, and I was at the point where I was begging people to believe me,’ Ruhoy told DailyMail.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘The sad part is that if someone had believed me earlier on, I think I could have prevented a lot of the recurrences that I had to go through because I've now undergone three rounds of radiation to my brain.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Ilene Ruhoy specializes in complex post-exposure illnesses such as long Covid&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ruhoy was healthy before her medical crisis, like many of her current patients. She questioned how this could have happened, feeling she had done everything right. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;During her quest for answers, Ruhoy complained of light sensitivity and severe, long-lasting migraines that doctors told her were due to her stressful job as a neurologist in a hospital.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said one doctor stayed glued to their computer and failed to even make eye contact with her. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another told her, after she begged for an MRI because she knew something was  wrong, that he 'didn't want to feed into the hysteria by ordering an MRI.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said 'Looking back, I think that I just wasn't cognizant of what was really happening when it was happening. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'And it's only when I look back in time and think through those appointments and basically I was at the point where I was like begging people to believe me, because things just were getting worse for me.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Around nine months into her illness, before being diagnosed, she found a primary care doctor and as&lt;span&gt; soon as Ruhoy walked into her new doctor's office, she began to sob, telling the physician that she had reached her wit's end. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Many of Ruhoy's patients are on their fourth or fifth healthcare professional&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'All I said was, please, just order me an MRI. And she said the famous words, "when a neurologist asks you to order a brain MRI, you order a brain MRI,"' Ruhoy said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I remember that moment when she just agreed and I almost hugged her. I didn't, I should have, but I was just so grateful, and I will always be grateful.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group floatRHS"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Ruhoy spoke to DailyMail.com about her new book published by St Martin's Publishing Group about treating complex chronic illnesses&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ruhoy still does not know definitively what caused her own tumor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: 'I have a PhD in environmental toxicology, so I've thought long and hard about this; what exposures have I had in my life, what infections have I had in my life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Once I was diagnosed, I underwent a big workup, led by myself, to try to answer that exact question, and I really came up with nothing. We don't really know what causes these tumors.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Inspired by her own journey, Ruhoy would come to specialize in complex post-exposure illnesses (PEIs), such as long Covid and chronic fatigue syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People with poorly understood chronic illnesses fed by exposure to certain medications, pathogens, or trauma generally describe feeling 'gaslit' by their doctors who don't adequately listen to their concerns, often brush them off as being due to stress, give up trying to treat patients, and alienate them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She vowed to help patients who have felt let down by the medical establishment and to not allow them to leave her office without setting forth on the path to recovery. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;PEIs encompass several diagnoses marked by a wide array of symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to Ruhoy, exposure can be to anything external and does not always involve an infection. For instance, she said, long-term exposure to pesticides or mold have been linked to cases of Parkinson's, multiple sclerosis, and chronic fatigue syndrome. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;At the emergency room, doctors informed her that she had a tumor called a meningioma the size of an apple pressing on the left side of her brain (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her newfound career treating PEIs began with Danielle, a dancer in her early 30s who developed debilitating joint pain, food allergies, hives, swelling in her hands and feet, dizziness, headaches, and neck pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Many of her patients today are on their fourth or fifth healthcare professional in their quest to figure out what is driving their symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Danielle was no different.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;She asked Danielle a laundry list of questions, questions no doctor had asked her before: Did she ever have any pain disorders? Did family members have similar symptoms to hers? Did she choke a lot? Did she have chest pain?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A detailed blood test revealed Danielle's hypothyroidism, missed by other doctors who hadn't ordered a comprehensive panel. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This likely caused her fatigue, menstrual issues, hair loss, bloating, and skin changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Ruhoy addressed each symptom: an MRI uncovered a misdiagnosed spinal problem, treated with muscle relaxants; medication stabilized her dizziness; and specialists managed her heart and joint pain. Within months, Danielle felt significantly better.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In addition to treating patients’ symptoms with medication, Ruhoy recommends drug-free treatments: being active, even for a short walk, time in nature, and following a consistent sleep schedule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Will you ever be “normal” again? It’s a question I hear often from patients, and unfortunately— if by “normal” you mean a full return to the person you were before this chronic illness... I can’t promise that you will,’ Ruhoy wrote in her book Invisible No More.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘However, if you care for yourself, if you remain diligent in the ways we have discussed, and if you attend to your body and listen to the signals it sends you… then you have a great chance of being well. Very well, even.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Pair it with leafy greens, quinoa, corn, beans, and grilled chicken. Drizzle some olive oil and lime juice on top and dig in.&lt;br&gt;Avocado Smoothie: Blend 1/2 avocado with spinach, almond milk, banana, and a little honey — then sip and enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All Images Courtesy: istock&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Sun, 27 Jul 2025 14:14:04 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>营养师警告您不应将这些维生素与咖啡混合- AOL.com | Dietitians Warn You Should Never Mix These Vitamins With Coffee - AOL.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieEFVX3lxTFBlWTVfQ3dmOS1qWmJjNVZUdnFtcXB5UGQybUU0Q1FiLXV2NGNfSTVVa0xocG1WaGZIT3RVd1pNbHpHd3VieTZvWDJ5LWRhWjRJUHh0akFkOGNiSVJCU1puQVZjcmpOUEhHUm1hUVFxNEtXNFNFZmFhRw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="caption"&gt;4 Vitamins You Shouldn’t Mix with Coffee&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;Tanja Ivanova - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you take your vitamins with your breakfast and coffee? If so, it might be time to switch up your routine. That's because &lt;strong&gt;certain vitamins, especially if you’re deficient in them, may not absorb as well if they interact with some of the components in coffee.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/16/18/3155" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Research shows;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Research shows&lt;/a&gt; that coffee intake can increase vitamin D levels, while decreasing levels of zinc, calcium and vitamin B. And although coffee contains valuable polyphenol antioxidants like chlorogenic acid (CGA) that can help reduce your &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12168468/#s5" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:risk of heart disease;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;risk of heart disease&lt;/a&gt;, these same compounds could negatively affect absorption of certain vitamins and minerals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The takeaway? Experts suggest&lt;strong&gt; capping your daily caffeine intake at 200 mg (about 2 cups of brewed coffee) to reap the most health benefits. &lt;/strong&gt;And regardless of daily caffeine intake, avoid taking &lt;strong&gt;the vitamins and minerals below within an hour of drinking coffee. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vitamins and minerals you shouldn't take with coffee&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Iron&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drinking coffee at the same time that you take your iron supplement can greatly reduce iron absorption. In fact, &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ajh.26987" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:a 2022 study from Switzerland;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;a 2022 study from Switzerland&lt;/a&gt; showed that when iron deficient women took an iron supplement with coffee, iron absorption was decreased by 54% compared to taking it with water. The disruption of iron absorption stems from its interaction with the polyphenol and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11858154/#sec4-molecules-30-00800" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:tannin antioxidants;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;tannin antioxidants&lt;/a&gt; in coffee. The good news is that &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2020/7909703" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:a 2020 study shows;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;a 2020 study shows&lt;/a&gt; there was no decrease in iron absorption when coffee was consumed one or two hours &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; a meal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vitamin D&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.imrpress.com/journal/IJVNR/92/2/10.1024/0300-9831/a000727" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:2021 study shows;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;2021 study shows&lt;/a&gt; that higher intakes of caffeine were linked with lower levels of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] — what's more commonly referred to as &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/vitamin-d-test/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:vitamin D;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;vitamin D&lt;/a&gt;. It is suggested that caffeine, like that found in coffee, may interfere with vitamin D absorption by reducing the expression of vitamin D receptors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B Vitamins&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The caffeine in coffee has a diuretic effect that can lead to increased excretion of water-soluble vitamins, including most B vitamins as well as vitamin C, before they are fully absorbed. On top of that, the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6160559/#:~:text=Some%20harmful%20effects%20have%20been,on%20the%20case%20(14)." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:polyphenols in coffee;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;polyphenols in coffee&lt;/a&gt; may also impact B vitamin absorption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Calcium&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since vitamin D is important in the absorption and use of calcium in building bone, drinking coffee may indirectly &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7397437/#:~:text=As%20vitamin%20D%20is%20important,optimum%20pharmacological%20effect%20%5B14%5D." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:reduce calcium absorption;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;reduce calcium absorption&lt;/a&gt; a bit when consuming at the same time as your supplement. This is especially true for those who may already have low calcium or vitamin D levels, or those who are at risk for osteoporosis, such as the older adult population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to consume coffee and vitamins&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re taking any vitamin or supplement on the list above, be sure to separate coffee consumption from your daily dosage of vitamins by at least an hour. But you may want to keep your morning coffee intact and instead change your supplement timing to later in the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“If possible, it’s best to eat breakfast first, or drink coffee with breakfast, so you’re not consuming coffee on an empty stomach which can irritate your stomach lining,&lt;/strong&gt; says &lt;a href="https://www.wowmd.com/pages/shelley-balls" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Shelley Balls, MDA, RDN, LDN;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Shelley Balls, MDA, RDN, LDN&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian and nutritionist for &lt;a href="https://www.wowmd.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:WOWMD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;WOWMD&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;Then, wait an hour or two to take your supplements.&lt;/strong&gt; “Limiting your intake of coffee to two cups per day can also help reduce nutrient absorption interference,” she adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another option is to get a vitamin organizer and place the supplements that &lt;em&gt;don't&lt;/em&gt; interact with coffee in the daytime compartments and those that &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; in the evening ones, when you are less likely to consume coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What about tea?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just like coffee, many types of tea also contain antioxidants and similar compounds found in coffee that may interfere with the absorption of certain vitamins and minerals. “Tea, especially black and green varieties, also contain tannins and caffeine, both of which can affect nutrient absorption," says &lt;a href="http://www.eatwelltobewellrd.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Cheryl Mussatto MS, RD, LD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Cheryl Mussatto MS, RD, LD&lt;/a&gt;, an Outpatient Clinical Dietitian at Cotton O'Neil Endocrinology and Diabetes Clinic in Topeka, Kansas. &lt;strong&gt;"While the impact may be slightly less than coffee depending on the type and amount, it’s still smart to avoid pairing tea with supplements like iron or calcium.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other ways to help absorb vitamins&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides rescheduling your coffee consumption, there are other things you can do to optimize your vitamin and mineral absorption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eat more nutrient-dense meals and snacks:&lt;/strong&gt; Ensure your vitamin and mineral intake is enough by increasing your intake of nutrients like calcium and iron through meals and snacks. Calcium is found in milk and milk-based items like yogurt, and cheese as well as fortified plant-based milk and juice, while good sources of iron include meat, poultry, fish, seafood as well as plant-based foods like beans, lentils, nuts and seeds. Consuming vitamin C with your iron-rich meals may help boost its absorption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stay hydrated:&lt;/strong&gt; Since non-decaf coffee contains caffeine, which is a diuretic, it could contribute to fluid and mineral losses, especially to water-soluble vitamins like B vitamins and vitamin C. So, make sure you consume plenty of water and other low-calorie, decaffeinated drinks with each meal and snack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Visit your healthcare provider:&lt;/strong&gt; If you’re worried your vitamin and mineral levels may be low, be sure to have your levels tested at least once a year. If you’re deficient in any vitamins and minerals, you can get a prescription for the necessary nutrients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The bottom line&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To make the most of your vitamin routine without skipping your morning coffee, it’s all about the timing. &lt;strong&gt;Check your supplement labels for those nutrients where coffee components are most likely to interfere, and take these vitamins at least one hour from the time of your cup of Joe.&lt;/strong&gt; And if you’re still worried you’re not absorbing enough nutrients, simply add more nutrient-dense foods at meals and snacks and visit your doctor each year to test for your vitamin and mineral levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Sun, 27 Jul 2025 13:58:19 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMieEFVX3lxTFBlWTVfQ3dmOS1qWmJjNVZUdnFtcXB5UGQybUU0Q1FiLXV2NGNfSTVVa0xocG1WaGZIT3RVd1pNbHpHd3VieTZvWDJ5LWRhWjRJUHh0akFkOGNiSVJCU1puQVZjcmpOUEhHUm1hUVFxNEtXNFNFZmFhRw</guid></item></channel></rss>
