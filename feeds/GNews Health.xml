&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While metabolism is primarily influenced by genetics, you can boost it by increasing muscle mass. &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/benefits-of-gaining-muscle-mass-11750809" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Muscle&lt;/a&gt; is metabolically active, meaning it requires more calories (compared to body fat) to function even at rest. One study found that pairing evening exercise with 45 grams of dietary protein before bed enhanced muscle repair during sleep, potentially boosting metabolism.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-are-there-foods-that-burn-calories-while-you-sleep"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Are There Foods That Burn Calories While You Sleep? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "The jury is out on whether our before-bedtime eating patterns significantly affect metabolism,” says &lt;a href="https://essentialnutritionforyou.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Rania Batayneh, M.P.H&lt;/a&gt;. Some studies show that high-calorie nighttime snacking can contribute to weight gain, partly due to unhealthy snack choices and mindless habits like watching TV.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; At the same time, research suggests that eating certain nutrient-rich foods at night may support better sleep and overall health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Foods high in tryptophan, like chicken, eggs, and beans, promote the production of serotonin and melatonin, improving sleep quality, which indirectly benefits metabolism.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Although metabolism naturally slows during sleep, a small, nutrient-dense snack before bed may aid muscle recovery, especially if paired with evening exercise, and help you feel energized the next day.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; 1 slice whole-grain toast + 2 tablespoons hummus (such as our homemade &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/252614/classic-hummus/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Classic Hummus&lt;/a&gt;)

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "Toast isn't just for breakfast," Batayneh says. "Hummus is made with chickpeas, which are rich in B vitamins. The main function of the B vitamins is to help your body metabolize carbohydrates, proteins and fats, and to use the stored energy in food."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Prepare your hummus-topped treat using a slice of high-fiber whole-wheat bread as the base. Not only will this good grain add satisfying fiber to the mix, but it may also help you score more zzz's.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/292184/6-foods-high-in-magnesium/" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Magnesium&lt;/a&gt;, which wheat flour is a source of, might be linked to better sleep quality and longer sleep duration.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; 6 ounces (¾ cup) 2% cottage cheese + ½ cup pitted tart cherries
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Cottage cheese is a top-notch pre-sleep protein snack. Choose tart cherries as a topping for their sweetness and their sleep-promoting powers. "Melatonin, perhaps the most well-known sleep-inducing hormone, regulates sleep-wake cycles. It's found in many fruits and vegetables, including tart cherries and pomegranates, as well as grains, nuts and seeds," Batayneh says.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; 3. Best for Better Sleep  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; 1 banana + 1 tablespoon nut or seed butter
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;em&gt;185 calories, 5 g protein&lt;/em&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There are many a-peel-ing aspects to this duo.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "Bananas are mostly made up of fast-digesting carbs, and fast digestion is your goal when you're snacking before bed. They're also a source of magnesium, which helps calm stress hormones and can promote sleep," Batayneh says.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The carbs also trigger a series of events internally that may help you chill out. "Carbs lead to the release of insulin, a hormone that helps tryptophan enter the brain and induce sleep," &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/erin-thole-summers-ms-mba-rdn-pmp-csm-36647853/?trk=public_profile_browsemap" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Erin Thole-Summers, M.S., M.B.A, RD, PMP, CSM,&lt;/a&gt; says.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The nut and seed butters contain healthy fats that satiate your brain and body, Batayneh continues.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; 4. Best for Sweet-and-Salty Fans  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; ½ cup 100% pomegranate juice + 15 salted almonds
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you're sensitive to caffeine, you may want to steer clear of green tea at night as well. "If you're looking for an alternative, pomegranate juice is a great fit. Compared to the average cup of green tea, 100% pomegranate juice has more antioxidant capacity, plus it contains no added sugars, fillers, preservatives or caffeine," Batayneh says.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_49-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_50-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7631123/are-almonds-as-healthy-as-you-think-they-are/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;A handful of almonds&lt;/a&gt; is a nice complement to the sweet sip. Like many of the items on this bedtime snack list, these nuts are sources of tryptophan and magnesium, and also tack on a few grams of bonus protein to your daily tally.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_51-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_53-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; ¼ cup crunchy chickpeas

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_57-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "If you naturally crave something crunchy after dinner, like chips or crackers, which have little to no nutritional value, I recommend roasted chickpeas," Batayneh says.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_58-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_59-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "These [snacks] are easily digestible, packed with B vitamins, and can help to fill you up so you don't wake up starving, which can lead to overeating the next day," Batayneh adds.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_68-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "Having a healthy, lower-calorie snack before bed can help regulate blood sugar levels that, for some, drop through the night and leave you waking up hangry in the morning," Thole-Summers says.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_69-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_70-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For a creamy, sweet treat that trumps ice cream or fro-yo on the nutrition front, turn to Greek yogurt. It’s protein-packed, which, paired with blueberries, gives this snack staying power to get you through the night.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_84-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A small snack before bedtime may help with muscle recovery, especially when paired with pre-bed exercise. The P.M. snack may also help you sleep better and wake up the next morning ready to take on your day. And while none of these options have magical metabolism powers, they add a nutritional boost to your day.

			&lt;p&gt;The eyes can reveal a lot about the health of our brain. Indeed, problems with the eyes can be one of the earliest signs of cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38424122/"&gt;latest study shows&lt;/a&gt; that a loss of visual sensitivity can predict dementia 12 years before it is diagnosed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our research was based on 8,623 healthy people in Norfolk, England, who were followed up for many years. By the end of the study, 537 participants had developed dementia, so we could see what factors might have preceded this diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the start of the study, we asked participants to take a visual sensitivity test. For the test, they had to press a button as soon as they saw a triangle forming in a field of moving dots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who would develop dementia were much slower to see this triangle on the screen than people who would remain without dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So why might that be?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visual issues may be an early indicator of cognitive decline as the toxic amyloid plaques associated with  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="165688" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; disease may first affect areas of the brain associated with vision, with parts of the brain associated with memory becoming damaged as the disease progresses. So vision tests may find deficits before memory tests do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-signal-of-future-alzheimers-could-be-hidden-in-the-way-you-speak?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;A Signal of Future Alzheimer's Could Be Hidden in The Way You Speak&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are several &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20182034/"&gt;other aspects&lt;/a&gt; of visual processing that are affected in Alzheimer's disease, such as the ability to see outlines of objects (contrast sensitivity) and to discern between certain colours (the ability to see the blue-green spectrum is affected early in dementia), and these can affect people's lives without them being immediately aware it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.aging-us.com/article/102118/text"&gt;Another&lt;/a&gt; early sign of Alzheimer's is a deficit in the "inhibitory control" of eye movements, where distracting stimuli seem to hold attention more readily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with Alzheimer's seem to have an issue ignoring distracting stimuli, which may show up as eye-movement-control issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If dementia makes it harder to avoid distracting stimuli, then these problems could increase the risk of &lt;a href="https://www.lboro.ac.uk/news-events/news/2023/october/dementia-driving-project-andrew-morris/"&gt;driving&lt;/a&gt; accidents – something we are currently investigating at Loughborough University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_144904" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-144904" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/EyeBehindTwoFingers642.jpg" alt="An eye with two fingers in the foreground" class="size-full wp-image-144904" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/EyeBehindTwoFingers642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/EyeBehindTwoFingers642-621x415.jpg 621w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/EyeBehindTwoFingers642-600x401.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-144904" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Alzheimer's may show up as eye-movement-control issues.

In other words, they don't follow the usual pattern of scanning the face of the person they are talking to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In healthy people, this would be from eyes to nose to mouth. We do this to "imprint" the face and remember it for later. People can sometimes sense when the person they are talking to does not do this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, some doctors working with people with dementia will recognise that someone has dementia when they meet them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with dementia can sometimes seem lost, because they do not purposefully move their eyes to scan the environment, including that of the face of the people they have just met.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It would follow that you would then later be less able to recognise people as you have not imprinted their features.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So this early issue in not recognising people you have just met could be related to ineffective eye movement for new faces, rather than being a pure memory disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_144903" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-144903" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/SeniorLadyLookingConfused642.jpg" alt="An older lady in a black jacket sitting outdoors" class="size-full wp-image-144903" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/SeniorLadyLookingConfused642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/SeniorLadyLookingConfused642-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/SeniorLadyLookingConfused642-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-144903" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;People with dementia can sometimes seem lost.

Perhaps that explains why we found that people who &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8391311/"&gt;watch more TV and read more&lt;/a&gt; have better memory and less dementia risk than those who do not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While watching TV or reading, our eyes flick back and forth over the page and TV screen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, people who read often also tend to have been in education longer. Having had good education provides brain reserve capacity so that when connections in the brain are damaged, the negative result is less.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_134632" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-134632" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/08/GroupOfPeopleWatchingTV642.jpg" alt="A group of adults on a couch watching TV" class="size-full wp-image-134632" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/08/GroupOfPeopleWatchingTV642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/08/GroupOfPeopleWatchingTV642-600x337.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-134632" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Could watching TV actually be good for your brain?

We are not sure why this is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite these exciting findings, treatment for memory problems using deliberate eye movements in older people has not been done that much yet. Also, using deficits in eye movements as a diagnostic is not a regular feature, despite the possibilities in eye movement technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the bottlenecks may be access to eye-tracking technologies, which are expensive and require training to use and analyse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until cheaper and easy-to-use eye trackers are available, using eye movements as a diagnostic tool for early-stage Alzheimer's is not possible outside the laboratory.&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/226356/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Viruses rely on hosts to survive. But some viruses are more effective at reproducing than others. Now, new research has shown that the herpes virus, more specifically herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), can change human DNA after less than an hour of infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a &lt;a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-60534-6"&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; published in &lt;em&gt;Nature Communication&lt;/em&gt;, the virus does more than just hijack the host’s cells. Instead, it makes fundamental changes to the human genome, allowing it to completely change the DNA of those infected to help power its reproduction.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further, the researchers say the changes the herpes virus makes to human DNA are not a side effect. Instead, this reshaping is an intentional change. And once set up, the changes allow the virus to create the perfect space to multiply. While herpes can have more drastic effects, most of the time it usually only shows up as cold sores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is so prevalent, though, that it is estimated that more than two-thirds of people under the age of 50 carry the virus. However, it doesn’t always exhibit itself in everyone that is infected. When it does, it typically only does so during times of stress, illness, or immune suppression. But, as noted above, it can spread beyond that to cause encephalitis, which is inflammation of the brain, and even genital-based infections.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="bgr-newsletter-signup-form newsletter-signup-form black-bg"&gt;	&lt;h4&gt;Tech. Entertainment. Science. Your inbox.&lt;/h4&gt;	&lt;p class="signup-form-info"&gt;Sign up for the most interesting tech &amp;amp; entertainment news out there.&lt;/p&gt;		&lt;span class="success hidden text-white font-bold items-center"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;What makes the way this virus works so intriguing to scientists is that it takes over RNAP II, a type of RNA that is responsible for copying and making new DNA. However, once the herpes virus takes control of it, the RNA starts copying its own genes and making new copies of itself instead. This &lt;a href="https://bgr.com/science/mind-altering-parasite-takes-control-of-host-spiders-before-killing-them/"&gt;allows the virus to replicate&lt;/a&gt; at an unprecedented rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This kind of control isn’t unseen in other viruses. Some virus-like parasites react in similar ways, taking over the cells of hosts to replicate their own. It’s one reason &lt;a href="https://bgr.com/science/up-to-50-of-all-people-are-infected-with-this-scary-parasite-study-says/"&gt;viruses are so difficult to combat&lt;/a&gt;. Luckily, the researchers found that one enzyme can block the virus from taking control like this. That makes this new enzyme, called TOP1, a viable contender for fighting the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research will hopefully provide some additional targets for new therapies.&lt;/p&gt;

two decades - and even gone backwards in some countries - a new global study suggests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The situation has been made worse by the Covid pandemic, leaving millions of children unprotected from diseases such as measles, tuberculosis and polio. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The researchers are calling for a concerted effort to provide better and more equal access to vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Child health experts warn that cuts to international aid budgets that fund vaccination programmes, combined with vaccine scepticism, are creating a "perfect storm".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The global childhood vaccination programme has been a huge success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Since 1974, more than four billion children have been vaccinated, preventing an estimated 150 million deaths worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;In nearly half a century until 2023, researchers say vaccine coverage doubled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But since 2010 progress has stagnated, to the extent that there are now wide variations in vaccine coverage around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;A study, published in the medical journal &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(25)01037-2/fulltext" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;The Lancet&lt;/a&gt;, says measles vaccinations have declined in nearly 100 countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The Covid-19 pandemic made things even worse, because of disruption to vaccine programmes during lockdowns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;By 2023, there were nearly 16 million children who had not had any childhood vaccinations – most of them in sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Study author Dr Jonathan Mosser, from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington, in the United States, says large numbers of children remain under-vaccinated and un-vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"Routine childhood vaccinations are among the most powerful and cost-effective public health interventions available, but persistent global inequalities, challenges from the Covid pandemic, and the growth of vaccine misinformation and hesitancy have all contributed to faltering immunisation progress," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Dr Mosser said there was now increased the risk of outbreaks of diseases such as measles, polio and diphtheria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;All children should benefit from life-saving immunisations, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Wide discrepancies remain between vaccination rates in wealthier and lower-income countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But the report's authors warn that vaccination rates have fallen in Europe, the US and other wealthy countries too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Professor Sir Andrew Pollard, director of the Oxford Vaccine Group, says the findings present a concerning picture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"More children will be hospitalised, permanently damaged and die from fully preventable diseases if the trend is not reversed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"Alas, the cuts in global health funding mean that this situation is set to deteriorate," Prof Pollard said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Dr David Elliman, from University College London, says many factors have contributed to the current situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"Around the world, the increasing number of countries torn apart by civil unrest and wars, combined with the drastic cuts in foreign aid from rich nations, such as USA and UK, makes it difficult to get vaccines to many populations," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"Where it appears that policy is being made on the basis of ill-informed opinion, rather than science, we have a perfect storm," Dr Elliman added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The researchers recommend that all countries try to strengthen primary healthcare systems and combat misinformation around vaccines to prevent parents being hesitant about getting their children vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;They also call for a concerted effort to provide better and more equal access to vaccines around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Tue, 24 Jun 2025 23:09:02

A few days later, Paloma had died at 23 years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Kate responded to Paloma’s death by proclaiming in posts on &lt;a href="https://x.com/search?q=from%3AKateShemirani%20paloma&amp;amp;src=typed_query" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:X;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;X&lt;/a&gt; that she had been murdered and that her death had been covered up. “Medicine is a lie and what we once believed to be healthcare is now a homicide service,” she wrote, later calling her daughter’s death &lt;a href="https://x.com/KateShemirani/status/1898327179009647041" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:“one big massive manslaughter case;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;“one big massive manslaughter case&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Sebastian placed the blame for his sister's death squarely on his mother, and told the BBC&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;“My sister has passed away as a direct consequence of my mum’s actions and beliefs.

That person was also an adult in Utah County.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All three individuals are unvaccinated, and they are not connected to one another, health officials said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Public health investigations are ongoing to identify any locations where possible exposures may have occurred," the news release stated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials said during the first person's "infectious period but prior to diagnosis," the person visited "several" public places. This included the Timpanogos Regional Emergency Room on June 14 between 2:14 p.m. and 7:02 p.m., and the Parkway Health Center in Orem on June 13, though no specific time was given.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Leisha Nolen, Utah's state epidemiologist, said the individual visited health care providers due to symptoms of the measles and was advised to stay home to quarantine, which they reportedly did following their diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"People who were at these sites at the same time, or two hours after this person, could have been exposed to measles," the department said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials urged those who may have crossed paths with the infected Utah County resident, especially those who are unvaccinated, to watch for symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We do have to suspect there are additional measles cases in Utah," Nolen said, noting the affected individual had not traveled outside of the state, pointing to the disease originating from Utah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early stages of measles symptoms — high fever, cough, runny nose or red eyes — usually appear seven to 14 days after exposure. A rash typically appears after four days of fever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyone who has been exposed to measles or is showing symptoms should call a health care provider first before visiting a clinic to prevent spreading the disease to others, the department said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A large majority of Utahns (more than 90%) have been vaccinated against measles and are highly protected against infection," the health department said. "Measles is a highly contagious disease that can cause serious illness, especially in young children, pregnant women and people who have weakened immune systems."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="kt_disclaimer"&gt;

The chemical engineer said that by March 2024, she was bedridden and had lost 20 lbs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Why was my body failing me? I’ve always lived a healthy lifestyle, this didn’t make any sense. It quickly became clear that this wasn’t something I could fix with a balanced diet or exercise,” Palen recalled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said doctors initially thought she might have an autoimmune disease, “but the truth was far from that.” Palen said that tiny organisms called Babesia had entered her bloodstream via a tick bite, targeting her red blood cells and leaving her “trapped in unbearable pain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/24809-babesiosis" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Cleveland Clinic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;, there are fewer than 3,000 annual cases of Babesiosis reported in the United States, but the illness can be life-threatening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Palen's case, the illness “completely shattered my immune system,” she recalled.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy News &amp;amp; Media&lt;/p&gt; Maria Palen doing occupational therapy&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It became so bad that something as simple as locking my phone or turning my car’s wheel became moments of agony,” Palen said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a follow-up &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/accounts/login/?next=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.instagram.com%2Fp%2FDEQ1l1YP1X0%2F%3Fhl%3Den&amp;amp;is_from_rle" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:video;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; shared in December 2024, Palen said that she was paralyzed after an October incident during which her tailbone began to ache and she felt feverish. Days later, her symptoms made it difficult to sit through a work meeting, leaving her feeling so weak she could hardly stand. Palen was taken to the hospital, where her health continued to deteriorate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Once the pain meds kicked in at the hospital, my legs started going numb. First the left, then the right, until it crept all the way up to my belly button,” Palen said in the video. “Turns out my spinal fluid was loaded with white blood cells. Something was definitely attacking my spinal cord and even now, doctors can’t pinpoint exactly what it was.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy News &amp;amp; Media&lt;/p&gt; Maria Palen.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Palen said she’s convinced the issues are related to Lyme Disease. Doctors gave her antibiotics, which she said cleared the infection, “but by then, the damage was done.” Palen said in the video that she was trying to be "patient" as she waited for her nerves to heal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/xzbuy-support-marias-journey-to-healing" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:GoFundMe;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;GoFundMe&lt;/a&gt; set up in January to support Palen has since raised more than $12,000.

                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RALEIGH, N.C. — A measles case was confirmed in North Carolina in a child traveling from another country who visited Forsyth and Guilford Counties, according to the North Carolina Department of Human Services (NCDHHS).&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officials said this is the first case found in North Carolina in 2025. The NCDHHS recommends anyone who visited the locations listed below last week to call their doctor to review immunization records and make sure they are up to date on the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NCDHHS said 90% of unvaccinated individuals will become infected, with babies, young children and pregnant people most at risk of complications.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a look at the locations and times impacted.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    
                    &lt;p class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Measles Symptoms:&lt;/h3&gt;                    &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High fever, rash, cough, runny nose, red and watery eyes. Sometimes, small, white bumps or spots can appear in the mouth.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over time, a rash appears on the head or face and then spreads to other parts of the body. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Babies, young children and pregnant people are at higher risk for measles complications like ear infections, diarrhea, pneumonia, immune amnesia (when your body forgets how to fight off other serious diseases), brain inflammation and death.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;When Symptoms Develop:&lt;/h3&gt;                    &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Symptoms can develop between 7 to 21 days after exposure.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;p class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How Measles Spreads:&lt;/h3&gt;                    &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The virus is very contagious and can be spread before a rash appears. It lives in the nose and throat, so when a carrier talks, sneezes or coughs, tiny droplets with the virus spray into the air. They can stay in the air and contaminate surfaces for up to two hours.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;p class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What To Do If You Were Exposed:&lt;/h3&gt;                    &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Locate your vaccination records or other evidence of immunity, you're not very likely to get measles if you have the MMR vaccine or other evidence of immunity.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are not immune, call your doctor and inform them of your exposure.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Afterwards, stay home for 21 days after measles exposure.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;p class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How to Prevent Measles:&lt;/h3&gt;                    &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best way to prevent measles is to get vaccinated with two doses of the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

Both were unvaccinated, the department said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;According to the department, the new infections are not related to Utah’s first measles case, &lt;a href="https://www.sltrib.com/news/2025/06/20/utah-measles-case-reported-utah/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" title="https://www.sltrib.com/news/2025/06/20/utah-measles-case-reported-utah/"&gt;reported last Friday&lt;/a&gt;. In that case, an unvaccinated Utah County resident was reported infected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;The person whose case was reported Friday spent hours in Orem’s Timpanogos Regional ER on Saturday, June 14, the department reported — and an unknown amount of time the day before at the Parkway Health Center in Orem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;Public health investigators are working to identify where the two new infected people might have exposed others, the department said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;In early June, &lt;a href="https://www.sltrib.com/news/2025/06/04/utah-officials-warn-potential/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.sltrib.com/news/2025/06/04/utah-officials-warn-potential/"&gt;DHHS reported&lt;/a&gt; that an infected out-of-state person traveled through Utah’s Washington County, visiting family in the region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;Measles symptoms typically appear seven to 14 days after exposure. They include a high fever — above 102.2 degrees Fahrenheit — and a cough, runny nose, or red eyes. A rash will usually appear within four days of a fever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;If you develop symptoms, stay away from other people and call your health care provider, health officials say. Call before going to a clinic or hospital, so staff there can prevent other people from exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;According to DHHS, more than 90% of Utahns have been vaccinated against measles, and are well protected against infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;As of Thursday, the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported&lt;/a&gt; a total of 1,214 confirmed measles cases in 34 states and the District of Columbia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;&lt;i&gt;This is a developing story.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Salt Lake Tribune</author><pubDate>Tue, 24 Jun 2025 20:29:47 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifEFVX3lxTE1yQWhXdElBVWxiME9kUFZVM1hQUkNTWmljOURQdjYtanp6TldCQVNMSUFha1JPbFdhM3RNQ18wV0tzR0E5d3hGb2Y3bUVUTEVLN1FGOTVEWF93YVIwejN5aW1rOXBuN1haak5TMEFWclVTU1VybnBQZTg3OF8</guid></item><item><title>科学家刚刚发现了姜黄的惊人益处- EatingWell | Scientists Just Discovered a Surprising Benefit of Turmeric - EatingWell</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia0FVX3lxTE5mQlk4N1B3aTdBZWUwTFQxa3BoRUVMZVdseFRuWGEwdDhhYkVUejFQQnYzd3ZSOHBCZXNfQkRib3B4SHpYbmhodmNYaHVmbGZkVXcya1ZfRVIxUW1pZ0NqbS0xU1h4NG5SQW9V?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-callout--summary mntl-sc-block-universal-callout--tips mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-summary callout--bordered" data-text="Key Points" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;
&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A new review of studies found that turmeric may help improve blood pressure, cholesterol and more.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Older people without dementia experienced better cognitive health while taking turmeric.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You can also get more turmeric by using it in your cooking or by taking turmeric shots.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Turmeric, the bright golden spice often found in kitchens around the world, has grown into much more than a culinary staple. Over the past few decades, its reputation as a natural remedy has skyrocketed, thanks largely to curcumin, which is a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-spice-for-metabolic-syndrome-11678783" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;powerful compound within turmeric&lt;/a&gt; that’s believed to drive its many health benefits. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; From teas and smoothies to capsules and gummies, turmeric has appeared in countless forms, establishing itself as the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-turmeric-supplements-8602203" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;best-selling botanical dietary supplement&lt;/a&gt; in the United States.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Its rise hasn’t just been fueled by traditional remedies—science has also taken a keen interest, with researchers digging into turmeric’s potential to support everything from joint health to brain function. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; But even with all of this enthusiasm, it’s important to note that not all claims about turmeric’s powers are created equal. While clinical studies from around the globe have explored its medicinal and therapeutic benefits, questions remain about which effects are backed by the strongest evidence. This is where large-scale, carefully designed studies come into play; they help distinguish proven health effects from those that need more investigation. And for everyone from curious consumers to health professionals, understanding the full scientific picture of turmeric can help ensure people get the most benefit from this golden spice.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Though many studies have shown the health benefits of curcumin in turmeric, there’s still a need for stronger research to determine which benefits are backed by reliable evidence. To bridge this gap, researchers looked at how safe and effective curcumin is for improving human health and wellness when taken orally, comparing it to other treatments to better understand its therapeutic potential, and the results were published in &lt;em&gt;Frontiers in Pharmacology&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-was-this-study-conducted"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Was This Study Conducted? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To better understand the health benefits of turmeric, researchers conducted an extensive review of existing studies, referred to as an umbrella review. This type of review combines evidence from multiple systematic reviews and meta-analyses to assess the links between turmeric (and its active compound, curcumin) and various health outcomes. Essentially, it helps paint a clear picture of the overall impact of turmeric on health.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The review included studies that met specific criteria to ensure quality and relevance. These studies came from six different regions, with most being from Iran (16) and China (6), while the rest came from Australia, Singapore and India. Interestingly, the studies also had a wide range in how turmeric, specifically curcumin, was tested. Doses ranged from just 50 mg to as high as 6,000 mg, and treatment durations varied from just a day to an entire year. Some studies compared turmeric to a placebo, while others compared it to regular care or medication.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-did-this-study-find"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What Did This Study Find? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To conduct this analysis, researchers started by looking through 1,628 records from various sources that focused on turmeric health benefits. After using specific criteria for inclusion, the researchers selected 25 key studies for the review. These articles provided the best evidence on the topic and formed the basis of our findings.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This research highlighted that, indeed, curcumin supplementation may &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/80991/10-ways-to-reduce-inflammation/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;lower markers of inflammation&lt;/a&gt;, such as C-reactive protein (CRP) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α). These benefits have been observed in adults with conditions like &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/mediterranean-diet-arthritis-study-11740419" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;rheumatoid arthritis&lt;/a&gt; and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), where it also improved certain antioxidant levels in the body. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This data also showed that curcumin, the active compound in turmeric, might play a significant role in supporting people with conditions like type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/pcos-symptoms-8641812" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;polycystic ovarian syndrome&lt;/a&gt; (PCOS). While this data confirmed some benefits that many are already familiar with, it also suggested some less-known potential benefits, including:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Better Blood Pressure:&lt;/strong&gt; Turmeric supplements may help lower systolic blood pressure by about 2 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure by less than 1 mmHg in adults. But evidence also suggests it doesn’t significantly lower blood pressure for people with certain liver conditions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improved Cholesterol and Triglycerides:&lt;/strong&gt; Curcumin may help in reducing total cholesterol, triglycerides and "bad" LDL cholesterol, while slightly increasing "good" HDL cholesterol. Among people with type 2 diabetes, its effects on LDL and HDL cholesterol were not significant. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brain Health Support:&lt;/strong&gt; Curcumin may help reduce anxiety and depression symptoms in some individuals. It may also help improve levels of a protein called brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which is important for brain health. For older adults, curcumin has been linked to better cognitive function, although it doesn’t appear to significantly improve depression in this group. However, findings are mixed; people with Alzheimer’s disease didn’t see benefits and, in some cases, performed worse in cognitive tests when taking curcumin. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-sc-block-adslot-inline"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Less Menstrual Cramp Pain: &lt;/strong&gt;Curcumin may help reduce the severity of menstrual cramps and premenstrual syndrome (PMS) symptoms. For women with PMS, taking curcumin significantly alleviated physical discomfort, mood-related issues and behavioral symptoms when compared to a placebo. Similarly, for women experiencing primary dysmenorrhea, curcumin has been effective in decreasing the intensity of cramps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It is important to note that several studies have reported some &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/turmeric-benefits-8785974" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;side effects when taking a turmeric supplement&lt;/a&gt;, which included stomach-related issues like bloating, nausea, abdominal pain, diarrhea and constipation. Thankfully, no serious side effects were found in these studies.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This study does have some limitations that should be considered. First, while the researchers aimed to collect comprehensive information, most of the studies the researchers analyzed did not register their research protocols. This lack of registration can reduce the transparency and reliability of the findings. Additionally, the review was limited to studies available in English databases, which means the researchers might have missed relevant research published in other languages. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Another issue is that the evidence they examined was drawn from existing reviews, which may have left out specific details from the original studies or included overlapping studies. There were also differences among the studies in terms of participants, interventions, and how outcomes were measured, which could impact the consistency and accuracy of the results. Lastly, not all the studies we evaluated were of high quality, meaning that some of the evidence may carry potential biases. These factors highlight the need for continued research to strengthen the foundation of knowledge in this area.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Integrating turmeric into your daily routine doesn’t just have to be for a flavor boost or a pop of sunny color. As this overview of research observes, turmeric offers &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/foods-with-anti-inflammatory-benefits-11754770" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;anti-inflammatory benefits&lt;/a&gt;, and it may also be able to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/choline-dementia-study-8779484" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;improve cholesterol, blood pressure and cognition&lt;/a&gt;. And enjoying turmeric—either out of the spice cabinet or as a supplement—doesn’t have to be difficult.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re someone who deals with &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/supplements-for-arthritis-8611187" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;stiff joints&lt;/a&gt;, for instance, adding a turmeric supplement into your smoothies might offer some relief, thanks to its anti-inflammatory properties. Similarly, for those managing conditions like polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) or even looking to improve mental health, the evidence suggests turmeric may provide additional support when combined with other treatments and healthy lifestyle choices.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; On a broader level, turmeric’s growing popularity has made it accessible in countless everyday products, from teas and lattes to capsules and snack bars. This means people don’t have to overhaul their routines entirely to tap into its potential. Whether you’re drinking a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/258547/turmeric-latte/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;golden latte&lt;/a&gt; to start your day, adding a pinch of turmeric to your dinner recipes or exploring supplements after consulting a healthcare professional, there are many ways to incorporate this golden spice into your life.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Just remember, while turmeric shows promise, moderation and evidence-based choices are key, especially when navigating the many claims surrounding its benefits.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A new review in &lt;em&gt;Frontiers of Pharmacology &lt;/em&gt;suggests that turmeric has several potential benefits, including &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7908639/the-fastest-way-to-reduce-inflammation/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;lowering chronic inflammation&lt;/a&gt;, supporting mental health and managing conditions like type 2 diabetes and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Additionally, the curcumin in turmeric has shown promise in &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/spices-to-relieve-pms-symptoms-8384644" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;easing symptoms of PMS&lt;/a&gt; and menstrual cramps and even &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/polyphenols-reduce-cognitive-decline-11680121" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;supporting cognitive function&lt;/a&gt; in certain cases.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_49-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_50-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; However, the evidence also reveals some limitations and variability in turmeric’s effects. Mixed results have been observed in specific populations, such as older adults and individuals with Alzheimer’s disease, particularly concerning its impact on mental health outcomes. Additionally, it’s important to recognize that turmeric is not a universal solution, as individual responses can differ significantly—and you may experience uncomfortable side effects.&lt;br&gt;

The child became ill while traveling to NC from another country where measles outbreaks have recently been reported. To protect the individual and their family’s privacy, no additional information about this individual will be released. This is the first confirmed case of measles in the state in 2025. NCDHHS is recommending all unvaccinated individuals ages one year and older receive measles vaccination to protect themselves and those around them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NCDHHS is working closely with the Forsyth County Department of Public Health and Guilford County Health Department to identify locations and times where people might have been exposed to measles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you visited a listed location during the dates and times below, review your immunization records or contact your health care provider to make sure you are up to date on the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine.&lt;br&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Laboratory testing is not recommended for people who were exposed unless they develop symptoms of measles, including fever and rash. Symptoms of measles can start seven to 21 days after being exposed. If symptoms develop, please call ahead before visiting the doctor or emergency room so steps can be taken to prevent exposure to others. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In some situations, people who have been exposed to measles may be eligible to receive post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) to reduce their risk of becoming ill. The timeframe for PEP has passed for most people who were potentially exposed to this case, but those who are at higher risk — including infants too young to receive MMR vaccination, immunocompromised individuals or pregnant women — should contact their doctor or local health department to see if PEP is needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Getting vaccinated against measles continues to be the most important step we can take to protect ourselves and our loved ones,” said NC Health and Human Services Secretary Dev Sangvai. “It is important to check with your health care provider to ensure you are current with all your vaccines.”  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;North Carolina residents can contact their health care provider or visit their local health department for additional information on ways to obtain the vaccine and schedule an appointment. Children eligible for the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines-for-children/about/index.html"&gt;Vaccines for Children&lt;/a&gt; program may receive the vaccine from a provider enrolled in that program.

Credentialed media should RSVP for the link by emailing &lt;a href="mailto:news@dhhs.nc.gov"&gt;news@dhhs.nc.gov&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles is a highly contagious, vaccine-preventable disease that is spread by direct person-to-person contact and through the air. The virus can live for up to two hours in the air where the infected person was present. Symptoms of measles usually begin 7-14 days after exposure, but can appear up to 21 days after exposure and may include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;High fever (may spike to more than 104 degrees)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cough&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Runny nose&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Red, watery eyes (conjunctivitis)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tiny white spots on the inner cheeks, gums and roof of the mouth (Koplik Spots) two to three days after symptoms begin&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A rash that is red, raised, blotchy; usually starts on face, spreads to trunk, arms and legs three to five days after symptoms begin&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the risk for community spread, parents are encouraged to make sure their children are up to date on all their childhood immunizations, including the measles vaccine. 90% percent of unvaccinated individuals who are exposed to measles will become infected. About one in five people who get measles will be hospitalized. In addition to North Carolina’s case, 1,214 measles cases have been reported in 2025 in 36 other jurisdictions as of June 19, 2025.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

(KATU) — &lt;/span&gt; The Oregon Health Authority (OHA) and county public health officials are investigating the state's first confirmed measles case of 2025. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The individual, an unvaccinated adult, recently returned to Oregon following international travel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case was confirmed on June 23. The individual began experiencing symptoms, including a sore throat, weakness, fatigue, headache, and fever, on June 16.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They were hospitalized in the Portland metro area with a rash and conjunctivitis on June 19 and discharged on June 21. Officials believe no patients were exposed during the hospitalization, and the individual is currently recovering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials suspect the disease was contracted during the individual's recent international travel, which spanned four to five weeks. This case is not linked to any measles outbreaks in other U.S. states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're here to tell you that measles is now in Oregon, and if you’re not vaccinated, you are susceptible," said Paul R. Cieslak, M.D., medical director for communicable diseases and immunizations at OHA’s Public Health Division.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;READ ALSO:&lt;a href="https://katu.com/news/nation-world/cdc-provides-new-measles-vaccine-guidance-with-summer-travel-season-underway" target="_blank" title="https://katu.com/news/nation-world/cdc-provides-new-measles-vaccine-guidance-with-summer-travel-season-underway" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt; CDC provides new measles vaccine guidance with summer travel season underway&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You could get measles if you're exposed to someone who is contagious, which can be from four days before their rash starts until four days after. After exposure, it can take up to three weeks before you show the characteristic measles rash. So, someone could not even know they have measles and be transmitting it for several days. That’s why it’s extremely important that all adults and children in their household be up to date on vaccinations," Cieslak added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Potential exposure locations include Flight UA1832/SN8869 (Brussels Air operated by United Airlines) on June 17, Portland International Airport arrivals and baggage claim on the same day, and a Safeway in Lake Oswego on June 22.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Nonmedical vaccine exemptions for kindergartners&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In May, the OHA reported that Oregon had a record-high nonmedical vaccine exemption for kindergartners, but most families continued to vaccinate their kids. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A record 9.7% of kindergartners in the state have claimed nonmedical exemptions from school vaccination requirements for the 2024-2025 school year, marking the highest rate ever recorded in the state. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This increase continues an upward trend from 8.8% in 2024, when Oregon had the fourth-highest nonmedical exemption rate in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the rise in exemptions, &lt;a href="https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/oregon.immunization.program/viz/OregonMeaslesImmunizationData/StateRates" target="_blank" title="https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/oregon.immunization.program/viz/OregonMeaslesImmunizationData/StateRates" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;data from the Oregon Immunization Program &lt;/a&gt;at OHA’s Public Health Division indicates that 86.3% of kindergartners were fully vaccinated with all required immunizations for the current school year, a slight decrease from 86.4% last year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stacy de Assis Matthews, school immunization coordinator at the Oregon Immunization Program, emphasized the importance of high vaccination rates in protecting public health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "An immunized community is our most effective defense against diseases such as measles," Matthews said. "Robust vaccination coverage not only protects individual children but also safeguards those who cannot be vaccinated due to age, medical conditions, or other vulnerabilities, helping protect our communities in Oregon."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For students across all grades, from kindergarten through 12th grade, 90.4% were fully vaccinated in 2025. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="https://katu.com/news/local/senators-urge-hhs-to-launch-national-measles-vaccination-campaign-merkley-wyden-oregon" target="_blank" title="https://katu.com/news/local/senators-urge-hhs-to-launch-national-measles-vaccination-campaign-merkley-wyden-oregon" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;Senators urge HHS to launch national measles vaccination campaign amid outbreak&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Oregon senators pushed for vaccinations&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In March, U.S. Senators of Oregon Ron Wyden and Jeff Merkley called on Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to take immediate action to curb the spread of measles in the United States. The plea followed the first measles-related deaths in the country in a decade. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a letter to Secretary Kennedy, the senators highlighted the urgency of the situation. Although Secretary Kennedy chaired the anti-vaccine nonprofit Children's Health Defense from 2015 to 2023, he wrote an op-ed on March 2 this year for &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/robert-f-kennedy-jr-measles-outbreak-call-action-all-us" target="_blank" title="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/robert-f-kennedy-jr-measles-outbreak-call-action-all-us" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;Fox News&lt;/a&gt; in which he calls MMR vaccines "crucial" to avoiding deadly disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Measles outbreak is call to action for all of us," the op-ed is titled. "Vaccines not only protect individual children from measles, but also contribute to community immunity, protecting those who are unable to be vaccinated due to medical reasons," he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is imperative that the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) act immediately and robustly to stop the spread of this preventable infection and save American lives," the senators wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lawmakers emphasized the need to increase vaccination rates to protect vulnerable populations. "More must be done to increase vaccination rates against measles. Clear communication that vaccines work is imperative to build trust and increase uptake of vaccinations, ultimately saving lives," they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The letter, led by Senator Ben Ray Luján and signed by several other senators, also stressed the importance of reinstating public health workers who were indiscriminately fired by the previous administration. "We urgently request that you reinstate all fired federal health workers and protect those remaining from termination to help stop the spread of measles and other infectious diseases," the senators concluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms and immune amnesia&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles spreads through the air after an infected person coughs or sneezes, with the virus lingering for up to two hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms typically start with a fever, cough, runny nose, and red eyes, followed by &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/signs-symptoms/photos.html?utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=govdelivery" target="_blank" title="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/signs-symptoms/photos.html?utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=govdelivery" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;a rash&lt;/a&gt;. Complications can include ear infections, lung infections, and, rarely, brain swelling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles is one of the most contagious diseases, and is known to cause a dangerous and unique phenomenon called &lt;a href="https://asm.org/articles/2019/may/measles-and-immune-amnesia" target="_blank" title="https://asm.org/articles/2019/may/measles-and-immune-amnesia" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;"immune amnesia,&lt;/a&gt;" in which the infected patient's immune system goes through a reset, effectively "forgetting" any immunity it had towards other diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to studies, in a room full of people exposed to measles,&lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2019/02/14/measles-infection-virus-spread/https://www.statnews.com/2019/02/14/measles-infection-virus-spread/" target="_blank" title="https://www.statnews.com/2019/02/14/measles-infection-virus-spread/https://www.statnews.com/2019/02/14/measles-infection-virus-spread/" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt; 90% who are unvaccinated &lt;/a&gt;will develop the disease. In addition, it can linger in the air for up to 2 hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even in healthy people, measles can cause the following:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;1 out of every 1,000 measles cases will develop acute encephalitis, which often results in permanent brain damage.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;1 to 3 out of every 1,000 children who become infected with measles will die from respiratory and neurologic complications.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE), a rare but fatal degenerative disease of the central nervous system characterized by:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Behavioral and intellectual deterioration.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Seizures that generally develop 7 to 10 years after measles infection.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most Oregonians have been vaccinated, significantly reducing their risk. However, unvaccinated individuals, especially pregnant people, infants under 1 year old, and those with weakened immune systems, are at higher risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the CDC, there have been &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank" title="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;three confirmed deaths from measles &lt;/a&gt;this year across the U.S. as of June 20.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public health officials advise those experiencing symptoms not to visit medical offices unannounced. Instead, they should call ahead to arrange a safe entry plan to prevent exposing others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more&lt;a href="https://oregonhealthnews.oregon.gov/measles-what-you-should-know/?utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=govdelivery" target="_blank" title="https://oregonhealthnews.oregon.gov/measles-what-you-should-know/?utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=govdelivery" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt; information on measles&lt;/a&gt;, visit the &lt;a href="https://www.oregon.gov/oha/PH/DISEASESCONDITIONS/DISEASESAZ/Pages/measles.aspx?utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=govdelivery" target="_blank" title="https://www.oregon.gov/oha/PH/DISEASESCONDITIONS/DISEASESAZ/Pages/measles.aspx?utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=govdelivery" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;Oregon Health Authority's website and blog.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>KCBY</author><pubDate>Tue, 24 Jun 2025 19:56:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiogJBVV95cUxNZ0JtV2p5N2hFdkdTenJrNGd1NFV1UUFXSk1mVkdHNVVsY3JqTFh1Nkc3T3hrZ3h2MUswMHh1YkRObHJfSEJFd3V1cXRPWnVtTDNQSDV3TGdaOEJtYXV2QklOYkVnU1c4T2xEMC1hVWluWkVuakw3UlJDcHA5QlcyNDZNcXVNVXlQQ005cWU1d1NwSmxDNlNIREZnY1AxelFxWnI1YTRWWERfZFo0dHBLNGhfejVueG1rTTJVTnZjQnlIRExkSzN4bFB2Sm50eFFFVGljTzlxazN6d3BpdEJVN1hMLVo0Ti03SmpvNlRjRkNJVFd4dVp6blI1U21VU3dKVS1pSEpwVmwzOUowQ2V4cjNBMjlEWFI3dGRzNkVLbTc1dw</guid></item><item><title>RFK Jr.承认他对实际治疗麻疹一无所知-雅虎 | RFK Jr. Admits He Knows Nothing About Actually Treating Measles - Yahoo</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieEFVX3lxTFB4MmhpcFRXNWdXb3RGMl9HYUdhRVpzdnk1SWdGTS0tN2tlcHkzM2tEbERqWFg3YWFZOHdxS1l0X1NwRXZGUS1JdHM3SVdIa0ZYV1BWeTlUUFZKREpmaVU0NkNweWFIZ1ZzR01QUU5sUExadVRTWGtTYQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="" data-article-body="true"&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Despite issuing guidance that measles can be treated with &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/rfk-jr-makes-bonkers-claim-141001818.html" data-ylk="slk:simple vitamins;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;simple vitamins&lt;/a&gt;, Health Secretary Robert F.

She torched Kennedy for continuing to spread vaccine misinformation and refusing to listen to medical experts while he leads the nation’s public health policy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Have you ever treated measles?” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://x.com/atrupar/status/1937538059987230782" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:asked;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;asked&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; Schrier, a former physician.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span&gt;“No,” Kennedy said with a short laugh.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Well I have,” Schrier said. “Let me tell you how miserable it is: These kids have high fevers, struggling to breathe, and they are crying. They suffer. The great thing is that there’s a vaccine to prevent it.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention officials have described the current measles outbreak in Texas as the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/nightly-news/video/measles-cases-spread-in-texas-238578245654" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:worst uptick;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;worst uptick&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; the agency has seen in measles cases in the last 25 years. But the lackadaisical public response to the contagion has only been made worse by Kennedy’s politics, which include unfounded claims that the disease-eradicating vaccine was contributing to higher autism rates in kids.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Schrier also accused Kennedy of lying to Republican Senator Bill Cassidy during his February confirmation hearings when he promised not to alter the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. Cassidy was a critical vote for Kennedy clinching the Cabinet role.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span&gt;“But then two weeks ago you fired all 17 experts on that very committee. Mr. Secretary, question for you, did you lie to Senator Cassidy when you told him you would not change this panel of experts?” Schrier &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://x.com/atrupar/status/1937538811224862934" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:asked;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;asked&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Kennedy denied having made that commitment altogether, calling it “inaccurate.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I made an agreement with him, and he and I talked many times about that agreement,” he said of Cassidy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Kennedy claimed that all 17 members had potential conflicts of interest before instating eight new members who were reputed vaccine and Covid-19 skeptics.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In May, Kennedy justified a religious Texas community’s decision not to receive the vaccine by claiming that the measles vaccine contains “aborted fetus debris” as well as “DNA particles.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span&gt;It should go without saying, but the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;measles-mumps-rubella&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; vaccine does not contain pieces of aborted fetuses. The vaccine &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.chop.edu/vaccine-education-center/vaccine-safety/vaccine-ingredients/ingredients-by-vaccine/mmr-vaccine-ingredients" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:contains;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;contains&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; live or weakened measles, mumps, and rubella viruses and ingredients to stabilize the solution.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The return of historically eradicated diseases is thanks to a growing movement of anti-vax parents who refuse to provide their children with the same public health advantages that they received in their youth, mostly in fear of thoroughly debunked conspiracy theories.

Since then, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.webmd.com/brain/autism/do-vaccines-cause-autism" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:dozens of studies;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;dozens of studies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; have proven there’s no correlation between autism and vaccines, including one study that surveyed more than 660,000 children over the course of 11 years.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span&gt;But America’s is not the first measles response that Kennedy has bungled. Under Kennedy’s stewardship, the anti-vax nonprofit Children’s Health Defense had its own questionable history with the disease. Preceding a deadly measles outbreak on Samoa in 2019, the organization spread rampant misinformation about the efficacy of vaccines throughout the nation, sending the island’s vaccination rate plummeting from the 60–70 percent range to just 31 percent, according to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2024/07/how-rfk-jr-falsely-denied-his-connection-to-a-deadly-measles-outbreak-in-samoa/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mother Jones;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mother Jones&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt; That year, the country reported 5,707 cases of measles as well as 83 measles-related deaths, the majority of which were children under the age of 5.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Tue, 24 Jun 2025 19:09:42 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMieEFVX3lxTFB4MmhpcFRXNWdXb3RGMl9HYUdhRVpzdnk1SWdGTS0tN2tlcHkzM2tEbERqWFg3YWFZOHdxS1l0X1NwRXZGUS1JdHM3SVdIa0ZYV1BWeTlUUFZKREpmaVU0NkNweWFIZ1ZzR01QUU5sUExadVRTWGtTYQ</guid></item><item><title>中国果园蝙蝠病毒发现引发曝光担忧- ScienceAlert | Virus Discovery Among Bats in China Fruit Orchards Draw Exposure Concerns - ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipAFBVV95cUxNMGFzdmtaTXQyMFgyRUcwRDc4N0Vzd0laOHB1Q1p0bnE2V2pSSjAtZ094TUJnbW0wMm1RYlVmVjdfV1F5V0tsQWkwNmRHTFJFRjZ4RWVycmZjQ0lDdWEtbHFMWTBpc1EzOGN0RGhvTG5zempqTmFVeHJCb1NsMG5vazRYWEZkY1ZwNkFOQ3RjT1JNc2VwdWIxVDlnb1ZGRDNnZ1B4eQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Bats living among the orchards of Yunnan province in southwest China have been found harboring a variety of unknown pathogens in their kidneys, including two that are closely related to the deadly Nipah and Hendra  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/virus" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73053" data-postid="165624" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;viruses&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The discovery was made by a team of scientists led by Guopeng Kuang from the Yunnan Institute of Endemic Disease Control and Prevention and Tian Yang from Dali University in China, who used genetic analysis to identify microbes in 142 bats from 10 different species. They found 20 new viruses in total, along with a new bacterium and a new protozoan parasite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The viruses of concern are both &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henipavirus"&gt;henipaviruses&lt;/a&gt;, which are known for their long genomes and wide range of hosts. More than half of the new viruses' genes match those of the Nipah and Hendra viruses, which, while highly lethal to humans who are infected, are relatively rare among our species.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's unclear whether these two new henipaviruses have the genetic machinery to cross from bats to other species, but their similarity to known human pathogens means scientists will be keeping a close eye on them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"&lt;span&gt;These viruses are particularly concerning because they were predominantly found in bat kidneys, a site linked to urine production, raising alarm about potential human exposure via contaminated fruits or water (routes implicated in previous outbreaks)," &lt;a href="https://www.scimex.org/newsfeed/new-bat-viruses-in-china-have-scientists-raising-urgent-concerns"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; molecular virologist Vinod Balasubramaniam from Monash University in Malaysia, who was not involved in the study. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That the bats were captured in fruit orchards means that if the viruses were capable of jumping between species, humans and domestic animals would make easy targets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/close-relative-of-highly-fatal-coronavirus-discovered-in-brazils-bats?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;Close Relative of Highly Fatal Coronavirus Discovered in Brazil's Bats&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But bats are also an important asset to orchards: they can pollinate fruits, fertilize soil, and prey on insects. For instance, 90 percent of bats in China that are insectivorous save the country's &lt;a href="https://fructidor.com/en/news/news-detail/23509d54-86fe-4867-9086-445456cbff8b"&gt;apple farmers&lt;/a&gt; an &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.5111467"&gt;estimated US$2 billion&lt;/a&gt; in crop losses each year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As University of Sydney &lt;span&gt;veterinarian and wildlife disease ecologist Alison Peel, who was also not involved in the study, &lt;a href="https://www.scimex.org/newsfeed/new-bat-viruses-in-china-have-scientists-raising-urgent-concerns"&gt;points out&lt;/a&gt;: "We have other examples of close evolutionary cousins to Hendra and Nipah that appear not to be of any concern for spillover, so there will need to be some more laboratory studies on these new viruses to determine the actual risk."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research is published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1013235"&gt;PLOS Pathogens&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

While sedated, they performed amputations to her right leg below the knee, her left leg above the knee, her right arm, and her left hand, to preserve what remained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Munoz said: 'Having been perfectly fine that morning, my body was now in a state of &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/sepsis/index.html" id="mol-c8076f70-511c-11f0-b835-69ff7119a9a2" class=""&gt;sepsis&lt;/a&gt;... my family was contacted so that we could say our final goodbyes as I was expected to die that night.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She continued in her GoFundMe &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-arisbeth-munoz-walk-again-fund-prosthetics"&gt;post&lt;/a&gt;: 'It's difficult.

I think it's a bad dream. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Arisbeth Munoz, 39, lost her right leg below the knee, her left leg above the knee, her right arm and her left hand due to sepsis and necrotizing fasciitis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;She had initially gone to her local emergency room due to vomiting and pain in her body&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'For five months since being admitted into the ER, I was admitted into six different hospitals, and was able to keep breathing with the help of machines.

With the caption: “Overheard someone call Diet Coke a ‘fridge cigarette’ and nothing’s been more true to me since.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;she didn’t actually come up with it herself?&lt;/strong&gt; No, but that’s not important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is?&lt;/strong&gt; That the video has now had 3.8m views.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So a fridge cigarette is what &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;gen Z&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; is calling a cold can of pop? &lt;/strong&gt;Correct.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is it even addictive? Does it give you cancer and heart disease and the rest? &lt;/strong&gt;No! (Definitely not, say the lawyers.) It’s not about cigarettes; it’s about that moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Which moment?&lt;/strong&gt; “I feel like it’s one of those things that doesn’t need a lot of explanation,” Reno, a freelance creator in New York, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/18/style/fridge-cigarette-diet-coke.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;told the New York Times&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’m sorry, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reno, but I feel it does. &lt;/strong&gt;She went on to say that “the crack of the can is like the spark of a lighter”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Different sound. &lt;/strong&gt;That’s not the point. Don’t be so pedantic. It’s about expectation. Look, @josiepeaches gets it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Also on TikTok?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@josiepeaches/video/7514352147862015254" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Also on TikTok&lt;/a&gt;. She says: “I’ve never related to anything more in my life!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;She also says &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;she doesn’t even smoke&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;Again, it doesn’t matter; it’s about the ritual, taking a break from your routine to reach not into a pack of Lucky Strikes but into the fridge for a cold, crispy one. Then the hit, not of nicotine to the brain, but bubbles and artificial sweeteners …&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mmmm. I remember when a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_Coke_Break" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Diet Coke break meant&lt;/a&gt; ogling ripped topless workmen out of the office window. &lt;/strong&gt;Well, that was the 90s and 00s, when objectifying the male body was acceptable. Not any more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But it’s OK to associate fizzy drinks with a dangerous drug that kills people? &lt;/strong&gt;It’s like smoking without the smoking, taking the edge off without taking years off your life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’m not sure fizzy drinks are that healthy, are they?&lt;/strong&gt; They’re not as bad as smoking, and this is a generation that cares about its health and wellbeing, but also about work-life balance, and taking a moment to escape the pressure …&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And TikTok.&lt;/strong&gt; And TikTok.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do say:&lt;/strong&gt; “A juice, perhaps? Or a ‘fridge vape’, as I call them …”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t say&lt;/strong&gt;: “I’m going out for a smoke. Or should I say a ‘tobacco spritz’?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Tue, 24 Jun 2025 16:53:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirAFBVV95cUxNb0V1Y2I2V3piUE02bU5KOVdhM2hER2s2RnVJdDZVY3ZkWjEzMFZUajVhU0ZaQzBqYXRyTjFnVlo5M19EMmtqb0lOeWhPUURlYW16Ym9kcl9YT2VUYk5wXzVIOTNFSmdudjFlckRabnlrLUJQRENlNGpCZWxqOXZEQ2dCZGJvMEk5QmFqdm9paDhfU3hoMnlCaTdkZTBlVXR2U2lxamcwUlZvSDQx</guid></item><item><title>美国疾控中心报告显示含硫柳汞疫苗与自闭症之间没有联系-路透社 | US CDC report shows no link between thimerosal-containing vaccines and autism - Reuters</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiygFBVV95cUxNUy0xUEs3ZlotSzAyNThqcUhhRVcxUk5mcDdOblhLSVhycVppRWFjeDROY1FNQlJaVTRxWGpVLVlQZmtpTFhEeFBaSWxBcDdqSC1tcFltT1c4dHppNXBzQmx1TzBJM1ViNjI2ZWtmY0FiRm1mb0p3MS1YWWpkSzd2RWhrZFVKUzF2NHNyZE9vX0I2aGV2TExjb3pYYTFqZWtSQ05lbzZJbUNuNjNTckw1MlZPSjB2aEhlQUJkOHhjRGVobGpZXzBrRkFn?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Reuters</author><pubDate>Tue, 24 Jun 2025 16:52:42 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiygFBVV95cUxNUy0xUEs3ZlotSzAyNThqcUhhRVcxUk5mcDdOblhLSVhycVppRWFjeDROY1FNQlJaVTRxWGpVLVlQZmtpTFhEeFBaSWxBcDdqSC1tcFltT1c4dHppNXBzQmx1TzBJM1ViNjI2ZWtmY0FiRm1mb0p3MS1YWWpkSzd2RWhrZFVKUzF2NHNyZE9vX0I2aGV2TExjb3pYYTFqZWtSQ05lbzZJbUNuNjNTckw1MlZPSjB2aEhlQUJkOHhjRGVobGpZXzBrRkFn</guid></item><item><title>癌症母亲在儿子的忏悔后心碎-每日邮报 | Cancer-stricken mother's heartbreak after son's chilling confession - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Misty De La Cruz is battling an aggressive &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-8ca498a0-510c-11f0-9d50-47d9571cdf5b"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;, but that isn't what's devastating her. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The mother of eight was &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/news/article-14453031/young-sisters-diagnosed-breast-cancer-weeks-apart.html"&gt;diagnosed with stage three triple-negative breast cancer&lt;/a&gt; in 2023. She sat down with her children and openly explained to them what her cancer diagnosis was and what it meant for the family going forward. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Since her diagnosis, De La Cruz, 43, has undergone weeks of chemotherapy treatments, surgeries with another to come, and has just begun immunotherapy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People with this stage of triple-negative breast cancer have a five-year survival rate of up to 65 percent, but De La Cruz's prognosis is far more dim, telling her followers on &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/tiktok/index.html" id="mol-c4deef00-510b-11f0-9d50-47d9571cdf5b"&gt;TikTok&lt;/a&gt; that she has a 20 percent chance of beating cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;De La Cruz typically records in one of two poses: lying down due to crippling fatigue that renders her bedbound some days, or driving to a doctor's appointment, whether it's to see a dermatologist from a facial rash due to chemo or the dentist to repair her decaying teeth.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The true toll &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14177967/breast-cancer-rising-doctors-warn-american-women-report.html"&gt;her cancer diagnosis&lt;/a&gt; is taking on the family was highlighted last month when the &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/maryland/index.html" id="mol-8ca86930-510c-11f0-9d50-47d9571cdf5b"&gt;Maryland&lt;/a&gt; resident received a phone call from her son's school that broke her heart, she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The school nurse told her the boy, now 10, had been unusually tired during the day. When asked why, he mentioned said he was staying up most nights ‘because he thinks that while he’s asleep, I’m going to die,’ De La Cruz said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘There’s so much more to this process than just us battling cancer… It’s the fact that our kids are so traumatized,' De La Cruz added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'As a parent you try to be strong for your children, but they watch you slowly change into someone completely different.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption" aria-label="To enrich screen reader interactions, please activate Accessibility in Grammarly extension settings"&gt;Misty De La Cruz, 43, was diagnosed with stage three triple-negative breast cancer in 2023 and was given a 20 percent chance of survival&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'He was crying, and the only thing he asked was if I was going to die. I tried to reassure him that the doctors were going to do the best that they could do to make sure that that didn’t happen. But ultimately, there is never a promise from anyone, but I was gonna fight as hard as I could.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Two years ago, at 41, De La Cruz began experiencing pain in her right breast during her period, a pain, she &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://people.com/mother-battling-stage-3-breast-cancer-gets-unexpected-call-from-school-nurse-exclusive-11751180"&gt;told &lt;/a&gt;PEOPLE, that ‘felt a little bit different’ from standard breast pain many women experience during their cycles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It persisted over several months until she went to see her gynecologist, who performed a standard mammogram and manual exam of her breasts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nothing looked suspicious, though her doctor noted that De La Cruz had dense breast tissue, which can make detecting nodules more difficult.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;De La Cruz went about her life as a busy working mom but said she harbored a feeling of uncertainty. Doctors brushed off her concerns, citing the healthy-looking mammogram.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, last summer, when doing her regular monthly manual breast exams, she found a pea-sized knot in her right breast that was not there the month before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She was back in her doctor’s office within days and taken for another mammogram as well as an ultrasound, which can sometimes pick up on tumors hidden within dense breast tissue that a standard mammogram may miss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors rushed to perform a biopsy, ‘and within 48 hours, I had the results for that biopsy… and it came back for stage 2 triple-negative breast cancer.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption" aria-label="To enrich screen reader interactions, please activate Accessibility in Grammarly extension settings"&gt;De La Cruz is pictured pre-diagnosis with her doctors. She said she did not begin to feel sick until she started chemo, which caused severe fatigue, brain fog, and nausea &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But an oncologist soon informed her that the cancer was actually at stage 3 and had spread to her lymph nodes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘So we needed to start immediately,’ De La Cruz said. ‘It’s going to wreak havoc and spreads especially quicker now because I had the biopsy and the mammogram, because radiation and agitating the tumor causes it to go crazy.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She began chemo within the week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I still wasn’t sick,’ she added. ‘I really didn’t start getting sick until I started chemo,’ which causes nausea, exhaustion, hair loss, and a whole list of side effects that hit harder than the disease itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The ensuing chemotherapy treatments ravaged De La Cruz’s body, causing such severe vomiting that her teeth began to rot, lethargy that left her bound to the couch, a rash across her face, and constant brain fog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Roughly 65 percent of women diagnosed with stage three triple negative breast cancer survive five years after their diagnosis. At this stage, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-12980937/Nurse-30-diagnosed-rare-aggressive-breast-cancer-patient-inspires-perform-breast-exam.html"&gt;the aggressive cancer&lt;/a&gt; has spread to the lymph nodes, six of which De La Cruz had surgically removed last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She recently learned that she carries a mutation on the BRCA2 gene that impedes the body’s ability to repair damaged DNA, allowing cells to accumulate damage and grow out of control, a hallmark of cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Women with this mutation have a 45 to 69 percent chance of developing cancer, and De La Cruz now worries for her daughters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The case rate of breast cancer among women as a rate per 100,000 people (light green squares) compared to the death rate shown by the green triangles . As death rates have plunged, case rates are still rising&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At 43, De La Cruz is not your typical cancer patient. Breast cancer is most common in women over 50, with the highest rates occurring in women over 70.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Yet signs are pointing to a spike in breast cancer among younger women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Radiologists affiliated with the American College of Radiology reported last year that new diagnoses of breast cancer in patients 20 to 39 rose by nearly three percent from 2004 to 2021, compared to just a 1.4 percent rise among women in their 70s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also found that cases in patients 40 to 74 increased by two percent per year from 2004 to 2012. But from 2018 to 2021, there was a 2.7 percent yearly increase. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors have attributed rising levels of new advanced cancer diagnoses to federal guidelines that recommend mammograms starting at age 40.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Watching their mother fight cancer and the effects of chemo took a toll on her children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She recounted a trip to the store with one of her sons who, while holding her hand, said he wished he had cancer instead of her. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another time, one of her sons went to sit with her on the couch and would not let go of her arm. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Checking your breasts should be part of your monthly routine so you notice any unusual changes. Simply rub and feel from top to bottom, in semi-circles and in a circular motion around your breast tissue to identify any abnormalities&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He cried, ‘Please don’t die, mom.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I handle a lot of stuff that comes with my cancer,’ she said. ‘At the end of the day… I have to deal with the fact that they tell me I only have a 20 percent survival rate.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;De La Cruz underwent surgery to remove six lymph nodes to mitigate the spread of her cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She will also undergo a double mastectomy, but can only do so after she finishes recovering from a breast reduction procedure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-misty-keep-her-family-home"&gt;started a GoFundMe&lt;/a&gt; to help pay the exorbitant costs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite her prognosis, De La Cruz tries to retain some type of normalcy for her children. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: 'No matter how sick I am, every Sunday our family has a Sunday dinner.

The damage done may have set Iran’s nuclear program back by some months. Iran launched a pro forma, kayfabe response. And maybe it all ends there. (At least for American involvement.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If so, that counts as a win, which makes me happy. It’s good for America and good for the world that this adventure didn’t get out of hand and maybe even made the world (temporarily) a touch safer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And yet, in my darker moments I find myself wondering if it wouldn’t be better for America’s long-term civic health if Trump hadn’t gotten lucky?

A recent study from &lt;a href="https://med.stanford.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Stanford Medicine&lt;/a&gt; shows that these decades are not just markers of getting older—they're periods of biological upheaval, where your molecules and microbes shift rapidly. These discoveries challenge the long-held belief that aging is a steady, slow process. Instead, the aging body transforms in spurts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers collected data over time from 108 adults, aged 25 to 75, all living in California. The team tracked each participant for a median of 1.7 years, with some followed for almost seven years. Their findings, published in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-024-00692-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Nature Aging&lt;/a&gt;, offer a clearer picture of how aging truly unfolds at the molecular level—and how it may help you stay healthier as you grow older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="nonlinear_aging_real_world_impact"&gt;Nonlinear Aging, Real-World Impact&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team behind the study, led by Dr. Michael Snyder, professor of genetics, noticed something curious. While most studies of aging look at gradual changes, many age-related diseases don’t develop slowly. Instead, they appear suddenly and grow worse quickly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Most molecules and microbes undergo nonlinear changes during human aging.

It jumps again to 86% past age 80. Neurological diseases like &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/ai-powers-major-leap-in-understanding-alzheimers-and-parkinsons-diseases/"&gt;Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s&lt;/a&gt; also follow this accelerated trend, with key turning points around age 40 and again near age 65.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="5" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;That pattern raised a question: could these disease risk spikes be tied to biological changes that also happen in bursts?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="6" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;To find out, the researchers turned to high-throughput omics—a set of powerful tools that can examine &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/sunburn-starts-with-rna-damage-not-dna-study-finds/"&gt;RNA&lt;/a&gt;, proteins, metabolites, and other biological molecules all at once. The Stanford team used multi-omics profiling to analyze over 135,000 molecules and microorganisms from participant blood and other samples. In total, nearly 250 billion data points were collected across various omics types, including the microbiome in the nose, mouth, gut, and skin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="7" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The result? About 81% of all tracked molecules didn’t just drift up or down with age—they changed in sharp jumps. These jumps clustered around two key ages: 44 and 60.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="what_happens_in_your_40s_and_60s_"&gt;What Happens in Your 40s and 60s?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="8" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These are not slow, gradual changes,” said Dr. Snyder. “It turns out the mid-40s is a time of dramatic change, as is the early 60s. And that’s true no matter what class of molecules you look at.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="9" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Xiaotao Shen, now an assistant professor at &lt;a href="https://www.ntu.edu.sg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Nanyang Technological University Singapore&lt;/a&gt; and first author of the paper, helped analyze the shifts. The study revealed that in the 40s, molecules linked to lipid metabolism, cardiovascular health, and even alcohol and caffeine processing changed significantly. Muscle and skin-related molecular patterns also shifted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="10" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;By your 60s, different areas lit up—particularly those related to carbohydrate metabolism, immune regulation, and kidney function. The changes affected the body’s ability to fight disease, process nutrients, and repair tissue. Together, these changes help explain why health risks rise more steeply after certain ages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Clustering reveals nonlinear changes in multi-omics profiling during human aging.

They initially assumed the shifts around the mid-40s were mostly due to menopause or perimenopause in women. But after separating the data by sex, the same patterns appeared in men. “This suggests that while menopause or perimenopause may contribute to the changes observed in women in their mid-40s, there are likely other, more significant factors influencing these changes in both men and women,” said Shen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="molecules_microbes_and_healthspan"&gt;Molecules, Microbes, and Healthspan&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="12" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study did more than confirm that aging is complex—it offered a detailed map of how molecules move through time. It showed that different systems in your body don’t age at the same speed. Earlier research from this group had already identified “ageotypes”—personalized aging patterns affecting the &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/attractive-people-have-stronger-immune-systems-surprising-study-finds/"&gt;immune system&lt;/a&gt;, metabolism, liver, or kidney differently in each person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="13" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the latest study, researchers also explored the microbiome, the trillions of bacteria, viruses, and fungi that live in and on your body. These tiny organisms changed in sync with molecular shifts, especially during the two aging bursts. Since the microbiome plays a key role in everything from digestion to immunity, its changes may help explain the increased risk of illness as people move into midlife and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;The heatmap shows the molecular trajectories in 11 clusters during human aging.

It suggests that the biological foundation for these risks is laid much earlier than symptoms appear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="4" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="health_decisions_at_critical_ages"&gt;Health Decisions at Critical Ages&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="15" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers emphasized that you’re not powerless against these aging bursts. In fact, knowing when they happen might help you prevent disease. For example, the sharp changes in alcohol metabolism in your 40s might mean your body no longer processes alcohol as well. Cutting back during this time could reduce your risk of &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/fatty-liver-disease-doubles-risk-of-death-from-several-diseases/"&gt;liver problems&lt;/a&gt; later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="16" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, a drop in immune strength in your 60s could make it harder to recover from infections. Increasing exercise, eating nutrient-rich food, and staying up to date with vaccines could help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="17" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm a big believer that we should try to adjust our lifestyles while we're still healthy," Snyder said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="4" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Functional analysis of nonlinear changing molecules in each cluster.

Rather than treating aging as one process, doctors may soon tailor prevention and treatment plans to specific windows in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="20" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also opens the door for better tracking of “biological age”—a concept that reflects how your body is aging, not just how many birthdays you’ve had. While many tests for biological age exist, few account for how fast changes are happening at different times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="5" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Function annotation for significantly dysregulated molecules in crest 1 and 2.

It shows that the rate of change, not just the direction, may be just as important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="22" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future research will explore what causes these shifts and how to stop them—or at least slow them down.

For now, their findings make a strong case for paying close attention to your health as you enter your 40s and 60s. These are the decades where prevention can really count.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr class="MuiDivider-root MuiDivider-fullWidth css-1pbb6nf" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/separator" id=""&gt;&lt;hr class="MuiDivider-root MuiDivider-fullWidth css-1pbb6nf" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/separator" id=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Brighter Side of News</author><pubDate>Tue, 24 Jun 2025 16:07:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiswFBVV95cUxNNWFqMXZ1ZkJpT3BSRWlIMkYwcVphTFlpampJaVhBZzN2LWhPMjI4c3ByTWV2QXhNNXdNQXRtQzBQRkswVjEtU2ZsRC1kM1ZoYVdpVDJYNWZqWXgwUTNwaHp3ckFXRmdKQ09HUkstamV3X3haQ2hBaW1YaHpIYmNKUFJpTy1ocHdmNDBFZlQxcU9jVW1aLVBTdnkyd0VVanRGTlFDVkxyOHR0VWdDMU1vWEZocw</guid></item><item><title>致命的坟墓真菌可能导致了致命的白血病治疗-好消息网络 | A Deadly Tomb Fungus May Have Yielded a Killer Leukemia Treatment - Good News Network</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinwFBVV95cUxOMEd5dkdHTm5tTDRWQ3J6QnZxbzgyeGdhUmNJaWVtazlWbXZ2N24yd2dxcW4wbXdpd29FMUFpWW83YjF0a1FfQzhiVGp1RkFVbEhMSlp6YXlTQUZtWjVUaXpiWGVoZ0t4U0dtQVZLZDBpa0FBaTVtWnpxMWZZdVR6VkE4TWJ4T1ZfMWF6YTVUaUszemNXTHR3Qm1lZG1VME0?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="td-post-content"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A deadly fungus has been turned into a potent cancer-fighting compound after researchers isolated a new class of molecules from it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aspergillus flavus&lt;/em&gt;, a toxic crop fungus linked to deaths in the excavations of ancient tombs—such as that of the boy pharaoh Tutankhamon—was recently used in a test against leukemia cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result? A promising cancer-killing compound that rivals FDA-approved drugs and opens up new frontiers in the discovery of more fungal medicines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Fungi gave us penicillin,” &lt;a href="https://blog.seas.upenn.edu/penn-engineers-turn-toxic-fungus-into-anti-cancer-drug" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Sherry Gao, Presidential Compact Associate Professor at the University of Pennsylvania and senior author of &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41589-025-01946-9" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;a new paper&lt;/a&gt; in Nature Chemical Biologyon. “These results show that many more medicines derived from natural products remain to be found.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After archaeologists opened King Tutankhamun’s tomb in the 1920s, a series of untimely deaths among the excavation team fueled rumors of a pharaoh’s curse. Decades later, doctors theorized that fungal spores, dormant for millennia, could have played a role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pgs-dpg-flex" data-pgs-partner-id="good-news-network"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the 1970s, a dozen scientists entered the tomb of Casimir IV in Poland. Within weeks, 10 of them died. Later investigations revealed the tomb contained &lt;em&gt;Aspergillus flavus&lt;/em&gt;, named for its yellow spores, whose toxins can lead to lung infections, especially in people with compromised immune systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, that same fungus is the unlikely source of a promising new cancer therapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The therapy in question is a class of ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides, or RiPPs, pronounced like the “rip” in a piece of fabric. The name refers the ribosome, a tiny cellular structure that makes proteins, including RiPP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Purifying these chemicals is difficult,” says Qiuyue Nie, a postdoctoral fellow and the paper’s first author. While thousands of RiPPs have been identified in bacteria, only a handful have been found in fungi. In part, this is because past researchers misidentified fungal RiPPs as non-ribosomal peptides and had little understanding of how fungi created the molecules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The synthesis of these compounds is complicated,” adds Nie. “But that’s also what gives them this remarkable bioactivity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To find more fungal RiPPs, the researchers first scanned a dozen strains of &lt;em&gt;Aspergillus&lt;/em&gt;, which previous research suggested might contain more of the chemicals. By comparing chemicals produced by these strains with known RiPP building blocks, the researchers identified &lt;em&gt;A. flavus&lt;/em&gt; as a promising candidate for further study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genetic analysis pointed to a particular protein in &lt;em&gt;A. flavus&lt;/em&gt; as a source of fungal RiPPs. When the researchers turned the genes that create that protein off, the chemical markers indicating the presence of RiPPs also disappeared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This novel approach of combining metabolic and genetic information not only pinpointed the source of fungal RiPPs in &lt;em&gt;A. flavus&lt;/em&gt; but could be used to find more fungal RiPPs in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After purifying four different RiPPs, the researchers found the molecules shared a unique structure of interlocking rings. The researchers named these molecules, which have never been previously described, after the fungus in which they were found: asperigimycins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even with no modification, when mixed with human cancer cells, asperigimycins demonstrated medical potential: two of the four variants had potent effects against leukemia cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OTHER GIFTS FROM THE WORLD OF FUNGI: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a title="Ingredient Found in All Mushrooms Can Reprogram Immune Cells to Fight Deadly Flu Infections" href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/ingredient-found-in-all-mushrooms-can-reprogram-immune-cells-to-fight-deadly-flu-infections/" rel="bookmark"&gt;Ingredient Found in All Mushrooms Can Reprogram Immune Cells to Fight Deadly Flu Infections&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another variant, to which the researchers added a lipid, or fatty molecule, that is also found in the royal jelly that nourishes developing bees, performed as well as cytarabine and daunorubicin, two FDA-approved drugs that have been used for decades to treat leukemia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inside the leukemia cells, a gene called SLC46A3, proved critical in allowing asperigimycins to enter leukemia cells in sufficient numbers, which has given the team the idea that it might be a pathway for other, already developed remedies called cyclic peptides, to enter and kill a leukemia cell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Knowing that lipids can affect how this gene transports chemicals into cells gives us another tool for drug development,” says Nie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through further experimentation, the researchers found that asperigimycins likely disrupt the process of cell division. Notably, the compounds had little to no effect on breast, liver or lung cancer cells, or a range of bacteria and fungi, suggesting that asperigimycins’ disruptive effects are specific to certain types of cells, a critical feature for any future medication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOVEL CANCER TREATMENTS: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a title="Scientists Identify New Way Cancers Sustain Themselves–and How Ginger Could Disrupt it" href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/scientists-identify-new-way-cancers-sustain-themselves-and-that-ginger-could-disrupt-it/" rel="bookmark"&gt;Scientists Identify New Way Cancers Sustain Themselves–and How Ginger Could Disrupt it&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to demonstrating the medical potential of asperigimycins, the researchers identified similar clusters of genes in other fungi, suggesting that more fungal RiPPs remain to be discovered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Even though only a few have been found, almost all of them have strong bioactivity,” says Nie. “This is an unexplored region with tremendous potential.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Nature has given us this incredible pharmacy,” says Gao. “It’s up to us to uncover its secrets. As engineers, we’re excited to keep exploring, learning from nature and using that knowledge to design better solutions.”&lt;/p&gt;

New findings show that this relay does more than position your eyes; it also helps you decide what those eyes are seeing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists from the &lt;a href="https://www.uchicago.edu/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Chicago&lt;/a&gt; have now traced high‑level judgment back to the same circuit that pilots a reflexive gaze. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://neurobiology.uchicago.edu/faculty/david-freedman-phd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;David Freedman&lt;/a&gt;, professor of neurobiology at the university, says the discovery redraws some of the most familiar maps of the mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-collicular-midbrain-hub-is-ancient"&gt;Collicular midbrain hub is ancient&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10115501/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;superior colliculus&lt;/a&gt; sits just above the brainstem and appears in fish, birds, and mammals alike, hinting at an ancestry stretching half a billion years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its layered tissue forms a two‑dimensional grid that rapidly transforms flashes of light into head and eye movements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For decades, textbooks described the structure as a simple switchboard for &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK10991/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;saccades&lt;/a&gt;, the rapid jumps that refresh a scene several times a second. The cortex, by contrast, was said to handle every higher act, from object recognition to chess.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Growing evidence counters that neat divide. A 2017 &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5752317/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; chronicled how collicular neurons encode attention and decision signals once thought exclusive to the cerebral mantle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those hints set the stage for a closer look at the midbrain in real time. Freedman’s group answered with electrodes and a clever behavioral trick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-gazing-and-judging"&gt;Gazing and judging&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;They trained two &lt;a href="https://neprimateconservancy.org/rhesus-macaque/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Macaca mulatta&lt;/em&gt; monkeys&lt;/a&gt; to hold their eyes on a central point while labeling drifting dot patterns as belonging to one of two learned categories. Fruit‑juice rewards encouraged fast, accurate button presses rather than eye shifts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the task, arrays of fine wires captured spikes in the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/posterior-parietal-cortex" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;posterior parietal cortex&lt;/a&gt;, a well‑known decision center, and simultaneously inside the colliculus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Timing analysis revealed that category information emerged in both places at almost the same moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More surprising, the midbrain signal was stronger and more consistent than the cortical one, indexing the upcoming choice with remarkable fidelity. That meant the ancient hub was not just echoing the cortex but &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-024-01744-x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;leading&lt;/a&gt; the conversation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is a really surprising place to find these kinds of cognitive signals because this area of the brain is traditionally associated with simpler &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/male-and-female-brains-are-wired-completely-differently/"&gt;spatial orienting behaviors&lt;/a&gt; and even reflexive functions,” said Freedman. He notes that the finding challenges a long‑held hierarchy that placed the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/psychology/neocortex" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;neocortex&lt;/a&gt; firmly on top.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-switching-off-the-collicular-midbrain"&gt;Switching off the collicular midbrain&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Correlation, however, does not guarantee causation. To probe necessity, the team injected minute doses of muscimol to silence collicular &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/rebooting-the-brain-experts-can-transform-cells-into-neurons/"&gt;neurons&lt;/a&gt; for about 30 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The monkeys still stared at the fixation point and pushed buttons with normal speed, showing that motor paths remained largely intact. Even so, their category judgments slipped toward chance until normal firing returned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 2021 &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8338902/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; by Michele Basso and colleagues had already shown that damping the same region biases simpler motion decisions in primates. The new work extends that causal role to abstract rules untied to any spatial cue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our results show us that this area is really important for the task,” Freedman added. Without its input, the cortex alone could not salvage performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-collicular-neurons-and-spatial-maps"&gt;Collicular neurons and spatial maps&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The collicular sheet represents space in a neat polar grid, each &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/cell-division-discovery-challenges-a-century-of-textbook-biology/"&gt;cell&lt;/a&gt; preferring a particular direction and eccentricity. Such organization may offer high‑speed scaffolding for loftier computations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Freedman suspects that the brain projects non‑spatial information onto that grid to exploit wiring already optimized for rapid competition among options. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spatial coding could act as a common currency, letting disparate sensory and memory traces jostle under a single rulebook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Separate teams have found midbrain &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627324004124" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;neurons&lt;/a&gt; that single out faces mere milliseconds after stimulus onset, bypassing the slower ventral stream. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Others report &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37352857/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;collicular bursts&lt;/a&gt; that end deliberations once evidence reaches a threshold, acting like an internal referee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Some of this data might be telling us that the spatial parts of the brain are getting recruited into helping us perform these non-spatial cognitive functions,” said &lt;a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=em1qF1AAAAAJ&amp;amp;hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Barbara Peysakhovich&lt;/a&gt;, first author of the study. Her remark underscores how evolution can co‑opt one circuit for many jobs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-midbrain-collicular-circuits-and-perception"&gt;Midbrain collicular circuits and perception&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Functional MRI supports the idea in humans. Activity flares in the colliculus when volunteers search &lt;a href="https://bmcneurosci.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2202-8-66" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;cluttered scenes&lt;/a&gt; or shift attention without moving their eyes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4949391/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; that probed eye‑driven Go/No‑Go decisions in progressive supranuclear palsy linked slow saccades to impaired evidence accumulation, implicating the same midbrain route. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such overlap suggests that eye‑movement disorders and cognitive decline may share a single lesion site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Computational neuroscientists are now modeling collicular circuits to design cameras that spot hazards before full scene analysis is complete. The Chicago data offer a fresh template for those algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the study blurs a tidy border between perception and reflection. It invites a broader search for additional double‑duty nodes throughout the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/big-changes-in-the-brain-between-the-ages-of-11-25-and-how-it-influence-our-decisions/"&gt;brain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-next-steps-and-implications"&gt;Next steps and implications&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Freedman plans to test whether similar signals appear in people using magnetoencephalography combined with deep‑brain electrical recordings during surgery. Such work could clarify how much of the primate finding generalizes to everyday human reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another priority is mapping the pathways that carry the category code into and out of the midbrain. Anatomical &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10115501/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; already show dense links from frontal &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/unexpected-find-inside-the-eye-of-a-tiny-wasp-megaphragma-viggianii/"&gt;eye&lt;/a&gt; field to colliculus as well as ascending fibers that reach the cortex via the thalamus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Untangling those loops may reveal how a single decision circulates between brainstem and cortex &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/action-observation-network-human-brain-perception-see-what-we-expect-to-see-mind-eye/"&gt;before reaching awareness&lt;/a&gt;. The results could also help clinicians fine‑tune deep‑brain stimulators aimed at restoring gaze and cognition in movement disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-024-01744-x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 24 Jun 2025 15:51:38 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiswFBVV95cUxNZDY1eXZWVk90MzhLTl84ZDVJcW1kaVVTOThWdHRtckRSbHM2WXBIUW5GeFRQZ1dRQVJpdUdhWG1mRk9IV0ZjcGdvN2FnajVieG13MDV5Q1RNZEVBa3V0cC1tS09zVVFXb0hELXpJNF9vYnpjRmNkVGRVaTc4ampmeFRFRHNld0EwSmhScElhUWRvX1Iya2NBTUY2b2ZoajctMmpHRXpJQkdoa2I4MHU3REtnRQ</guid></item><item><title>用这种富含脂肪的日常小吃告别不眠之夜-印度时报 | Say goodbye to sleepless nights with this fat-rich everyday snack - Times of India</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi-AFBVV95cUxPNmhub3Vsd0NMUkQzT1ZIUGk2cGVsd3VLb09vdTVvYjZzVXBucVhFanFNTEdJdFlhamRWU1FiaWdxdnNvbVhfWlZ6Mm9XWHJGT3BaS0Z0NFFLd2tvbTFjSWVEZnhpeXFoU2pFSkhDMjd0M0JqVEp2WWZrdnVXUEQ5WGZ2RklNT1lQdWNZZEhnX2YyVkpCYzk3TGszVW1DX0pfSDc1SXp5UTNQOGlWT0Mzc2JHb2puTjZhS2l6RmNtLXJqQm1vR21tZnR5akk3NTluVEhJLVNLbUJXaFhrMDM3SHEteFlITWQwVUQ2eVVIZzlTcVJUb3d4eA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;div class="MwN2O"&gt;&lt;div class="vdo_embedd"&gt; &lt;div class="T22zO"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Avocados are no longer just salad toppings or toast companions. A new study published in the Journal of the American Heart Association by Dr Kristina Petersen and her team at Penn State found that eating one Hass avocado daily may improve sleep quality. Originally focused on heart health in adults with abdominal obesity, the research involved 969 participants aged 25 and older with waistlines over 35 inches for women and 40 inches for men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who added a large Hass avocado to their diet over 26 weeks did not see significant cardiovascular gains. What stood out instead was better sleep. That unexpected discovery has opened new questions about how nutrients in everyday foods, like avocados, might support rest. Dr Petersen highlights that while no single food works miracles, avocados hold promise within a balanced lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Avocados may help you sleep better, study finds by surprise&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Petersen and her colleagues set out to explore how avocados affect heart health, but stumbled on sleep benefits instead. Their trial split participants into two groups. One added a Hass avocado to their meals daily. The other maintained usual habits without significant avocado intake. Over 26 weeks, the sleep quality reports stood out. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those eating avocados regularly slept better without changing their sleep routines. Though the study was not designed for sleep outcomes, knowledge of these new results adds context and invites further investigation. It highlights how a single dietary change can lead to unexpected benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div data-pos="0" class="id-r-component QbQNS undefined

Hass avocados provide monounsaturated fatty acids known to support heart health and cellular recovery. They also offer dietary fibre, which supports digestion and metabolic balance, potassium that helps regulate blood pressure and muscle function, folate and vitamin K that support brain and bone health, copper involved in neurotransmitter production, and pantothenic acid that supports hormone regulation and stress response. Taken together, these nutrients may promote relaxation, better sleep cycles and overall restfulness. Dr Petersen highlighted the emerging role of nutrition in sleep and overall heart health in her report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Why avocados wont fix everything&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers stress that one avocado cannot replace sleep hygiene or medical care. They recommend pairing it with regular exercise, reduced caffeine and alcohol use, less evening screen time, and quitting smoking. Experts point out that avocados are calorie-dense, so eating more than one per day may result in unintended weight gain. For most people, though, one avocado is a safe and nutrient-rich addition to a regular diet that supports multiple areas of health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What we already know about &lt;keyword id="23654141" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="avocado-benefits" source="keywords"&gt;avocado benefits&lt;/keyword&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This new sleep finding builds on existing research. Studies from previous years link regular avocado intake to lower levels of bad cholesterol and reduced abdominal fat in women. A recent 2024 trial showed that daily avocado consumption may lower the risk of type 2 diabetes in women. When viewed together, the data demonstrates that this beloved fruit could influence heart health, metabolic function and now potentially sleep.

Other videos show static holds without arm support, in an arched Superman position.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Various claims have been made about adult tummy time on social media, including that it can help “fix” one’s posture, alleviate neck and back pain, and undo “tech neck”, the hunched, head-forward position many of us inadvertently adopt while desk bound.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="posture-and-pain" class="dcr-12pc8kk"&gt;Posture and pain&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Think of “good posture”, and the image of a soldier-like ramrod back might come to mind. “There are very strong cultural beliefs about what good posture is,” says Prof Leon Straker, of Curtin University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;But despite strongly held assumptions that a slumped posture increases your risk of neck and back pain, researchers say there is little convincing evidence this is actually the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;One &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27174256/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;study in teenagers&lt;/a&gt;, co-authored by Straker, found no association between sitting posture and neck pain, while a second – which &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33444448/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;tracked young adults&lt;/a&gt; over five years – found that, surprisingly, “people with the really direct upright posture – which we normally think of as good – actually had slightly increased risk of pain”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“The conclusion there is that posture is really important for function, but it doesn’t link strongly to your risk of pain,” Straker says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“We do have some evidence [in adults] that people that have neck pain do tend to lean forward as they’re sitting at, say, a computer,” the head of physiotherapy at the University of Newcastle, Prof Suzanne Snodgrass, says. But association is not causation – it’s unclear whether that &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31773477/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;forward head position&lt;/a&gt; causes the neck pain, or whether people maintain that posture &lt;em&gt;because&lt;/em&gt; they have neck pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="c55f5ed4-ef2c-4e8c-95d5-39fa737f2bb4" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":13,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"Is good posture overrated?

He points out that back pain is more strongly associated with low physical activity, stress, emotions and sleep than mechanical factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="can-tummy-time-fix-tech-neck" class="dcr-12pc8kk"&gt;Can tummy time ‘fix’ tech neck?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Extended hours in front of screens, &lt;a href="https://news.sky.com/story/life-sized-model-shows-what-office-workers-might-look-like-in-20-years-11843868" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;gimmicky dolls made by office equipment companies&lt;/a&gt; would have us believe, will eventually turn us all into slouched Quasimodos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“If you sit hunched for a long time, does your posture end up being stuck that way? I think there’s some merit to that,” Snodgrass says. “For a lot of the years of your life, you can reverse things by doing exercise and movement.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The rationale for adult tummy time “is that if your spine is in the opposite position, rounded for a lot of the day, if you put it in that [extension] position, you’re kind of balancing it out,” she says. “Tummy time probably helps your lumbar spine [the lower back] more than it helps your neck.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;But as for “fixing” posture, “it’s not going to change how you sit – it’s only going to move your spine in another way, to give it a bit more mobility when you’re doing other things.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-22" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;skip past newsletter promotion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;aside aria-label="newsletter promotion" class="dcr-av5vqf"&gt;&lt;div class="dcr-10et71f"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-1sbse14"&gt;Sign up to &lt;span&gt;Saved for Later&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-1xjndtj"&gt;Catch up on the fun stuff with Guardian Australia's culture and lifestyle rundown of pop culture, trends and tips&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SecureSignup" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props="{&amp;quot;newsletterId&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;saved-for-later&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;successDescription&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Catch up on the fun stuff with Guardian Australia's culture and lifestyle rundown of pop culture, trends and tips&amp;quot;}"&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1eusqlu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy Notice: &lt;/strong&gt;Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Though the evidence doesn’t suggest adult tummy time will change posture or risk of neck pain in the long term, back extension positions may help to maintain range of movement, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;He emphasises the “need to start gently and progress it sensibly, so that you’re not actually … creating pain by doing something that you’re body’s not used to”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="other-movements-to-try" class="dcr-12pc8kk"&gt;Other movements to try&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“There is no single ideal posture linked to pain prevention,” Saragiotto says. Although tummy time positions are low risk and easy to do, “there are better interventions supported by evidence, such as … pilates, having a healthy lifestyle, and even walking.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In an office environment, “having breaks and moving during the day is usually what will help more than having a perfect ergonomic posture,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="1bc1c605-0822-478e-88b4-f495772f754c" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.EmbedBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="UnsafeEmbedBlockComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"html":"&amp;lt;blockquote class=\"tiktok-embed\" cite=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@dr.dan_dpt/video/7501379896900472095\" data-video-id=\"7501379896900472095\""max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px;\" &amp;gt; &amp;lt;section&amp;gt; &amp;lt;a target=\"_blank\" title=\"@dr.dan_dpt\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@dr.dan_dpt?refer=embed\"&amp;gt;@dr.dan_dpt&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; If you’re looking to avoid the dreaded tech neck, here are 3 ways that I would go about it.  &amp;lt;a title=\"physicaltherapy\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/physicaltherapy?refer=embed\"&amp;gt;#physicaltherapy&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;  Original poster: @charlom &amp;lt;a target=\"_blank\" title=\"♬ original sound - Dr. Dan, DPT\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-7501379978248899359?refer=embed\"&amp;gt;♬ original sound - Dr. Dan, DPT&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/section&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt; &amp;lt;script async src=\"https://www.tiktok.com/embed.js\"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;","alt":"Video about avoiding tech neck ","index":31,"isTracking":true,"isMainMedia":false,"source":"TikTok","sourceDomain":"tiktok.com"}'&gt;&lt;div data-component="click-to-view:tiktok.com" class="dcr-umpqcy"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-njwpqm"&gt;Allow TikTok content?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-j4jr8l"&gt;This article includes content provided by TikTok.

Also lifting through the lower abdominal muscles, so pulling them up and in shoulders back … And then just lifting your head nice and long, and standing tall.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“At home, you can lie on your back, knees bent, and have your arms out to the side, like drawing angels in the snow … so that you’re stretching your arms. That will stretch out that upper back as well, and while you’re doing that, tucking the chin down to lengthen the back of the neck.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;For strength, Straker also suggests exercises that involve lifting the head and neck against gravity, such as swimming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Any ongoing pain, the experts say, should be assessed by a health professional.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="8a6b8734-91d1-4e25-95b9-0e20dff67be4" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.CalloutBlockElementV2" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="CalloutBlockComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"callout":{"description":"&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;nbsp;What health trend&amp;amp;nbsp;do you want examined?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;","prompt":"Share your experience","displayOnSensitive":true,"elementId":"8a6b8734-91d1-4e25-95b9-0e20dff67be4","title":"Share your experience","isNonCollapsible":false,"formFields":[{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.CalloutFormFieldBase","name":"what_is_your_namepseudonym","id":"172730135","hideLabel":false,"label":"What is your name/pseudonym?","hidden":false,"type":"text","required":false},{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.CalloutFormFieldBase","name":"what_news_story_or_health_information_being_shared_on_social_media_have_you_seen_that_youd_like_us_to_examine","id":"172730137","hideLabel":false,"label":"What news story or health information being shared on social media have you seen that you’d like us to examine","hidden":false,"type":"textarea","required":true},{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.CalloutFormFieldBase","name":"do_you_have_a_link_to_an_example_you_can_share","id":"173258657","hideLabel":false,"label":"Do you have a link to an example you can share?","hidden":false,"type":"text","required":false},{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.CalloutFormFieldRadio","name":"can_we_publish_your_response","options":[{"label":"Yes, entirely","value":"Yes, entirely"},{"label":"Yes, but contact me first","value":"Yes, but contact me first"},{"label":"Yes, but please keep me anonymous","value":"Yes, but please keep me anonymous"},{"label":"No, this is information only","value":"No, this is information only"}],"id":"172730143","hideLabel":false,"label":"Can we publish your response?","hidden":false,"type":"radio","required":true},{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.CalloutFormFieldBase","name":"email_address","description":"Your contact details are helpful so we can contact you for more information.

High levels of cortisol, the body’s primary stress hormone, can linger longer and interfere with memory and decision-making. Here’s a fact: It’s not a decline, it’s a signal. A signal to be more intentional about brain health.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="mt10 mb10 htEchoArticlePromo"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="predictorShow mb20" data-vars-predictor="true" data-vars-quiz="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="quizShow mb20" data-vars-minimized="false" data-vars-predictor="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ankita Kaul shared five daily habits that can improve brain performance:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;1. Practice daily mindfulness and reading:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deep breathing, meditation, and reading books or articles help reduce stress hormones, calms the nervous system, and improves mental focus.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;2. Prioritise quality sleep:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sleep is the brain’s repair mode. It consolidates memories, clears toxins, and refreshes your ability to concentrate and make decisions. &lt;strong&gt;Also read | &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/fitness-coach-shares-10-healthy-habits-to-know-in-your-20s-sitting-for-too-long-wrecks-your-body-to-walking-10000-steps-101744772593164.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="Fitness coach shares 10 healthy habits to know in your 20s: Sitting for too long wrecks your body to walking 10000 steps"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fitness coach shares 10 healthy habits to know in your 20s: Sitting for too long wrecks your body to walking 10000 steps&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="inlineIMG"&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;img data-src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/04/18/original/skin_sleep_1744979694687.jpg" class="lazy" src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/550x309.jpg" alt="Sleep helps in rejuvenating the body.(Shutterstock)" title="Sleep helps in rejuvenating the body.(Shutterstock)"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;Sleep helps in rejuvenating the body.(Shutterstock)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;3. Move your body:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regular physical activity boosts blood flow to the brain and increases BDNF. a protein that enhances learning, memory, and brain plasticity.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;4. Feed your brain right:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Incorporate brain-boosting foods like walnuts, berries, dark chocolate, leafy greens, and omega-3-rich seeds. What you eat directly affects how you think and feel.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;5. Acceptance:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We all have visualised our life a certain way and it’s not turning out to be, but we cannot harm ourselves emotionally by thinking everyday about our situations. We need to accept what life has given to us and make the most of our resources around.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Be more conscious and take care for your mind. Because the smartest thing you can do for your brain is to start giving it what it really needs daily. Remember to take control of your mind than the mind controlling you,” said the wellness coach. &lt;strong&gt;Also read | &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/selfcare-and-wellness-11-small-healthy-habits-to-boost-your-overall-wellbeing-101714738031992.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="Self-care and wellness: 11 small healthy habits to boost your overall well-being"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Self-care and wellness: 11 small healthy habits to boost your overall well-being&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This article is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'In this study, we report the generation of fertile androgenetic mice,' the Chinese experts say in their paper, published in the journal &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.2425307122"&gt;PNAS&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Our findings, together with previous achievements of uniparental reproduction in mammals, support previous speculation that genomic imprinting is the fundamental barrier to the full-term development of uniparental mammalian embryos.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts caution that we are not ready to start such experiments in humans, which could be deeply unethical. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Christophe Galichet, research operations manager at the Sainsbury Wellcome Centre in London, points out that the success rate of the experiments was very low. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Of 259 mice embryos that were transferred to female mice, just two survived, grew to adulthood and then fathered their own offspring. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This research on generating offspring from same-sex parents is promising,' Galichet, who was not involved with the experiments, told &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2485396-mice-with-two-fathers-have-their-own-offspring-for-the-first-time/"&gt;New Scientist&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'[But] it is unthinkable to translate it to humans due to the large number of eggs required, the high number of surrogate women needed and the low success rate.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Today, gay couples who want to have children usually rely on a surrogate mother or father to bring a child into the world. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Today, gay couples who want to have children usually rely on a surrogate mother

it? &lt;/h3&gt; &lt;div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"&gt; &lt;ol class="mol-bullets-with-font"&gt;&lt;li class=""&gt;Experts took sperm from two male mice and injected it into an immature egg cell with its genetic material removed (known as enucleation)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=""&gt;Gene editing was then used to reprogram seven parts of the sperm DNA to allow an embryo to develop&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=""&gt;The embryo, featuring the genetic material from two fathers, was transferred to a female womb and allowed to grow to term &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=""&gt;The offspring grew to adulthood and became a parent after mating with a member of the opposite sex &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=""&gt;These offspring appeared normal in terms of size, weight, appearance&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Unlike with a pair of heterosexual parents, this means that one of the couple is not actually related to the child. So it's long been a dream for gay couples to raise a child who has genetic material from both fathers (or both mothers). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Back in 2023, researchers revealed they'd been able to &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-11837591/Scientists-create-mice-TWO-biological-fathers.html"&gt;create mice from two biological fathers for the first time&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Because mice are actually genetically very similar to us, the promising results hinted the feat could be replicable in humans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But even if a human child could be birthed from two fathers, it potentially threw a huge ethical quandary into the mix: What if that human child is not able to have children of their own through normal conception when they reach adulthood?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Fortunately, these new experiments suggest this might not be an issue.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The human related to both of his or her fathers would grow up and be able to have a family of their own, the results suggest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;During heterosexual reproduction, genetic material from a male carried by the sperm combines with genetic material from a female contained in the egg, or ovum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When this happens, a group of genes called 'homologous chromosomes' from the mother come together with those from the father and combine in a process called 'crossing over'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A gene editing technique was then used to reprogram parts of the sperm DNA to allow an embryo to develop – a process called androgenesis (file photo) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/sciencetech/article-6265453/Hope-gay-couples-want-children-mice-two-MOTHERS-born-China.html"&gt;when both sets of homologous chromosomes come from either two males or two females&lt;/a&gt;, the genes don't copy over properly, leading to 'imprinting abnormalities' and developmental defects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;That's why the researchers had to turn to gene editing, which makes tweaks in the DNA, and target genes responsible for imprinting. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers are also considering this approach in larger animals like monkeys – but the technological hurdles will be significantly larger. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Helen O’Neill, molecular geneticist at the University College London, called the new work a 'major step forward'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It confirms that genomic imprinting is the main barrier to uniparental reproduction in mammals and shows it can be overcome,' she told New Scientist. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Earlier this year, another Chinese team got mice with two fathers to grow to adulthood &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/sciencetech/article-14333227/First-mouse-two-biological-FATHERS-gay-men-children.html"&gt;by editing 20 different genes in their stem cells&lt;/a&gt;, but the rodents weren’t fertile. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="art-ins mol-factbox sciencetech" data-version="2" id="mol-e5371a60-5107-11f0-991e-b313021459ca"

editing?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"&gt; &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Genome editing enables scientists to make changes to DNA, leading to changes in physical traits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists use different technologies to do this. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These technologies act like scissors, cutting the DNA at a specific spot. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Then scientists can remove, add, or replace the DNA where it was cut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The first genome editing technologies were developed in the late 1900s. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;More recently, a new genome editing tool called CRISPR, invented in 2009, has made it easier than ever to edit DNA. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The acronym stands for 'Clustered Regularly Inter-Spaced Palindromic Repeats'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The technique involves a DNA cutting enzyme and a small tag which tells the enzyme where to cut. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;By editing this tag, scientists are able to target the enzyme to specific regions of DNA and make precise cuts, wherever they like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It has been used to 'silence' genes - effectively switching them off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When cellular machinery repairs the DNA break, it removes a small snip of DNA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In this way, researchers can precisely turn off specific genes in the genome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;Source: US National Human Genome Research Institute

itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A leading psychiatrist has revealed his 'guilt' over America's spiraling autism crisis, after his team's work led to an explosion in cases — and fueled the anti-vaccine movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the 1980s, around one in 2,000 children had autism in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But by the turn of the century, this had jumped 13-fold to one in 150 children&lt;span&gt;, in large part due to Dr Allen Frances and his team's updated guidelines for diagnosing autism.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For the first time, doctors began recognizing Asperger's syndrome — a milder condition where patients develop in a typical way in early life but tend to have difficulty with social cues, empathy and forming relationships — as a form of autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2013, building on his team's work, the definition was loosened yet again to include even milder cases, and autism was re-defined as 'autism spectrum disorder'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The result was, according to Dr Frances, that children were 'labeled with a serious condition for challenges that would better be viewed as a variation of the normal'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Today, around one in 31 children have autism spectrum disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Speaking to &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/m002dz62"&gt;the BBC&lt;/a&gt;, Dr Frances said: 'It's a kind of mea culpa — we had good intentions that led to terrible unintended consequences. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Allen Frances, a top psychiatrist, led an update to the guidelines for diagnosing autism in 1994 that loosened the definition to include people with milder symptoms&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I feel very guilty that through our well-meaning but misguided efforts, we've contributed to the anti-vax movement.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Duke University professor added: 'It was absurd [the link between vaccines and autism], I knew the problem was definitional and increased assessment and popularity of diagnosis, not vaccines.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The anti-vaccine movement in America gained traction after a now-debunked 1998 study falsely linked the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) shot to autism. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite overwhelming scientific evidence disproving any connection, the myth spread online and has fueled growing distrust in vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now amplified by Covid pandemic-era skepticism, the movement has led to falling vaccination rates and a resurgence of preventable diseases like measles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The fact autism rates have risen drastically in that time has fueled these concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Frances led the team that updated the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) in 1994, which sets the definition of conditions like autism. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;His team loosened the definition amid requests from child psychiatrists and pediatricians who said the extremely stringent criteria were leaving children with similar symptoms, but milder, without access to health services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Health insurance generally only covers autism treatment — speech therapy and strategies to manage symptoms — for people diagnosed with the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At the time, the team's modeling predictions suggested that loosening the definition would have only a modest impact on diagnostic rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Frances added: 'What we did was introduce something called Asperger's disorder, and that evolved into autism spectrum disorder — which can be ever so much more mild in its presentation and therefore very much more common.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'So this meant that the symptoms of autism as currently used or defined by many clinicians, and certainly self-defined by patients and families, would include many people who have normal social awkwardness, eccentricities, difficulties relating to people that previously would never have been considered a mental disorder.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'But now, because of the loosened definition, because of the fact that school services are tied to having the diagnosis of autism, and perhaps most of all because of the internet popularity of self-diagnosis... we have this enormous increase in rate.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He added in an op-ed in the &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/23/opinion/why-autism-rates-increased.html"&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt; that cases were further skyrocketing because autism spectrum disorder was so difficult to diagnose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'There is no biological test; symptoms vary greatly in nature and severity; clinicians don't always agree; different diagnostic tests may come up with different conclusions; and the diagnosis is not always stable over time,' he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Diagnostic inaccuracy contributes to falsely elevated rates, which can lead to misconceptions that an "epidemic" is occurring.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Junior has vowed to find the cause of spiking autism diagnoses, which he blames on '&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14619009/RFK-Jr-toxins-causing-autism-epidemic.html"&gt;environmental toxins&lt;/a&gt;.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In April, he said he would commission a series of studies into whether mold, pesticides, food chemicals or medicines were raising the risk of developing the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;RFK Jr also raised the possibility that ultrasound scans, used routinely to monitor babies before birth, could be behind the surge. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As well as children, about 5.4million adults, equivalent to about one in 45 people, are now considered to have autism in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts are increasingly raising concerns over autism misdiagnoses, saying some people told they have the condition may instead have something else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt; A &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00406-020-01189-w"&gt;2020 review study&lt;/a&gt; found of those diagnosed with autism 20 percent had anxiety disorders while 11 percent had depressive disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Among famous people who say they have autism is Elon Musk, pictured above last year while attending the Breakthrough Prize Awards in Los Angeles&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, Dr Frances said that autism diagnoses in children should not be viewed as permanent, like they currently are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Diagnoses in kids, particularly, should be written in pencil,' he said, 'because they are so often unreliable and unstable'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Instead, there's a tendency that once a diagnosis is made it gets on medical charts and it's sort of written in stone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It lasts forever and it can haunt someone for the rest of their life who had a misdiagnosis of autism early in their life, and who changed self-expectations and external expectations as a result.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Donald Trump has vowed to 'get to the bottom' of the uptick in autism rates in the US, saying in an interview that there was 'something going on'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He wrote on Truth Social, his social media platform, in March: '20 years ago, autism in children was one in 10,000. NOW IT'S 1 in 34. WOW! Something's really wrong. We need BOBBY!!! Thank You! DJT.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Tue, 24 Jun 2025 15:06:19 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikwFBVV95cUxNV0pvNVlaaVl2QnBVR2c1Rkx1YjdrVzl2cXAweWZxMDY0bGZWY0JxXy1vZlgyNGtmb1Y2TkYwY0g0OWNfaDZuLVBvdUZfUU1xLWNCVExxb09EeWY1Nkd3dUpfc3VybVpmRzZpQUpOd0ZMR1FQV0tnS1lYS2JTUzQ3WmNwN0tZc1lNMk5nTlJyUWF6bzTSAZgBQVVfeXFMTkl1a1BUNVVaTmFuWWp3TVFuLVd6cUp0QVhFWFJoUlRrYmc0ekU0STJuRE9OSnQxaEE1LU9aSVZZMnNDNWctZ2tZM3hHLWNvc0dld3l3X0llZTVEZk01RHU2STlETUZuQ3BSXzRCbVZveHNFZzI5MDd0RkttSm5QekFWdnhQa0hfalBoc3dxRFFraS0tTFBycVY</guid></item><item><title>《Ozempic Might Be a Dementia Buster》- Gizmodo | Ozempic Might Be a Dementia Buster, Too - Gizmodo</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieEFVX3lxTFB0b1ZuN2QyX05Rb1RWZXpZYzZLRWFlRWx0NVpRakxidTgwNlpyNWdjNTg3d1NVc242UUdQUF9TSXNldFM3Tkw2eDFSaC1LRHZ2bDJSdjd0Mk1sOGYtQzlPVGQ5RmVjeG9Dc3NIVGNZNHcxMTMzdklLdg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content prose dark:prose-invert lg:prose-lg lg:leading-[29px] font-serif max-w-none"&gt;
              
              
              &lt;p&gt;Semaglutide, the active ingredient in popular weight loss drugs Ozempic and Wegovy, might also double as a brain booster. Research out today describes a link between semaglutide use and a reduced risk of dementia in people with type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scientists at Case Western Reserve University conducted the study, &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/13872877251351329"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in the Journal of Alzheimer’s Disease. They found that diabetes patients taking semaglutide have a significantly lower risk of dementia than those taking other diabetes medications. The findings should prompt further study into this connection, including clinical trials, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;GLP-1 drugs were first approved to help control blood sugar in people with type 2 diabetes. Newer GLP-1 agents, such as semaglutide, have also proven to be &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/semaglutide-tirzepatide-weight-loss-drugs-future-uses-1851116318"&gt;substantially more effective&lt;/a&gt; at helping people lose weight than diet and exercise alone. Studies are also showing that the health benefits of GLP-1s can extend beyond just weight loss. Study researcher Rong Xu and her team have been looking into some of these potential added benefits. Their past studies have suggested that semaglutide can help temper cravings for &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/dont-look-now-but-ozempic-might-help-you-quit-smoking-too-2000481229"&gt;nicotine&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/could-ozempic-help-reduce-opioid-overdose-risk-2000503728"&gt;opioids&lt;/a&gt;, for instance.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;There is currently no known cure for dementia, as Xu notes. But up to half of all dementia cases might be preventable, and scientists have identified over a dozen modifiable risk factors that contribute to dementia risk, including obesity, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease—all conditions that GLP-1s like semaglutide are known to address. GLP-1s also seem to generally reduce inflammation, yet another contributing factor to dementia.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Given all that, “semaglutide has emerged as a promising candidate” for a preventative treatment that can tackle multiple drivers of dementia risk, Xu told Gizmodo.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers had already &lt;a href="https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/alz.14313"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; a link between semaglutide use and a reduced risk of Alzheimer’s disease, the most common form of dementia. The team, wanting to test its hypothesis with other related dementias, analyzed the medical records of around 1.7 million patients with type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Over a three-year span, they found that people on semaglutide had a noticeably lower risk (around 40% to 50% lower) of developing any Alzheimer’s disease-related dementia than those taking any of seven other diabetes medications, including insulin and metformin. This pattern could be seen among men, women, younger and older patients, and in people with or without obesity. On closer inspection, however, a reduced risk associated with semaglutide was only found with vascular dementia (the second-most common form of dementia), and not with Lewy body dementia or frontotemporal dementia.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“As we and others have previously shown benefit for semaglutide and other GLP-1RA medications in [Alzheimer’s disease], our results support the GLP-1 receptor as a target for dementia prevention,” they wrote in their paper.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These findings aren’t definitive, however, and can only show a correlation between semaglutide and lower dementia risk. That said, there’s been a lot of evidence— much of it encouraging—to warrant clinical trials that could truly show a causal effect, the researchers say. Indeed, Novo Nordisk, the developers of Ozempic and Wegovy, are currently conducting &lt;a href="https://www.alzint.org/about-us/funders/corporate-partner-novo-nordisk/"&gt;two large-scale trials&lt;/a&gt; testing semaglutide for Alzheimer’s (both are expected to finish as early as this year). Xu and her team also next plan to study whether tirzepatide and other emerging, potentially more effective GLP-1 drugs can provide an even greater buffer against dementia.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

							&lt;p data-start="223" data-end="258"&gt;Some people just seem to defy time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="260" data-end="584"&gt;You know the type. They’re in their 60s, maybe older, and yet their energy, glow, and overall vibe feel decades younger. It’s not just genetics—though that helps. It’s often the small, consistent choices they make behind the scenes. Especially in the evening, when most people are winding down and giving in to old routines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="586" data-end="842"&gt;Having spent years working in a fast-paced financial world, I saw the effects of stress, sleep deprivation, and burnout up close. And I’ve also spent the last decade learning how people age differently—and why some seem to thrive while others just... fade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="844" data-end="1028"&gt;Turns out, the folks who age the best aren’t relying on expensive serums or cosmetic procedures. They’re quietly practicing a few smart evening habits that support their body and mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1030" data-end="1051"&gt;Here are six of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="1053" data-end="1100"&gt;1. They protect their sleep like it’s sacred&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1102" data-end="1209"&gt;If there’s one habit almost every youthful older adult has in common, it’s this: they take sleep seriously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1211" data-end="1391"&gt;They’re not doom-scrolling on their phones at midnight or falling asleep in front of the TV. They have wind-down routines that help them signal to their bodies that rest is coming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1393" data-end="1586"&gt;And this matters. According to Dr. Matthew Walker, neuroscientist and author of &lt;em data-start="1473" data-end="1487"&gt;Why We Sleep&lt;/em&gt;, “Sleep is the single most effective thing we can do to &lt;a href="https://www.cogneurosociety.org/going-deep-sleep-matthew-walker/?.com"&gt;reset our brain&lt;/a&gt; and body health each day.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1588" data-end="1848"&gt;When I asked a 67-year-old yoga instructor how she keeps her skin glowing, her answer wasn’t “vitamin C serum.” It was: “I’m in bed by 9:30 and up by sunrise.” No shame in being an early bird if it means your cells are getting the time they need to regenerate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1850" data-end="1981"&gt;Sleep helps repair the skin, regulate hormones, and reduce inflammation—three of the biggest players in how young (or not) we look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="1983" data-end="2011"&gt;2. They actually &lt;em data-start="2003" data-end="2011"&gt;unplug&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2013" data-end="2059"&gt;This one’s tough for most of us, including me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2061" data-end="2310"&gt;But the people who seem ageless have figured out the power of digital boundaries. They know that constant input—news, texts, emails, alerts—doesn’t help them wind down. It jacks up their nervous systems and steals time from things that restore them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2312" data-end="2536"&gt;Instead, they create tech-free pockets in the evening. Maybe it’s 30 minutes before bed. Maybe it’s an entire hour. But during that time, their phones are off, the laptop is closed, and their minds are given space to settle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2538" data-end="2745"&gt;This habit helps reduce mental clutter and sleep-disrupting blue light exposure. But more than that, it’s a way of reclaiming control. They’re not being pulled around by their devices—they’re choosing peace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="2747" data-end="2790"&gt;3. They stretch, breathe, or move gently&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2792" data-end="2859"&gt;There’s something so underrated about low-impact movement at night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2861" data-end="2972"&gt;It’s not about torching calories. It’s about releasing tension from the day so it doesn’t accumulate over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2974" data-end="3287"&gt;I had an older neighbor years ago who looked easily 15 years younger than her age. Every evening, she’d spend ten minutes doing light yoga and breathwork on her patio. Nothing fancy—just basic stretches and long, slow exhales. When I asked her about it, she said, “I’d rather stretch today than stiffen tomorrow.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3289" data-end="3503"&gt;As noted by Harvard Health, “stretching &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/exercise-and-fitness/take-time-to-stretch?.com"&gt;increases blood flow to muscles&lt;/a&gt; and joints, which helps improve flexibility and posture over time.” And posture, by the way, is a huge factor in how youthful someone appears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3505" data-end="3668"&gt;Gentle evening movement keeps the body supple and supports restful sleep. It’s also a form of mindfulness, which reduces stress—another major contributor to aging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="3670" data-end="3711"&gt;4. They don’t eat too close to bedtime&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3713" data-end="3804"&gt;This isn’t about being overly strict or skipping dinner altogether. It’s more about timing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3806" data-end="4056"&gt;People who age gracefully tend to give their bodies a break at night. They stop eating a couple hours before bed—not because it’s trendy, but because they’ve noticed how heavy meals late at night mess with their digestion, sleep, and even their skin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4058" data-end="4244"&gt;According to registered dietitian Cynthia Sass, “Eating too close to bedtime can&lt;a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/how-long-before-bed-should-you-stop-eating-11679832?.com"&gt; lead to reflux&lt;/a&gt;, bloating, and restless sleep—all of which can affect how you look and feel the next day.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4246" data-end="4473"&gt;The science backs this up. Late-night eating can interfere with the body’s natural repair processes. It can spike blood sugar, promote fat storage, and even mess with collagen production. Not ideal if you’re trying to age well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4475" data-end="4578"&gt;A light, nourishing dinner—and time to digest it—gives the body a chance to focus on healing overnight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="4580" data-end="4643"&gt;5. They process their emotions instead of stuffing them down&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4645" data-end="4700"&gt;This one surprised me when I first started noticing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4702" data-end="4863"&gt;The people who stay vibrant into old age aren’t just physically healthy. They’re emotionally agile. And many of them use the evening to check in with themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4865" data-end="4977"&gt;They journal. They meditate. They talk to someone they trust. Or they just sit quietly and reflect on their day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4979" data-end="5140"&gt;What they &lt;em data-start="4989" data-end="4996"&gt;don’t&lt;/em&gt; do is suppress everything they feel. Because that stuff doesn’t disappear. It just shows up later—in tension, in poor sleep, in chronic stress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5142" data-end="5244"&gt;As therapist Lori Gottlieb has said, “Avoidance is a short-term strategy with long-term consequences.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5246" data-end="5474"&gt;Making space to feel your feelings in the evening isn’t always comfortable, but it’s powerful. It keeps your nervous system regulated and your body out of fight-or-flight mode. And a calm body is a healthier, more resilient one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5476" data-end="5663"&gt;I’ve started keeping a small notebook by my bed. Just a few lines before sleep: What went well today? What do I need to let go of? I’ve found it helps me sleep deeper—and wake up clearer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="5665" data-end="5730"&gt;6. They treat evenings as a time to &lt;em data-start="5704" data-end="5713"&gt;nourish&lt;/em&gt;, not just escape&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5732" data-end="5865"&gt;A lot of people think of the evening as a reward system: You got through the day, now you get to zone out with wine and TV until bed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5867" data-end="6049"&gt;There’s nothing wrong with a glass of wine or a good show now and then. But the people who stay youthful long-term don’t just check out every night. They use that time intentionally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6051" data-end="6214"&gt;They read something inspiring. They call someone they love. They listen to music or do something creative. It’s not about productivity—it’s about feeding the soul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6216" data-end="6378"&gt;One woman I interviewed—a 72-year-old painter who looked closer to 50—said something that stuck with me: “Evenings are sacred. That’s when I come back to myself.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6380" data-end="6474"&gt;That mindset changes everything. It turns the evening into a time of reconnection, not escape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="6481" data-end="6499"&gt;Final thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6501" data-end="6603"&gt;Here’s the truth: aging is inevitable, but how you age is deeply influenced by what you do day to day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6605" data-end="6624"&gt;And night to night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6626" data-end="6803"&gt;If you want to stay sharp, energetic, and yes, even youthful into your 60s and beyond—it’s the small evening habits that stack up over time. Not miracle creams. Not crash diets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6805" data-end="6882"&gt;Just real choices, made repeatedly, that support your body, mind, and spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6884" data-end="7011"&gt;You don’t have to overhaul everything tonight. Just pick one habit that resonates and try it for a week. Then build from there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7013" data-end="7093" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node=""&gt;The glow? That comes from the inside out. And it’s earned one evening at a time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Protein promotes satiety and helps build muscle, antibodies and hormones.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For extra protein, a dietitian leans on quick, convenient, high-protein drinks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Some of her favorites are skim milk, bone broth, and yogurt and kefir smoothies.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As a dietitian, I know how important protein is for building muscle and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/2053490/high-protein-flat-belly-diet-meal-plan/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;promoting satiety&lt;/a&gt;. Peek inside my fridge, and you’ll spot an entire lineup of high-protein beverages. I rely on them for everything from smoothies and dressings to soups (not to mention sipping from a glass or even straight from the container). They’re also essential on hectic days when meals and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7938635/best-foods-to-eat-when-youre-exercising-more-according-to-dietitians/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;post-workout recovery fuel&lt;/a&gt; get pushed to the bottom of my to-do list.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To avoid turning a bag of pretzels into lunch, I always recommend keeping a few drinkable high-protein picks on hand. Curious to hear what I’ve got stocked? Keep reading to discover my favorite high-protein sips.

&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Chobani nonfat plain Greek yogurt is a core staple in my fridge. It’s my daily go-to for &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/ways-to-add-10-grams-of-protein-to-your-meals-11715637" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;bumping up the protein&lt;/a&gt; in breakfast bowls, whether I’m having chia pudding, a fruit parfait or a smoothie bowl. I also love to whip it into salad dressings, marinades and soups. So, I was thrilled to spot their new line of &lt;a href="https://www.chobani.com/products/drinks/high-protein-drinks/mango-30g" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Chobani High-Protein Greek Yogurt Drinks&lt;/a&gt; during a recent grocery run. They make fueling my morning yogurt habit even easier. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; These protein-packed drinks come in three different protein levels, with 15, 20 or a whopping 30 grams of protein per serving. But the best part? There are no added sugars or protein powders. You will find low-fat Greek yogurt and real fruit. Instead of added sugars, there are some stevia and monk fruit extracts for a touch of sweetness. With at least 15% of the Daily Value of calcium per bottle, they’re great for your bones. They’re also an excellent source of vitamin B12—hello, energy! Plus, they provide a boost of &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-probiotic-drinks-8727164" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;gut-friendly probiotics&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Tangy, creamy and packed with billions of probiotics, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7664397/what-is-kefir/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;kefir is a fermented milk drink&lt;/a&gt; that has been one of my lifelong staples. As a creature of habit, I always toss a bottle of plain Lifeway Kefir into my shopping cart. But when their new line of &lt;a href="https://lifewaykefir.com/products/lowfat-matcha-latte-probiotic-smoothie-collagen/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Lifeway Kefir Probiotic Smoothie + Collagen&lt;/a&gt; hit shelves, I had to give it a try.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This twist on their classic kefir delivers an extra protein boost (13 grams per cup) thanks to added collagen. Collagen is a protein that may &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/nutrients-for-better-skin-health-8410425" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;support healthy skin&lt;/a&gt;, making it a popular addition to many beauty routines.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; It may also promote &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/the-6-best-foods-for-joint-health-8691833" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;joint and bone health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Like yogurt, kefir is rich in gut-friendly probiotics that can support digestion, immunity and more.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; It’s also an excellent source of &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/calcium-benefits-8649279" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;bone-building calcium&lt;/a&gt; and is fortified with vitamin A.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It comes in fun flavors like Matcha Latte (my personal fave!), Berry Blast, Tropical Fruit and Plain (perfect for savory recipes). Sip it straight, whip it into a smoothie or swirl it into chilled soups like gazpacho for a creamy, probiotic, protein-packed twist. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Sometimes, you just crave something warm and savory. That’s where &lt;a href="https://www.campbells.com/swanson/products/sipping-bone-broth/swanson-sipping-chicken/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Swanson Sipping Chicken Bone Broth Cup&lt;/a&gt; comes in. Whether you’re fighting the sniffles or are depleted after a sweaty workout, bone broth is a soothing, low-calorie way to replenish. &lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Each ready-to-drink cup contains 10 grams of protein and is also naturally rich in potassium and collagen. It’s made with real, whole-food ingredients, including chicken bone broth, veggies and herbs. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It also comes in a convenient, single-serve 10.75-ounce cup. So, it’s perfect when you’re on the go, at the office or just not in the mood to dirty up a bowl. While this version is made for sipping, it’s just as versatile in the kitchen. Use it in soups, stews, chili or even grains for an added protein and flavor boost.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Each serving contains 460 mg of sodium, so if you’re watching your sodium, keep serving sizes small (think half a container rather than the whole thing).

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As a frequent traveler, I know how tough it can be to get in all your fruits and veggies when you’re on the road. That’s why I often grab &lt;a href="https://www.nakedsmoothie.com/our-products/functional/double-berry-protein" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Naked Protein Smoothies&lt;/a&gt;. They’re readily available at airport terminals or rest stops. Plus, their vibrant colors make them easy to spot. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; One of my favorites is the Double Berry flavor. It offers 20 grams of protein per bottle, plus the nutrition of apple, banana, strawberry and blueberry juices and purees. This smoothie also contains 4 grams of digestion-supporting fiber, 10% of your daily potassium and three times the DV for vitamin C. With zero added sugars, all of its natural sweetness comes from fruit. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; However, with 310 calories per bottle, it may be best to use this smoothie as an on-the-go meal replacement when rushing to an early-morning flight or post-workout. But if you need extra calories, you can always pair it with a salad, soup and sandwich for a balanced meal. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_52-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Milk is also rich in important nutrients like calcium, potassium, iodine, phosphorus, B vitamins and more. I love that it’s made with just one main ingredient: milk (it also contains added vitamins A and D to prevent nutrient deficiencies). That’s it. No added sugars, syrups, salt, thickeners or fillers.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_59-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Not all &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7964007/best-protein-shakes-protein-powders/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;protein drinks are created equal&lt;/a&gt;. Some are packed with added sugars, while others may have hidden preservatives or additives. While these drinks can be a super-convenient and portable source of nutrition, they shouldn’t replace whole foods like fruits, veggies, whole grains or lean proteins in your diet. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_60-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_61-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Here’s what to keep in mind when picking one out:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_62-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_63-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Protein Content: &lt;/strong&gt;The amount of protein you need depends on several factors, such as your age, sex, activity level and overall diet. If you’re active or don’t get enough protein at meals, you may benefit from a drink with 30 grams of protein. But if you only need a snack, one with 10 to 12 grams may do the trick.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Added Sugars: &lt;/strong&gt;When checking labels, it’s easy to zero in on total sugars. But added sugars are much more important. For instance, dairy-based drinks contain naturally occurring sugars like lactose, which can make the total sugar count look high. However, these naturally occurring sugars are nothing to worry about. What you want to watch out for are added sweeteners like cane sugar, corn syrup and even honey, which offer no nutritional value.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Serving Size: &lt;/strong&gt;It’s easy to assume an entire bottle is a single serving. Yet, some drinks pack two or more servings in a single container, bottle or can. If you’re not reading the label closely, you could end up consuming double (or more!) the calories, sugar and—in some cases—fat than you planned. So, be sure to check the serving size.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_64-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-our-expert-take"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_65-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Our Expert Take &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_66-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As a dietitian, I lean heavily on high-protein drinks. My favorites include Chobani High-Protein Greek Yogurt Drink, Lifeway Kefir Probiotic Smoothie + Collagen, Swanson Sipping Chicken Bone Broth, Naked Protein Smoothies and classic skim milk. Considering the wealth of options on store shelves, finding a nutritious, high-protein drink can seem daunting. To make it easy, look at the protein content, added sugars and the serving size. As helpful as these drinks can be for giving you the protein you need, think of them as an addition to—rather than a replacement for—real whole foods. Then, load your fridge for quick, convenient, high-protein sipping!&lt;br&gt;

Scientists have now identified how our cells grab it, opening new paths for research on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/first-map-of-the-brains-mitochondria-may-explain-cognitive-decline/"&gt;memory&lt;/a&gt;, learning, and cancer resistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work centers on queuosine, a vitamin‑like micronutrient we must borrow from food or friendly gut bacteria. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A reseearch team led by Valérie de Crécy‑Lagard of the &lt;a href="https://www.ufl.edu/"&gt;University of Florida&lt;/a&gt; traced the entry point of queuosine into the cell, the transporter gene SLC35F2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-is-queuosine"&gt;What is queuosine?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Queuosine is not built into proteins or DNA. Instead, it slots into transfer RNA (&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39600051/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;tRNA&lt;/a&gt;), the molecular interpreters that read genetic &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/action-observation-network-human-brain-perception-see-what-we-expect-to-see-mind-eye/"&gt;codes&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By modifying the wobble position of tRNAs for histidine, tyrosine, aspartate, and asparagine, queuosine helps ribosomes choose the correct amino acid more quickly and accurately. That fine‑tuning keeps translation errors and oxidative stress in check.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Laboratory &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-83451-y" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; show that supplementing queuosine reverses translation chaos and steadies protein production in stressed cells. Because humans cannot manufacture queuosine, diet and microbes must deliver a steady supply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-nutrient-and-cancer-connection"&gt;Nutrient and cancer connection&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experiments from the &lt;a href="https://www.dkfz.de/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;German Cancer Research Center&lt;/a&gt; uncovered a curious twist. Removing tRNA queuosine weakened context‑based memory in female mice but left males mostly unscathed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The result hints that queuosine’s control over translation interacts with hormone‑sensitive neural &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/your-brain-literally-changes-based-on-daily-activities-and-lifestyle/"&gt;circuits&lt;/a&gt;. Cancer biologists track the nutrient for another reason.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tumor tissues often show steep drops in queuosine modification, a change that encourages the rapid, glycolysis‑heavy metabolism called the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7146442/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Warburg effect&lt;/a&gt;. In cultured cells, adding the precursor queuine slows growth in colon, liver, and breast cancer lines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-queuosine-gets-in"&gt;How queuosine gets in&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For over 30 years, scientists have suspected that there had to be a transporter for this nutrient, but no one could find it. We’ve been hunting for it for a long time,” said de Crécy-Lagard. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hints about a queuosine gateway surfaced in the early 1990s when growth‑factor stimulation boosted uptake. Screens of known solute carrier proteins drew blanks, sending researchers back to the drawing board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The investigators ran cross‑species genomics and &lt;a href="https://www.genome.gov/genetics-glossary/CRISPR" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;CRISPR&lt;/a&gt; knockouts in &lt;a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/henrietta-lacks/importance-of-hela-cells" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;human HeLa cells&lt;/a&gt;. Only one gene, SLC35F2, consistently blocked uptake when deleted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-confirming-the-nutrient-s-pathway"&gt;Confirming the nutrient’s pathway&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Restoring SLC35F2 rescued transport, confirming it as the primary, high‑affinity channel for queuosine and its nucleobase form, queuine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Radiolabeled assays measured a Michaelis constant of 174 nanomoles, and competing nucleosides failed to displace queuosine from the transporter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fluorescence imaging placed SLC35F2 on the plasma membrane and inside the &lt;a href="https://www.genome.gov/genetics-glossary/golgi-body" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Golgi&lt;/a&gt;, a hint that queuosine may cycle through secretory routes before reaching cytosolic tRNA pools. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also revealed a second, low‑affinity pathway that kicks in when dietary levels spike.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We don’t think we could have cracked it without the full team,” said Vincent Kelly of &lt;a href="https://www.tcd.ie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Trinity College Dublin&lt;/a&gt;, joint senior author and professor of biochemistry and immunology, highlighting the collaborative push.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-implications-for-brain-health"&gt;Implications for brain health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neurons fire thousands of times per second, and any slowdown in protein synthesis can scramble that rhythm. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In mice lacking tRNA queuosine, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/B9780128131466000059" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;hippocampal neurons&lt;/a&gt; mis‑translate codons, depressing long‑term potentiation, a cellular marker of learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Restoring dietary queuine fixed the translation lag and improved maze performance within days. With SLC35F2 in hand, neuroscientists can now ask whether genetic &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/human-brains-use-storage-trick-to-keep-your-memories-in-sequential-order/"&gt;variants&lt;/a&gt; of the transporter align with neurodevelopmental disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public databases list rare point mutations in SLC35F2 in fewer than one percent of the population. Their functional impact remains untested, but the data set gives clinicians a starting point for genotype‑phenotype studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-could-this-nutrient-help-fight-cancer"&gt;Could this nutrient help fight cancer?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;SLC35F2 carries an intriguing label as an oncogene. High expression predicts poor prognosis in some &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/4365-leukemia" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;leukemias&lt;/a&gt; and solid tumors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers once assumed the protein simply imported chemotherapy drugs. Yet new data suggest that tumors may hijack SLC35F2 to starve cells of queuosine and rewire translation. Therapies could exploit the system in two ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Selective inhibitors might deprive cancer cells of the nutrient, pushing their error‑prone translation machinery past a lethal threshold. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, stabilized queuosine analogs could flood normal tissues that preserve SLC35F2, tamping down oxidative stress and inflammation. Early animal trials are already underway at several labs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-dietary-sources-of-queuosine"&gt;Dietary sources of queuosine &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Queuosine comes mainly from meat, dairy, and fermented foods, while some gut bacteria, especially members of the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/immunology-and-microbiology/bacteroides" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bacteroides&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; genus, synthesize it from scratch. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vegans often show slightly lower circulating levels than omnivores, though the difference disappears when microbial producers are abundant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Antibiotic courses can wipe out those producers for weeks. &lt;a href="https://www.tcd.ie/medicine/psychiatry/research/neuropsychiatric-genetics-research-group/study-volunteers-needed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Researchers&lt;/a&gt; in Ireland are now tracking whether short‑term queuosine drops after antibiotics correlate with slower reaction times or mood changes in healthy volunteers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-cancer-drug-rides-along"&gt;Cancer drug rides along&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;SLC35F2 already had a reputation in oncology circles because it escorts the experimental anticancer drug &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7281096/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;YM155&lt;/a&gt; into cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Knowing that the protein’s day job is moving queuosine gives pharmacologists a fresh angle: they can tweak YM155’s structure to ride the same pathway more efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conversely, blocking SLC35F2 might protect healthy neurons during chemotherapy by keeping YM155 out while allowing other nucleosides through alternative transporters. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That strategy would echo the way cardiologists use dexrazoxane to shield the heart from doxorubicin, targeting transporter specificity rather than the drug itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-gut-microbes-and-queuosine-boost-health"&gt;Gut microbes and queuosine boost health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The discovery also tightens the link between diet, microbes, and host gene expression. If intestinal bacteria ramp up queuosine output, plasma levels rise, SLC35F2 activity increases, and translation fidelity improves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Better fidelity reduces misfolded proteins that would otherwise inflame the gut, creating a positive feedback loop. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disrupt the loop with a high‑fat, low‑fiber &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/mixed-diets-offer-health-benefits-and-lower-carbon-footprint/"&gt;diet&lt;/a&gt;, and queuosine production plummets. Misfolded proteins accumulate, triggering oxidative stress that further damages the gut barrier. Restoring queuosine, through supplements or fermented foods, could break the cycle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-future-research-directions"&gt;Future research directions &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team wants to chart how queuosine levels rise and fall across organs and over the human lifespan. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;High‑throughput mass spectrometry, paired with SLC35F2 genotyping, should reveal whether deficiencies track with cognitive decline or chemotherapy resistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This discovery opens up a whole new chapter in understanding how the microbiome and our diet can influence the translation of our genes,” said Kelly. Diagnostic kits could follow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A simple blood test measuring queuosine might guide personalized nutrition plans, especially for patients with gut dysbiosis or limited dietary variety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2425364122" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 24 Jun 2025 13:40:05 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikAFBVV95cUxPWl9xSE1CMUU0aFRuZ3lLSzFoS1ZLX3hlZW85QzA2NFlmLS1Wb1FhRGpfN0dMTjdVZlhJazhUYjUyNHRkT1pGejFEdVpvcXhjU1FEdjBuU1UyVDNfcWlyWmNTYnR0U1BGVEtpaVlLQTdCdFJBY1BhZGxtbXc1SjE1YmN4ZXVTX0pxYjd3WHlDRVo</guid></item><item><title>维生素D使乳腺癌治疗成功率提高79% ，研究表明- SciTechDaily | Vitamin D Boosts Breast Cancer Treatment Success by 79%, Study Shows - SciTechDaily</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilwFBVV95cUxPcjZjRTBnRENCQV9xS291SDNSSGFvWUx3Zzh0VWRaeGN0Y0hxSmN5a1d5bWs1aEJqelFFMTMzSVhqZUQ0VHlwaVh4a0JsbnljYWo2YTNuVWxEc3hONmtteFFYUmgydlhBcWdZQjFZelJCWHdLeXk2OG05R2JsTEJFNm5MX2p0TmNHcWJsZk1IejNNSTR3SlJN?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SciTechDaily</author><pubDate>Tue, 24 Jun 2025 13:30:36 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilwFBVV95cUxPcjZjRTBnRENCQV9xS291SDNSSGFvWUx3Zzh0VWRaeGN0Y0hxSmN5a1d5bWs1aEJqelFFMTMzSVhqZUQ0VHlwaVh4a0JsbnljYWo2YTNuVWxEc3hONmtteFFYUmgydlhBcWdZQjFZelJCWHdLeXk2OG05R2JsTEJFNm5MX2p0TmNHcWJsZk1IejNNSTR3SlJN</guid></item><item><title>高镁零食可以减轻睡前焦虑-健康文摘 | A Snack High In Magnesium Can Reduce Anxiety Before Going To Bed - Health Digest</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirAFBVV95cUxNNk9XaVVnYmtsemJla0dWdGYyaXJ3WVV5RGhPU0JkYjI2WWhhWE9xOWhuV1h1UWNCNWktanQ5T3FtclJvTXlEOUJ5NDBhU0VaaUl2anZSa2wzNVE2TGxvZDJ0ZHBXSmlSUkdBLVRBS3ZEdWlYck42NFlFb1JCeUpPZ2NqdGxTOUlJS2VDc0kzczJCWUdEVmZqdmdPaGRSTHIxRGVKOGF2UHQza3lX?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="content" class="article"&gt;

&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Trying to get high-quality sleep when you're anxious can be a nightmare. The more wound up you are, the more your mind refuses to shut off. Sure, you can try some &lt;a href="https://www.healthdigest.com/671718/15-things-you-can-do-to-reduce-anxiety/" target="_blank"&gt;tips to reduce your anxiety&lt;/a&gt;, but they might not work. That's when you may need to turn to your pantry for some magnesium-rich snacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;You may have heard of the relationship between magnesium and anxiety before, particularly if you've been following the buzz around this mineral on social media. Truly, magnesium keeps popping up on TikTok as a remedy for bowel issues, tight muscles, and a host of other complaints. While research is thin on some magnesium claims, several studies point to its potential (albeit sometimes indirect) benefits for anxious sleepers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, a &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/12/12/3672" target="_blank"&gt;2020 article&lt;/a&gt; in Nutrients discussed the complex relationship between magnesium deficiency and stress. The authors highlighted a feedback loop: Psychological or physical stress increases magnesium excretion, which can lower the body's magnesium levels. In turn, this deficiency may heighten the body's stress response. The article recommended further research into whether increasing magnesium intake could help mitigate stress-related health risks.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;In an interview for the &lt;a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/magnesium-for-anxiety" target="_blank"&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt; on the connection between magnesium and anxiety, psychiatrist Dr. Joseph Austerman spoke about cortisol and its possible connection with magnesium. "Cortisol is very important for acute stress, but in times of chronic stress, it can actually worsen depression and anxiety," he said. Since magnesium may reduce cortisol, it may also reduce anxiety. And that would support another comment from Dr. Austerman, who said that "we've seen that when you give magnesium to people, especially with mild anxiety, they tend to get better."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another expert, licensed clinical psychologist Shelby Harris, had similar comments about magnesium. In a &lt;a href="https://www.webmd.com/sleep-disorders/features/magnesium-glycinate-sleep" target="_blank"&gt;WebMD&lt;/a&gt; piece, Harris noted, "Magnesium helps your brain calm down and relaxes your muscles, which could help you sleep better by supporting your body's natural sleep patterns." However, she added that despite anecdotal evidence showing that some people with anxiety &lt;a href="https://www.healthdigest.com/1083570/what-does-it-mean-to-get-quality-sleep/" target="_blank"&gt;experience better quality sleep&lt;/a&gt; after consuming magnesium, it doesn't work for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Whether you decide to try magnesium before hitting the sack is up to you and your doctor. But if you do, you don't necessarily have to spend money on magnesium supplements. You could always go the food route and fuel up on &lt;a href="https://www.healthdigest.com/726183/foods-you-should-eat-if-you-need-more-magnesium/" target="_blank"&gt;magnesium-rich foods&lt;/a&gt; before bed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Figuring out which magnesium-heavy snack to eat is the fun part. Plenty of healthy food options have an abundance of magnesium — and they taste good enough to make you feel like you're getting a genuinely lip-smacking treat rather than an anxiety treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;According to a magnesium fact sheet offered by the &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Magnesium-HealthProfessional/" target="_blank"&gt;National Institutes of Health Office of Dietary Supplements&lt;/a&gt;, some top food choices include nuts and nut butters, pumpkin seeds, bananas, oats, plain yogurt, and raisins. With those ingredients alone, you could mix and match your way to a week's worth of magnesium-filled snacks, such as this homespun Crunchy Granola offered by &lt;a href="https://www.tastingtable.com/1064975/homemade-crunchy-granola-recipe/" target="_blank"&gt;Tasting Table&lt;/a&gt;, which nicely combines a few magnesium-dense foods into a munchable form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;There's just one catch: Be certain to keep your bedtime goodies to under 200 calories to avoid overloading your system and overfeeding your body. Remember: The more calories you consume before your head hits the pillow, the more restless your night could be due to active digestion. And you don't want to reduce your anxiety by taking magnesium, only to need an antacid to soothe your upset stomach.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Newborn babies and patients with Alzheimer's disease share an unexpected biological trait: elevated levels of a well-known biomarker for Alzheimer's, as shown in a &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/braincomms/article/7/3/fcaf221/8158110" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; led by researchers at the University of Gothenburg and published in &lt;i&gt;Brain Communications&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;First author Fernando Gonzalez-Ortiz and senior author Professor Kaj Blennow recently reported that both newborns and Alzheimer's patients have elevated blood levels of a protein called phosphorylated tau, specifically a form called p-tau217.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This protein has largely been used as a diagnostic test for Alzheimer's disease, where an increase in p-tau217 blood levels is proposed to be driven by another process, namely the aggregation of b-amyloid protein into amyloid plaques. Newborns (for natural reasons) do not have this type of pathological change, so interestingly, in newborns increased plasma p-tau217 seems to reflect a completely different—and entirely healthy—mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A large international study that involved researchers in Sweden, Spain and Australia analyzed &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/blood+samples/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;blood samples&lt;/a&gt; from more than 400 individuals, including healthy newborns, &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/premature+infants/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;premature infants&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/young+adults/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;young adults&lt;/a&gt;, elderly adults, and people diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. They found that newborn babies had the highest levels of p-tau217—even higher than those found in people with Alzheimer's. These levels were particularly elevated in premature babies and started to decrease over the first few months of life, eventually settling to adult levels.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;h2&gt;First time in the blood of newborns&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous research, largely based on animal models, had hinted at the role of phosphorylated tau in early brain development. This is the first time scientists have directly measured p-tau217 concentrations in the blood of human newborns, opening the door to a much clearer understanding of its developmental role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But here's where it gets fascinating, while in Alzheimer's disease p-tau217 is associated with tau aggregation into harmful clumps called tangles, believed to cause the breakdown of brain cells and subsequent cognitive decline. In contrast, in newborns this surge in tau appears to support healthy brain development, helping neurons grow and to form new connections with other neurons, thereby shaping the structure of the young brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study also revealed that in both healthy and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/premature+babies/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;premature babies&lt;/a&gt;, p-tau217 levels were closely linked to how early they were born. The earlier the birth, the higher the levels of this protein, suggesting a role in supporting rapid brain growth under challenging developmental conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Potential roadmap for new treatments&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's perhaps most compelling about these findings, is the hint that our brains may once have had built-in protection against the damaging effects of tau, so that newborns can tolerate, and even benefit from, high levels of phosphorylated tau without triggering the kinds of damage seen in Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;p&gt;"We believe that understanding how this natural protection works—and why we lose it as we age—could offer a roadmap for new treatments. If we can learn how the newborn brain keeps tau in check, we might one day mimic those processes to slow or stop Alzheimer's in its tracks," says Gonzalez-Ortiz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So while an increase of p-tau217 is a danger signal in older brains, in newborns it might be a vital part of building one. The same molecule, two dramatically different roles—one building the brain, the other marking its decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plasma p-tau217 has recently received FDA approval for use in diagnosing Alzheimer's disease, making it an increasingly important tool in clinical settings. The authors emphasize the need to also understand the mechanism for the increase in p-tau217, especially for interpreting it as an outcome in clinical and epidemiological research and in drug development. This study indicates that amyloid plaques may not be the main driver of increases in p-tau217.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;We know that sitting for long periods of time &lt;a href="1-4-billion-adults-have-high-of-disease-from-not-enough-exercise-say-who" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;isn't good for us&lt;/a&gt;, but just how much exercise is needed to counteract the negative health effects of not escaping our desk all day?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research suggests about 30 to 40 minutes of building up a sweat should do the trick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Committing to a good half our or so of "moderate to vigorous intensity physical activity" at some point each day ought to balance out 10 hours of sitting still, the research says – although any amount of exercise or even &lt;a href="even-2-hours-a-day-of-standing-instead-of-sitting-is-good-for-you-study-suggests" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;just standing up&lt;/a&gt; helps to some extent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's based on a  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/meta-analysis" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73088" data-postid="165293" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt; study published in 2020 analyzing nine previous studies, involving a total of 44,370 people in four different countries who were wearing some form of fitness tracker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watch the video below for a short summary:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analysis found the risk of death among those with a more sedentary lifestyle went up as time spent engaging in moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity went down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In active individuals doing about 30-40 minutes of moderate to vigorous intensity physical activity, the association between high sedentary time and risk of death is not significantly different from those with low amounts of sedentary time," the researchers explained in their &lt;a href="https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/54/24/1499" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Too Much Sitting Can Still Be Harmful Even if You Exercise, Study Warns&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, putting in some reasonably intensive activities – cycling, brisk walking, gardening – can lower your risk of an earlier death right back down to what it would be if you weren't doing all that sitting around, to the extent that this link can be seen in the amassed data of many thousands of people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_151064" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-151064" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/ManSittingAtTable.jpg" alt="Man Sitting At Table" class="wp-image-151064 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/ManSittingAtTable.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/ManSittingAtTable-392x415.jpg 392w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/ManSittingAtTable-600x636.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-151064" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Too much time sitting down isn't good for you, but you might be able to offset the harm.

The &lt;em&gt;British Journal of Sports Medicine&lt;/em&gt; (BHSM) also put out a &lt;a href="https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/54/24" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;special edition&lt;/a&gt; to carry both the study and the revised guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As these guidelines emphasize, all physical activity counts and any amount of it is better than none," &lt;a href="https://www.scimex.org/newsfeed/exercise-can-offset-the-risks-linked-to-sitting-around-all-day" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; physical activity and population health researcher Emmanuel Stamatakis from the University of Sydney in Australia&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"People can still protect their health and offset the harmful effects of physical inactivity."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research based on fitness trackers is broadly in line with the 2020 WHO guidelines, which recommend 150-300 mins of moderate intensity or 75-150 mins of vigorous intensity physical activity every week to counter sedentary behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_132985" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-132985" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/07/OlderPersonLungingIndoors.jpg" alt="Older women in a pink top and black leggings lunging with small weights" class="size-full wp-image-132985" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/07/OlderPersonLungingIndoors.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/07/OlderPersonLungingIndoors-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/07/OlderPersonLungingIndoors-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-132985" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Any amount of exercise is better than none.

As more data gets published, we should learn more about how to stay healthy even if we have to spend extended periods of time at a desk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Although the new guidelines reflect the best available science, there are still some gaps in our knowledge," &lt;a href="https://www.scimex.org/newsfeed/exercise-can-offset-the-risks-linked-to-sitting-around-all-day" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;said Stamatakis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are still not clear, for example, where exactly the bar for 'too much sitting' is.

It develops slowly over several years. In the UK, more than three million people have osteoporosis, with more than 500,000 fragility fractures occurring annually, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/rightcare/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2017/02/rightcare-susans-story-full-narrative.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bone strength and density weaken naturally over time due to hormonal shifts unfolding deeper in the body, making older individuals more susceptible to osteoporosis. Women are also more prone to getting it, due to smaller bone structure and oestrogen loss during menopause. However, it's important to remember that it can also affect men. While genetics and other medical conditions can increase the risk of osteoporosis, there are also ways you can help prevent it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Taking to &lt;a data-content-type="section-topic" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/all-about/viral" rel="Follow" target="_blank"&gt;Instagram &lt;/a&gt;and Bluesky, nutritionist Jessica Barac, who focuses on helping women struggling with menopause, has shared one study that has proven that adding one thing to you diet may help prevent the condition from developing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Worried about osteoporosis? Eat &lt;a data-content-type="section-topic" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/all-about/healthy-eating" rel="Follow" target="_self"&gt;prunes&lt;/a&gt;," she wrote.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;She went on to quote a study &lt;a href="https://www.psu.edu/news/research/story/got-prunes-prunes-may-preserve-bone-density-and-strength-older-women" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;published by Penn State University&lt;/a&gt; in 2024 that suggested that postmenopausal women who ate 4-6 prunes a day maintained their bone strength and density. Meanwhile, those who didn't eat prunes lost both bone strength and density.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Jessica went on to explain: "As oestrogen declines in menopause, bone breakdown speeds up. Over time, that leads to lower density, weaker structure, and higher fracture risk.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"But prunes, rich in polyphenols, appear to blunt the inflammatory pathways that drive bone loss," she added.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5452226/" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt; another study&lt;/a&gt; from 2016, it was found that prunes are an effective food for preventing and reversing bone loss in postmenopausal osteoporosis. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While prunes can help prevent and reduce the loss of bone mass that helps reduce the risk of developing osteoporosis, it won't cure it. However, a person with osteoporosis may wish to add prunes to their diet to help improve their bone health.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To test this, the 2024 study had postmenopausal women divided into groups, with some eating prunes daily and some not. Over the span of 12 months, they were scanned to track and measure bone mass, strength and density.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The results showed that the women who had eaten the prunes preserved bone structure and strength at the tibia, the main weight-bearing bone in your leg. Meanwhile the women who hadn't eaten the prunes lost it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Jessica went on to share three main reasons why this matters in terms of osteoporosis. Her first argument was that cortical bone strength goes hand-in-hand with fracture resistance, meaning you'll be less likely to break or fracture a bone if your bone strength stays healthy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Her second argument was that maintaining the strength of your tibia may help you to stay more mobile as you get older. Moving on to her third and final argument, Jessica said keeping your bones strong and healthy is critical for keeping your strength as you get older.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"You know what else protects your bones?" she added. "Muscle. Movement. And food that supports hormonal change. Eat 4-6 prunes a day."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While eating four to six prunes every day may seem like a lot, she recommends mixing them into some Greek yoghurt, blending them into a smoothie, or toss them into a salad. Or you could just have them as a snack with some nuts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Surrey Live</author><pubDate>Tue, 24 Jun 2025 12:53:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijgFBVV95cUxOQTRYTVhGZFFuR2ZNbDNUaFhHdTVQVGNsRDBpcHlFblc0MzlVTmNPclpaLUV2U3BMakJLQ3V4ekF5dHQzbXplcW8tNTA5VkhFbnhWQU1tR2lyZUJrd290MktfdFRjOHotQjVadGRFOUdDLUNRbE5fcFYtUEthbERTRV9hNi1wYkNwaGFSMlN3</guid></item><item><title>心脏病专家顾问说，一小步就能降低胆固醇- Surrey Live | Consultant cardiologist says small step will slash cholesterol - Surrey Live</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikgFBVV95cUxNNi1PVEtUaHJwRzJuYWx3ckVqQm5MN185T0xNOWlOc1daS0NfSVZsN3RBN2Y2RjZidy1xbklQOXlFc1RONkNaek1uR2p1cGJ3MGdWcHBpNlM1ZlNDSzM0S3JwRFY1R3ZGSEI1Mk1qclRTemhNYmZHZ3c1N3FXRXlidzZfZVV4b0lxdnd0X0h1OGlRQQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body" itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p&gt;While we're all aware of the significance of a balanced diet and the dangers of smoking, there are five lesser-known habits that could be detrimental to your heart health. Despite the frequent discussions about heart health, many of us unknowingly partake in behaviours that can harm this crucial organ.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Speaking earlier this year for Heart Awareness Month, a leading cardiologist explained the five daily activities that might be jeopardising your cardiovascular health. From sleep patterns to stress levels, these habits could be causing more harm than you realise.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Five things damaging your heart health&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;h4&gt;Lack of physical activity&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;"A sedentary lifestyle can lead to weight gain, high cholesterol, and increased blood pressure, all of which increase your risk for cardiovascular disease," cautioned Dr Christopher Broyd, consultant cardiologist at Nuffield Health Brighton Hospital. "Regular exercise is crucial for heart health."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, there's no need to stress yourself into hitting the gym every day - just start with small steps. "Begin with simple activities like walking, stretching, or using a stationary bike," suggested Dr Broyd.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Even short bursts of activity, such as 10-minute walks, can add up over time and gradually increase your stamina."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Most importantly, select activities that you find enjoyable. "Whether it's dancing, swimming, cycling, or playing a team sport, finding something fun makes it easier to stay motivated," advised Dr Broyd.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Try to pick a time of day that works best for you and stick to it, whether it's in the morning, during lunch breaks, or in the evening."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4&gt;Stress&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chronic stress - such as that caused by demanding jobs or family issues - can contribute to heart problems, warned the cardiologist. "Prolonged stress can negatively affect the heart by raising blood pressure and increasing the risk of heart attack or stroke," explained Dr Broyd.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Stress also encourages unhealthy coping mechanisms, like overeating or smoking.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Chronic job stress can elevate blood pressure, lead to poor eating habits, and disrupt sleep, all of which can harm heart health over time."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Therefore, it's vital to have effective coping strategies for managing stress.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Regular physical activity, such as walking, yoga, or exercise, can help release built-up tension and improve mood by boosting endorphins," suggested Dr Broyd. "Some find that mindfulness techniques like meditation, deep breathing, or progressive muscle relaxation can calm the mind and reduce stress levels."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class="in-article-image" data-mod="image" data-orientation="landscape" data-tmdatatrack="inline-widget" data-tmdatatrack-articleid="31924229" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;h4&gt;Not prioritising sleep&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Lack of sleep or poor-quality sleep can increase blood pressure, contribute to obesity, and disrupt the body's natural repair processes," warned Dr Broyd. "Sleep disorders like sleep apnoea can also significantly affect heart health."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to Dr Broyd, establishing a regular sleep routine can help achieve natural and restful sleep. "Go to bed and wake up at the same time every day, even on weekends," advises Dr Broyd. "This helps regulate your body's internal clock and promotes a more consistent sleep pattern. Engage in calming activities before bed, such as reading and avoid stimulating activities like watching intense TV shows."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr Broyd also recommended limiting caffeine, nicotine, and alcohol consumption in the evenings. "Consuming caffeine or nicotine in the late afternoon and evening can interfere with sleep," Dr Broyd warned.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Similarly, while alcohol may initially make you feel sleepy, it can disrupt your sleep cycle later in the night."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4&gt;Insufficient sunlight exposure&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;"A lack of sunlight exposure can lead to vitamin D deficiency, which has been linked to higher blood pressure, inflammation, and an increased risk of heart disease," Dr Broyd said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Safe sun exposure or supplementation can help maintain heart health."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;During winter months, taking short breaks to step outside is crucial. "If you're working or studying indoors, take short breaks to step outside and soak up some sun," Dr Broyd recommended.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Aim to get outside for at least 15-30 minutes each day, especially in the morning when the sun is less harsh. Take walks, sit in a park, or enjoy outdoor activities like gardening, walking the dog, or even having lunch outside."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class="in-article-image" data-mod="image" data-orientation="landscape" data-tmdatatrack="inline-widget" data-tmdatatrack-articleid="31924226" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;h4&gt;Social isolation&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Being socially isolated or feeling lonely can increase your risk of heart disease," Dr Broyd explained. "Studies have shown that loneliness can trigger stress, raise blood pressure, and negatively affect immune function, all of which can harm heart health."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you're experiencing loneliness, it's advisable to get in touch with friends or family, or perhaps join a new club. "Improving social isolation takes time and effort, but by making intentional efforts to connect with others and build relationships, you can enhance your social support network and overall wellbeing and ultimately improve your heart health," Dr Broyd advised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Surrey Live</author><pubDate>Tue, 24 Jun 2025 12:48:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikgFBVV95cUxNNi1PVEtUaHJwRzJuYWx3ckVqQm5MN185T0xNOWlOc1daS0NfSVZsN3RBN2Y2RjZidy1xbklQOXlFc1RONkNaek1uR2p1cGJ3MGdWcHBpNlM1ZlNDSzM0S3JwRFY1R3ZGSEI1Mk1qclRTemhNYmZHZ3c1N3FXRXlidzZfZVV4b0lxdnd0X0h1OGlRQQ</guid></item><item><title>第三例麻疹确诊，大特拉弗斯县宣布爆发- WPBN | Third measles case confirmed, Grand Traverse County declares outbreak - WPBN</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipgFBVV95cUxQVVZzdUN0VkxnV045dGZQUFdZOWxqWXRKZll0djBVZjRYXzZqNHJjNG0wc0ZNelJId1JlNjJiVGI2eVV3bDUweEwtZ2FpSHJsUHRvd195WW1SUkpEZkhTOVZXWEdBbzVzTHg2cWgtcmpKa19STGhqeGFjbE9FenJhaDk4ZlJwYkNZQXpwbWdsUXZmV1NqQktQSmoyUlJ6b0lETndxM19B?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="StoryText-module_storyText__FWhP"&gt;&lt;p&gt;GRAND TRAVERSE COUNTY, Mich., (WPBN/WGTU) -- Local health departments are saying there is a measles outbreak in Grand Traverse County after a third case was confirmed on Monday, June 23.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Grand Traverse County Health Department (GTCHD) and the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS) said an outbreak is defined as three or more related cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first case of measles in the county was reported June 18, 2025. This was the first Grand Traverse County case since 2019.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two days later, a second case was reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is important that we, as the public health department, take action to protect, maintain, and improve the health of our community,” said Mike Lahey, MPH, Health Officer at GTCHD. “Measles is a serious disease, and we want to make sure that our residents and visitors are safe. Those who are not vaccinated against measles should consider getting vaccinated during this busy travel time in our community. It is important to make sure you protect yourself and your family from this vaccine-preventable disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are no new public exposure sites to be reported, and all confirmed cases in Grand Traverse County have been determined to be linked to one another by GTCHD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms of measles usually begin 7-14 days after exposure, but can appear up to 21 days after exposure and may include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;High fever (may spike to over 104F).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cough.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Runny nose.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Red, watery eyes (conjunctivitis).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tiny white spots on the inner cheeks, gums, and roof of the mouth (Koplik Spots) may appear two to three days after symptoms begin.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A rash that is red, raised, blotchy; usually starts on the face, spreads to trunk, arms, and legs three to five days after symptoms begin.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyone experiencing symptoms is urged to call their healthcare provider. If seeking in-person medical attention, call ahead to inform your doctor, urgent care, or emergency room of the potential measles exposure before arrival so facilities may take precautions to prevent exposure to other individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In some cases, if it has been less than six days since the potential exposure, you may be able to receive post-exposure treatment that could prevent illness. Contact your healthcare provider, pharmacy, or local health department for vaccination and guidance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The GTCHD has a measles hotline that can be reached during normal business hours, Monday through Friday from 8:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. at 231-995-6800.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, the line will be monitored from 10:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. Saturday, June 21st, and from 10:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. Sunday, June 22nd. If outside of office hours, Grand Traverse County residents can also contact 2-1-1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WPBN</author><pubDate>Tue, 24 Jun 2025 12:42:52 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipgFBVV95cUxQVVZzdUN0VkxnV045dGZQUFdZOWxqWXRKZll0djBVZjRYXzZqNHJjNG0wc0ZNelJId1JlNjJiVGI2eVV3bDUweEwtZ2FpSHJsUHRvd195WW1SUkpEZkhTOVZXWEdBbzVzTHg2cWgtcmpKa19STGhqeGFjbE9FenJhaDk4ZlJwYkNZQXpwbWdsUXZmV1NqQktQSmoyUlJ6b0lETndxM19B</guid></item><item><title>Golden Retriever在可爱的视频中展示了许多打嗝的方法- AOL.com | Golden Retriever Shows Many Ways To Burp in Cute Video - AOL.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidkFVX3lxTE1pZERIaGZZblhpbkVfbDhTWVBwRGphNV9pWjRheS0wTnNaRlNkWXRSQWVUdERCMndCaEVmc213RjRKV3ZoeXF4UndLek1nak1OUzRYYUFla19qTlAwSVZxM1c4VkM5OTVEdnFWdC1ZR2lXWl9IM1E?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;(Photo Credit: @daisythegoldiee / Instagram)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dogs can be interesting as well as entertaining on several occasions. However, not many are aware that their ways of entertainment can also be weird habits. A reel on social media has been proving this instance in the most hilarious way possible. The following video shows a &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/golden-retriever" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Golden Retriever;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Golden Retriever&lt;/a&gt; showcasing many styles of burping that can leave anyone busting a gut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Instagram video shows Golden Retriever burping in different ways&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;User @daisythegoldiee took to Instagram to share an adorable video of their Golden Retriever dog showing ways to burp. The popular page created by the owner is dedicated to the unmissable moments of the two Golden siblings, &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com/news/176650-dog-car-wash-video" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Daisy and Maple;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Daisy and Maple&lt;/a&gt;. In the above-mentioned viral reel, Maple is seen flaunting her never-seen-before talent of burping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the pooch’s hooman decides to rate her burping skills to appreciate her talent. The first one is a “small but mighty baby Burp” of Maple, which receives a 9 out of 10. Later, the Golden shows her “I smell my own burp” burp, which goes on to receive an 11 out of 10. The next one is “I ate a lot of yoghurt and now I’am really full” burp. This cute burp with a little yoghurt stain on the canine’s nose gets full marks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, Maple’s “Head Scratchies Burp” scores a 9 out of 10 while “the dainty lady burp” is an 8. Furthermore, the “Huh?. It wasn’t me.” burp receives a 9 as well. The last but not the least is none other than the “multi-tasking burp.” This turns out to be the best burp as the hooman rates it as a 12 out of 10. Maple’s owner, finding joy in the pet’s burps, proves how a dog’s weird habits can also be entertaining.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the time of writing, this funny reel has garnered over 20K likes, more than 245K views, and over 3K shares. Users also shared their reactions in the comment section, with one writing, “i like the multi tasking burp.” One more commented, “All of her burps are 100/10.” A third user stated, “I’d like to request more of this series please and thank you.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com/news/180752-golden-retriever-burp-instagram-video" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Golden Retriever Shows Many Ways To Burp in Cute Video;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Golden Retriever Shows Many Ways To Burp in Cute Video&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:DogTime;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;DogTime&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 24 Jun 2025 12:22:37 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidkFVX3lxTE1pZERIaGZZblhpbkVfbDhTWVBwRGphNV9pWjRheS0wTnNaRlNkWXRSQWVUdERCMndCaEVmc213RjRKV3ZoeXF4UndLek1nak1OUzRYYUFla19qTlAwSVZxM1c4VkM5OTVEdnFWdC1ZR2lXWl9IM1E</guid></item><item><title>一些早发性癌症正在上升。为什么？ -现场科学 | Some early-onset cancers are on the rise.

&lt;p&gt;Some early-onset cancers — those that occur in people under age 50 — are on the rise in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This overall increase is due to a rise in 14 different types of cancers in younger people, according to a new analysis. The largest increases have occurred in breast, colorectal, kidney and uterine cancer diagnoses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the overall incidence of early-onset cancer is still low, these small increases could add up over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A rise of a few percent per year is "not a huge change in the number of diagnoses, because cancer is still rare at these ages,"&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cepr.ca/?risen_staff=miranda-fidler-phd" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.cepr.ca/?risen_staff=miranda-fidler-phd" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt; &lt;u&gt;Miranda Fidler-Benaoudia&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a cancer epidemiologist at Alberta Health Services and the University of Calgary, told Live Science. "But it's when it's happening over two, three decades that it really leads to a meaningful increase in that period."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reasons behind these increases are complex and manifold, and many are probably specific to each type of cancer, experts say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To tease out trends in early-onset cancer diagnoses and the myriad reasons behind them, National Cancer Institute epidemiologist &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://dceg.cancer.gov/about/staff-directory/shiels-meredith" target="_blank" data-url="https://dceg.cancer.gov/about/staff-directory/shiels-meredith" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Meredith Shiels&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and colleagues compiled data on cancers diagnosed in 15- to 49-year-olds between 2010 and 2019 in the U.S. In a study published May 8 in the journal &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://aacrjournals.org/cancerdiscovery/article-abstract/doi/10.1158/2159-8290.CD-24-1678/762175/Trends-in-Cancer-Incidence-and-Mortality-Rates-in" target="_blank" data-url="https://aacrjournals.org/cancerdiscovery/article-abstract/doi/10.1158/2159-8290.CD-24-1678/762175/Trends-in-Cancer-Incidence-and-Mortality-Rates-in" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Cancer Discovery&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the team broke down changes in the rates of different cancers in three age groups: 15 to 29, 30 to 39, and 40 to 49.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Breast and uterine cancer rates increased in every early-onset age group, while rates of colorectal and certain kidney cancers increased among 30- to 39-year-olds and 40- to 49-year-olds, the team found. More than 80% of the additional cancers that occurred in 2019 compared with 2010 were one of these four types. Other diagnoses that increased in at least one early-onset cohort included melanoma, cervical cancer and stomach cancer, though incidences of these cancers remained low overall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-ab3sBrwS6wtfmjmK27M99U" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-ab3sBrwS6wtfmjmK27M99U slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 id="lifestyle-changes-3"&gt;Lifestyle changes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many factors could contribute to these observed increases. Research suggests that&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://acsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.3322/caac.21858" target="_blank" data-url="https://acsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.3322/caac.21858" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt; &lt;u&gt;obesity&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a risk factor for colorectal, kidney and uterine cancers, all of which are rising in younger people. Globally, the percentage of adults who are overweight or obese has &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/obesity-and-overweight" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/obesity-and-overweight" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;increased&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; significantly since 1990. Although most studies linking cancer and obesity were conducted in older adults, it's possible that higher rates of obesity in younger people could also increase the rates of early-onset cancer, the researchers wrote.&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://acsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.3322/caac.21858" target="_blank" data-url="https://acsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.3322/caac.21858" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt; &lt;u&gt;One 2024 study&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; suggests that more than half of uterine cancers diagnosed in 2019 might be linked to obesity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Changes in reproductive patterns over the years could also be contributing to the increased incidence of early-onset breast cancers, Fidler-Benaoudia said. Girls are &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2819141" target="_blank" data-url="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2819141" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;getting their periods earlier&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and women are &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.TFRT.IN?locations=US" target="_blank" data-url="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.TFRT.IN?locations=US" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;having fewer children&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr73/nvsr73-02.pdf" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr73/nvsr73-02.pdf" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;having them later in life&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, than they did a few generations ago. Being younger at first menstruation, giving birth fewer times, and giving birth for the first time later in life have all been linked to a higher risk of developing certain types of early-onset breast cancer, the researchers wrote. Other research suggests that using oral contraceptives (birth control pills) might also slightly elevate the risk of early-onset breast cancer, though it may also &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/hormones/oral-contraceptives-fact-sheet" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/hormones/oral-contraceptives-fact-sheet" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;protect&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; against ovarian and endometrial cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="better-detection-3"&gt;Better detection&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier detection of cancers in people with genetic risk factors may also play a role. For instance, those with certain BRCA gene variants have a higher risk of breast, ovarian or prostate cancer, while those with &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK431096/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK431096/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Lynch syndrome&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; face an increased risk of myriad cancers, including colon cancer, stomach cancer and brain cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;blockquote class="vanilla-quoteblock"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think that we need large studies that follow individuals over the life course, including at younger ages, to be able to identify risk factors for early-onset cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Meredith Shiels&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/topic_search_results?topic_status=P&amp;amp;category%5B%5D=15&amp;amp;searchterm=" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/topic_search_results?topic_status=P&amp;amp;category%5B%5D=15&amp;amp;searchterm=" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Newer screening guidelines&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; recommend people with these genes start screening for cancer earlier than those with an average risk of the disease. Even a small increase in the number of early-onset cancers detected via these new recommendations could trigger an uptick in diagnoses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Screening for other, unrelated issues could also help identify certain cancers earlier. For example, changes in imaging procedures for MRIs and CT scans mean that health care professionals are catching &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11120239/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11120239/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;more instances of renal cell carcinoma&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a type of kidney cancer, during other tests. This incidental detection has led to an increase in kidney cancer diagnoses in almost all age groups, the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="environmental-exposures-3"&gt;Environmental exposures&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;People's prenatal or early-life exposures to certain compounds may also fuel specific early-onset cancers. Researchers reported in April in the journal&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1590019&amp;amp;xcust=livescience_us_3467233821507289474&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41586-025-09025-8&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Fhealth%2Fcancer%2Fsome-early-onset-cancers-are-on-the-rise-why" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09025-8" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed="skimlinks" data-placeholder-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1590019&amp;amp;xcust=hawk-custom-tracking&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41586-025-09025-8&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Fhealth%2Fcancer%2Fsome-early-onset-cancers-are-on-the-rise-why" data-google-interstitial="false" data-merchant-name="nature.com" data-merchant-network="SkimLinks"&gt; &lt;u&gt;Nature&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that childhood exposure to a chemical called colibactin, which is produced by certain &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; strains in the colon, causes DNA mutations observed more frequently in early-onset colorectal cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Showing that an exposure directly causes a certain type of early-onset cancer — or even pinpointing which types of exposures might pose a risk — is no easy feat. "I think that we need large studies that follow individuals over the life course, including at younger ages, to be able to identify risk factors for early-onset cancers,"&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://dceg.cancer.gov/about/staff-directory/shiels-meredith" target="_blank" data-url="https://dceg.cancer.gov/about/staff-directory/shiels-meredith" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt; &lt;u&gt;Shiels&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; told Live Science in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even with these sorts of extended studies, though, it can be challenging to pin down the exact causes of early-onset cancer. "The issue with cancer at young ages is, whilst it's increasing, it's still relatively rare [compared] to those older age groups," Fidler-Benaoudia said. "To have enough people develop cancer to then identify risk factors in this prospective way is incredibly challenging, because you need huge, huge numbers."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it's impossible to eliminate your individual risk of getting cancer, there are some things that reduce the overall risk at the population level. For instance, wearing sun protection and getting vaccinated against human papillomavirus (HPV) can help protect against certain cancers, Fidler-Benaoudia said. Similarly, limiting alcohol and smoking can reduce the odds of a person developing cancer at any point in their life, not just before age 50, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://hsph.harvard.edu/profile/tomotaka-ugai/" target="_blank" data-url="https://hsph.harvard.edu/profile/tomotaka-ugai/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Tomotaka Ugai&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a cancer epidemiologist at the Harvard T.H.

As an oncologist, I remind patients frequently that healthy kidneys are a product of diligent care over many years.” &lt;strong&gt;Also read | &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/kidney-cancer-causes-diagnosis-conventional-surgery-drawbacks-emergence-of-breakthrough-surgeries-101694332018631.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="Kidney cancer: Causes, diagnosis, drawbacks of conventional surgery, breakthrough treatments"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kidney cancer: Causes, diagnosis, drawbacks of conventional surgery, breakthrough treatments&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="mt10 mb10 htEchoArticlePromo"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="predictorShow mb20" data-vars-predictor="true" data-vars-quiz="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="quizShow mb20" data-vars-minimized="false" data-vars-predictor="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr Pushpinder Gulia further suggested tips that can reduce the risk of kidney cancer:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;1. Do not smoke at all:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tobacco use remains one of the leading causes of kidney cancer. Even occasional smoking exposes the kidneys to harmful chemicals and impairs blood flow. Quitting tobacco as early as possible can significantly reduce your long-term risk.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;2. Maintain a healthy weight and stay active:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excess weight is associated with increased risk of kidney tumors, in part through insulin resistance and chronic inflammation. Uncomplicated, regular physical activity like 30 minutes of brisk walking a day can control weight and promote kidney function.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;3. Use pain medications with caution:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Young adults usually take over-the-counter pain relievers such as ibuprofen for headaches or muscle pains. Although infrequent use is usually okay, frequent use or taking it over a long period of time can hurt the kidneys and maybe increase the risk of cancer. Use medicine as recommended and see a doctor if you take it often. &lt;strong&gt;Also read | &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/kidney-cancer-7-lifestyle-mistakes-that-are-damaging-your-kidneys-putting-you-at-risk-of-cancer-101717995677790.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="Kidney cancer: 7 lifestyle mistakes that are damaging your kidneys, putting you at risk of cancer"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kidney cancer: 7 lifestyle mistakes that are damaging your kidneys, putting you at risk of cancer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="inlineIMG"&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;img data-src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/03/13/original/shutterstock_2520614153_1741869613958.jpg" class="lazy" src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/550x309.jpg" alt="Drink water to keep your kidneys healthy.(Shutterstock)" title="Drink water to keep your kidneys healthy.(Shutterstock)"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;Drink water to keep your kidneys healthy.(Shutterstock)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;4. Keep blood pressure and blood sugar under control:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Uncontrolled diabetes and high blood pressure are strongly linked with kidney disease and kidney cancer. They can remain undetected in their initial stages, so regular screening is necessary. Controlling them by medicines, diet, and low salt and sugar consumption can safeguard kidneys.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;5. Add kidney tests to your check-ups:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you've had a good family history of kidney problems or are exposed to chemicals at work, talk to your doctor about adding kidney function tests or imaging scans such as ultrasounds to your regular checkups. Early diagnosis makes a difference.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;6. Stay well hydrated:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keeping hydrated aids the kidneys in flushing out waste products well. Drink 8 to 10 glasses of water per day unless you have a medical condition for which your doctor recommends something else.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;7. Restrict exposure to toxic chemicals:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with prolonged exposure to industrial chemicals, pesticides, or heavy metals need to take extra precautions with regular screenings. Use protection when working with household or gardening chemicals and attempt to restrict unnecessary exposure. &lt;strong&gt;Also read | &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/are-you-always-stressed-oncologist-says-hypertension-can-cause-kidney-cancer-101749973716264.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="Are you always stressed?

Oncologist says ‘hypertension can cause kidney cancer’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;8. Notice new or unusual symptoms:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms such as unintended weight loss, hematuria, or persistent pain in the back should never be taken lightly, particularly among elders. They could be early symptoms of kidney cancer and need to be evaluated at once by a physician.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This article is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.

And while much of the focus on extreme heat is the immediate risk to human health, &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2023/07/20/chronic-heat-exposure-illness/" target="_blank"&gt;chronic heat can cause a range of chronic health problems&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;Days and years of exposure to persistent heat can tax the heart and kidneys, disrupt sleep and challenge our mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="CPQMBNYJUJFNZERRDR2DJZCCPQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;To protect yourself, give yourself time to acclimatize to the heat and stay hydrated. “The first 10 to 15 days of anyone doing any new activity in a warm environment are really important to progressively and gradually do that. Because you allow your body time to adapt,” said &lt;a href="https://kins.uconn.edu/person/rebecca-stearns/" target="_blank"&gt;Rebecca Stearns&lt;/a&gt;, the chief operating officer of the &lt;a href="https://ksi.uconn.edu/" target="_blank"&gt;Korey Stringer Institute&lt;/a&gt;, a nonprofit housed&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;at the University of Connecticut dedicated to studying and preventing heatstroke in athletes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="6ND4PWW4X5A7FBZKXWS3SRWZYU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Don’t exercise outdoors alone, and learn to recognize the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/heat-health/about/index.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fextreme-heat%2Fsigns-symptoms%2Findex.html" target="_blank"&gt;signs of heatstroke&lt;/a&gt; in yourself and others. Getting out of the heat, even for a few hours, is &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/413470" target="_blank"&gt;protective during heat waves&lt;/a&gt;. Air conditioning and electric fans can help, but may not always be available, such as during a power outage. Dousing the skin in water may be an &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2752456" target="_blank"&gt;effective alternative&lt;/a&gt; or going to designated &lt;a href="https://nchh.org/information-and-evidence/learn-about-healthy-housing/emergencies/extreme-heat/cooling-centers-by-state/" target="_blank"&gt;cooling centers&lt;/a&gt; in your community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="6EDUAMCEPBCJHDJPL5GFJUF6SA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;If you feel unwell, weak, confused or agitated, those are all “red flags,” Stearns said.

Age-related changes trigger so-called cardiac fibroblasts, which can lead to fibrosis: A buildup of connective tissue, as seen in scarring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although fibrosis is an important function and helps repair heart tissue after damage, when it is uncontrolled, it leads to a stiffer, less flexible ECM. In the case of the heart, this can make it &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00441-016-2431-9" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;less efficient at pumping blood&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Focusing on the ECM is relatively novel. “Most aging research focuses on how cells change over time,” &lt;a href="https://news.nus.edu.sg/new-biomaterial-shows-ageing-in-heart-could-be-reversed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.mbi.nus.edu.sg/jennifer-young/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Jennifer Young&lt;/a&gt;, senior author of the study and assistant professor at the Mechanobiology Institute of the National University of Singapore. “Our study looks instead at the ECM and how changes in this environment affect heart aging.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;To help uncover the role of the ECM in heart health, the team designed a new, hi-tech model called DECellularized In Situ Polyacrylamide Hydrogel-ECM hybrid (DECIPHER).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This model was created using heart tissue from a rat and a lab-created gel that shares physical properties with ECM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previously, the authors explain, it was unclear whether changes in cell signaling or changes in tissue stiffness were most responsible for age-related declines in heart function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The DECIPHER platform solves this problem,” explains &lt;a href="https://www.mbi.nus.edu.sg/student/avery-rui-sun/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Avery Rui Sun&lt;/a&gt;, first author of the study, in a &lt;a href="https://news.nus.edu.sg/new-biomaterial-shows-ageing-in-heart-could-be-reversed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;. He explains how it allows “researchers to independently control the stiffness and the biochemical signals presented to the cells — something no previous system using native tissue has been able to do.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, they could adjust the model and see what happens when cell signalling occurs as it does in a young heart, but with an older, stiffer ECM. Conversely, they could mimic the biochemical signals of an aged heart with a young, flexible ECM. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found that “young” cell signaling outweighed the negative effects of the stiffer ECM. In reverse, young cells placed on “aged” ECM showed signs of dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This implies that “the biochemical environment around aged heart cells matters more than stiffness,” explains Young.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Medical News Today&lt;/em&gt; reached out to &lt;a href="https://vitalsolution.com/interventional-cardiology-a-commitment-to-lifelong-learning/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Nishant Kalra, MD&lt;/a&gt;, an interventional cardiologist, chief medical officer at VitalSolution — an Ingenovis Health company — who was not involved in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Surface molecules (ligands) found in young heart tissue can prevent the activation of fibrosis-promoting cells, even when the tissue is as stiff as aged heart tissue, which points to new ways to target the extracellular environment to slow heart aging,” he told us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Human studies next&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This work provides a platform for identifying molecular mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets to prevent or reverse age-related cardiac dysfunction. While promising, human translation requires further validation, as the study used rat cells.”&lt;br&gt;— Nishant Kalra, MD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although intriguing, it will be countless studies and many years before these results will lead to new treatments. However, there are many science-backed lifestyle changes that will support your heart as you age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;We asked Kalra for some tips on maintaining heart health. “For lifestyle-based prevention of heart aging, the most evidence-based strategies are:”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regular aerobic exercise: &lt;/strong&gt;At least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic activity per week&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adherence to a healthy dietary pattern: &lt;/strong&gt;Emphasize fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins while limiting saturated and trans fats, cholesterol, and sodium, such as by adopting the &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/324221" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Mediterranean&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/254836" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;DASH diets&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stop smoking: &lt;/strong&gt;Tobacco damages blood vessels and increases the risk of heart disease.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adequate sleep: &lt;/strong&gt;Aim for 7–9 hours of quality sleep per night. Sleep deprivation can negatively impact heart health.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weight management: &lt;/strong&gt;Obesity is a major risk factor for heart disease. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stress reduction: &lt;/strong&gt;Find healthy ways to manage stress, such as exercise, meditation, or spending time in nature.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“These behaviors,” he continued, “are consistently associated with reduced biological and cardiovascular aging, as shown in large epidemiological studies and supported by the American Heart Association.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;MNT&lt;/em&gt; also reached out to &lt;a href="https://uk.treated.com/medical-team/dr-daniel-atkinson" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Daniel Atkinson, MD&lt;/a&gt;, a family physician from the United Kingdom, working for a private healthcare company called Treated. He also advised reducing alcohol intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Keep it below 14 units (roughly 4–5 drinks) per week, avoid drinking more than 3 drinks in any one session, and give your body (and heart and liver) a break from alcohol for at least one continuous 48-hour period each week.”&lt;br&gt;— Daniel Atkinson, MD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Excess alcohol consumption carries a few health risks,” Atkinson said, “and among these is the effect it can have on raising blood pressure, which elevates your risk of heart disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;He explained how drinking alcohol in excess can weaken the heart muscles, making it more difficult for the heart to pump blood around the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Medical News Today</author><pubDate>Tue, 24 Jun 2025 11:24:36 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilwFBVV95cUxPTGNQNkpoV0Y1TWdSMDlGTUNKem1KcFVQUk0wejlFbXBDT2tZaTU4WXpSN0czTElKQy00MUMtTkdkYzhtVUdnQXZPNzEyWHhrbWRCTmk3ckpwbF80Wk92ODZxelBvQUlvTGp4UEV6cHZwT3pkLUFjbTlNVy02U0FMb1F0MFQ5dVdoVEhDb2h0d1ZnNXhHTV8w</guid></item><item><title>神经科医生说，你可以在20分钟内降低胆固醇、血压和痴呆症的风险- Surrey Live | Neurologist says you can cut cholesterol, blood pressure and dementia risk in 20 minutes - Surrey Live</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigwFBVV95cUxOU3dnMWYtLTA5Nmc3QWh0RkthdUJIbzRKZml2ektzMjBoOUpoZ1BsMzFHREszVkNMY2lIakZBSE5Vdm9xUUc1Znk3ZHhrY0FUTXFHNWExd0tvT01MYjJmR2RpMEN5OU50R3JxLVR6MnQ3OUZ6b2dxZzRqOVJNT2dwVzVWMNIBiAFBVV95cUxORHpTWlhjcFhUbXhrZHNMd3JENm5SXzlrUHNPS2FfaFBQeUFQYW5UTFlHZE1JR1NZQmpzVW9ZSS1kV0d6UElsWExadXJ3T1h3aWRJNGkwOG90RlZidHBBZTV1UGZHcV9vc1BSUW9fbGEyTjdHdm1ESHp6T1ItSXhHNjIxZTBaN251?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body" itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A professor of neurology says there are steps we can take to support brain health and lower the risk of dementia, as well as reducing cholesterol and blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Jonathan Schott, professor of neurology at UCL and chief medical officer at Alzheimer’s Research UK, &lt;span&gt;has outlined six easy ways to give your brain a boost this summer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Learn a new skill (that you enjoy)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Keep your brain active by doing the things that you enjoy doing,” recommends Schott. “I’ve previously said, ‘If you hate Sudoku, don’t do Sudoku’ as you’re not going to stick with it.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s more about finding whatever keeps you engaged and stimulated, he emphasises.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“For some people, that’s reading a book, for others it will be playing chess or learning a new skill like crochet,” says Schott.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Learning a new skill, or getting better at a pre-existing one, helps keep your brain flexible, explains the neurology professor.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“What we think is, when you learn new skills, those areas [in the brain] get connected better together and the connections get stronger – that’s why when you repeat a skill over and over and over again then that movement becomes more automatic,” says Schott. “And we think that it probably makes the brain a bit more resilient.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Do something active every day&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I think exercising is the single best thing that we can do,” says Schott. “We talk at Alzheimer’s Research UK about what’s good for your heart is good for your brain, and that’s because lots of the risk factors for your heart are also risk factors for brain diseases as well.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Exercise can lower your blood pressure, can lower your cholesterol, can take your weight down and gives you a sense of wellbeing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Ideally, you want to be doing a little bit of exercise every day and want to be doing something that gets your heart rate substantially elevated for at least 20 minutes three or four times a week.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There is also growing evidence that suggests exercise can buffer some of the effects of the causes of dementia in the brain.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The mechanisms aren’t entirely clear, but it’s likely that the chemicals that get released from the muscles get into the brain and may actually alter this,” he adds.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Go on regular walks&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“What’s really interesting is that it does not need to be hugely vigorous exercise,” says Schott. “We’re not talking about running marathons, we’re talking about walking every day or walking up the stairs rather than taking a lift.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Some of the research that we’ve done suggests that it’s actually relatively small but sustained amount of activity throughout your life, that may be the most beneficial.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Walking with others also offers additional valuable social benefits, and Alzheimer’s Research UK is set to host a variety of Walk For A Cure events across the UK this summer – ranging from family-friendly, accessible 5km routes to more challenging 42km hikes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Stay connected&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Several studies also suggest that social isolation can raise the risk of dementia, so staying connected with others is a powerful way to support your brain health.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Do things that you really enjoy doing yourself, but also with other people,” recommends Schott. “Staying connected helps you keep in touch with people, you get feedback on people and you can also compare how your brain performance is to other people’s.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“When I have someone who says to me, I’m a bit worried about my memory, my immediate thought is to say what’s your memory like compared to those people you hang out with?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;5. Get your blood pressure checked&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Keeping an eye on your blood pressure is really important,” says Schott. “We and others have found that it’s your blood pressure in your 30s and your 40s which actually may have the most impact on your brain health.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The professor explains that monitoring blood pressure is important because dementia generally stems from two main causes: neurodegenerative diseases and cerebrovascular disease, with the latter involving damage to the brain’s blood vessels.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“By reducing the blood pressure, we think we’re probably putting less strain on the blood vessels in the brain, which makes them more robust and less likely to get clogged or less likely to burst,” he explains.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;6.

She wishes she could shout “fiber, fiber, fiber” from the rooftops.

Seniors can miss out on fibers because of issues including appetite, access to certain foods, fixed incomes and dental health.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://health.usnews.com/doctors/asim-cheema-834684" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Asim Cheema" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68498f31e4b0cf5f0c9aa069" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://health.usnews.com/doctors/asim-cheema-834684" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="7"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr. Asim Cheema&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, who specializes in internal medicine and cardiology, notices both fiber and hydration issues in many patients. “Not eating enough fiber can cause constipation and also raise cholesterol. One thing I see a lot is older adults not drinking enough water. They don’t feel thirsty as often, so it just slips their mind. These are basics that are easy to overlook but really affect how people feel day to day.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Flashpop via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Flashpop via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;“I often emphasize that having some healthy fat stores is actually protective as we age," said Dr. Elaine Healy.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Next, there’s the issue of protein. As you age, you’re already facing a decrease in muscle mass, and that’s a concern, even if you’ve never been the body-building type. According to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yorktownhealth.com/provider/shawn-george-d-o" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Shawn George" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68498f31e4b0cf5f0c9aa069" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.yorktownhealth.com/provider/shawn-george-d-o" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="8"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr. Shawn George&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, an internal medicine physician, “Loss of muscle can lead to weakness, falls and a decline in mobility. To combat this, protein needs actually increase with age, as it helps maintain muscle mass and strength.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I recommend older patients focus on consuming higher amounts of protein throughout the day, sources like lean meats, eggs, beans and Greek yogurt, spread across meals, rather than relying on just one protein-heavy meal. For someone in their 60s or beyond, aiming for at least 1.2 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight per day is a good target. It’s about making sure the body has the building blocks it needs to stay strong and functional for as long as possible.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Every bite counts, these experts said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.centerwellprimarycare.com/en/doctors/tamea-deshawn-evans-md.html" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Tamea Evans" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68498f31e4b0cf5f0c9aa069" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.centerwellprimarycare.com/en/doctors/tamea-deshawn-evans-md.html" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="9"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr. Tamea Evans&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, an internal medicine physician and diabetologist, suggested that seniors should focus on high-impact foods, which she described as those that pack a nutritional punch even in smaller, more senior-friendly sized portions. She used natural peanut butter as an example: “It’s a great source of healthy fats, some sugar, calories, protein, vitamins and minerals, all in one spoonful. The key is choosing foods that are rich in things such as fiber and good fats, so every bite counts.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Instead of focusing on weight, focus on strength instead.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In addition to nutrition, there’s also the issue of weight. Happily, there might be some good news here from Rao. “Being in shape is actually better for longevity than being skinny,” she said. “As you age, you want to focus on maintaining strength and mobility, rather than just weight. Ensuring that you maintain lean muscle mass is crucial as you age.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="cli cli-pullquote"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-pullquote__placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-pullquote__content"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-pullquote__quote accent-cli"&gt;““The body may not bounce back like it used to, but it’s still incredibly responsive to care — especially when you give it better fuel.””&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cli-pullquote__attribution caption-cli"&gt;- Dr. Raj Dasgupta&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I wouldn’t obsess over the scale, but staying strong matters more than ever,” Burgess said. “It’s less about a goal weight and more about keeping your heart, muscles and joints in tip-top shape.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A few more pounds might even be a good idea, said &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://uhgc.org/team/elaine-healy-md" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Elaine Healy" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68498f31e4b0cf5f0c9aa069" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://uhgc.org/team/elaine-healy-md" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="10"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr. Elaine Healy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, vice president of medical affairs and medical director at United Hebrew Geriatric Center. “I often emphasize that having some healthy fat stores is actually protective as we age. Particularly for older women, who may have been naturally slender their whole lives, it’s important not to fear a few extra pounds. It’s not about promoting obesity, but rather ensuring there are enough reserves to withstand health challenges.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you’ve never eaten well, should you start now?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://enableu.com.au/about/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Janet Phile" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68498f31e4b0cf5f0c9aa069" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://enableu.com.au/about/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="11"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Janet Phile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, a registered nurse who specializes in complex care for those with aging-related challenges, said that you can start eating better, and feeling better, at any age. “It boosts your energy and immune system, and it may help you live longer,” she said. “It’s never too late to treat your body better. I’ve had patients in their 70s and 80s who improved inflammatory markers, cognitive clarity and mobility when they committed to eating more nourishing foods.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Ormond agrees, saying, “Your body is still capable of healing and adapting — even in your 70s, 80s or beyond. I’ve seen people feel more alert, sleep better and move with less pain, just from making small nutrition changes. You don’t need a lifetime of perfect eating for it to be worth it. Start now, and you’ll feel the difference.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Cheema said that the effort will be totally worth it if you start feeling better. “If you start eating more heart-healthy foods, like leafy greens or fish, your brain and blood flow benefit, too. That can keep your memory sharp and help you stay independent longer. So don’t worry if your earlier habits weren’t great before — what you do now still counts. It’s worth the effort at any age.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Eating well leads to feeling good, said &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.garagegymreviews.com/author/drraj" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Raj Dasgupta" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68498f31e4b0cf5f0c9aa069" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.garagegymreviews.com/author/drraj" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="12"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr. Raj Dasgupta&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, a quadruple board-certified physician specializing in internal medicine, pulmonology, critical care and sleep medicine, and chief medical adviser for Garage Gym Reviews. “You can feel better, move more easily and even manage chronic conditions more effectively just by improving your eating habits,” he said. “The body may not bounce back like it used to, but it’s still incredibly responsive to care — especially when you give it better fuel.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>HuffPost</author><pubDate>Tue, 24 Jun 2025 11:00:17 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinAFBVV95cUxPNC1QdEJJYVpOSTkyS1F2RzBvcG9TdmN1QllNcXo1WHJBeER6MXVtYnVSMXZHNXVwdk82emZ4dUUtR090QzFUc1pZZUV1SUZRRk9va1RhQWtDY3J4cW94RE9WOWg5QUFVWFBvRkNzNE9UY1c4dWFCOUlfVFJkWVdJbXZEU2NwejZBU3A0WDQxci02TDhqQkF5Um8xOFjSAaIBQVVfeXFMUFZRbjRmNC1sMzVtNDMxbjdFTEpnNU9mSGk4cVRmZy12QTFTcGpHRGVBT29xRENHUnZlOXl0VE1VdWtfazhaRE1STEpZZUdoUXdLSE5tenFLTW13d1p5c1p1LU9YTVR1ZFpDZDcwMm9OaTB0S1VEWVY1VEFyemVGY0RsRk93SW12TVBKYjNlVnp5eWwtMUhZNElBbThreFRGQnZ3</guid></item><item><title>专家说，这7种微妙的行为可能是伪装的“肥胖症” - HuffPost | Experts Say These 7 Subtle Behaviors Might Be 'Bigorexia' In Disguise - HuffPost</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikwFBVV95cUxOdW9XREFqX3poaGNLRDRXY05FOVUwNGcxR3lzWE81UWRmSzRVWVh5eUNONVNIOVY3WkktSUtJR3Q4Mk1ENmlqanlmMlZsWUFVb1kxbjJaazVyQ2JBd1RzTVdZQlNDd3BjSnY5cXRzTVlYbnZRM01EbjFqV0NJd0ZxbnZod2syMWFyTXlyVWYzTDltbTjSAZgBQVVfeXFMUG1wUmRITGNEOFI2cHBwbHJVSXBVUXpyTEtiZnpWNmoxS08xTHB1WFZ3bk54RHJ0TVBRYzRtdGpNSHB2VGFyd21hOUNZMzE5TVJKTVQtWG5laDd0U2l0aFpsU1hLcUZpbno4NVotZUdvdER4NWVKeGtjMlJIRUxta2ZSVGRoX05GNXNjNzFNZFEtM2xMY0ZIV24?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="entry__content-list js-entry-content js-cet-subunit"&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to body image disorders, the idea of a teenage or young woman probably comes to mind.

They may view themselves as puny even if they are objectively muscular,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roughly 90% of those with bigorexia are young men, said &lt;a href="https://www.bryant.edu/academics/faculty/trunzo-joseph" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Joseph Trunzo" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="685951fee4b0833f89bf46da" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.bryant.edu/academics/faculty/trunzo-joseph" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="2"&gt;Joseph Trunzo&lt;/a&gt;, a clinical psychologist and the associate director of the School of Health and Behavioral Sciences at Bryant University in Rhode Island. &lt;a href="https://www.allianceforeatingdisorders.com/have-you-heard-about-bigorexia/" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="It mostly impacts" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="685951fee4b0833f89bf46da" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.allianceforeatingdisorders.com/have-you-heard-about-bigorexia/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="3"&gt;It mostly impacts&lt;/a&gt; between ages 15 to 32.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;While seeing a muscular young man isn’t as shocking as seeing folks with some other body image or eating disorders, it can be just as damaging both physically and mentally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Below, experts share the warning signs of bigorexia and what to do if you suspect a loved one is dealing with it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Exercising compulsively. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exercise is, of course, a good thing when done properly and in moderation — it benefits &lt;a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/heart/physical-activity/benefits" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="cardiovascular health" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="685951fee4b0833f89bf46da" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/heart/physical-activity/benefits" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="4"&gt;cardiovascular health&lt;/a&gt;, mental health, &lt;a href="https://www.niams.nih.gov/health-topics/exercise-your-bone-health" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="bone health" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="685951fee4b0833f89bf46da" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.niams.nih.gov/health-topics/exercise-your-bone-health" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="5"&gt;bone health&lt;/a&gt; and more. But in folks with bigorexia, exercise can become an obsession.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Trunzo, if your child is constantly exercising or doing it too frequently, you should take notice. This may look like hours and hours spent at the gym each day or long periods of time in your basement home gym.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Young people struggling with bigorexia tend to turn to certain kinds of exercise, he noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Bigorexia predominantly focuses on musculature and muscle size and muscle gain. So you don’t really see these kids doing long track workouts and running marathons,” explained Trunzo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of focusing on stamina or even weight loss, people with bigorexia are trying to develop superhero-like physique, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;This also might look like guilt when they aren’t at the gym, said Nagata.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Again, physical activity is supposed to be good for our health, but for people with muscle dysmorphia, it becomes a chore, it becomes a preoccupation, and they feel bad and guilty if they’re not at the gym all the time,” Nagata explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond the actual exercise, it’s how the exercise makes them feel, Nagata added. If your child is complaining that they feel bad that they didn’t go to the gym today or are overly upset when they miss a workout regimen, take note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Withdrawing from activities they normally like.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Muscle dysmorphia is a mental health condition, so it often leads to disruptions in quality of life, daily functioning,” said Nagata.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;These young men often become so obsessed with their fitness routine or their eating regimen that it also impacts their social life, their school work or their actual work if they’re in the workforce, Nagata added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s generally some sort of impairment in functioning [and] lower quality of life,” he noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may see your loved one withdrawing from things they normally enjoy, whether that’s movie night with their friends or a trip with their cousins. And this is because of issues with their body appearance and what they “need” to do to follow their strict rules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Becoming upset if it’s suggested that they break their diet plan.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Someone with bigorexia often has a preoccupation with dieting and calorie intake, according to Trunzo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Often they’ll religiously count their calories or their macros in a restrictive way, and even if they’re trying to bulk up, they’ll refuse to eat certain foods if they don’t help build muscle (think of ingredients with high sugar levels).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;No matter what, they likely have strong food rules that don’t allow for much leeway. And if there is a deviation from their set food plan or ideal caloric intake, they’ll likely get mad or upset, Trunzo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the restrictive food days, someone with bigorexia may also allow themselves to have a “cheat day” when they can eat whatever they want, but that is problematic, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s really a lot of overlap with that and binge eating, but it’s just been kind of reclaimed or rebranded in a positive light, but some of the behaviors themselves can still have health risks,” said Nagata.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Not eating enough food to fuel their workouts.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Food is designed to fuel us, and the more you exercise, the more you need to consume. But for someone with bigorexia, their high levels of exercise likely don’t match their pretty normal intake of food, said Nagata.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The [food] intake is very, very low, and that leads to the starvation state in bigorexia, some of these individuals may have a ‘normal’ food intake ... but the energy output is often massive,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;While they may be eating a diet that is sufficient for someone who exercises regularly, but not excessively, it’s not enough food for someone who is constantly at the gym. This can have devastating consequences on the body, such as entering into a starvation of malnutrition state, said Nagata.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Darrin Klimek via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Darrin Klimek via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;A young man with bigorexia may spend hours and hours weightlifting to bulk up.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Taking lots of supplements and protein powders.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s common for young people with bigorexia to engage in excessive supplement use, which includes taking over-the-counter products from stores like GNC and your local pharmacy, in addition to protein powders, said Trunzo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;While these products are legal, as with other &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/fda-101-dietary-supplements" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="supplements in this country" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="685951fee4b0833f89bf46da" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/fda-101-dietary-supplements" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="6"&gt;supplements in this country&lt;/a&gt;, “most of them are not regulated by the Food and Drug Administration,” said Nagata.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So, you can buy them online, you can often buy them at grocery stores or just over the counter, but because of current laws and lack of regulation, actually anything in the supplement category is not really rigorously tested for safety or effectiveness,” Nagata added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;These products can be tainted or mislabeled, Nagata said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you (or your child) do take supplements, look for USP-certified or NSF-certified products, because this rating guarantees safety, &lt;a href="https://linkedin-learning.pxf.io/c/2706071/449670/8005?subId1=641b040de4b0bc5cb653b13f&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fin%2Fgina-milano-rdn-4615b8b8&amp;amp;subId3=xid:fr1750699954074faf" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Gina Milano" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="685951fee4b0833f89bf46da" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://linkedin-learning.pxf.io/c/2706071/449670/8005?subId1=641b040de4b0bc5cb653b13f&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fin%2Fgina-milano-rdn-4615b8b8&amp;amp;subId3=xid:fr1750699954074faf" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="7"&gt;Gina Milano&lt;/a&gt;, a clinical dietitian at Stanford Health Care in California &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/magnesium-sleep-stress-social-media-trend_l_641b040de4b0bc5cb653b13f" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="previously told HuffPost" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="685951fee4b0833f89bf46da" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="641b040de4b0bc5cb653b13f" data-vars-target-content-type="buzz" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="8"&gt;previously told HuffPost&lt;/a&gt;.

Taking anabolic steroids.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The use of anabolic steroids, which &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/5521-anabolic-steroids" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="are comprised of man-made testosterone" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="685951fee4b0833f89bf46da" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/5521-anabolic-steroids" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="10"&gt;are comprised of man-made testosterone&lt;/a&gt; and increase muscle gains in those who use them, is also common among those with bigorexia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“To me, the use of anabolic steroids is a red flag in itself,” said Nagata.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They are illegal in the U.S., and they have significant health consequences that can lead to heart complications or liver damage, kidney problems, and in teenagers, steroid use can actually lead to stunted growth and height, and there’s a lot of brain effects as well,” Nagata added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Roid rage” goes hand-in-hand with steroid use and is marked by aggression and irritability, Nagata added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. Constantly checking their appearance in the mirror.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mirror checking often is associated with eating disorders like anorexia, but is also seen in young men with bigorexia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They’re always looking at themselves in the mirror, and checking their physical appearance,” said Trunzo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;This isn’t the occasional peek in the mirror to make sure your hair is in place and your shirt isn’t too wrinkled, instead, it’s obsessively looking in every nearby mirror and reflective surface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overall, pressure from social media is a big driver of bigorexia. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Years ago, the average person didn’t have a view into a celebrity’s or influencer’s everyday routine. Aside from movies or print news articles, there wasn’t any more insight into a famous person’s life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, though, social media gives everyone — kids included — a peek into the exercise routines, food regimens and daily life of rich and famous people. And this only hurts a kid’s body image, both experts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The constant bombardment from social media, I think, has been a real driver in the increases that we’re seeing in kids having these issues with body dysmorphic disorder, and specifically with bigorexia,” said Trunzo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s not realistic to think that your child will be shielded from social media forever, so instead of avoiding the topic, address it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As a parent, you want to know what your kid is seeing on social media, what they’re seeing on TV, or what they’re seeing in the movies, and then you want to talk to them about that,” Trunzo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Trunzo, you can do this by asking them how they think a certain celebrity looks in a picture. If the child responds with something like, “They look great, I wish I looked like that,” explain to them what goes into these seemingly unposed photos — such as editing, lighting, private chefs, personal trainers and plastic surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s never too early to start having these kinds of discussions with your child, said Trunzo. This way, they’ll understand that what they’re looking at, whether on TikTok or in a movie, isn’t real and isn’t how they should aim to look.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here’s what to do if a loved one shows any of the above signs of bigorexia:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, understand that bigorexia is a serious mental health condition that can cause huge physical and mental health implications, said Nagata.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you have concerns, you should get professional help,” Nagata said. Your primary care provider or pediatrician is a good place to start as they can conduct assessments and evaluation, and provide referrals, he noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think, in general, muscle dysmorphia is — and eating disorders are — best supported by an interdisciplinary team, including a mental health, medical and nutrition provider,” Nagata said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost hidden hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title default-title"&gt;20 Years Of Free Journalism&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-once-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-canceled-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message-container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message support-huffpost__message--control"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth. &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/support" class="cli-support-huffpost__message__link js-entry-link" data-vars-item-name="Support our mission" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="main" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="/support" data-vars-target-content-type="feed" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="12"&gt;Support our mission&lt;/a&gt; to keep us around for the next 20 — we can't do this without you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message variation contributor-once-variation"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We remain committed to providing you with the unflinching, fact-based journalism everyone deserves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you again for your support along the way.

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IN A NUTSHELL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;🔬 Scientists at King’s College London have developed a revolutionary &lt;strong&gt;nanoneedle patch&lt;/strong&gt; that is thinner than a human hair, enabling painless biopsies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;💉 The patch collects detailed &lt;strong&gt;molecular information&lt;/strong&gt; from tissues without cutting or scarring, offering a non-invasive alternative to traditional biopsies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;🧠 This innovation could transform &lt;strong&gt;disease diagnosis&lt;/strong&gt; and monitoring, particularly for conditions like brain cancer and Alzheimer’s, through real-time molecular analysis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;🤝 Developed through interdisciplinary collaboration, the patch promises faster, more accurate medical decisions, heralding a new era of &lt;strong&gt;personalized medicine&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biopsies have long been a necessary but often painful procedure for diagnosing various medical conditions. However, a revolutionary new development from scientists at King’s College London promises to change this narrative. A microscopic patch, bristling with nanoneedles and thinner than a human hair, offers a pain-free alternative to traditional biopsies. This breakthrough could transform how diseases like cancer and Alzheimer’s are diagnosed and monitored, eliminating the need for invasive procedures that often involve scalpels and needles. The potential implications for patient care and medical diagnostics are profound and far-reaching.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Revolutionary Patch: A Leap in Medical Technology&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nanoneedle-studded patch represents a significant advancement in medical technology. Unlike traditional biopsies that require removing tissue samples, this patch painlessly collects detailed molecular data from tissues without cutting or scarring. The patch’s nanoneedles are roughly 1,000 times thinner than a human hair, allowing them to extract molecular “fingerprints” such as lipids, proteins, and mRNA directly from living cells. This method offers an unprecedented level of detail and accuracy in molecular diagnostics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developed through a collaboration involving experts in nanoengineering, clinical oncology, cell biology, and artificial intelligence, this patch could revolutionize personalized medicine. By providing a real-time window into disease progression and treatment response, it allows for more accurate and timely medical decisions. The ability to sample the same tissue multiple times, without destroying it, is a significant advancement over traditional biopsy techniques. This innovation holds promise for improving outcomes for patients with complex conditions like brain cancer and Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="ZEcurf0NMO"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.rudebaguette.com/en/2025/06/quantum-laws-just-got-twisted-u-s-engineers-use-entangled-light-to-project-mind-bending-3d-holograms-in-real-time/"&gt;“Quantum Laws Just Got Twisted”: U.S. Engineers Use Entangled Light to Project Mind-Bending 3D Holograms in Real Time&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Transforming Disease Monitoring and Treatment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The implications of this nanoneedle patch extend beyond mere diagnostics. It could fundamentally change how diseases are tracked and treated. By enabling frequent, non-invasive sampling, doctors can make faster, more informed decisions about surgeries and treatment plans. For instance, in brain surgery, the patch allows surgeons to quickly assess molecular data from suspicious areas, enabling more precise and targeted interventions. This capability reduces delays in treatment and improves surgical outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The patch’s potential for integration into everyday medical devices, such as contact lenses and bandages, further enhances its utility. Manufactured using techniques similar to those used for computer chips, these nanoneedles can be mass-produced, making them accessible for widespread medical use. This innovation could soon bring diagnosis and monitoring directly to the skin’s surface, offering a seamless and efficient way to manage health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="Rhjv9KfoTa"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.rudebaguette.com/en/2025/06/not-china-not-the-u-s-this-surprising-nation-now-tops-the-world-in-rd-spending-and-is-quietly-rewriting-the-innovation-map/"&gt;Not China, Not the U.S.: This Surprising Nation Now Tops the World in R&amp;amp;D Spending and Is Quietly Rewriting the Innovation Map&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Collaborative Efforts and Future Prospects&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of this nanoneedle patch is a testament to the power of interdisciplinary collaboration. By bringing together experts from various fields, this project has achieved a breakthrough that could redefine medical diagnostics. In preclinical studies, the patch has already demonstrated its effectiveness on brain cancer tissue and mouse models, with promising results that suggest real-world applications are not far off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Ciro Chiappini, the lead author of the study, emphasizes the patch’s potential to revolutionize disease diagnosis and monitoring. By offering a painless and efficient alternative to traditional biopsies, this technology could significantly improve patient experiences and outcomes. As the patch moves towards clinical application, it holds the promise of transforming how diseases are diagnosed and managed, making personalized medicine a tangible reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A New Era in Painless Diagnostics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The introduction of the nanoneedle patch marks a significant step forward in the quest for painless medical diagnostics. As this technology continues to develop, it could lead to the end of painful biopsies, providing a safer and more comfortable experience for patients. The ability to diagnose and monitor diseases without invasive procedures opens new avenues for medical care and treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research, published in Nature Nanotechnology, has garnered attention for its potential to change the landscape of medical diagnostics. By enabling faster and more accurate disease tracking, this technology could help doctors and patients make better, more informed decisions. As we move forward, the question remains: how will this breakthrough in nanotechnology reshape the future of personalized medicine and patient care?&lt;/p&gt;

However, this process can be hindered by chronic stress, poor diet, and lack of proper recovery.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to detox cortisol&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;1. Cut back on caffeine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The frustrating thing about excess cortisol is that it creates a “wired but tired” feeling, and can have you reaching for the coffee pot more than usual. This creates a self-sustaining cycle of fatigue, caffeine, stress, and more fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-bkChBi byNLHx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“&lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/is-coffee-good-for-you" target="_blank"&gt;Coffee&lt;/a&gt; is a stimulant which will raise cortisol levels,” explains Relf. “This isn’t necessarily a bad thing, however, if we consume it too often and in too large quantities, then it can cause consistently elevated cortisol levels. This can have a knock-on effect on other hormones, creating greater imbalances.” That said, you don’t need to cut it out entirely. Cutting back will have a marked positive effect, as will waiting to &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/when-is-the-right-time-to-drink-coffee" target="_blank"&gt;drink caffeine&lt;/a&gt; until after you’ve eaten breakfast. And there are always &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/best-coffee-alternatives-for-a-healthy-energy-boost" target="_blank"&gt;caffeine alternatives&lt;/a&gt; to explore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;2. Incorporate breathwork&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“&lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/breathwork-benefits" target="_blank"&gt;Breathwork&lt;/a&gt; activates the parasympathetic nervous system, which can counteract cortisol spikes,” says Dr. Osagie-Clouard. Similarly, practising mindfulness can help to lower the perception of stress, which can shift you from a reactionary state to a responsive one. To get started with breathwork, start by extending your exhale to be longer than your inhale. Or, there’s the “parasympathetic sigh,” which can help facilitate feelings of calm quickly. To do it, breathe in, then take a second sip of air just before you slowly exhale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;3. Move more&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regular exercise is recommended for almost everyone. The trick with excess cortisol, though, is to make sure the &lt;em&gt;type&lt;/em&gt; of exercise you choose doesn’t stress your body out more. “Gentle, consistent activity—like &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/walking-for-longevity" target="_blank"&gt;walking&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/yoga-boat-pose" target="_blank"&gt;yoga&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/reformer-pilates-guide" target="_blank"&gt;Pilates,&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/all-the-benefits-of-strength-training-for-women" target="_blank"&gt;strength training&lt;/a&gt;—regulates stress hormones better than high-intensity exercise and overtraining,” says Dr. Osagie-Clouard. So, don’t assume you need to spend hours in the gym. “Exercise has been shown to reduce cortisol levels and improve insulin sensitivity, which is key in the management of PCOS,” says Relf. Forget the idea of a perfect schedule, though. “Any movement is beneficial,” she points out. “So choose consistency over everything.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;4. Make sleep a priority&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most important and powerful things you can do for your body is get enough rest, between six and eight hours a night, as consistent, uninterrupted sleep will help to reset cortisol in the body. There has been some recent discussion about women needing more than eight hours during certain periods of their cycle, but this is yet to reach the mainstream. “Give yourself a regular bedtime and establish an evening routine that helps you unwind and relax in the lead up to bedtime,” suggests Relf.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;5. Rethink your nutrition&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eating in a way that keeps blood sugar stable can help to assuage the stress spikes and troughs associated with excess cortisol. “Think protein, fiber, and healthy fats,” recommends Dr. Osagie-Clouard. There are also &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/foods-that-naturally-lower-cortisol" target="_blank"&gt;cortisol-lowering foods&lt;/a&gt; to incorporate into your diet. This could look like pairing fruit with yogurt and seeds or nuts. Or, popping some peanut butter on a rice cake. The added fiber and fat will help slow down the absorption of carbohydrates and cause a smaller sugar spike.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>vogue.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 24 Jun 2025 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMia0FVX3lxTFAydXc4ZUN1T0xTbUpHY3pRSTNmd0NqTC1ZU1R4blBXVkpyUEY3TnFZeVZKZEVSdTVEUzJJN3dLN3RNMlNoU1NLWHdLRUFyc09BTmxlbDY4djJlQXN0Zk5DM2E3eVpzajZGakZR</guid></item><item><title>多少酒精可以缩短您的寿命？科学家揭示了令人震惊的数字-印度时报 | How much alcohol can shorten your life?

Far from being harmless in moderation, drinking—whether casually or regularly—has been shown to significantly shorten life expectancy and increase cancer risk. In a study published in the Journal of Studies on Alcohol and Drugs, lead researcher Dr. Tim Stockwell and his colleagues concluded that even small amounts of alcohol can be harmful. Dr. Stockwell later told the Daily Mail that as little as two drinks per week may shave off several days from your life, while regular drinking could cost you years. This shift in understanding is not only scientific but cultural, challenging decades of messaging that moderate drinking, particularly wine, might be good for your heart or longevity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;New research quantifies how alcohol consumption shortens your lifespan&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Tim Stockwell, a leading researcher in alcohol studies, has drawn attention to just how sharply alcohol impacts longevity. In media interviews following the study, he provided estimates that frame alcohol's toll in tangible terms:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Just 2 drinks per week might cut life expectancy by 3 to 6 days.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Consuming 7 drinks a week essentially one per day could cost you 2.5 months of life.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;At 35 drinks per week, the average individual could lose up to 2 years from their lifespan.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;These numbers are based on population averages, meaning the actual impact on an individual can vary depending on genetics, health and other habits. Still, the risk is clear. The new findings undermine earlier beliefs that a little alcohol may be protective, particularly for heart health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, they highlight a consistent dose-response relationship.

Men who believe they are safe because they only drink on weekends are often still over the risk thresholds, especially when binge-drinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;Debunking the red wine health myth&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;For years, red wine has enjoyed a reputation as the “healthy alcohol” thanks to its polyphenol content, particularly resveratrol, thought to support cardiovascular health. However, researchers like Dr. Croker clarify that these benefits do not outweigh the harms of alcohol itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of the same polyphenols in red wine are found in:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grapes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Berries&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Green tea&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coffee&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;So while the plant compounds are beneficial, consuming them through alcoholic drinks defeats the purpose. The WCRF now recommends avoiding alcohol altogether, including red wine, for those concerned about cancer or long-term health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The negative impact of alcohol far outweighs any perceived cardiovascular benefits,” says Dr. Croker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why men struggle more with cutting down&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Social norms and peer pressure play a significant role in male drinking habits. According to research by Professor Richard Cooke from Staffordshire University, men are less likely to think about their health and often feel pressured to match their friends’ drinking habits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="59"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 2025 WCRF survey found:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="61"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="62"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;25% of men feel judged or “boring” when they refuse drinks&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;1 in 5 men has called in sick after weekday drinking (vs. 1 in 10 women)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;50% of men use excuses not to drink rather than openly declining&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cooke’s advice includes setting personal motivations for cutting back, such as wanting to feel mentally sharper, avoiding hangovers or being a better role model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="64"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="65"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Smarter strategies for moderation&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="66"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of quitting entirely, many men may benefit from mindful drinking. Here are Cooke’s and WCRF’s top strategies:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="68"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="69"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Low or no-alcohol alternatives allow you to stay social without increasing cancer risk.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;“Bookending” start and end your night with non-alcoholic drinks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Spacing out drinking days your weekly total matters more than just weekend binges.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Track your units many underestimate their intake; apps and calculators can help.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="70"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="71"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The final word: it all adds up&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="72"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alcohol’s health effects are cumulative, meaning even low-level, long-term drinking increases your lifetime risk of disease and death. Experts now urge rethinking drinking norms, especially for men over 40, where health risks compound with age and weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="74"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;While a celebratory pint here and there is unlikely to do major harm, the science is clear.

 &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A leading nutritionist has warned how you brew your coffee could raise your risk of cancer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt; But, on the other hand, she added, coffee also contains 'fat-soluble diterpenes' that raise both cancer and heart disease risk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;That's because diterpenes are known to increase bad cholesterol 'in just a few weeks'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Bad' cholesterol, or LDL, is a fatty substance that builds up in blood vessels, interfering with blood flow to and from the heart, and raising the risk of damage to the organ. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Traditional paper drip and instant cold brew are both filtered brewing methods she recommended that can lower your risk of cancers and heart trouble.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'They trap diterpenes essentially eliminating their negative effects whilst still preserving beneficial polyphenols,' she explained. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, she warned against methods that use equipment containing harmful microplastics that can also work their way into your coffee.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Hot water to plastic will accelerate the release of microplastics into your beverage, as well as your plastic associated chemicals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt; 'So if you are going to do filtered coffee, pour over is probably your best bet. Doing something into a glass container and not having hot water touch plastic,' she added.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Unfiltered methods have been linked to cancer risk as it increases the chance harmful compounds can find their way into your cup &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The nutritionist also advised against using a french press, or any method that involves pouring boiling water over fresh coffee grounds&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She warned of similar risks of using popular espresso pods, explaining how chemicals are released when hot water runs through them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ms Patrick's warning comes after scientists discovered too much instant coffee could increase the risk of some types of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;That's because the popular caffeinated drink contains twice as much acrylamide than ground coffee — a chemical substance produced when some food, including coffee beans, is cooked at high temperatures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The product has been declared as a 'problem human carcinogen' by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), meaning there is evidence the chemical could cause cancer in humans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Laboratory tests revealed acrylamide in the diet causes lung and reproductive cancers in animals and scientists agree that it has the potential for similar effects in humans, according to the Food Standards Agency (FSA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A Polish study from 2013 that analysed 42 samples of coffee, including ten instant coffees, revealed instant coffee had double the amount of acrylamide than freshly ground coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, you would need to drink about ten cups of instant coffee a day for your intake of acrylamide to become a concern, according to researchers at McGill University in Canada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some 80 per cent of UK households buy instant coffee, particularly those aged over 65, according to research by the British Coffee Association. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

So it helps to keep stepping up your workouts to get the best results. “With all exercise, as your body adapts to the movement, it requires an increase in intensity and effort to continually progress,” Ellis says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Looking to take your walking workouts to the next level? Here’s what trainers recommend, plus why walking is so good for you in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="why-is-walking-so-good-for-you"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why is walking so good for you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;A flood of recent research has linked regular walks to impressive health benefits. A &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:6;pos:1" class="link " href="https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/early/2023/01/23/bjsports-2022-105669" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:British Journal of Sports Medicine;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:6;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;British Journal of Sports Medicine&lt;/a&gt; analysis of data from more than 30 million people found that those who did 75 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise (like brisk walking) per week had a 23% lower risk of dying early.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Another study, this one published in &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:7;pos:1" class="link " href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(24)00755-4/fulltext" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:the Lancet;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:7;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;the Lancet&lt;/a&gt;, tracked 700 adults with lower back pain for three years. The researchers found that those who were asked to follow a walking program for six months had fewer issues with back pain returning and more time between back pain flares than those who didn’t follow a walking routine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Walking can even support your mood. A &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:8;pos:1" class="link " href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/article-abstract/2720689" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:JAMA Psychiatry;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:8;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;JAMA Psychiatry&lt;/a&gt; study found that walking for an hour a day can reduce the risk of depression by 26%. “It also strengthens your muscles and bones and decreases the risks of chronic diseases too,” Pack says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="how-to-make-your-walks-more-challenging"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to make your walks more challenging&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Matheny stresses that any walks is better than none, especially if your activity level is currently lower than you’d prefer. But if you’re ready to kick the intensity up a notch, experts recommend doing these modifications to make your walking workouts more challenging:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold" data-jump-link-target="" id="push-the-pace"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Push the pace&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;It’s easy to get content with moving at whatever speed feels good to you. But if you feel comfortable at your current pace, it’s time to take things to the next level. “Increasing your pace will make it more challenging,” Pack says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Matheny suggests moving at a speed where you start to breathe more heavily and trying to maintain that. Taking &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/walk-faster-10-tips-picking-115102236.html" data-ylk="slk:shorter steps rather than longer strides;cpos:9;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;shorter steps rather than longer strides&lt;/a&gt;, as well as bending your elbows to about 90 degrees and pumping your arms for momentum, can help you maintain a faster clip. Once you feel good at faster speeds, he suggests that you push the pace to the point where you could almost break into a jog, while still sticking with a low-impact workout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;You can also track your speed with a fitness app to keep tabs on your progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold" data-jump-link-target="" id="do-interval-workouts"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do interval workouts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Interval training simply means alternating between low-intensity and high-intensity activity in a workout. “Interval training gives your body an opportunity to push itself while allowing for proper recovery in between intervals,” Ellis says. By keeping your body “guessing,” it can help to improve your fitness and calorie burn, Matheny says. “This is a great way to incorporate a low-impact ‘high-intensity interval training,’” Pack says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;There are a few ways to approach this. One is that you can simply move faster during your walks for a certain period of time, like a minute or two, before slowing down to recover and then speeding up again. But Matheny says you can also incorporate things like step-ups on a park bench during your walks to help quickly increase your heart rate, before continuing with your walk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold" data-jump-link-target="" id="add-more-distance--but-not-too-much-at-once"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Add more distance — but not too much at once&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Just like any form of exercise, ramping up the intensity or distance too fast raises the risk of injury. “Ten thousand steps a day is the sweet spot,” Pack says. “But for someone who may only be at 3,000 steps a day, they can gradually add more distance over time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;She suggests adding an additional 1,000 steps a week until you hit your target step count. “Maybe the first goal is to hit 4,000 a day for a week; then 5,000 the next week,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold" data-jump-link-target="" id="use-weights--but-not-hand-weights"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use weights — but not hand weights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Matheny recommends adding weights to your walks to push yourself “after you feel like you can't walk any faster.” But experts agree that &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/should-you-be-wearing-a-weighted-vest-on-your-daily-walks-100017788.html" data-ylk="slk:a weighted vest is a better option;cpos:10;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;a weighted vest is a better option&lt;/a&gt; than using hand weights. “Hand weights can throw off your normal walking gait,” raising the risk of injury, Matheny explains. “It doesn’t give you a good arm workout either,” he adds. Pack agrees. “A vest gives equal weight distribution; hand weights may not and could be harder on joints,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Many weighted vests allow you to add more weights over time to increase the intensity, giving you plenty of mileage out of this investment. “Wearing a weighted vest and adding resistance is a great option to challenge your body during walks,” Ellis says. “That improves bone density and strengthens your core musculature.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold" data-jump-link-target="" id="crank-up-the-incline"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Crank up the incline&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;This is easier if you’re on a treadmill, but you can also walk up hills outside.

But &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="link " href="https://www.instagram.com/runningsoles_/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Almoni Ellis;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;Almoni Ellis&lt;/a&gt;, a personal trainer in Chesapeake, Va., tells Yahoo Life that your body adapts to become more efficient the more you walk. So it helps to keep stepping up your workouts to get the best results. “With all exercise, as your body adapts to the movement, it requires an increase in intensity and effort to continually progress,” Ellis says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Looking to take your walking workouts to the next level? Here’s what trainers recommend, plus why walking is so good for you in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="why-is-walking-so-good-for-you"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why is walking so good for you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;A flood of recent research has linked regular walks to impressive health benefits. A &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:6;pos:1" class="link " href="https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/early/2023/01/23/bjsports-2022-105669" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:British Journal of Sports Medicine;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:6;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;British Journal of Sports Medicine&lt;/a&gt; analysis of data from more than 30 million people found that those who did 75 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise (like brisk walking) per week had a 23% lower risk of dying early.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Another study, this one published in &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:7;pos:1" class="link " href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(24)00755-4/fulltext" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:the Lancet;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:7;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;the Lancet&lt;/a&gt;, tracked 700 adults with lower back pain for three years. The researchers found that those who were asked to follow a walking program for six months had fewer issues with back pain returning and more time between back pain flares than those who didn’t follow a walking routine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Walking can even support your mood. A &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:8;pos:1" class="link " href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/article-abstract/2720689" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:JAMA Psychiatry;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:8;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;JAMA Psychiatry&lt;/a&gt; study found that walking for an hour a day can reduce the risk of depression by 26%. “It also strengthens your muscles and bones and decreases the risks of chronic diseases too,” Pack says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="how-to-make-your-walks-more-challenging"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to make your walks more challenging&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Matheny stresses that any walks is better than none, especially if your activity level is currently lower than you’d prefer. But if you’re ready to kick the intensity up a notch, experts recommend doing these modifications to make your walking workouts more challenging:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold" data-jump-link-target="" id="push-the-pace"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Push the pace&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;It’s easy to get content with moving at whatever speed feels good to you. But if you feel comfortable at your current pace, it’s time to take things to the next level. “Increasing your pace will make it more challenging,” Pack says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Matheny suggests moving at a speed where you start to breathe more heavily and trying to maintain that. Taking &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/walk-faster-10-tips-picking-115102236.html" data-ylk="slk:shorter steps rather than longer strides;cpos:9;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;shorter steps rather than longer strides&lt;/a&gt;, as well as bending your elbows to about 90 degrees and pumping your arms for momentum, can help you maintain a faster clip. Once you feel good at faster speeds, he suggests that you push the pace to the point where you could almost break into a jog, while still sticking with a low-impact workout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;You can also track your speed with a fitness app to keep tabs on your progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold" data-jump-link-target="" id="do-interval-workouts"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do interval workouts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Interval training simply means alternating between low-intensity and high-intensity activity in a workout. “Interval training gives your body an opportunity to push itself while allowing for proper recovery in between intervals,” Ellis says. By keeping your body “guessing,” it can help to improve your fitness and calorie burn, Matheny says. “This is a great way to incorporate a low-impact ‘high-intensity interval training,’” Pack says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;There are a few ways to approach this. One is that you can simply move faster during your walks for a certain period of time, like a minute or two, before slowing down to recover and then speeding up again. But Matheny says you can also incorporate things like step-ups on a park bench during your walks to help quickly increase your heart rate, before continuing with your walk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold" data-jump-link-target="" id="add-more-distance--but-not-too-much-at-once"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Add more distance — but not too much at once&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Just like any form of exercise, ramping up the intensity or distance too fast raises the risk of injury. “Ten thousand steps a day is the sweet spot,” Pack says. “But for someone who may only be at 3,000 steps a day, they can gradually add more distance over time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;She suggests adding an additional 1,000 steps a week until you hit your target step count. “Maybe the first goal is to hit 4,000 a day for a week; then 5,000 the next week,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold" data-jump-link-target="" id="use-weights--but-not-hand-weights"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use weights — but not hand weights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Matheny recommends adding weights to your walks to push yourself “after you feel like you can't walk any faster.” But experts agree that &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/should-you-be-wearing-a-weighted-vest-on-your-daily-walks-100017788.html" data-ylk="slk:a weighted vest is a better option;cpos:10;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;a weighted vest is a better option&lt;/a&gt; than using hand weights. “Hand weights can throw off your normal walking gait,” raising the risk of injury, Matheny explains. “It doesn’t give you a good arm workout either,” he adds. Pack agrees. “A vest gives equal weight distribution; hand weights may not and could be harder on joints,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Many weighted vests allow you to add more weights over time to increase the intensity, giving you plenty of mileage out of this investment. “Wearing a weighted vest and adding resistance is a great option to challenge your body during walks,” Ellis says. “That improves bone density and strengthens your core musculature.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold" data-jump-link-target="" id="crank-up-the-incline"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Crank up the incline&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;This is easier if you’re on a treadmill, but you can also walk up hills outside. Walking on an incline “will increase your heart rate and can incorporate more glutes and hamstring involvement,” Pack says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;If you’re on a treadmill, she recommends walking at different inclines to switch up the challenge. So that could mean walking at an incline of five, before switching to eight and then back to five, all in the same workout.

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;The social media platform TikTok recently banned a hashtag called #SkinnyTok after European regulators warned it was promoting &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/04/28/1263527105/steroids-men-body-image" target="_blank"&gt;unrealistic body images &lt;/a&gt;and extreme weight loss.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;The company had seen an onslaught of content featuring emaciated-looking young women peddling tips on how to drop weight quickly.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Now the hashtag may be gone, but eliminating this kind of harmful content is not that simple. There's still no shortage of people — on TikTok and other social media platforms — spreading unhealthy information on how to eat fewer calories and get very, very thin.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Research shows that consuming this type of content on social media &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5003636/" target="_blank"&gt;is correlated to&lt;/a&gt; a higher risk of disordered eating. Young women and girls are especially vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;But when it comes to nutrition and wellness, it can be hard to disentangle the unhealthy from the healthy.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"You have many kinds of content in the gray zones," says &lt;a href="https://www.brookeduffy.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Brooke Erin Duffy&lt;/a&gt;, who studies social media and culture at Cornell University. "Their regulation is much more difficult."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Creators are good at taking advantage of this murky ground, says Duffy. "As soon as there is an attempt for platforms to regulate or thwart a hashtag, anyone using the platform is gonna develop a workaround," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A popular meme called "What I eat in a day," for example, features people showing their daily food intake. Posts can either feature a balanced diet or one that could put someone in a dangerous calorie deficit. One young woman recently posted a video showing the single croissant she subsisted on in a day, whereas a different woman featured a balance of lean proteins and vegetables adding up to 1,800 calories.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Body-positive counterprogramming&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Some creators on the front lines of the body image battle are making their own counterprogramming. Athlete and creator Kate Glavan — who has nearly 150,000 followers — urges her followers to take seriously the dangers of content that glamorizes undernourishment.  She discusses her own struggle with an eating disorder in her videos.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"A lot of creators are explicitly promoting anorexia to their audience," Glavan says in &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@kateglavan/video/7380018730572451115" target="_blank"&gt;a recent TikTok video&lt;/a&gt;. "It's dangerous. It's misinformed," she says, and she advises people to "block these creators."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Research shows that anorexia has &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8429328/" target="_blank"&gt;the highest mortality rate&lt;/a&gt; of any psychiatric disorder.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But researchers who study this issue say &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/10/17/1196978085/nprs-book-of-the-day-draft-10-17-2023" target="_blank"&gt;body-positive content&lt;/a&gt; doesn't garner the same kinds of audiences — or profit. "Negative images that are unrealistic or show really thin people or really muscular people tend to have a more lasting impact than body-positive content&lt;strong&gt;," &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://nutrisci.med.utoronto.ca/faculty/amanda-raffoul" target="_blank"&gt;says Amanda Raffoul,&lt;/a&gt; who researches eating disorders and social media at the University of Toronto.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Messaging that equates thinness with beauty is reinforced throughout society, Raffoul says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Raffoul points to&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1471015323000223" target="_blank"&gt; research that suggests&lt;/a&gt; consumption of body-positive content on social media does not necessarily provide protection against or counteract content that promotes unrealistic beauty standards or weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The way that they structure content and the way that they code algorithms to amplify certain types of messaging and even target certain types of messaging to specific users puts that information in the hands of more vulnerable people," Raffoul says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Even though platforms aren't creating content, says Raffoul, they are responsible for how &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/01/17/1224955473/social-media-algorithm-filterworld" target="_blank"&gt;aggressively they amplify&lt;/a&gt; different kinds of messaging or direct it at certain demographics.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;TikTok declined a request for an interview for this story, but in an emailed statement stressed that they "regularly review safety measures to address evolving risks and have blocked search results for #skinnytok since it has become linked to unhealthy weight loss content." Searches on the platform for this term are redirected to the &lt;a href="https://www.allianceforeatingdisorders.com/" target="_blank"&gt;National Alliance for Eating Disorders&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Among other safety strategies, the company says it continues to restrict videos for teen accounts and redirect searches to health experts, as well as partner with advocacy groups that offer strategies around recognizing and treating eating disorders.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;A losing battle&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Some body-positive warriors say the movement is having a low moment. "With the massive &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/05/13/1198912257/weight-loss-drugs-ozempic-hollywood-body-positvity-future-us-obesity-shortage" target="_blank"&gt;rise of GLP-1 drugs&lt;/a&gt; and their widespread use as a quick fix weight loss solution, we've seen this return of the narrative that thin is back in," says &lt;a href="https://www.meganjaynecrabbe.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Megan Jayne Crabbe,&lt;/a&gt; author of the recently published book &lt;em&gt;We Don't Make Ourselves Smaller Here. "&lt;/em&gt;The beauty standard has swung back towards extreme slimness," Crabbe says.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;While Crabbe still creates content on social media, she says it's harder to break through with messaging that normalizes bigger bodies than it was a few years ago. She is glad to see #Skinnytok banned, but she says she sees a need for more soul searching on the question of beauty standards from Western culture.  "I think banning the hashtag is a surface-level plaster to a very deep wound," she says. "We are still deeply fat phobic as a society."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Some content creators say the uphill battle against negative content around eating and skinny bodies is exhausting. "I don't really claim it anymore," says &lt;a href="https://the-dots.com/users/nyome-nicholas-williams-77718" target="_blank"&gt;Nyome Nicholas-Williams,&lt;/a&gt; of the term "body positivity." Nicholas-Williams — a Black woman and a plus-size model — says she feels pushed out of the movement that Black women started but she says has since &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9589104/#s3" target="_blank"&gt;been co-opted&lt;/a&gt;. "I'm more of like 'body neutrality,'" she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In 2020, Nicholas-Williams &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/oct/25/instagram-row-over-plus-size-model-forces-change-to-nudity-policy" target="_blank"&gt;publicly took on&lt;/a&gt; the social media platform Instagram, accusing the company of censoring content featuring Black plus-size models with different standards than those it used to police content featuring white, slim people. The company issued an apology and pledged to change its policies.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Nicholas-Williams says some of her public criticism of the social media platform has likely cost her business, but she thinks speaking out against dangerous content is an important strategy in combating it.  "People speaking up and being brave," she says, "that's what it takes."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Raffoul, who studies nutrition and social media at the University of Toronto, says the profit should not be overlooked. "Every second, every minute that we spend on these platforms is being monetized," says Raffoul, who points out that eating disorders and ideals around unattainable thinness have been around for decades, but that social media platforms allow for a new delivery system.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Raffoul believes it will take lawmakers forcing change in order to create meaningful protection from dangerous content through these new channels.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Until that happens, she says, the best strategy to combat it is not to look at it at all.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Debunking a common fear about kids’ vaccines - STAT</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMisgFBVV95cUxOeFJiaGw2YVBRcWNHRFFJVDlXZUhxc1hwMnJ2Y2p5RW5uNGJrcTFoMnFPSmdHampMRmVjNTk1Q0NaMnM0YUs4VWZKNTg1b2kwMHd5aHdiQWtsdktRdVVuZERFSUk4ODVXWDJGS2UzcjR3bGZIdUNBS1dRTzl6ZTNjaEZZZk9oNjhBcmFPcS1FZXFmX2ZMdFFnMXJpN2pJVHZfTFNWZUllY0x2LVE3LXoyREVn?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content the-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-flow wp-block-post-content-is-layout-flow"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1986, a typical child was recommended to receive 11 vaccine doses — seven injections and four oral. Today, that number has risen to 50 to 54 doses by age 18, depending on whether one or two flu shots are given in the first eligible year, and on a few product- and age-specific factors that determine whether a child receives two or three HPV doses, three or four Hib doses, or two or three rotavirus doses. That’s a substantial increase in the number of shots, which is why some are alarmed by the idea of “too many, too soon.” But the science should offer worried parents a great deal of comfort.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As an infectious diseases physician who directs an antibiotic stewardship program, I’m constantly weighing the benefits and risks of medical interventions — much like  parents weighing vaccine decisions for their children. And as a parent of two young kids myself, I understand why parents don’t want their children to receive anything that isn’t clearly indicated, and I share that commitment to evidence-based decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So, when parents ask me whether their kids are getting too many vaccines I take the question seriously and look at the data.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And those data reveal one of the most striking paradoxes in modern medicine, something that most people — including many health care providers — don’t know: Despite this significant increase in injections, today’s vaccines expose children to a fraction of the immune-stimulating material that previous generations encountered.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To understand why, we need to know what antigens are. An antigen is any protein or molecule that your immune system recognizes as foreign. When you get a vaccine, the antigens in it teach your immune system to identify and fight specific diseases. Think of antigens as the “mug shots” your immune system uses to recognize threats.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One hundred years ago, children received exactly one vaccine: smallpox. That single shot contained approximately 200 different antigens. Today’s &lt;em&gt;entire&lt;/em&gt; pediatric schedule exposes a child to about 165 — a fraction of the more than 3,200 in a single 1980s pertussis shot.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;In 1986, children received vaccines protecting against seven diseases. Those vaccines exposed them to over 3,200 antigens — mostly from a single shot of whole-cell DTP (diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis) that contained roughly every protein the pertussis bacterium could produce.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Today’s expanded schedule protects against 16-18 diseases, but the total antigen count is about 165. That’s about a 95% reduction in antigen exposure, thanks to precision engineering that strips vaccines down to only the components necessary for protection.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This isn’t theoretical. Vaccine expert Paul Offit and colleagues &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11773551/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;calculated&lt;/a&gt; that a baby could theoretically respond to 10,000 vaccines simultaneously before using even one percent of circulating B-cells. The real-world schedule barely registers on the immune system’s capacity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Since 1986, we’ve added vaccines against diseases that were killing and disabling thousands of children annually. Hib was the &lt;a href="https://www.chop.edu/vaccine-education-center/vaccine-details/haemophilus-influenzae-type-b-hib-vaccine" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;leading cause of meningitis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7336a4.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;severe bloodstream infections&lt;/a&gt; in infants. After conjugate vaccines were introduced for all infants in 1990, the disease was &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7336a4.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;virtually eliminated&lt;/a&gt; within a few years. Hepatitis B vaccination began in 1991 and has &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/evidence-to-recommendations/hepb-adults-etr.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;nearly eradicated childhood liver infections&lt;/a&gt; that can lead to cancer decades later. Pneumococcal conjugate vaccines introduced in 2000 &lt;a href="https://www-sciencedirect-com.laneproxy.stanford.edu/book/9780323790581/plotkins-vaccines" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;slashed rates of bloodstream infections and pneumonia&lt;/a&gt; in toddlers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The CDC &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7331a2.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;estimates&lt;/a&gt; that vaccinating children born from 1994 through 2023 will prevent approximately 508 million illnesses, 32 million hospitalizations, and 1.13 million deaths, resulting in $540 billion in direct savings and $2.7 trillion in societal costs. Each additional vaccine underwent rigorous testing and addressed a real public health need.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some who believe in the “too many, too soon” canard might say that the problem isn’t the antigens but the aluminum. But that fear is unfounded, too.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Aluminum salts have enhanced vaccine effectiveness since the 1930s, with doses tightly regulated by the FDA at no more than 0.85 mg per shot. In 1986, children received a total of about &lt;a href="https://www.chop.edu/vaccine-education-center/vaccine-safety/vaccine-ingredients/aluminum" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;1.5 mg of aluminum&lt;/a&gt; through their first six months from vaccines (the diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP) vaccine). Today, they &lt;a href="https://www.chop.edu/vaccine-education-center/vaccine-safety/vaccine-ingredients/aluminum" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;receive&lt;/a&gt; approximately 4.4 mg by 6 months and about 6 mg by age 2 — a modest increase over nearly 40 years.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For context, formula-fed infants ingest about &lt;a href="https://www.chop.edu/vaccine-education-center/vaccine-safety/vaccine-ingredients/aluminum" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;38 mg of aluminum&lt;/a&gt; in their first six months, though only about 1% is absorbed. Furthermore, well over half the aluminum from vaccines clears through healthy kidneys within days, more than 70% by two weeks, with the remainder eliminated over months in people with normal kidney function. While it’s true that aluminum from vaccines enters the bloodstream more directly than aluminum from food (most of which is not absorbed), the body &lt;a href="https://x.com/jakescottMD/status/1935034952674099481" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;processes it the same way&lt;/a&gt;. Once in the blood, aluminum binds to proteins like transferrin and is filtered by the kidneys, regardless of how it entered. Reassuringly, studies show that routine vaccination does not increase total blood aluminum levels, and total lifetime exposure from vaccines remains far lower than from diet.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Many newer vaccines contain zero aluminum: rotavirus, chickenpox, meningococcal conjugates, annual influenza, and mRNA Covid-19 vaccines, as well as RSV prevention shots, which are not technically vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The mismatch between perception and reality isn’t surprising. Going from about a dozen shots to over 50 feels overwhelming. Parents experiene more office visits and naturally assume a greater biological burden. Of course, some parents’ hesitation isn’t rooted in politics or science. It’s the emotional weight of watching their children cry, or their own fear of needles. Those feelings are entirely human. But knowing what today’s vaccines actually contain — and what they prevent — can help put that discomfort in perspective.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Medical training doesn’t help. Most physicians learn about vaccine schedules but not the underlying immunology. We’re taught to recommend vaccines, not to explain why a 1980s pertussis shot contained about 20 times more antigens than today’s entire schedule.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The public health community bears responsibility, too. We’ve focused on vaccine safety and effectiveness — both crucial — while neglecting to communicate the engineering advances that make modern vaccines so precise.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The solution isn’t to dismiss parental concerns but to arm families with actual data. The CDC lists vaccine ingredients online, but this information is often technical or not prominently displayed, making it hard for most parents to easily access or understand. Putting plain-language antigen and aluminum content directly on vaccine information sheets would cost little and build trust through transparency.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Innovation continues. Researchers are developing adjuvants using saponins, synthetic molecules, and emulsions that could eliminate aluminum entirely while maintaining vaccine effectiveness. Combination vaccines already reduce both needle sticks and total adjuvant exposure.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The numbers tell a remarkable story. Children today receive roughly four to five times as many shots as their 1986 counterparts, yet are exposed to 95% fewer antigens and only modest increases in aluminum. We’ve achieved far more protection with far less immune burden through decades of scientific precision.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This isn’t just a medical success story; it’s a lesson in how perception can diverge from reality. When parents see more visits and more needles, their instinct to worry is natural and understandable. But when we look at what actually matters to the immune system — the biological load, not the injection count — the data are reassuring.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In an era when medical misinformation spreads faster than the diseases vaccines prevent, transparency has become our most powerful tool. Show people that a single 1980s pertussis shot contained more antigens than today’s entire schedule, and watch skepticism transform into understanding.&lt;/p&gt;

Dylan Thomas Wakefield, 29, knew something wasn't right when he woke from his sleep with a ‘relentless searing pain’ in the upper left side of his stomach.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After his symptoms worsened, the dad of three drove himself to hospital, where he was admitted with suspected gastritis - stomach inflammation. But just three days later he was put into a coma after his blood pressure dropped "dangerously low" following his diagnosis of severe acute pancreatitis.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The pub landlord woke after two days - in that time he posted a heartbreaking message on social media revealing to friends this was the darkest chapter" of his life but he was not "giving up". But three weeks later he was put back into a coma and died on May 28.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;His brother Nathan Lamb, 31, said: "The whole ordeal has been a massive shock - we didn't think he would die from this. He was so young - it is so unfair.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"He was such a lovely brother to all of his nine siblings - all he wanted was for people to be happy and enjoying themselves at all times. He loved his family - we are all devastated that this has happened."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dylan was staying with his sister Caitlin Lamb, 27, when he woke with stomach ache on April 24 this year. As the pain grew stronger, Dylan decided to drive himself to King's Mill Hospital in Nottingham, as he was "barely holding himself together.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nathan has told that he was initially treated for gastritis, but a couple of hours later he was diagnosed with acute severe necrotising pancreatitis. The condition is the result of a significant portion of the pancreatic tissue dying due to inflammation and impaired blood supply.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Once he arrived, the dad was admitted into their care, but only three days later he was placed into an induced coma after his blood pressure dropped.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nathan said: "The doctors told us it was to let his body rest. They attached him to several machines and told us they would be taking over to let Dylan's body focus on getting stronger."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class="in-article-image" data-mod="image" data-orientation="portrait" data-tmdatatrack="inline-widget" data-tmdatatrack-articleid="31920514" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;To the family's delight, Dylan awoke two days later on April 29. Nathan recalled his still being "very poorly", but his condition began to stabilise a little. During this time Dylan posted a heartbreaking Facebook message telling friends and family he is awake on May 9.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The message read: "What started as feeling unwell quickly became unbearable — a searing, relentless pain in my stomach that I knew wasn’t normal.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Paramedics told me I was okay, but something inside me said otherwise. I drove myself to the hospital, barely holding it together. Hours later, I was diagnosed with chronic pancreatitis.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"My body began to shut down. The pain intensified. Things went from bad to life-threatening.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"I was put into a coma and for days, my family watched helplessly, not knowing if I would ever wake up again. They prayed. I fought.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"On April 29, I opened my eyes - but the fight is far from over. I’m still in the hospital. I’m still in pain. I can’t walk. I can’t eat. I’m facing a lifelong condition that has torn through my life in a matter of days.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"This has been the darkest chapter I’ve ever known — terrifying, humbling and utterly heartbreaking. Thank you to everyone who’s sent love, prayers, or even a thought my way. I’m still here and I’m not giving up."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class="in-article-image" data-mod="image" data-orientation="portrait" data-tmdatatrack="inline-widget" data-tmdatatrack-articleid="31920512" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;From the message he received more than 70 messages of support from his family and friends. But only three weeks later Dylan's health began to decline and he was placed into a second coma on May 25.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He later passed on May 28 - just over a month since he was admitted - leaving behind his three children, Lily, 12, Layton, nine and &lt;a data-content-type="section-topic" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/all-about/kingston"&gt;Kingston&lt;/a&gt;, six. Nathan said the cause of the pancreatitis hasn't been confirmed - but he believes it was due to alcohol intake.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He said: "Dylan liked a drink, but he was only 29 - issues like this you would think only start later in life. He has his whole future ahead of him - it is so unfair."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nathan has also said he was told by doctors there is "no known treatment" for the disease - they could only manage the side effects of the condition as well as Dylan's pain. Following Dylan's "shock" his friends have set up a crowdfunder to help expense his funeral.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class="in-article-image" data-mod="image" data-orientation="portrait" data-tmdatatrack="inline-widget" data-tmdatatrack-articleid="31920511" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;

Research suggested that regular use of certain types of commonly-prescribed drugs used to treat bladder conditions, Parkinson's disease and depression, could significantly increase the risk of dementia in later life.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The study, carried out by experts from the University of Nottingham and funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR), found that there was nearly a 50% increased risk of dementia among patients aged 55 and over who had used strong anticholinergic medication daily for three years or more.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Alzheimer's Society, when the study came out, commented: "Our own researchers have already shown a strong link between anticholinergic drugs and risk of dementia. This study builds on this information, showing that long-term, high-dose use increases risk of some dementias, particularly vascular dementia.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"A shortcoming of this type of study is that from this information we can't rule out whether the diseases that cause dementia might have already begun in the brains of people involved before they started taking these drugs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; "Current guidelines for doctors say that anticholinergic drugs should be avoided for frail older people because of their impact on memory and thinking, but doctors should consider these new findings for all middle aged and older people as long-term use could raise the risk of dementia."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Anticholinergic medications aid in the contraction and relaxation of muscles. They function by inhibiting acetylcholine, a chemical that transmits messages within the nervous system.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These drugs are prescribed by doctors to treat a range of conditions, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, bladder issues, allergies, gastrointestinal disorders, and symptoms of Parkinson's disease.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These medicines can have short-term side effects, such as confusion and memory loss, but it is less clear whether long-term use increases the risk of dementia. The research, led by Professor Carol Coupland from the University's Division of Primary Care and published in the JAMA Internal Medicine journal, examined the medical records of 58,769 patients diagnosed with dementia and 225,574 patients without a dementia diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;All patients were aged 55 and over and registered with UK GPs contributing data to the QResearch database, between 1 January 2004 and 31 January 2016. This study was first reported on in 2019.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The findings of the study indicated increased risks of dementia for anticholinergic drugs overall and specifically for the anticholinergic antidepressants, antipsychotic drugs, antiparkinsons drugs, bladder drugs and epilepsy drugs after accounting for other risk factors for dementia.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;No increased risks were found for the other types of anticholinergic drug studied such as antihistamines and gastrointestinal drugs. This study provides further evidence that doctors should be careful when prescribing certain drugs that have anticholinergic properties.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, it's important that patients taking medications of this kind don't just stop them abruptly as this may be much more harmful.

Each dementia case was matched to five control patients of the same age, sex, and general practice.Professor Coupland said: "Our study adds further evidence of the potential risks associated with strong anticholinergic drugs, particularly antidepressants, bladder antimuscarinic drugs, anti-Parkinson drugs and epilepsy drugs. " "The risks of this type of medication should be carefully considered by healthcare professionals alongside the benefits when the drugs are prescribed and alternative treatments should be considered where possible, such as other types of antidepressants or alternative types of treatment for bladder conditions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These findings also highlight the importance of carrying out regular medication reviews. We found a greater risk for people diagnosed with dementia before the age of 80 which indicates that anticholinergic drugs should be prescribed with caution in middle-aged people as well as in older people."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s Society: The six most common symptoms of dementia include: &lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Memory loss&lt;/b&gt; – problems recalling things that happened recently &lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Difficulty organising thoughts&lt;/b&gt; – struggling to make decisions, solve problems or follow steps &lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Problems with communication&lt;/b&gt; – difficulties following conversations or struggling to find the right words &lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Problems with vision&lt;/b&gt; – problems judging distances or perceiving object edges &lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Getting confused about time or place&lt;/b&gt; – losing track of the time or date, or becoming confused about where they are &lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Changes in mood or personality –&lt;/b&gt; becoming unusually anxious, irritable, or withdrawn &lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you’re worried about yourself, or someone close to you, then check your symptoms today.

Research suggested that regular use of certain types of commonly-prescribed drugs used to treat bladder conditions, Parkinson's disease and depression, could significantly increase the risk of dementia in later life.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The study, carried out by experts from the University of Nottingham and funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR), found that there was nearly a 50% increased risk of dementia among patients aged 55 and over who had used strong anticholinergic medication daily for three years or more.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Alzheimer's Society, when the study came out, commented: "Our own researchers have already shown a strong link between anticholinergic drugs and risk of dementia. This study builds on this information, showing that long-term, high-dose use increases risk of some dementias, particularly vascular dementia.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"A shortcoming of this type of study is that from this information we can't rule out whether the diseases that cause dementia might have already begun in the brains of people involved before they started taking these drugs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; "Current guidelines for doctors say that anticholinergic drugs should be avoided for frail older people because of their impact on memory and thinking, but doctors should consider these new findings for all middle aged and older people as long-term use could raise the risk of dementia."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Anticholinergic medications aid in the contraction and relaxation of muscles. They function by inhibiting acetylcholine, a chemical that transmits messages within the nervous system.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These drugs are prescribed by doctors to treat a range of conditions, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, bladder issues, allergies, gastrointestinal disorders, and symptoms of Parkinson's disease.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These medicines can have short-term side effects, such as confusion and memory loss, but it is less clear whether long-term use increases the risk of dementia. The research, led by Professor Carol Coupland from the University's Division of Primary Care and published in the JAMA Internal Medicine journal, examined the medical records of 58,769 patients diagnosed with dementia and 225,574 patients without a dementia diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;All patients were aged 55 and over and registered with UK GPs contributing data to the QResearch database, between 1 January 2004 and 31 January 2016. This study was first reported on in 2019.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The findings of the study indicated increased risks of dementia for anticholinergic drugs overall and specifically for the anticholinergic antidepressants, antipsychotic drugs, antiparkinsons drugs, bladder drugs and epilepsy drugs after accounting for other risk factors for dementia.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;No increased risks were found for the other types of anticholinergic drug studied such as antihistamines and gastrointestinal drugs. This study provides further evidence that doctors should be careful when prescribing certain drugs that have anticholinergic properties.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, it's important that patients taking medications of this kind don't just stop them abruptly as this may be much more harmful. If patients have concerns, then they should discuss them with their doctor to consider the pros and cons of the treatment they are receiving.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Professor Tom Dening, Head of the Centre for Dementia at the University of Nottingham and a member of the research study teamThe 58,769 patients with dementia had an average age of 82 and 63% were women.
