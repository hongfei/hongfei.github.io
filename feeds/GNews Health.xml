After checking out, en route to the airport, a stylist in her party cried out that he'd left "an important package" in his fridge and telephoned the hotel, pleading with them not to throw it away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"Turns out he'd forgotten his Ozempic," my editor friend whispered. We were baffled. Ozempic?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Back then, Ozempic was not part of the common lexicon. But quietly, in certain circles, this injectable drug, which is licensed for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, was being prescribed privately and off-label for weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Flash forward to today and the picture is vastly different. "So many fashion people are on it," she tells me today. "And now they're very vocal." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Serena Williams, Elon Musk and Whoopi Goldberg have all spoken about using weight-loss injections. Some are now prescribed by the NHS, including Wegovy and Mounjaro, generating scores of headlines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Really, this should have made it a great leveller. In theory, anyone struggling with obesity can - without the expense of a private doctor - get help to manage their weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Only that's not the full picture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jHorPx"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-5340b511-1 ilsLtA"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250919-090805-05e5ba0164-web-2.30.1-2/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-5340b511-0 hagXkB hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/3634/live/9b734b80-9ae8-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.png.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/3634/live/9b734b80-9ae8-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.png.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/3634/live/9b734b80-9ae8-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.png.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/3634/live/9b734b80-9ae8-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.png.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/3634/live/9b734b80-9ae8-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.png.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/3634/live/9b734b80-9ae8-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.png.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/3634/live/9b734b80-9ae8-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.png.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/3634/live/9b734b80-9ae8-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.png.webp" loading="lazy" alt="AFP via Getty Images Models walk the runway wearing white and black

And with the NHS tightly restricting access, some working in the field warn a two-tier system around weight-loss drugs is developing - one that's benefitting the most well-off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Martin Fidock, who is UK managing director of Ovivia, which provides Wegovy and lifestyle support to NHS patients, claims that thanks to varying thresholds of eligibility in different regions, NHS prescriptions are a "postcode lottery".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;An estimated 1.5 million people in the UK use these drugs - but more than nine in 10 are believed to pay privately. Prices vary but it generally costs between £100 and £350 a month, depending on the dose and lifestyle support. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Then, last month, it was reported that pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly was expected to &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cvg3ykg4jrro" class="sc-f9178328-0 jZoZnB"&gt;increase the list price of Mounjaro&lt;/a&gt; by as much as 170%. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;They have since done a deal for UK distributors, meaning rises are likely to be less, and the deal doesn't affect the cost to the NHS - but it has still caused concern in some quarters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"It's scary," says Brad, a tech company worker in his 40s. He has been taking Mounjaro for a year and worries he may not be able to afford to continue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"I've lost 20kg and want to keep using it, but it's a lot of money.

They work in part as an appetite suppressant by mimicking a hormone, which makes people feel fuller. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Studies have suggested patients can lose as much as a fifth of their body weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;They are licensed for people with a BMI of 27 or more for those with a health condition or above 30 for those without (adjusted for certain ethnic groups). But tougher NHS criteria are being applied, and in England and Wales the drugs are mostly restricted to those with a BMI of over 35.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Plus there are more restrictions too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="embed-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 cnKFtO"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jdlrvG"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;For Wegovy, local areas are making their own decisions on access.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Martin Fidock claims that in recent months a third of regional health boards have increased the BMI threshold, which he says has resulted in fewer people being able to get it. (The BBC has been unable to verify this data.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;A spokesperson for Novo Nordisk, the pharmaceutical giant that makes Wegovy, told the BBC it is "concerned about the growing disparity" in access to NHS specialist weight management services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"This has led to a large proportion of people needing to pay out of pocket, an option which is out of reach in areas of depravation where obesity rates are significantly higher."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;NHS England has said the differences could be related to different levels of need and other providers being more active in certain regions, but confirmed it was up to local areas to decide how much to spend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jHorPx"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-5340b511-1 ilsLtA"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250919-090805-05e5ba0164-web-2.30.1-2/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-5340b511-0 hagXkB hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/0ac0/live/0750dec0-9af9-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/0ac0/live/0750dec0-9af9-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0ac0/live/0750dec0-9af9-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/0ac0/live/0750dec0-9af9-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/0ac0/live/0750dec0-9af9-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/0ac0/live/0750dec0-9af9-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/0ac0/live/0750dec0-9af9-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0ac0/live/0750dec0-9af9-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Reuters Blue Ozempic injection pens lined up" class="sc-5340b511-0 bGQwLJ"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-5340b511-2 lha-dta"&gt;Reuters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 etSgSK"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 jFVvLh"&gt;While Ozempic is intended for those with type 2 diabetes, Wegovy is prescribed specifically for weight loss&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jdlrvG"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;For Mounjaro, NHS England has started it for people with a BMI above 40 who also have certain health conditions. The NHS roll-out officially began in June, but a report published earlier this month suggests that not all general practices had started offering it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Just 18 out of 42 NHS boards across England confirmed that they'd begun prescribing it in line with the roll-out plan, according to data obtained by freedom of information requests published in the BMJ. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;The NHS has previously said it is supporting the phased rollout for eligible patients and that "these represent brand-new services in primary care that are being established and scaled up over time".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;But Mr Fidock believes we are seeing a "postcode lottery".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"We have got an obesity epidemic and these drugs provide us with an opportunity to tackle it in a way we have never been able to do before. But your ability to benefit is dependent largely on whether you have the means to pay."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Adding to the challenge is the fact that more people from deprived areas struggle with obesity in the first place: more than a third of people in the most deprived areas are obese – twice that of more affluent neighbourhoods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="embed-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 cnKFtO"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jdlrvG"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Beyond the physical health risks - and there are many, including higher risks of cancer and heart disease, plus mental health problems - there may be social consequences too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;One US study found that obese men with a bachelor's degree earn 5% less than their thinner colleagues, while those with a graduate degree earn 14% less. For obese women it is worse still, earning 12% and 19% less respectively, based on data concerning 23,000 US workers, published in The Economist in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;NHS GP Matthew Calcasola, who is also involved in a service Get a Drip, which offers weight-loss drugs privately, has his own concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"We're concerned health inequality will build," he says. "GPs worry about this."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 bPbmDW"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 fsBZby"&gt;Private patients priced out&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jdlrvG"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Meanwhile, a booming private market has emerged. Sara de Souza, a business analyst from Nottingham, is among those delighted that it has.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Following the birth of her son Vito in 2023, she put on 30kg. "I got to 96kg," she recalls. "Me and my husband both got into bad habits. We were so busy, we were eating junk food and having chocolates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"I was always tired and struggled to pick up my baby. But I just couldn't lose the weight."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Sara tried dieting and went to see her GP who referred her to a lifestyle diet and activity programme. But still the pounds stuck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;At her heaviest her BMI was 37.5, but she wasn't eligible for NHS access and paid £200 a month for the drug through an app called Juniper, which also gave her diet and lifestyle advice. Within a year she had lost the full 30kg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 etSgSK"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 jFVvLh"&gt;Sara says the cost didn't impact her.

"Even if it had, I'd have carried on, because of the benefits."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Not everyone feels the same. Some 18% of overweight Britons would be willing to pay for weight-loss drugs - but if they were available on the NHS, 59% said they would be keen on using them, according to new polling by communications agency Strand Partners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;And some of those willing to pay privately fear they could find themselves being priced out following the proposed price spike.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jHorPx"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-5340b511-1 ilsLtA"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250919-090805-05e5ba0164-web-2.30.1-2/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-5340b511-0 hagXkB hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/db9c/live/e3617910-991e-11f0-858a-a904eacbef23.png.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/db9c/live/e3617910-991e-11f0-858a-a904eacbef23.png.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/db9c/live/e3617910-991e-11f0-858a-a904eacbef23.png.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/db9c/live/e3617910-991e-11f0-858a-a904eacbef23.png.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/db9c/live/e3617910-991e-11f0-858a-a904eacbef23.png.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/db9c/live/e3617910-991e-11f0-858a-a904eacbef23.png.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/db9c/live/e3617910-991e-11f0-858a-a904eacbef23.png.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/db9c/live/e3617910-991e-11f0-858a-a904eacbef23.png.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images A pen prepared for weight loss injection

Katharine Jenner argues there needs to be more done to address one of them in particular: our "broken food system".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"People in poorer areas are surrounded by junk food advertising, more unhealthy takeaways, and face bigger barriers to buying healthy food," she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"Without investment in prevention, health will get worse, inequalities will widen, and the costs will fall on all of us."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;How to effectively achieve that is perhaps the biggest question of all. But whatever the answer - and regardless of whether the onus really should be on the state or as others argue, the individual - it runs far deeper than the cost of a weight-loss jab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"We live in a society that prizes freedom of choice and expression, values material wealth and tolerates vast inequality," argues Chris Rojek, sociology professor at City St George's, University of London.

Published in The Lancet, it shows deaths due to cancer increased by 21% during this period, despite advances in treatment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In comparison, both incidence and mortality have declined significantly in US and China over the 33-year period. The reason behind this is strong tobacco control, universal vaccination and organised screening in these two countries, Dr Abhishek Shankar, radiation-oncologist at AIIMS Delhi, said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;India, he added, continues to fare poorly on both counts because of persisting risk factors such as high use of tobacco, obesity and infections, coupled with limited access to early detection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Early Detection Saves Lives: Watch for These Ovarian Cancer Symptoms&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Study links 4.3m &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;cancer deaths&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt; in 2023 to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;modifiable risk factors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Evidence-based strategies like HPV and Hepatitis-B vaccination, mammography, lung cancer screening with low-dose CT, and colonoscopy screening, and timely treatment remain uneven or inadequate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;For India to reverse its trajectory, we must urgently strengthen risk prevention strategies, expand evidence-based screening programmes and integrate cancer care into its universal health coverage agenda," Shankar said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study's lead author Dr Lisa Force from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME), University of Washington, said, "Cancer remains an important contributor to disease burden globally and our study highlights how it is anticipated to grow substantially over the coming decades, with disproportionate growth in countries with limited resources." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;She added that despite the clear need for action, cancer control policies and implementation remain under-prioritised in global health, and there is insufficient funding to address this challenge in many settings. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study shows cancer incidence has declined by 19% and 20% in China and the US, respectively, between 1990 and 2023, while their mortality rates attributable to cancer has also seen a robust decline - 43% decline in mortality due to cancer in China and 33% in the US. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study estimates that 42% (4.3 million) of the estimated 10.4 million cancer deaths in 2023 were attributable to 44 potentially modifiable risk factors - presenting an opportunity for action. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Behavioural risk factors contributed to the most cancer deaths across all country income levels in 2023, especially tobacco use which contributed to 21% of cancer deaths globally. Tobacco was the leading risk factor in all country income levels except low-income countries, where the leading risk factor was unsafe sex (linked to 12.5% of all cancer deaths)," the study said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A parliamentary committee report tabled in 2023 suggested raising taxes on tobacco products in India to make them less affordable. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Committee recommends the ministry (health) to pursue with the department of revenue to expedite the decision on raising taxes on tobacco products," it said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also stressed upon the need to link the Population-Based Cancer Registry to Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission to get real time data on cancer patients. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mission is a key health initiative by the govt which aims at providing digital health IDs for all Indian citizens to help hospitals, insurance firms, and citizens access health records electronically when required. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most cancer cases in India are detected in late stages leading to poor prognosis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The parliamentary committee suggested that the issue of screening for cancer should be taken up at 'Jan Aandolan Pace', a mass movement to fight against cancer by timely screening. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A day in a month may be fixed for cancer screening on the lines of reproductive and child health," the parliamentary committee suggested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Sun, 28 Sep 2025 22:42:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiuwFBVV95cUxPV2REUVNqUUpQdXRmLVVwN1pSLVk1cV92Qy1VTUJwajdUZVBZcXU5c2VVU1JzUXB2VTQtcEpIalo0aUV4NEtMTFVFWkp6SUxtTE5FbTRrWUF4M2FjZklRRkZER0FDWnFpZk5iZy13c3o3U2V0LWNmbnJDdEZPb2VEODg2d0pGMkhFSk1qMjIxZTYzVzhXckNrenZRX0s2LUhsQk1WbUxYaGp1VW0zeVFvWk5Bd19GWjFjeXBV</guid></item><item><title>“科学家只是武器化的食物中毒” ：工程沙门氏菌摧毁癌症肿瘤，而医生害怕活的药物革命-能源记者</title><link>https://www.energy-reporters.com/news/scientists-just-weaponized-food-poisoning-engineered-salmonella-bacteria-destroys-cancer-tumors-while-doctors-fear-the-living-drug-revolution/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Energy Reporters</author><pubDate>Sun, 28 Sep 2025 20:46:03 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijAJBVV95cUxNZEpkOFdmUzExMVZad0FrRm42emduRHZ1TVRFbGhja0JFWHhDT1ZaZFRIZ3Y0SGs3b2p0UE1jZF90dEpIdW9NbHI5YUtIZjJjd0Q5UUZJNnBRekRkMzliQmdSREdMLUY4V1dfMlhpWXk4cDh4b2NuaEN1bjZFcVI4R1VqZk94Uk9HQjZIUDY1eHpSZGptTjNKTWgzeEN2ZUptanktVDQ5WE9PeWh4dnNVMTR5ZmNraEVieGdzTUVCazZQUGsyeG1xT25lNTJoMEpXVTdfNU4wT0Ztd2N0Z1U5SktjY0J6UzVZak9Bcmg5WnBXYTJWb0NHMHdTVHBpWmRjbElNNkFiOFB5bjFV</guid></item><item><title>医生测试了一种针对新冠肺炎的常用药物。结果令人惊叹- ScienceDaily</title><link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250928095616.htm</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p id="first" class="lead"&gt;A widely available and affordable drug has been shown to be effective in treating seriously ill COVID-19 patients, according to a new international study led by researchers at the Australian National University (ANU) in collaboration with King's College London.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study analyzed data from almost 500 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 across six countries. Patients who inhaled heparin were half as likely to require ventilation and had a significantly lower risk of dying compared with those receiving standard care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heparin, a drug traditionally injected to treat blood clots, was tested in this study in an inhaled form, targeting the lungs directly. As well as acting as an anticoagulant, heparin has anti-inflammatory and pan-antiviral properties. Earlier research results showed breathing and oxygen levels improved in COVID-19 patients after they inhaled a course of heparin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers believe the drug could also be useful in fighting other serious respiratory infections such as pneumonia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professor Clive Page, Emeritus Professor of Pharmacology at King's who co-led the international study with ANU's Professor van Haren, said: "Inhaled heparin is anti-viral, anti-inflammatory and anti-coagulant. There's no other drug that has that unique combination. We know it's only a matter of time until the next pandemic, and there are still COVID-19 patients who get very sick. This is a great weapon to have up our sleeve."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the findings highlight the potential of inhaled heparin, further development is required before the treatment can be routinely adopted. The researchers believe the drug could also be useful in fighting other serious respiratory infections such as pneumonia, which can be caused by a range of viruses and bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Professor van Haren, the drug would also be helpful for those with a compromised immune system, such as cancer patients, when they experience a respiratory infection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professor Frank van Haren, lead author, ANU and Director of the Intensive Care Unit at the St George Hospital in Sydney, said: "It doesn't matter what kind of respiratory infection the patient is dealing with, the drug -- when inhaled -- will stop it from infecting the patient and from damaging the lungs. We're aiming to conduct another trial in Europe to confirm its effectiveness in fighting other common respiratory infections such as influenza and RSV. And because it's inexpensive, it's much more accessible for those from low-income countries"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers are now also developing an improved formulation of heparin, specifically designed to be given by inhalation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research is published in &lt;em&gt;eClinicalMedicine&lt;/em&gt; and simultaneously presented of at the European Respiratory Society (ERS) International Congress in Amsterdam on Sunday, September 28, the leading annual gathering for respiratory research.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Professor Wendy Davis, lead study author and professor at the University of &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/western-australia/index.html" id="mol-787a8c70-958d-11f0-8923-256e77754a14"&gt;Western Australia&lt;/a&gt;, said: 'An association between type 2 diabetes and sepsis has been noted in some earlier studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Our study, in a large community-based sample of adults, confirms a strong relationship even after adjustment for a number of potential risk factors and the competing risk of death from unrelated causes, which may have occurred in people at high risk of sepsis before they developed sepsis, thus leading to overestimation of the incidence of sepsis if ignored.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The best way to prevent sepsis is to quit smoking, normalize high blood sugar and prevent the onset of the micro- and macrovascular complications of diabetes. That's why this study is important.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sepsis&lt;a target="_self" href="/health/sepsis/index.html" id="mol-6dee3a50-e854-11ee-9371-b5d203091076" class=""&gt; &lt;/a&gt;is a medical emergency that is caused by the body's extreme reaction to an infection. It occurs when chemicals released in the bloodstream cause the immune system to go haywire. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Instead of sending infection-fighting white blood cells to attack a foreign invader, it targets healthy tissues and organs such as the limbs and the lungs and kidneys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Infections that lead to sepsis most commonly start in the skin, urinary tract, lungs, or gastrointestinal tract, but almost any infection can lead to sepsis - starting in wounds as innocuous as paper cuts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But according to non-profit Sepsis Alliance, half of all cases are from an unknown pathogen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sepsis kills 350,000 Americans adults every year and 75,000 children. That's done death every 90 seconds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The mortality rate ranges from 10 to 30 percent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The latest sepsis data from the CDC has shown a slight uptick in sepsis deaths in the last three months, which experts warn could be due to a lack of cohesive sepsis strategy in the US&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Sepsis symptoms can closely resemble the flu, so look out for a very high or low temperature, sweating, extreme pain, clammy skin, dizziness, nausea, high heart rate, slurred speech, and confusion&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The new study, which is being presented this week at the Annual Meeting of the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD), looked at the medical records of 157,000 adults between 2008 and 2011 from Australia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Of those, 1,430 had type 2 diabetes. They were matched with 5,720 individuals who were not diabetic based on age, sex and where they lived.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The average participant age was 66, and 52 percent were men. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers tracked their health status until they had a record of sepsis, died, or the study reached its end in 2021. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They found two percent of patients with type 2 diabetes were hospitalized for or with sepsis compared to 0.8 percent of their matched counterparts without diabetes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And during the average 10-year follow-up time, 12 percent of participants with type 2 diabetes suffered sepsis compared to five percent of their matched counterparts, a 2.3-fold increased risk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The most notable difference was in diabetics ages 41 to 50, who were at 14.5 times more likely to develop sepsis than non-diabetics. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Janice Holloway, 65, from Arizona, suffered an infection from an unknown pathogen, which quickly turned to sepsis - the first signs of which were a rash on the back of her leg and a high fever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Sepsis can affect patients of any age, including three-year-old Beauden Baumkitchner, who had both legs amputated after he scraped his knee and contracted staph bacteria &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers said people with type 2 diabetes were more likely to be older, male, indigenous, smokers, use insulin, have high blood pressure or have heart failure, all of which are independently associated with a greater risk of sepsis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to Sepsis Alliance, slow wound healing seen in diabetics also raises the risk, as contaminants that can seep into the wounds and infect the bloodstream, causing sepsis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And as glucose builds up in the blood, it attacks blood vessels, leading to poor blood flow to tissues. This makes it more difficult for blood to deliver oxygen to vital organs that are needed to fight infection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Professor Davis said: 'Our study identifies several modifiable risk factors, including smoking, high blood sugar, and complications of diabetes, underscoring that there are steps individuals can take to potentially lower their risk of sepsis.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, the researchers cautioned the study is observational and cannot prove direct causation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Officers from the Marabella Police Station were called to the scene shortly after 10:25 a.m., where they met family members and were shown to a small 10x10 bedroom downstairs in the house.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_top" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Layne’s body was found on the floor, with a brown curtain tied around his neck, which relatives had reportedly cut from the ceiling in an attempt to save his life. He was dressed in grey shorts and was bareback. Police noted ligature marks around the neck, discoloration of the lips, and no visible signs of violence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to family members, Layne had suffered a steady mental and physical decline over the past few years, which they believe began after he received a Sinopharm COVID-19 vaccine in late 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_middle" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His grandparents, Evangeline and Andy Rahim, along with his mother, Joann Cooper, and aunt, Nicole Lamont, told police that following the vaccination, Layne experienced a range of health issues, including chronic insomnia, severe headaches, and a pre-existing heart condition. He also reportedly fell into a deep depression that the family struggled to manage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In search of relief, the family said they turned to alternative medicine and had been consulting with a herbal practitioner based in Tacarigua. However, Layne’s condition reportedly worsened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The grandparents told police that the last conversation they had with him was around 3a.m. on Thursday. Two days later, they found him hanging from the ceiling. Emergency medical personnel were called, but he was already deceased upon their arrival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scene was processed by Crime Scene Investigator WPC Nysus, along with Sgt Lee, Cpl Downes, PC Forbes, and PC Madho.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_bottom" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_63-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When choosing a cereal that &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7909480/best-foods-for-digestion/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;supports digestion and regularity&lt;/a&gt;, here’s what dietitians recommend checking on the label.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_64-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_65-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; High in Fiber &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_66-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://myfoodmychoicenutrition.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Tracy Colin, M.S., RD, LDN,&lt;/a&gt; recommends choosing a cereal that has at least 4 grams of fiber per serving to get closer to your daily fiber needs. Look for options that contain &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8031247/healthy-whole-grains-to-eat-more-fiber/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;whole grains like wheat, oats, sorghum or barley&lt;/a&gt;, which provide fiber and other gut-supporting nutrients.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_67-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_68-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; However, she cautions about overdoing it: “Some cereals can have over 15 grams per serving. Too much fiber at once can actually backfire, leaving you bloated or constipated,” says Colin. To support regular bowel movements, choose cereals with a mix of fiber-rich ingredients like whole grains, nuts and seeds.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_69-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_70-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Low in Sugar &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_71-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://alissapalladinonutrition.squarespace.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Alissa Palladino, M.S., RDN, LD, CPT&lt;/a&gt;, recommends checking the Nutrition Facts panel and aiming for no more than about 10% of the Daily Value for added sugar, or around 5 grams per serving. That said, for those who don’t like the taste of high-fiber cereals on their own, a small amount of sugar can make it more palatable, which is why some options on this list are slightly higher.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_72-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_73-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Check the Serving Size &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_74-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Hardy points out that cereal serving sizes can vary a lot—from as little as ¼ cup for dense granolas to 1½ cups for lighter, puffed options like Kix. The FDA establishes serving sizes based on a cereal’s density and Reference Amounts Customarily Consumed (RACCs).&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; If you’re watching your fiber, sugar or calorie intake, it’s important to check the serving size so you don’t unintentionally double your portions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_75-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_77-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-our-expert-take"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_78-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Our Expert Take &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_79-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If your digestion feels sluggish in the morning, a high-fiber cereal can help get things moving. Quick and convenient, cereal is an easy way to start the day with a good serving of fiber. Whether you prefer a childhood classic or a low-sugar option, look for cereals with at least 4 grams of fiber. Don’t forget to check the serving size to keep calories and sugar in check. For a simple, effective way to support regularity, stick with an all-time breakfast favorite: high-fiber cereal.&lt;br&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;A massive study involving genetic data from over 1.2 million people has identified over a dozen new gene regions associated with dyslexia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have produced the largest genetic study of dyslexia to date," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41398-025-03514-0"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the study authors, led by University of Edinburgh molecular geneticist Hayley Mountford.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dyslexia is a neurodevelopmental brain difference that can make certain aspects of modern life challenging. In the current study, participants had challenges reading and/or writing, although that is not the case in all people with dyslexia; some find other aspects of verbal processing more challenging than their peers, such as spelling and grammar, or following verbal instructions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/several-psychiatric-disorders-share-the-same-root-cause-study-reveals"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;S&lt;/strong&gt;everal Psychiatric Disorders Share The Same Root Cause, Study Reveals&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_175099" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-175099" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/ChildHoldingBookOpen-e1758584257151.jpg" alt="child holding book open" class="wp-image-175099 size-full" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-175099" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;(&lt;a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/person-wearing-blue-long-sleeved-shirt-reading-book-g3O4mCifZEk"&gt;Josh Applegate/Unsplash&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;As with the other neurodivergences, like  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/autism-spectrum-disorder" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73013" data-postid="175089" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;autism&lt;/a&gt; or  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-adhd" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73112" data-postid="175089" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;ADHD&lt;/a&gt;, dyslexia comes with &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/having-dyslexia-could-mean-your-brain-is-wired-to-make-better-decisions"&gt;advantages as well&lt;/a&gt;, such as &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ridd.2021.104036"&gt;higher non-verbal creativity&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/brainsci12010027"&gt;Past twin studies&lt;/a&gt; have suggested that genes strongly determine dyslexia, so Mountford and colleagues took up the challenge of pinpointing what those genetic associations are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their genome-wide study identified 80 regions associated with dyslexia, including 36 regions not previously reported as significant. Thirteen of these regions were novel to science, with no prior link to dyslexia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of the newly associated genes are involved in early brain development. And, as expected, some of them are &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/09567976241293999"&gt;shared with ADHD&lt;/a&gt;, which can often occur alongside dyslexia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the vast datasets, the researchers also found correlations between dyslexia and measures of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/large-body-map-study-suggests-chronic-pain-comes-in-9-distinct-types"&gt;chronic pain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The underlying mechanism remains unelucidated, however, the genetic overlap between pain-related phenotypes and neurodevelopmental traits may hint at a shared biological basis," Mountford and team &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41398-025-03514-0"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; in their paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With these newly identified gene associations, researchers might finally start unraveling these connections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research was published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41398-025-03514-0"&gt;Translational Psychiatry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

But the torrent of sirens early on the morning of September 17 was enough to briefly rouse me from bed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;I found out later that day that a five-alarm fire involving more than 200 firefighters had &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/20/nyregion/red-hook-warehouse-fire.html"&gt;ripped through a 150-year-old artists’ warehouse&lt;/a&gt; in the neighboring area of Red Hook. It was one of the biggest New York has experienced this year, and though no one was killed, the work of more than 500 artists may have been destroyed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The Red Hook fire was a tragedy for New York’s already struggling artistic community, but it got me thinking about the state of urban fires in the US today. As long as cities have existed, fires have been a threat. Rome &lt;a href="https://www.thecollector.com/did-emperor-nero-start-the-great-fire-of-rome/"&gt;famously burned to the ground&lt;/a&gt; in 64 CE — though not, as was long assumed, at the hands of the Emperor Nero — while the diarist Samuel Pepys &lt;a href="https://notesfromtheuk.com/2025/08/08/samuel-pepys-the-great-fire-of-london-and-a-wheel-of-parmesan-cheese/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CNobody%2C%20to%20my%20sight%2C,soldiers%20if%20they%20were%20needed."&gt;described&lt;/a&gt; how “even the very stones of churches” burned in London’s Great Fire of 1666.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Here in the US, the Great Chicago Fire of 1871 &lt;a href="https://www.badgeandwallet.com/news/10-most-memorable-fires-us-history#:~:text=October%208%2C%201871%20was%20an,was%20also%20largely%20under%20reported."&gt;consumed&lt;/a&gt; 3.3 square miles of the city, and left 100,000 people homeless. As late as the 1970s, the Bronx in New York was for a time averaging &lt;a href="https://shoeleather.podcasts.library.columbia.edu/podcast/the-bronx-is-burning/"&gt;as many as two fires &lt;em&gt;per hour&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, part of an endless conflagration that ultimately destroyed 80 percent of the borough’s housing over the course of the decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;As the Red Hook disaster shows, fire is still a threat, especially to older buildings. But beneath the sound of those sirens is a story of underappreciated progress toward ever greater safety. Compared with 1980, the per-capita civilian fire death rate &lt;a href="https://www.nxtbook.com/nxtbooks/nfpa/journal_2024winter/index.php"&gt;has fallen&lt;/a&gt; by roughly two-thirds — from about 28.6 deaths per million people to around 11 per million in 2023. Total reported fires are also &lt;a href="https://www.nxtbook.com/nxtbooks/nfpa/journal_2023winter/index.php?startid=58&amp;amp;utm_source=chatgpt.com"&gt;down&lt;/a&gt; by half over that time period, and injuries have fallen by more than half.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;As the terrible Los Angeles fires at the start of the year demonstrated, the &lt;a href="/climate/398719/los-angeles-fire-reconstruction-insurance-housing"&gt;growing risk to urban areas from wildfires&lt;/a&gt; presents a new and dangerous threat to US cities. But even with those rare but spectacular disasters, America’s homes and buildings are far less vulnerable to deadly fires than they once were. And we’ve gotten here through the accumulation of small improvements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Smoke alarms that work&lt;/strong&gt;: There may be no single more important fire safety feature than the humble smoke alarm. While the very first automatic smoke fire alarm was invented in 1890, as late as 1977, less than a quarter of all households in the US had smoke alarms, which is one of those facts of the recent past that leaves me gobsmacked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Today alarms are &lt;a href="https://www.nfpa.org/education-and-research/research/nfpa-research/fire-statistical-reports/smoke-alarms-in-us-home-fires?utm_source=chatgpt.com"&gt;now present&lt;/a&gt; in the vast majority of US homes — and when they’re working, the death rate per reported home fire is about 60 percent lower than in homes without a working alarm. Modern building codes also now usually require interconnected systems and alarms in bedrooms. But they have to be checked consistently to make sure they actually work — a large share of fatal fires still occur in homes with no alarm &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; one that failed to operate. And battery-powered smoke alarms are safer than those that are hardwired.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Automatic sprinklers: &lt;/strong&gt;If a fire does break out, more buildings have automatic sprinklers to quench them. Sprinklers can make a huge difference: the per-fire civilian death rate is &lt;a href="https://www.nfpa.org/education-and-research/research/nfpa-research/fire-statistical-reports/us-experience-with-sprinklers?utm_source=chatgpt.com"&gt;roughly&lt;/a&gt; 90 percent lower when sprinklers are present than when no automatic extinguishing system is installed. Most new multifamily houses and apartment buildings are required to have them by code, and they’ve become more common in other new construction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Safer furnishings and interior finishes.&lt;/strong&gt; After years of debate, the US &lt;a href="https://www.cpsc.gov/Newsroom/News-Releases/2021/New-Federal-Safety-Standard-for-Upholstered-Furniture-Fires-Goes-into-Effect?utm_source=chatgpt.com"&gt;adopted&lt;/a&gt; a national smolder-resistance standard for upholstered furniture in 2021, which federalized an existing California code. Upholstery that’s less prone to ignite from a dropped cigarette or similar ember means fewer small room fires becoming structure conflagrations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Less smoking — and “fire-safe” cigarettes.&lt;/strong&gt; Cigarettes, man — they can kill you in so many ways, including by accidentally igniting a house fire. In 1980 there were &lt;a href="https://www.maine.gov/future/sites/maine.gov.dps.fmo/files/inline-files/nfpa_home_fires_started_by_smoking.pdf"&gt;an estimated 70,800 smoking-related cigarette home fires&lt;/a&gt; leading to 1,820 deaths. But cigarette smoking in the US has &lt;a href="/public-health/410443/vaping-conundrum-public-health-youth-ecigarettes"&gt;fallen significantly&lt;/a&gt;, meaning fewer cigarettes to trigger fires, and all states now require so-called “fire-safe” cigarettes that are less likely to ignite. By 2016, the number of smoking-related fires had fallen to 16,500, causing 660 deaths, even as both population and the number of buildings had increased.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Better electrical and heating safety.&lt;/strong&gt; Modern building codes now &lt;a href="https://www.cpsc.gov/s3fs-public/afci.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com"&gt;require&lt;/a&gt; safeguards like arc-fault circuit interrupters (AFCIs) that cut power when wires start arcing behind walls, which can risk sparking sudden fires. While heating equipment is still a major cause of fires, heating–related fires &lt;a href="https://www.usfa.fema.gov/downloads/pdf/statistics/fire-estimate-summary-series.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com"&gt;fell&lt;/a&gt; by a third between 2010 and 2019, thanks in part to &lt;a href="https://code-authorities.ul.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/ul_ElectricHeaterTipoverProtection.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com"&gt;appliance improvements&lt;/a&gt; like automatic space heater shutoffs and temperature controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="the-boring-important-work-of-making-homes-fire-resistant" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;The boring, important work of making homes fire-resistant&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;These fire safety improvements didn’t just happen. Each required regulators, often learning from fire disasters of the past, to &lt;a href="https://www.iccsafe.org/building-safety-journal/bsj-dives/fema-highlights-the-life-and-property-savings-of-building-codes/#:~:text=More%20Than%20$1%20Billion%20Saved,Introduction%20of%20fire%20sprinkler%20systems"&gt;institute new building codes and new product safety requirements&lt;/a&gt;. Public service campaigns pushed people to get smoke alarms for their homes and warned them of risky behaviors like smoking in bed. These are the engines of progress that get overlooked, but have directly saved countless lives over the course of decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;We can never know when a fire is prevented. But maybe my life was saved — and maybe yours as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The progress has been uneven. Most US fire deaths still happen where we sleep: homes account for the clear majority of civilian fire fatalities. The risks &lt;a href="https://www.usfa.fema.gov/downloads/pdf/statistics/v21i3.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com"&gt;concentrate&lt;/a&gt; among older adults, people with disabilities, and lower-income households living in older buildings, where missing alarms, space-heater misuse, or unsafe extension cords are more common. And we can &lt;a href="https://stories.tamu.edu/news/2025/01/14/los-angeles-fires-demonstrate-rising-threat-of-wildfires-in-urban-areas/#:~:text=WUI%20areas%20are%20often%20(though,especially%20vulnerable%20to%20wildfire%20hazards."&gt;expect the risk of wildfires&lt;/a&gt;, including those that directly threaten cities, will only grow in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But we shouldn’t miss how far we’ve come from the days when the Bronx — and neighborhoods throughout the country — &lt;a href="http://decadeoffire.com/"&gt;was burning&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;A version of this story originally appeared in the Good News newsletter. &lt;a href="/pages/good-news-newsletter-signup"&gt;Sign up here!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>vox.com</author><pubDate>Sun, 28 Sep 2025 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqAFBVV95cUxNcFlRRlFFbElEUDRzWlpqTkhmTU96MWN3SFZYc1IzN0VSSEhwNDBHeWYzMzhkVTVPWlBNWHRtdlJ2VXFjTEk2QWxYRW1oREdvaTJaZ2NFVVB2Q2lpOTFaXzUySEx4ZUVGZ0lCRlBfU2tqSmNTMXdySERTTFVJR3RQaXZZdUlkclE3YWNNOHBNcHFTeXVIUnJ4QVlqVk9LOUxhYTVndndnblg</guid></item><item><title>这种天然化合物可以保护大脑免受中风- SciTechDaily</title><link>https://scitechdaily.com/this-natural-compound-could-protect-the-brain-against-stroke/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content cf entry-content content-spacious"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A natural compound present in the brain shows promise in reducing stroke damage by protecting the blood-brain barrier and lowering inflammation.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DMT, short for dimethyltryptamine, is a naturally occurring psychoactive compound that exists in a variety of plants and animals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A recent study published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="glossaryLink" aria-describedby="tt" data-cmtooltip="cmtt_5c602c0d2f1725ec17e319add1b06272" data-gt-translate-attributes='[{"attribute":"data-cmtooltip", "format":"html"}]' tabindex="0" role="link"&gt;Science Advances&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; by researchers at the HUN-REN BRC Institute of Biophysics and the Semmelweis University Heart and Vascular Centre reports that DMT can lessen the damaging impact of stroke in both laboratory cell cultures and animal models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;A solution from nature in the spotlight&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This compound is also produced in the human brain, where it is now being investigated in clinical trials as a potential aid for restoring brain function following stroke. Until recently, the way DMT worked in this context remained unclear. “It is amazing how we can always turn to nature to find ingenious solutions for health problems,” says co-lead author Mária Deli from the HUN-REN BRC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;The blood-brain barrier as a therapeutic target&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We found that DMT significantly reduced infarct volume and edema formation in a rat stroke model,” explains co-first author Marcell László. In both animal experiments and cell culture models, the authors showed that DMT treatment restored the structure and function of the damaged blood-brain barrier and improved the function of astroglial cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This psychoactive compound also inhibited the production of inflammatory cytokines in brain endothelial cells and peripheral immune cells, while reducing the activation of brain microglia cells through Sigma-1 receptors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;DMT could serve as therapeutic adjuvant to existing stroke treatments&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The therapeutic options currently available for stroke are very limited. The dual action of DMT, protecting the blood-brain barrier while reducing brain inflammation, offers a novel, complex approach that could complement existing treatments,” says Judit Vigh, co-first author of the work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since current stroke therapies do not always result in full recovery, a DMT-based treatment may represent a promising new alternative, mainly in combination with existing methods. The recent findings from researchers in Szeged and Budapest, Hungary, support the development of a therapy that goes beyond the limitations of conventional stroke treatment. Clinical trials on the use of DMT and investigations on its long-term effects are currently ongoing.&lt;/p&gt;

She explained that the biggest reasons for this come down to two harmful compounds: advanced glycation end products (AGEs) and trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“AGEs are harmful compounds that form when proteins or fats combine with sugar in the bloodstream,” Bhanote said.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;She explained that animal-based foods — especially if they are grilled, fried or roasted — are high in AGEs. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6600625/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Research shows" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68d5524be4b0ca9d8817817c" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6600625/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="10"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Research shows&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; that these compounds can accumulate in your tissues and, over time, can lead to oxidative stress and inflammation, which are key drivers of cellular aging. “AGEs damage proteins, DNA and other vital cellular structures, accelerating the aging process and contributing to chronic diseases like diabetes, cardiovascular disease and Alzheimer’s,” Bhanote said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Jenny Dettrick via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Jenny Dettrick via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;Plant-based proteins are "naturally low in AGEs and do not contribute to TMAO production," Bhanote said.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;What about TMAO? Bhanote explained that elevated levels of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9235870/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="TMAO" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68d5524be4b0ca9d8817817c" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9235870/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="11"&gt;&lt;span&gt;TMAO&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; have been linked to an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases, including atherosclerosis, heart attack and stroke — all of which obviously are not good for longevity. “TMAO promotes the accumulation of cholesterol in the arteries and impairs the body’s ability to remove it, leading to inflammation and further damage to the cardiovascular system. This not only compromises heart health but also affects overall cellular function and longevity,” Bhanote said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Related to the mistake many people make of overemphasizing protein in their diet, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://cbb.yale.edu/people/raghav-sehgal" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Raghav Sehgal" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68d5524be4b0ca9d8817817c" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://cbb.yale.edu/people/raghav-sehgal" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="12"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Raghav Sehgal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, a Ph.D. student and Gruber fellow at Yale University whose research focuses on human aging, told HuffPost that one common mistake people make when it comes to longevity is focusing on “miracle diets” promising fast results. The biggie that’s relevant here: the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/keto-effects-body_l_5d9b58abe4b099389803e441" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="ketogenic diet" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68d5524be4b0ca9d8817817c" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="5d9b58abe4b099389803e441" data-vars-target-content-type="buzz" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="13"&gt;&lt;span&gt;ketogenic diet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, which prioritizes fat and protein while minimizing carbohydrates. For many people doing keto, meat and eggs are hero foods; however, as previously explained, eating too many animal products can take years off your life.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How To Use Protein To Work For You, Not Against You &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;So, how should we approach protein with an eye toward longevity? Bhanote and Sehgal are of the same mind about this: Eat more protein-rich plants and fish.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;While fish certainly isn’t a plant, it is thought of differently than animal-based proteins because it has a completely different nutritional makeup than meat, and scientific research has repeatedly shown benefits to human health when consumed regularly. Eating fish regularly has been associated with &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25969396/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="reducing the risk of premature death by 12%." data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68d5524be4b0ca9d8817817c" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25969396/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="14"&gt;&lt;span&gt;reducing the risk of premature death by 12%.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Sehgal explained that plant-based proteins (such as beans, lentils, chickpeas, soy, nuts and seeds) are loaded with antioxidants, fiber and nutrients that keep our hearts healthy, reduce inflammation and lower the risk of chronic diseases. “These foods are naturally low in AGEs and do not contribute to TMAO production, making them much gentler on your cells and overall health,” Bhanote added.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8804093" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Scientific studies show" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68d5524be4b0ca9d8817817c" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8804093" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="15"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Scientific studies show&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; that having a diet that prioritizes plant-based proteins lowers the risk of mortality associated with cardiovascular disease and other causes.

It’s crucial to get enough and, as Ferree pointed out, it’s especially important to get enough as we age. But other nutrients are important too, which is why Sehgal said the best diet for longevity is a balanced one that includes a wide variety of nutrient-rich foods. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The benefit of eating a balanced diet full of plants certainly isn’t revolutionary news, but it is backed up by many&lt;span&gt; scientific studies. When it comes to longevity — and health in general — science-backed wins out over trendy and new. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>HuffPost</author><pubDate>Sun, 28 Sep 2025 11:00:17 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>警告中风：需要注意什么和症状- HuffPost</title><link>https://www.huffpost.com/entry/warning-stroke-what-it-is-and-symptoms-to-look-for-goog_l_68d551afe4b0ca9d881780ea</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="entry__content-list js-entry-content js-cet-subunit"&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strokes are a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/stroke/facts.htm" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="leading cause of death in the U.S." data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68d551afe4b0ca9d881780ea" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.cdc.gov/stroke/facts.htm" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="0"&gt;leading cause of death in the U.S.&lt;/a&gt;, with nearly 800,000 people experiencing one every year.

About 15% are hemorrhagic strokes, which occur when a blood vessel ruptures in the brain. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;And among the people who have strokes, many also experience what is known as a warning stroke in the days, weeks or months beforehand.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; Here’s what to know about warning strokes:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Warning strokes are known medically as transient ischemic attacks.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unbeknownst to most people outside of the medical field, warning strokes are a fleeting yet very dangerous medical condition that can be precursors to full-blown strokes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, up to 1 in 5 people who experience a warning stroke could have a stroke within 90 days if they don’t get medical attention, according to &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/staff/24305-ahmed-itrat" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Ahmed Itrat" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68d551afe4b0ca9d881780ea" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/staff/24305-ahmed-itrat" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="2"&gt;Dr. Ahmed Itrat&lt;/a&gt;, the stroke medical director at Cleveland Clinic Akron General.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what exactly is a warning stroke? Medically, it’s referred to as a transient ischemic attack and causes “&lt;span&gt;sudden-onset transient symptoms of neurological injury which resolve on their own,” Itrat said. “These symptoms may be similar to what one would consider a stroke, but the only difference is they don’t lead to a permanent neurological injury.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, transient ischemic attacks come on quickly, last for a short time and do not result in the type of brain damage that can be seen with full-fledged strokes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the lack of potential brain damage does not mean you should ignore a transient ischemic attack. It’s still a medical condition that needs to be taken seriously, Giglio said. “I&lt;span&gt;t really is a harbinger in many people for someone who is going to have a stroke even within the next 48 hours and certainly within the next seven, 30, 90 days,” he said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Transient ischemic attacks are also commonly referred to as “ministrokes.” But &lt;a href="https://www.neurology.columbia.edu/profile/joshua-z-willey-md" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Joshua Willey" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68d551afe4b0ca9d881780ea" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.neurology.columbia.edu/profile/joshua-z-willey-md" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="3"&gt;Dr. Joshua Willey&lt;/a&gt;, a stroke neurology expert at Columbia University’s Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, said this problematic term minimizes the emergent nature of the condition. The phrase “warning strokes,” on the other hand, highlights that this condition is an emergency, just like a “regular” stroke, he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The signs of transient ischemic attacks and strokes are the same.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I would say that basically all the same signs and symptoms of a stroke are the signs and symptoms of a transient ischemic attack,” Giglio said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;All three experts who spoke with HuffPost referred to “&lt;a href="https://www.nm.org/healthbeat/healthy-tips/stroke-warning-signs" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="BE FAST" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68d551afe4b0ca9d881780ea" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.nm.org/healthbeat/healthy-tips/stroke-warning-signs" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="4"&gt;BE FAST&lt;/a&gt;” as a widely accepted mnemonic device detailing the signs of stroke. And as the acronym suggests, these symptoms come on quickly, Giglio said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B&lt;/strong&gt;alance — changes in balance or a loss of balance.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;E&lt;/strong&gt;yesight — changes in vision, like blurriness, loss of sight or double vision.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;F&lt;/strong&gt;acial droop — drooping of the face or an uneven smile.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt;rm — arm weakness on one side of the body.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;S&lt;/strong&gt;peech — changes in speech, like slurring words or speaking gibberish.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;T&lt;/strong&gt;ime — it’s time to call emergency services. According to Willey, the “t” can also stand for the&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; terrible headache that comes on fast.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Y&lt;span&gt;ou could have all of those symptoms, you could have one of those symptoms or any mixture in between,” Giglio said. So, don’t wait around for more than one sign. If you notice any of these issues, go to the emergency room.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Kinga Krzeminska via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Kinga Krzeminska via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;Conditions like high blood pressure put you at increased risk for not only strokes but also warning strokes.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The symptoms are fleeting.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people dismiss the signs of a transient ischemic attack because of how quickly they go away, according to all three experts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it’s important to take these symptoms seriously, no matter their brevity. And while there is no hard-and-fast rule for exactly how long they might persist, there are general guidelines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Typically, we’ve come to recognize that transient ischemic attacks probably last, at most, 5 minutes [or] 10 minutes and certainly less than an hour,” Willey said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;He added that warning strokes could last for just 30 to 60 seconds.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;That means you should not minimize a minute of arm soreness or blurred vision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Even though, by definition, transient ischemic attacks are transient, when a person’s having symptoms there’s no way to predict whether that’s going to be resolving down the road or the symptoms are going to persist and lead to a disability,” Itrat said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You should call for help if you experience symptoms.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;As soon as you notice any signs, you should call emergency medical services rather than wait for the symptoms to go away — because they may not resolve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“&lt;span&gt;If someone has any of those signs and they were abrupt in onset, I would advise them to go to the nearest emergency room,” Giglio said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Willey added that once you’re there, you should escalate your situation and let the medical staff know that you think you may have had a stroke. In other words, don’t beat around the bush or discount your symptoms. A warning stroke is an emergency and should be treated as such. Communicating with nurses and doctors effectively will let them know you need to be treated quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, Willey said if you don’t feel comfortable going to the emergency room, you should see your doctor or cardiologist as soon as possible. And that doesn’t mean in a week; it means, truly, as soon as possible.

Curious, she decided to scan a patch of skin that she had largely ignored but that had slowly changed colour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="article-im-prompt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The system flagged the lesion for urgent review under the &lt;a href="/topic/nhs"&gt;NHS’s&lt;/a&gt; two-week suspected cancer pathway. That same day, Lynsey’s referral was sent off to Chorley Hospital. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I couldn’t believe it,” she said. “I just kept thinking, what if I hadn’t said anything?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-ii" class="sc-looa6c-0 cPCVUJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-left"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="4" class="sc-awdjp1-0 gAZoaM"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/09/26/14/15/Lynsey-Roberston-ignored-her-mole-for-years.png" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/09/26/14/15/Lynsey-Roberston-ignored-her-mole-for-years.png?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/09/26/14/15/Lynsey-Roberston-ignored-her-mole-for-years.png?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Lynsey Robertson ignored her mole for years" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-346242"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 bpFomM hgzWpY"&gt;Lynsey Robertson ignored her mole for years&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 CXMrn"&gt; (Supplied)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mole didn’t hurt and although friends had occasionally asked about it, she had always dismissed it, assuming it wasn’t serious enough to bother a doctor with. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’d had it for years,” she said. “It wasn’t causing me any trouble. I thought I’d be wasting the GP’s time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She was quickly booked in for minor surgery to remove the mole, but was diagnosed days later with malignant &lt;a href="/topic/melanoma"&gt;melanoma&lt;/a&gt;, an aggressive form of skin cancer that can spread rapidly through the body. Lynsey then underwent a second procedure to remove all cancerous cells, which was successful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She is now urging others not to ignore changes in their skin or unusual marks or moles, saying that had she not tested the technology at her office, “who knows what could have happened”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Developed by Skin Analytics, the cancer detection system &lt;a href="/news/uk/home-news/nhs-people-britons-national-institute-for-health-and-care-excellence-b2742713.html"&gt;uses AI to analyse images of lesions&lt;/a&gt; and detect potential signs of skin cancer.

The images are then assessed by &lt;a href="/topic/ai"&gt;AI&lt;/a&gt;, and any lesion that is flagged will then be further reviewed by a dermatologist. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The technology, which has been deployed across the country, has been conditionally approved for the next three years and has assessed more than 170,000 &lt;a href="/topic/nhs"&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt; patients since 2020. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rapid adoption of &lt;a href="/news/health/ai-depression-mental-illness-research-b2828460.html"&gt;artificial intelligence in healthcare&lt;/a&gt; has sparked debate in the UK as some voice concerns around data security,&lt;a href="/news/health/ai-healthcare-patients-nhs-b2732070.html"&gt; data bias&lt;/a&gt;, and a lack of human empathy. In its 10-year health plan for England, the government said it would “make the NHS the most AI-enabled health system in the world with AI seamlessly integrated into clinical pathways.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="4" class="sc-awdjp1-0 aagrY"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/24/14/02/01JMVC5JY0X5KRDZSJK0FBCR8Q.jpg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/24/14/02/01JMVC5JY0X5KRDZSJK0FBCR8Q.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/24/14/02/01JMVC5JY0X5KRDZSJK0FBCR8Q.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="The NHS employs AI in hospitals and clinics" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-346244"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 bpFomM hgzWpY"&gt;The NHS employs AI in hospitals and clinics&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 CXMrn"&gt; (King’s College London/PA)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week, health secretary &lt;a href="/topic/wes-streeting"&gt;Wes Streeting&lt;/a&gt; said: “The AI revolution is here, and we are arming staff with the latest ground-breaking technology, so patients get faster and smarter care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This government is reinstating the UK’s position as a technology superpower - driving vital investment and economic growth as we build an NHS fit for the 21st century.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The skin cancer screening technology is the world's first AI legally authorised to detect cancer without a doctor present, according to Skin Analytics. It says that polling of 2,000 people found that 73 per cent believe the NHS has a duty of care to use technology that has proven benefits for patients. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-iii" class="sc-looa6c-0 cPCVUJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Urgent skin cancer referrals have skyrocketed in the UK in the last decade. According to the NHS, more than 17,000 people are diagnosed with melanoma each year, and around 2,300 people die annually. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A report from Cancer Research this month found that just half of the UK’s cancer patients were being &lt;a href="/news/health/ai-nhs-app-hospital-admissions-waiting-lists-b2827458.html"&gt;diagnosed within NHS England’s target &lt;/a&gt;of 28 days.

Credit: Shutterstock&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A pioneering study by a George Mason University researcher demonstrates the benefits of foods containing natural sugars compared to those with added sugars.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you were offered two snacks, one with seven grams of sugar and another with more than 30 grams, the healthier pick might seem obvious. But the choice is not always so straightforward. Having less sugar does not automatically make a food better for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the nearly 100 million adults in the United States currently living with prediabetes, the idea of a fruit that could help lower the risk of diabetes might sound unlikely. Tropical fruits typically contain between ten and 50 grams of sugar, with mangoes landing near the upper limit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On that basis alone, they might appear to be a poor option. Yet research led by clinical nutrition scientist Raedeh Basiri suggests otherwise. Her work shows that mangoes, even with their higher sugar content compared to many low-sugar snacks, may provide protective benefits for people with prediabetes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is not just the sugar content that matters, but the overall food context that matters,” said Basiri, assistant professor in George Mason’s Department of Nutrition and Food Studies. This study is the first long-term clinical trial to demonstrate both metabolic and body composition benefits of mangoes in prediabetes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simply put, it’s more than the sugar in the food; it’s about the whole food. The sugars naturally found in mangoes and other fruits are complemented by fiber and other vitamins and nutrients that offer additional health benefits. Food with added sugar, such as breakfast cereals, and even low-sugar snack options, may not have the same nutritional value and can even increase diabetes risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Whole Fruits in Diabetes Prevention&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The goal is to encourage people to include whole fruits, like mango, as part of healthy eating behaviors and practical dietary strategies for diabetes prevention,” said Basiri. “Individuals at high risk of diabetes should not only focus on the sugar content of foods, but on how sugars are delivered.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basiri and her team split study participants into two groups; one group received a fresh mango daily, while the other group was given a low-sugar granola bar each day. Over six months, researchers measured participants’ blood glucose levels, bodily responses to &lt;span class="glossaryLink" aria-describedby="tt" data-cmtooltip="cmtt_4cb72805779a46424113c0172c95f83d" data-gt-translate-attributes='[{"attribute":"data-cmtooltip", "format":"html"}]' tabindex="0" role="link"&gt;insulin&lt;/span&gt;, and body fat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the conclusion of the study, findings revealed that the high-sugar mango (32 grams of sugar) proved more beneficial than a low-sugar granola bar (11 grams of sugar). The group that consumed the daily mango showed improved blood glucose control, enhanced insulin sensitivity, and reduced body fat.&lt;/p&gt;

While these antibodies are useful in predicting whether a person will develop RA, a significant portion of individuals with these antibodies do not develop this condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A recent study published in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.adt7214" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Science Translational Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; characterized the changes in individuals’ immune systems as they progressed from being at risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis to actually showing clinical symptoms. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Characterizing this immune profile in at-risk individuals who progress to clinical rheumatoid arthritis could allow the early detection of this condition and the development of preemptive therapies for this at-risk population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study’s author, &lt;a href="https://vchs.ucsd.edu/about/leadership/firestein.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Gary Friestein&lt;/a&gt;, MD, senior associate vice chancellor for health sciences at the University of California, San Diego School of Medicine, said, “Most people who are at-risk for RA never develop the disease. That makes prevention studies difficult because some individuals who do not need therapy will be treated with medicines with potential side effects.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We hope that the findings from this study will directly support new ways to predict RA as well as potentially identify targets for prevention trials,” added the study’s co-author, &lt;a href="https://som.cuanschutz.edu/Profiles/Faculty/Profile/17168" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Kevin Deane,&lt;/a&gt; MD, Professor of Medicine at the University of Colorado Anschutz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune condition in which the body mistakenly produces an immune response to healthy tissue, specifically the lining that covers the joints. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The disease-modifying drugs used for the treatment of RA cannot reverse the damage, but can prevent the progression of the disease and help manage the condition. However, studies suggest that &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/rheumatology/article/64/1/65/7816327" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;5 to 27%&lt;/a&gt; of individuals with rheumatoid arthritis do not respond to these treatments, and relapse is also common after remission in individuals who respond to treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early detection of individuals at risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis can help prevent the condition from progressing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Currently, once someone develops the swollen joints of RA, the disease is usually ‘forever,’ meaning that they will need to be on treatments for life. Furthermore, worldwide, RA affects millions of people’s lives and costs billions of dollars to manage,” said Deane.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If we find ways to prevent the first swollen joints in RA, or even ‘reset’ the immune system in an at-risk stage, this could lead to people never getting full-blown RA — or having a much milder form of disease. That could have huge benefits for individuals’ well-being, as well as for public health.”&lt;br&gt;— Kevin Deane, MD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Individuals with rheumatoid arthritis exhibit elevated levels of anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPA) and rheumatoid factor (RF) 3-5 years prior to the onset of clinical symptoms. Approximately 30-60% of individuals with elevated ACPA and RF levels go on to develop rheumatoid arthritis. In other words, ACPA and RF levels are not accurate predictors of progression to RA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Attempts are currently underway to develop preemptive treatments to prevent the development of rheumatoid arthritis in the at-risk population expressing ACPA and RF. For instance, studies have shown that the drug &lt;a href="https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0140-6736(23)02650-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;abatacept&lt;/a&gt; can reduce the risk of rheumatoid arthritis development in this at-risk population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The characterization of the changes in the immune profile of at-risk individuals who develop RA could help understand the mechanism of the disease and more effectively target the subset of at-risk individuals who progress to develop RA symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study’s author, &lt;a href="https://alleninstitute.org/person/mark-gillespie/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Mark Gillespie&lt;/a&gt;, Ph.D., Assistant Investigator at the Allen Institute, explained, “Prior to this study, the field lacked an understanding of the biology of the ‘at-risk’ period and the changes that occur when individuals who are at-risk for RA go on to develop clinical disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the present study, the researchers examined the changes in the immune profiles of at-risk individuals who later developed rheumatoid arthritis, referred to as converters. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The immune profiles of converters were compared with the profiles of at-risk individuals who did not develop RA, referred to as non-converters, and healthy individuals who showed absence or very low levels of ACPA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study consisted of 45 at-risk individuals, with 16 of them developing rheumatoid arthritis during the follow-up period, and a group of 11 individuals with early clinical rheumatoid arthritis. The control group consisted of 38 healthy individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that at-risk individuals exhibited increased levels of inflammatory proteins in their circulation compared with healthy controls at the start of the study. This sign of systemic inflammation was present in at-risk individuals, regardless of whether they developed rheumatoid arthritis during the follow-up duration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, there was an increase in the number of immune cells, such as &lt;hl-trusted-source source="PubMed Central" rationale="Highly respected database from the National Institutes of Health"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK557618/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;monocytes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-trusted-source&gt;, that are involved in inflammation in both converters and non-converters. Moreover, these immune cells showed increased expression of inflammatory genes and proteins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers were unable to detect any differences in gene or protein expression in immune cells between converters and non-converters at the start of the study. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers then characterized changes within the group of converters from the time of their last visit without clinical symptoms to their next visit when they were first diagnosed with clinical RA. These changes in the immune profile of converters were compared with those in healthy controls over a similar time frame.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Autoimmune conditions are caused by the immune system’s failure to distinguish between the body’s own proteins and foreign proteins or antigens from germs. Autoimmune conditions are characterized by a dysfunction of &lt;hl-trusted-source source="PubMed Central" rationale="Highly respected database from the National Institutes of Health"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK459471/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;T and B lymphocytes,&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-trusted-source&gt; which are crucial components of the immune system involved in producing a coordinated response in an antigen-specific manner. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the present study, the researchers found changes in gene expression of B and T cells in converters, suggesting the activation or stimulation of these cells. Naive lymphocytes become activated upon their exposure to antigens, leading to their proliferation and differentiation into effector cells or memory cells. The short-lived effector cells are involved in the immediate immune response, whereas long-lived memory cells facilitate a faster response to future infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Naive or memory B cells are activated upon binding to an antigen, leading to their proliferation and differentiation into antibody-producing effector cells. In rheumatoid arthritis, subsets of B cells produce autoantibodies against the lining of joints. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;When cells become pro-inflammatory&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the present study, naive and memory B cells in converters exhibited changes in their gene expression profiles that suggested their activation. In other words, the B cells showed a shift towards a pro-inflammatory state. Moreover, the researchers identified a subset of activated memory B cells in converters with a profile similar to those found in clinical rheumatoid arthritis patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Helper T cells, which express the CD4 protein on their surface, interact with B cells and are essential for the activation of B cells. Consistent with the increase in activated B cells in converters, the researchers also found an increase in the population of effector CD4 T cells in this group of individuals. Moreover, these CD4 T cells showed increased expression of genes that are involved in B cell activation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The activation of B cells and the increase in the number of helper T cells in converters suggest a shift toward increased autoantibody production, which could contribute to disease progression. In addition, naive CD4 T cells also showed changes in gene regulation mechanisms, priming them to differentiate into effector cells capable of promoting B cell activation.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Looking and feeling ‘healthy’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our team discovered that during this ‘at-risk’ period, where individuals look and feel healthy, their immune systems are dramatically different. Individuals at risk for RA exhibit widespread inflammation and signs of immune activity, including in B cells that produce the autoreactive antibodies characteristic of RA, as well as in T cells that interface with and instruct the B cells to produce these antibodies.” &lt;br&gt;— Mark Gillespie, Ph.D.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We also discovered immune changes in ‘naïve’ T cells, which are significant because these cells have not encountered any threats previously and may suggest that immune cells in individuals at-risk for RA are already wired to respond in a determinantal manner,” Gillespie added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Medical News Today</author><pubDate>Sun, 28 Sep 2025 10:34:44 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipAFBVV95cUxQcVFDQmItTDlEMUhyQjk1dWhyem5MY1h2MmVFb2Y4T1EtS3pnSDNaU0o2b04tTENjY1pWWDFXdWhQV0ZBMXNFbGhXV1JYUnFHb0pzdHlSV3QtYWFfNkxPOE8tQXVKUnRBM0d0eFh5cG5HU3BsVng1N0hoMEJpR1QwZEpTcU1WY0wtRkpQMEJCVHdueE9XZFRGSlg0Umd2ZHpIYVF5Xw</guid></item><item><title>科学家发现肠道-大脑相互作用与心理健康之间的惊人联系- PsyPost</title><link>https://www.psypost.org/scientists-discover-surprising-link-between-gut-brain-interactions-and-mental-health/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="content-inner "&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study provides evidence that the connection between the brain and the stomach may be linked to mental health in a measurable way. Researchers from Aarhus University in Denmark, publishing their work in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s44220-025-00468-6" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Nature Mental Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, report that a specific pattern of communication between the brain and the stomach reflects how individuals feel emotionally and psychologically. Their findings suggest that these gut-brain interactions can indicate a person’s levels of anxiety, depression, well-being, and overall quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea that emotions are linked to physical sensations in the gut is widely reflected in language. People often talk about having “butterflies in the stomach” when nervous, or feeling “sick to the stomach” when distressed. Yet, despite these common expressions, most scientific attention in the field of brain-body interaction has focused on other organs, such as the heart and lungs. These areas have long been studied for their roles in emotion and mood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers were struck by how little was known about how the stomach, in particular, interacts with the brain. While recent studies have explored the influence of gut bacteria and digestion on mental health, very little work had been done on the electrical rhythms of the stomach and how they may directly communicate with the brain’s networks involved in emotion, attention, and cognition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team behind this new study wanted to explore whether a person’s psychological profile might be reflected in how strongly the stomach and brain are coupled during rest. Their aim was not to link a specific diagnosis like depression to a single brain region, but rather to identify patterns across a broad spectrum of mental health experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our interest grew from the long-standing discussion about the role of the body in shaping emotion, a question that has fascinated philosophers and scientists for centuries,” said study author &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/leah-banellis-phd-b192a6a0/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Leah Banellis&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://bsky.app/profile/leahbanellis.bsky.social" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;@leahbanellis&lt;/a&gt;), a postdoctoral fellow in Cognitive Neuroscience at Aarhus University. “Yet, while the heart and lungs have received much attention, the stomach has been largely overlooked. This gap struck us as especially surprising, because the link between the stomach and emotional experience feels so intuitive. It is heavily reflected in everyday language, with phrases like ‘butterflies in the stomach,’ ‘sick to our stomach,’ or ‘trust your gut.'”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was part of the Visceral Mind Project, a large-scale initiative that combines data on brain activity, bodily rhythms, and psychological assessments. The team recorded data from 243 people using a method that captures both electrical signals from the stomach (electrogastrography) and brain activity measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The participants represented a wide range of mental health profiles, from those reporting high well-being to others showing signs of distress, including anxiety, depression, fatigue, and insomnia. To capture this diversity, the researchers didn’t exclude people with psychiatric symptoms or diagnoses. Instead, they aimed for variation, which would allow their models to detect patterns across the mental health spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each participant underwent a series of recordings while lying still in the MRI scanner. At the same time, sensors on the abdomen captured the stomach’s slow electrical rhythm, which cycles about three times per minute. This rhythm, which originates from specialized cells in the stomach lining, is typically involved in coordinating digestion. But the researchers suspected it might also be linked to mental state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To analyze the relationship between stomach and brain activity, the team used a method that looks at how well the two rhythms align over time. This measure, known as phase-locking value, essentially captures the degree of synchronization between stomach signals and brain signals across different regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers then combined this data with results from a comprehensive mental health questionnaire. The battery included 37 different scores across a range of domains—such as anxiety, stress, mood, fatigue, attention, sleep quality, and life satisfaction. Using a statistical method known as canonical correlation analysis, they looked for patterns that linked brain-stomach coupling with the participants’ mental health profiles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analysis revealed a clear and statistically significant pattern. Stronger coupling between the stomach’s rhythm and brain activity was associated with poorer mental health. Individuals who reported more symptoms of anxiety, depression, stress, and fatigue tended to show increased synchronization between their stomach and brain rhythms. In contrast, those with higher levels of well-being and life satisfaction showed weaker coupling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For the first time, we’ve found a scientific link between your ‘gut feelings’ and your mental health, showing a surprising connection between your stomach’s natural rhythm and your brain,” Banellis told PsyPost. “Specifically, our study revealed that stronger communication between the stomach and brain is linked to worse mental health, such as higher symptoms of anxiety, depression, stress, and fatigue, whereas weaker stomach-brain communication aligns with better mental health reflected in higher overall well-being and quality of life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This stomach-brain signature was not random. It was localized in specific brain networks, particularly those involved in attention, cognitive control, and salience detection. Some of the strongest associations were found in regions like the superior angular gyrus and the posterior frontal and parietal areas—regions often implicated in cognitive tasks and mental health disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, the researchers ran multiple control analyses to ensure the robustness of their findings. They ruled out the possibility that the observed effects were simply due to general brain activity patterns, fluctuations in heart rate or breathing, or basic features of stomach physiology. In other words, the association appeared specific to the coupling between the stomach’s electrical rhythm and particular brain networks—not just a general marker of body or brain state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their approach was designed to detect broad psychological dimensions rather than focus on one diagnosis. The strongest psychological pattern they found was a spectrum ranging from negative affective states (like anxiety and depression) to positive traits (like well-being and quality of life). This result suggests that the stomach-brain connection is not tied to any one disorder but instead reflects a general mode of psychological functioning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Anxiety, depression, stress, and fatigue showed the strongest links to stomach-brain communication,” Banellis explained. “While phrases like ‘butterflies in the stomach’ or feeling ‘sick to your stomach’ are common ways we describe emotional distress, it was surprising to find such consistent and clear evidence across these symptoms. Even more unexpected was the direction of the effect: we might have assumed that stronger alignment between the body and brain would be beneficial. Instead, our findings suggest that heightened stomach-brain communication could act more like a warning signal, an internal alarm system reflecting mental strain rather than harmony.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As with all research, there are limitations. The findings are based on resting-state measurements, meaning the participants were not performing any tasks during the brain scans. This leaves open the question of how the stomach-brain relationship behaves during emotional challenges or cognitive demands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another limitation is that the study was cross-sectional—it measured participants at one point in time. This limits the ability to determine cause and effect. Longitudinal studies that follow people over time will be needed to see whether changes in stomach-brain coupling can predict shifts in mental health, or whether interventions that alter this coupling can improve well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Despite our study including hundreds of participants, far surpassing the size of previous studies, and using a robust machine learning technique, our study is correlational in nature,” Banellis noted. “Thus, future causal paradigms are needed to understand this mental health associated stomach-brain relationship further.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also note that their measurements relied on surface recordings of stomach activity, which can be affected by noise and variability. Despite extensive quality control, a portion of the data had to be excluded. Future studies using higher-resolution tools or invasive methods in clinical settings might yield even clearer signals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our study raises important questions about causality, whether the stomach is influencing the brain, the brain is influencing the stomach, or both, as well as how stomach-brain communication develops over time and whether it can predict changes in mental health,” Banellis said. “It also opens the door to new treatment approaches targeting the disrupted brain-body connection we identified.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“To build on these findings, we plan to pursue three closely connected next steps: first, case-controlled studies in patients diagnosed with anxiety or depression; second, longitudinal studies to track how stomach-brain communication evolves and whether it predicts mental health trajectories; and third, testing new interventions designed to modulate stomach-brain interactions and evaluate their potential for improving mental health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s44220-025-00468-6" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Stomach–brain coupling indexes a dimensional signature of mental health&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Leah Banellis, Ignacio Rebollo, Niia Nikolova, and Micah Allen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Sun, 28 Sep 2025 10:28:30 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirgFBVV95cUxPdVdqTV8zU1p2NDczWEc0SkhmeFFTanVJV2dsMmdXTlI2UTZjNzBFaGtYdDloUGlEcnA2ajduYk9ta1BfemJsclBEVTR6azA2QXVJamlFdnUxcmY1ZnV0c0lXMy1ZSTRaQm1TQjJ5RjNQWlhGaXBlaXRCMkdQVk1VZFVUM0k5dk9Va2VjVE5Dd3NoMHdMRDBpemFsRVZMTTVXcG8wRDZMTi1sRjl6N1E</guid></item><item><title>泰诺很受欢迎，而且很安全。我们将解释这种药物如何在体内发挥作用-今日美国</title><link>https://www.usatoday.com/story/graphics/2025/09/28/how-tylenol-works-nsaids-autism-pain-relivers/86351608007/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gnt_ar_b"&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;On Sept. 22, President &lt;a target="_blank" href="/news/politics/donald-trump/" data-autotag="26f031d1-9924-4f10-b4e6-019d076113d5" rel="noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Donald Trump&lt;/a&gt; pushed an unproven link between Tylenol and an increase in &lt;a href="/story/news/politics/2025/09/22/autism-tylenol-takeaways-trump-rfk-jr/86293921007/" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;autism in children&lt;/a&gt;, and he issued an urgent warning to expectant mothers not to take the medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;What do we know about the drug? Tylenol is used to treat a several conditions, such as mild to moderate pain, &lt;a href="/story/news/health/2024/11/22/valley-fever-cases-arizona/76476521007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;fever&lt;/a&gt;, headaches, muscle aches, toothaches, backaches and colds.

They are used for treating various types of pain and are part of different drug classes. One significant distinction is that Tylenol does not relieve inflammation; NSAIDs do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Tylenol falls under the umbrella of two other medication classes: analgesics (pain relievers) and antipyretics (fever reducers), says &lt;a href="https://uihc.org/childrens/providers/anureet-walia" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Dr. Anureet Walia&lt;/a&gt;, a pain management specialist with UI Health Care. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;To this day, it's still a bit of a mystery how acetaminophen works. What experts do know is acetaminophen works solely on the central nervous system, while NSAIDs work on the brain and the body as a whole.

Taking your medication as recommended ensures you will receive its full benefits. Always take your current medical conditions and the sort of pain your body may experiencing into account when choosing between Tylenol and an NSAID.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Here's a comparison on how theses drugs work:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Regardless of the type of pain reliever, it’s important to remember that Tylenol and NSAIDs should &lt;a href="/in-depth/news/health/2022/12/11/pain-america-expensive-complicated-problem-managing-pain/8210733001/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;be taken only for episodic pain&lt;/a&gt;. “If your pain is constant and around the clock, it really should be a discussion with your physician about the source of the pain (and) how to best manage it,” Mangan says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;No casual link between Tylenol and autism&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The American Psychiatric Association issued the following statement on autism in response to President Trump's announcement:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“It is essential that the administration prioritizes evidence-based support for individuals on the autism spectrum and invests in long-term comprehensive research about the disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"Vaccines do not cause autism.

&lt;p id="7d341865-008a-4164-a8cd-960f2950a22f"&gt;If you love figs, you may have heard some unsettling lore about them: that every fig hides a wasp, because these insects need to crawl inside and die in order for the fruit to grow. But are there really wasps in the figs we eat, or is this just a myth?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The answer is somewhere in between. Wasps do play an essential role in the life cycle of many types of fig trees, but most figs from the supermarket are likely bug-free.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-seasonal" href="" data-url="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="7d341865-008a-4164-a8cd-960f2950a22f-2" class="paywall" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.botanicgardens.org.au/teachers-and-schools/teacher-resources/primary-learning-resources/garden-safari-invertebrates-0" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.botanicgardens.org.au/teachers-and-schools/teacher-resources/primary-learning-resources/garden-safari-invertebrates-0" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Fig wasps&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; are a group of hundreds of species of small insects that spend much of their life inside figs. They're about the size of a fruit fly, and they're not the same type of wasps that sting humans. Figs and fig wasps have &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/planet-earth/evolution" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/planet-earth/evolution"&gt;&lt;u&gt;evolved&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; alongside each other for millions of years, leading to a special relationship called &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.nhm.ac.uk/discover/mutualism-examples-of-species-that-work-together.html" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.nhm.ac.uk/discover/mutualism-examples-of-species-that-work-together.html" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;mutualism&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, or a link between two species that benefits both of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mid-article-leaderboard" class="ad-unit sm:hidden block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="068a1ec1-5f44-4831-bfbf-ba02625da19c"&gt;"Fig trees and fig wasps are a great example of a mutualism," &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.uu.se/en/contact-and-organisation/staff?query=N10-1267" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.uu.se/en/contact-and-organisation/staff?query=N10-1267" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Charlotte Jandér&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a plant ecology and evolution researcher at Uppsala University in Sweden, told Live Science in an email.

But this relationship is rather complex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What we think of as the fig "fruit" is actually a hollow structure called a syconium filled with tiny flowers. Generally, when a female fig wasp crawls inside a synconium from a female fig tree, she spreads pollen, which the plant needs in order to produce seeds and ripen. The hole that the wasp crawls in is very small, and she may lose her wings and antenna in the process and can even die inside the fig.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, it's possible that some types of figs may have dead fig wasps inside them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that doesn't necessarily mean the figs we eat have wasps inside. Not all types of figs require pollination in order to ripen. Humans eat the fig species &lt;em&gt;Ficus carica, &lt;/em&gt;which has several cultivars that are parthenocarpic, meaning they can produce ripe fruit without pollination — and therefore, without fig wasps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Most figs we eat in the US have no wasps inside them," &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://biology.umd.edu/people/carlos-machado" target="_blank" data-url="https://biology.umd.edu/people/carlos-machado" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Carlos Machado&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a biology professor at the University of Maryland, told Live Science in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check id="eee78aa6-647e-43ea-b4d2-f069e5713eea"&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="caption-text"&gt;A female wasp entering a fig. Fig wasps can't sting humans, and they're much smaller than the wasps that do. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: Danita Delimont via Alamy)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p id="c8d9cfa5-2d5b-44e1-95f4-3e43394549d6"&gt;Mission figs and Brown Turkey figs are two commonly-sold fig cultivars that don't require wasp pollination to ripen and produce seeds, Jandér said. This doesn't apply to all figs that humans eat, though; Smyrna figs, Calimyrna figs, and wild figs around the Mediterranean all rely on wasps for pollination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Most wild figs do require pollination to produce ripe fruit," Machado explained. That means these types of figs could have a tiny wasp inside them — but it's still not a guarantee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/planet-earth/plants/how-do-plants-with-seedless-fruit-reproduce" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/planet-earth/plants/how-do-plants-with-seedless-fruit-reproduce"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do plants with seedless fruit reproduce?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just because a wasp was once in the fig, doesn't mean it's still in there by the time the fig is eaten. The synconia of &lt;em&gt;Ficus carcia&lt;/em&gt; have a large enough opening that the fig wasp is sometimes able to leave the structure after entering. If the wasp does die inside, her body generally gets squished and decomposes from the process of the fig maturing, Jandér said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Even if there were remnants of the original pollinator there you probably would not see them," Jandér explained. Any crunchy texture is more likely from the plant's seeds, not wasp remains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-a2342a21-12d9-443f-8dc0-543b01059df7" class="paywall" aria-hidden="true" href="" data-url="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id="the-fig-wasp-life-cycle-3"&gt;The fig wasp life cycle&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="c50a1ca6-b273-44dc-8b65-d4dafd1b56b6"&gt;Although wasps sometimes die inside figs, these fruits are actually an essential part of their reproduction cycle. Just as most types of figs need wasp pollination to make new fruit, fig wasps couldn't reproduce without the help of fig trees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a female wasp crawls into a fig syconium from a female tree — the type of figs we eat — she only pollinates it, because the flowers inside are too long for her to lay her eggs on. But if she ventures into a synconium from a male tree — which are called caprifigs and generally not eaten by humans — she'll start to &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fs.usda.gov/wildflowers/pollinators/pollinator-of-the-month/fig_wasp.shtml" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.fs.usda.gov/wildflowers/pollinators/pollinator-of-the-month/fig_wasp.shtml" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;lay her eggs&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There, the eggs hatch and develop from larvae into young wasps, which mate while still inside the fruit. Generally, the male wasps die inside the caprifig after mating, though they do help chew a tunnel that allows the female wasps to escape, sometimes even offering themselves as bait for the predatory ants that may be waiting outside. Eventually, the fertilized female wasps burst out in search of a new fig to lay their eggs in, carrying pollen from the old caprifig with them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="08c65b1d-ba48-46e7-8edb-88c362c71881"&gt;There are over &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.northwestern.edu/stories/2023/07/unraveling-the-tangled-evolution-of-figs" target="_blank" data-url="https://news.northwestern.edu/stories/2023/07/unraveling-the-tangled-evolution-of-figs" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;850 species of fig trees&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and each one can only be pollinated by a specific species of fig wasp, Jandér said. The relationship between these plants and animals evolved millions of years ago, and both Machado and Jandér pointed to its importance. As a keystone species — an organism that many other plants or animals in the ecosystem rely on to survive — fig trees and their relationship with wasps continue to be of great interest to researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are other plant-pollinator mutualisms in nature, but the fig-fig wasp mutualism is possibly the most diverse and most consequential of all," Machado said.&lt;/p&gt;

Only two antibiotics work against those infections, and the drugs are expensive and must be administered through an IV, researchers said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-3 bYFsJw cuqaEv article-text"&gt;Bacteria with the gene were once considered exotic, linked to a small number of patients who received medical care overseas. Though the numbers are still small, the rate of U.S. cases jumped more than fivefold in recent years, the researchers reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-3 bYFsJw cuqaEv article-text"&gt;“The rise of NDMs in the U.S. is a grave danger and very worrisome,” said David Weiss, an Emory University infectious diseases researcher, in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-3 bYFsJw cuqaEv article-text"&gt;It’s likely many people are unrecognized carriers of the drug-resistant bacteria, which could lead to community spread, the CDC scientists said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-3 bYFsJw cuqaEv article-text"&gt;That may play out in doctors’ offices across the country, as infections long considered routine — like urinary tract infections — could become harder to treat, said Dr. Maroya Walters, one of the report’s authors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__FlexBase-sc-1fnzlkn-1 jGlKin adWrapper" aria-label="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-3 bYFsJw cuqaEv article-text"&gt;Antimicrobial resistance occurs when germs such as bacteria and fungi gain the power to fight off the drugs designed to kill them. The misuse of antibiotics was a big reason for the rise — unfinished or unnecessary prescriptions that didn’t kill the germs made them stronger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-3 kNAFkD cuqaEv article-text"&gt;In recent years, the CDC has drawn attention to “ &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/afcee30eb24848d38f9b855fbcc9a4ba"&gt;nightmare bacteria&lt;/a&gt; ” resistant to a wide range of antibiotics. That includes carbapenems, a class of antibiotics considered a last resort for treatment of serious infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-3 bYFsJw cuqaEv article-text"&gt;Researchers drew data from 29 states that do the necessary testing and reporting of carbapenem-resistant bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-3 bYFsJw cuqaEv article-text"&gt;They counted 4,341 cases of carbapenem-resistant bacterial infections from those states in 2023, with 1,831 of them the NDM variety. The researchers did not say how many of the infected people died.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-3 bYFsJw cuqaEv article-text"&gt;The rate of carbapenem-resistant infections rose from just under 2 per 100,000 people in 2019 to more than 3 per 100,000 in 2023 — an increase of 69%. But the rate of NDM cases rose from around 0.25 to about 1.35 — an increase of 460%, the authors said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-3 kNAFkD cuqaEv article-text"&gt;A researcher not involved in the study said the increase is probably related to the &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/hub/covid-19-pandemic"&gt;COVID-19 pandemic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-3 bYFsJw cuqaEv article-text"&gt;“We know that there was a huge surge in antibiotic use during the pandemic, so this likely is reflected in increasing drug resistance,” said Dr. Jason Burnham, a Washington University researcher, in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__FlexBase-sc-1fnzlkn-1 jGlKin adWrapper" aria-label="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-3 bYFsJw cuqaEv article-text"&gt;The CDC’s count is only a partial picture. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-3 bYFsJw cuqaEv article-text"&gt;Many states are not fully testing and reporting cases. Even in states that do, cases tend to be among hospital patients sick enough to warrant special testing.

A CDC &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7423a2.htm"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; published in June noted an increase in NDM cases in New York City between 2019 and 2024. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-3 bYFsJw cuqaEv article-text"&gt;___&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-3 bYFsJw cuqaEv article-text"&gt;This story was first published Sept. 23, 2025.

This sustained elevation, Dr Jamnadas said, can lead to &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/doctor-reveals-6-signs-you-might-have-insulin-resistance-increased-belly-fat-cravings-for-carbs-sugar-thirst-101754709377512.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="insulin resistance"&gt;insulin resistance&lt;/a&gt;, requiring the body to produce even more insulin to manage blood sugar. He added that this background of high insulin, even when blood sugar levels appear normal, is destructive to metabolism and causes visceral fat to accumulate, particularly around the internal organs and in the liver, leading to a condition known as fatty liver. This visceral fat is specifically produced from glucose and is considered a particularly harmful type of fat, he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="embed_div"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The dangers of elevated insulin levels&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Jamnadas said: “Any hormone that stays in your body for a long time, the body becomes immune to it. So now you produce a whole bunch of insulin in order to bring that sugar level down. So then you say, okay, well, it doesn't matter because the insulin is bringing the sugar level down. So what's the harm – you're not a diabetic. No, but it's that background, high insulin, that is destroying your metabolism. It's that high insulin level in the background. So insulin pushes glucose into the liver and you develop a fatty liver. It pushes the calories into production of new fats around your viscera.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The viscera means in your belly, around your pancreas, you get visceral fat. Now this fat is produced from glucose – it's a different kind of fat. Look, if I gave you a high-calorie diet right now, of all sorts of foods, you put on weight everywhere. Okay? But if I give you glucose you put it on mostly in your stomach and your stomach will protrude and that's called visceral fat. It's on the inside. You can't pinch it around the organs. This is very detrimental fat. And that's the epidemic that we have today,” he added.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="mt10 mb10 htEchoArticlePromo"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="predictorShow mb20" data-vars-predictor="true" data-vars-quiz="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="quizShow mb20" data-vars-minimized="false" data-vars-predictor="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Fasting: a solution to reduce visceral fat&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what can you do? According to Dr Jamnadas: “The only thing that will make you lose that fat very quickly is to change your diet, of course, and you have to do &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/does-intermittent-fasting-actually-work-what-most-people-get-wrong-mistake-how-to-follow-this-diet-health-coach-explains-101756635500243.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="fasting"&gt;fasting&lt;/a&gt; because fasting brings your insulin level. See this is where fasting comes in... you see when you don't eat, your insulin levels come down because you are not stimulating your pancreas anymore. So you want to bring your insulin levels down.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He added, “The best thing you can do in the world is to do fasting because if I just simply cut down on my calories, then there's a different physiology that's going to take place in the body, and when you fast there's a totally different physiology.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr Jamnadas explained: “When you cut down on calories the body senses that this caloric deficit your metabolic rate muscles included. So you lose fat and you also lose muscles. On the other hand, when you're fasting, it's a different physiology. Fasting is I've put on fat. Now I'm going to take it out of the bank. Now the bank is going to be available for me to pull out my calories and use it now.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“And you start burning the fat. So in the first 12 hours of a fast, you take out all the glucose in the form of glycogen from your muscles and your liver. After 12 hours, you start pulling the fat out. And the first place the fat comes out of is going to be visceral fat. That is why fasting benefits you so much because it gets rid of that worst fat. The fat that is very inflammatory,” Dr Jamnadas concluded.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This report is based on user-generated content from social media.

&lt;p id="a82dd7cc-5a06-433a-80e7-088725468f64"&gt;Aging has its challenges. The body slows down, joints get stiffer, and holding onto muscle takes more effort than it used to. And while there’s plenty of fitness advice out there, much of it feels geared toward younger crowds rather than older generations looking to stay strong and steady.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s where Ed Gemdjian comes in.

You will train major patterns used every day: sit and stand, hinge, push, pull, brace, and get up from the floor.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The structure is simple: start with the warm-up, then move through all six exercises as a circuit, repeating two to three times per week on non-consecutive days. He also stresses the importance of listening to your body: “If a rep hurts sharply, stop and reduce the range or choose the easier option. And if you have medical concerns, speak with a healthcare provider before starting a new program.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now let's take a look at the exercises...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-warm-up" href="" data-url="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-warm-up"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Warm-up&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;a id="elk-c2c52e65-860d-45d6-ac3d-9d4a499b0a85" href="" data-url="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id="bird-dog-3"&gt;Bird Dog&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul id="5d85505e-75a1-4aed-b75b-c2e8c3a799ea"&gt;&lt;li&gt;5 slow reps per side with a 3‑second hold.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hands under shoulders, knees under hips.

This can make everyday tasks like climbing stairs, carrying groceries, or getting up from the floor more difficult than they used to feel. Maintaining strength is key not just for mobility, but for balance, energy, and overall independence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gemdjian highlights why this matters so much in his work at The Gym Venice. He says, “Strength training is the single best antidote to age-related decline. After 30, we lose muscle and power each decade, which erodes balance, joint health, and independence.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He says it's a good idea to focus on compound movements as they engage multiple muscles in one movement. “These exercises preserve lean mass, strengthen bones, and improve insulin sensitivity, keeping energy and weight manageable.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus, they build stronger glutes, legs, and core, making everyday tasks like climbing stairs, carrying groceries, or getting off the floor feel easier. “Strength work through &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/features/progressive-overload-what-is-it-and-how-does-it-help-build-muscle-and-strength" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/features/progressive-overload-what-is-it-and-how-does-it-help-build-muscle-and-strength"&gt;progressive overload&lt;/a&gt; also sharpens the brain via coordination and nervous-system adaptations,” he adds. “Add a little weight, reps, or range as your body adapts and loads gradually will begin to feel easier.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Follow &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqKAgKIiJDQklTRXdnTWFnOEtEWFJ2YlhObmRXbGtaUzVqYjIwb0FBUAE" target="_blank" data-url="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqKAgKIiJDQklTRXdnTWFnOEtEWFJ2YlhObmRXbGtaUzVqYjIwb0FBUAE" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tom's Guide on Google News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://google.com/preferences/source?q=tomsguide.com" target="_blank" data-url="https://google.com/preferences/source?q=tomsguide.com" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;em&gt;add us as a preferred source&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

He passed away in 2022 at the age of five.&lt;/p&gt;				&lt;div class="body content-single-wrap"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PARENTS who each carry the sickle cell trait have a one-in-four chance of having a child with sickle cell anaemia — a painful reality with which Latoya Minott Smikle has had to live.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During her fourth pregnancy, the now mother of five learnt that her four-week-old baby — Aiden-Jon Amir Hall — had sickle cell disease. At the time, she also found out that she, her partner, and their three other children were carriers of the sickle cell trait.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After five-and-a-half years of fighting courageously, Aiden-Jon passed away due to complications with the disease in 2022. Out of that heartache and the battle she waged on his behalf, Smikle established the Aiden-Jon Amir Hall Foundation, which is seeking to raise $1 million this year to provide financial support to six individuals with sickle cell disease. The foundation is also looking to raise awareness about the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smikle recalled that before Aiden-Jon’s birth, she’d lived next door to a family who also had loved ones with sickle cell disease. She told the &lt;b&gt;Jamaica Observer&lt;/b&gt; that she became aware of their late-night hospital runs during a crisis and would hear the anguished cries of pain that echoed through the neighbourhood. Yet, she admitted, she’d never imagined that one day that would also be her reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It was after Aiden was diagnosed with the disease that the Sickle Cell Unit in Kingston, which was the unit that reached out to us, they were the ones that looked up my children’s medical records from birth, and then from there they would have discovered that all of them have the trait.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Imagine you’re learning that you have a baby with full sickle cell, then you’re finding out that yourself has the trait and all your living children also have the trait. I don’t think I have to tell you how jarring that was. It was very shocking and very jarring, and I think for a moment I became depressed because I would have been four weeks postpartum; that’s not the easiest kind of news to bear at that time,” she told the &lt;b&gt;Sunday Observer&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smikle said subsequent checks would later reveal that it was likely her mother who had the sickle cell trait.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sickle cell is a genetic blood disorder that causes red blood cells to become rigid, abnormal cells that block blood flow in small vessels, leading to severe pain. An individual can either have the trait or the full extent of the disease. If an individual is diagnosed with the trait, it means that they inherited one sickle cell gene. The full extent of the disease, sickle cell anaemia, occurs when an individual inherits two sickle cell genes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;September is recognised as Sickle Cell Awareness Month, an annual observance dedicated to raising awareness, understanding, and support for the inherited blood disorder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aiden-Jon was diagnosed with sickle cell anaemia, the most common and severe form of the disease that causes red blood cells to become stiff, crescent-shaped, leading to anaemia, painful episodes, and potentially severe organ damage as the sickle cells block blood flow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like her neighbours, Smikle said late-night hospital visits soon became the norm as she cradled her baby through multiple painful crises. Hospital stays were rarely fewer than seven days, and balancing finances, work, and caring for her other children alongside her husband proved an overwhelming task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At times she had no choice but to take Aiden-Jon with her to work, as her spouse served in the Jamaica Constabulary Force. She recounted one particularly difficult moment when she took him with her as she led a work event in St Ann, only for him to suffer a major crisis before it began — one that ended with another hospital admission. She shared that she was living in Clarendon at the time, but wanted her son to be treated at the specialised Sickle Cell Unit in Kingston to receive comprehensive care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My car had to become an ambulance. I had to be flying like a mad woman from St Ann to get back into town because when a child is in pain; it’s difficult hearing your child cry all the way from St Ann to Kingston. There is nothing that can soothe that pain but whatever is administered to him; for example, morphine and other drugs through IV [intravenous therapy], plus give him the requisite treatment that he needs at the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s very challenging. Sickle cell anaemia is a very challenging situation for parents, especially if you’re not somebody who has a job that pays well; it even becomes a greater challenge because, financially, it is a very stressful situation,” said Smikle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She told the &lt;b&gt;Sunday Observer&lt;/b&gt; that her experience has revealed the gaps that exist in the system as well as the lack of empathy in society for individuals living with sickle cell disease and for parents struggling with their children. While the Sickle Cell Unit, which is located at the University of the West Indies, Mona, serves as a vital pillar by providing testing, resources, and some level of support, Smikle does not believe it is adequately funded to deliver holistic care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She noted, too, that even with assistance from the National Health Fund to cover the cost of medication for loved ones with sickle cell disease, many parents continue to struggle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a country where approximately one in every 150 babies is born with sickle cell disease and one in 10 adults carries the trait, she stressed that greater support and resources are urgently needed. She is hoping the Aiden-Jon Amir Hall Foundation, launched last Saturday, will bring about some of that change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I believe that God would have known that this would have been my journey and that I would have needed all these life experiences as a tool to help me now to be better able to help other persons, and so, for me, the foundation is to let my son continue to live and continue to impact people, because even though he was five and a half years old, he was such a loving child; people were impacted by him. The testimonies that people shared at his funeral, one would have assumed that he was an adult, but he was just a child and very impactful in such a very small window of time,” she told the &lt;b&gt;Sunday Observer&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As a Christian, some people would ask me if I don’t ask God why, and why God never healed him, but my faith tells me that God sacrificed his only son through a very brutal death to provide life for me. Whatever my son went through, whatever we all went through as a family with my son, I believe there was purpose behind it to help the forgotten, to help those that are being overlooked, to help those that can’t speak for themselves because they’re in too much pain and because nobody wants to hear anything from them,” she reasoned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smikle said she has identified six recipients for a grant — a number that reflects how old her son would have been if he had not passed away a month before his birthday in 2022. One of the recipients is the child of a single father who has to undergo surgery to remove his/her spleen. There will be a fund-raising dinner in October to raise $1 million for the recipients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s to build a community that can help others who are struggling; for them to understand, ‘You’re not alone.’ For me, most importantly, my child would not have survived, not because there wasn’t effort put forward to making him live the best life he lived, but I want to help someone else’s child to be able to live longer and healthier, and to reach the peak of all that they are able to achieve so that I can smile when I visit my son’s grave; I can smile and say, ‘I did it for him,’ ” said Smikle.&lt;/p&gt;

Maybe it's financial problems, relationship issues, or personal pain, but they often walk through life feeling alone. While their behaviors indicate there's a problem, their words sometimes speak louder. Whether it's saying they don't care or acting like they're busy, if someone says any of these phrases casually, they're struggling more than they want to admit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It isn't always obvious when our loved ones are going through things, but there will sometimes be telltale signs. It could be their tone of voice or dismissive words, but it's up to us to pay close attention. Because when a person is struggling, they may be crying out for help and their words will fall on deaf ears.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;If someone says any of these 11 phrases casually, they're struggling more than they want to admit&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;1.

It's unfortunate, but most people who are struggling won't reveal that their mental health is in decline. Filled with guilt and shame, they'd rather cover it up by telling others they are fine, but this can be dangerous and hurtful to those who care about them most.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if they don't see it, their loved ones have a strong desire to connect and be vulnerable with each other. As the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6125010/" rel="nofollow"&gt;American Journal of Lifestyle Medicine&lt;/a&gt; reiterated, "Humans are wired to connect, and this connection affects our health."

As a result, they may shrug and give up. But if someone says "it is what it is," they're struggling more than they want to admit&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Loved ones might be upset to hear it, but those dealing with mental or emotional health issues may not see it as a big deal. Maybe they were taught to just suck it up and deal with it, or are so tired of trying that they have nothing left to give.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Holding everything in might make someone feel more isolated in the long run, causing them to pull away. But talking to loved ones can help and &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/health-wellness/most-powerful-phrase-for-someone-struggling"&gt;provide a safe space to open up&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/subtle-habits-tell-other-people-everything-they-need-know-about-you"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8 Subtle Habits That Tell Other People Everything They Need To Know About You&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;3.

But when someone uses their tiredness as an excuse to avoid doing certain things, like socializing with friends or taking care of their daily responsibilities, it's not a good sign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who are struggling are shutting themselves out from seeking help, making their mental health issues worse. And according to a &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1745691614568352" rel="nofollow"&gt;study published in Perspectives on Psychological Science&lt;/a&gt;, loneliness and social isolation are twice as harmful to someone's physical and mental health as obesity is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/truly-smart-people-usually-avoid-anyone-who-does-these-things"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Truly Smart People Usually Avoid Anyone Who Does These 11 Things&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;4.

Like clockwork, they'll compare their issues to someone who is seemingly struggling more than them, downplaying their own pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But just because it isn't as severe as someone else's plight, doesn't make it any less important.

Even if it's something small like journaling their thoughts, actively finding a way to vent is the best way to figure out what to say or, at the very least, get those emotions out in a healthy and productive way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/habits-quietly-successful-people-miserable-people-overlook"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5 Habits Of Quietly Successful People That Miserable Folks Always Overlook&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;7.

Despite venting being good for their mental health, those who struggle will always do things on their own terms, despite it harming them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/money/people-who-never-struggle-financially-avoid-these-everyday-habits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People Who Never Struggle Financially Avoid These 11 Everyday Habits&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;8.

Despite how difficult the obstacle may be, they can't always depend on others to save them. But this doesn't mean they have to shut everyone out completely. Even if they can't always help, at the very least, people can offer the support needed to keep moving forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who don't bother asking for help are always going to struggle the most. Even if they can do it all on their own, isolation and the feeling of helplessness are only intensified when they shut down. This is why it's important to let people in.

So, they choose to portray everything as just fine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While they might not see anything wrong with this, shutting out others is hurtful. After all, feeling abandoned can hurt just about anyone's feelings. Does this mean people have to open up completely? No, but simply saying, "I'm going through something, but I'd rather not talk about it now" is a lot better than keeping them in the dark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/health-wellness/tiny-ways-people-can-tell-you-didnt-shower-even-when-try-freshen-up"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;11 Tiny Ways People Can Tell You Didn't Shower, Even When You Try To Freshen Up&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;11.

Likely, it's true. But everyone needs a break now and then, and using being busy as an excuse is never a good sign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/your-body-has-something-to-tell-you/202412/the-cost-of-fighting-your-unwanted-emotions"&gt;psychologist Elizabeth Sadock&lt;/a&gt; put it,"Suppressing emotion is like denying hunger: It persists because it serves an essential purpose." So, even if they're not revealing how they truly feel, eventually, it will come back to bite them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/family/quiet-struggles-only-moms-who-financially-provide-for-their-families-will-understand"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;11 Quiet Struggles Only Moms Who Financially Provide For Their Families Will Understand&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Marielisa Reyes is a writer with a bachelor's degree in psychology who covers self-help, relationships, career, family, and astrology topics.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="midcat-most-popular"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Related Stories From YourTango:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p id="rc-widget-c743d1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>YourTango</author><pubDate>Sun, 28 Sep 2025 03:33:53 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMingFBVV95cUxNYU1pQ1AtVkUyU0pIRUlwTHVick1jdW9vVjZnYWpxc1l6bS1hc05FY3IzTVBaS3IyNzFiV18yamJmSW94V25BNHJER0tuTHg2LXJ5eDJxNmNmLWlCaXlrWl9DMVZGcEVtZlNtcDZIRWZuMlRzZHdxOFpmcFJWb01IYTl4cWJWMGp2TlM1YnNKd1J3Y2g0b1RIS0dzeW5UUQ</guid></item><item><title>新冠疫情后，致命感染激增-新印度快报</title><link>https://www.newindianexpress.com/thesundaystandard/2025/Sep/28/post-covid-surge-in-deadly-infections</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-test-id="text" class="arrow-component arr--text-element text-m_textElement__e3QEt text-m_dark__1TC18 "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tuberculosis, India’s enduring scourge, continues to exact a heavy toll, with the country accounting for approximately 26–27% of the global burden. Annually, millions contract TB, and over 400,000 succumb despite widespread treatment programmes, reflecting persistent challenges in early detection, adherence, and drug-resistant strains. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Encephalitis, recurring episodically in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, has claimed thousands over decades, disproportionately affecting children. Its insidious onset—fever, headache, and vomiting—can escalate to seizures, confusion, disorientation, coma, and death, caused by Japanese encephalitis virus or a spectrum of viral, bacterial, and parasitic pathogens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, these outbreaks reveal a sobering pattern: mucormycosis exposed Covid-linked vulnerabilities; dengue and leptospirosis magnified ecological and systemic fragilities; TB endures silently; and encephalitis underscores how routine monsoon cycles can precipitate tragedy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, a new menace looms. Kerala is grappling with a surge in Primary Amoebic Meningoencephalitis (PAM), caused by Naegleria fowleri, reporting 69 confirmed infections and 19 deaths in 2025. Nationally, 72 cases and 19 deaths have been reported, with sporadic referrals in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The amoeba thrives in warm freshwater, entering through the nasal passages during swimming or bathing, and swiftly migrating to the brain to devastate tissue. Early signs—fever, headache, nausea, and vomiting—can accelerate to seizures, stiff neck, hallucinations, confusion, coma, and death, with a staggering global fatality rate of 95–98%. Treatment relies on Amphotericin B, sometimes intrathecally, with miltefosine employed in early interventions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kerala’s 2024 reprieve—29 cases with 24 survivors—was credited to rapid diagnosis and intensive care. In 2025, however, the outlook has darkened: sporadic spread has replaced cluster outbreaks, underscoring the persistent vulnerability of populations and the human cost behind every statistic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The New Indian Express</author><pubDate>Sun, 28 Sep 2025 02:45:54 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiogFBVV95cUxPN0VMbW0zU1NkQUtTWk9oazlLTkRkcFRSbUg4T0dScUF0emZGeE92MG1hd0dsc2xkNkhoWnFsWExpMjdCYUlia1JhRzRDR2NlXzg0ZEhnSDU2TUJRMmdjQU1tTkN6SEFSeUhSZThhUnZscXE4OXVETVVOb2hYS3pMWGVMa0V2ZDluY2tGbUotWkJ5cnFDaVlEc1kzQzNhUS1MQ0E</guid></item></channel></rss>
