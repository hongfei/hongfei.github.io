      &lt;span class="js-subbuzz__title-text"&gt;"During a knee replacement, the medical team completely dislocates your knee, puts the knee cap to the side, and starts measuring and cutting. During tibia replacement, this part assists in pushing the tibia forward so you can apply components accurately."&lt;/span&gt;
    
  &lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;"During hip replacement, the entire hip is dislocated, and if it’s an old posterior approach, your femoral head is sticking out of the wound at roughly 45 degrees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you get a joint replacement revision, all bets are off because there is so much pulling, hammering, drilling, etc. If it's a hip, you can sometimes lose so much blood that you need a transfusion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During abdominal surgery if you are reconnecting a patient’s colon, the surgeon will stick a special instrument up your butt to staple the rectum to the intestine. Yes, staple."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1llf2l5/comment/mzzs99d/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;amp;utm_term=1&amp;amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank"&gt;u/pancakefishy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

You’re also more likely to lose muscle mass and strength or to develop osteoarthritis, and both can put more stress on the muscle you do have.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-subscribe-cta" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="COV5MCEVYZES3P2UYBOX2H2FFE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;As a result, up to 60 percent of older adults live with persistent muscle pain, according to a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8034863/" target="_blank"&gt;2020 review in the journal Medical Clinics of North America.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="DUKQVJBPE5GHDMP4KASKRTHACY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But there’s a lot you can do to ease that discomfort. Here’s a look at sources of muscle pain and the best routes to feeling better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="QF65MQC7MFGXROGK22RJ2V7WLM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;These “pulled” muscles are often more common later in life, Gardner says. The best treatment is a day or two of rest, ice, compression and elevation. But that doesn’t mean lying in bed all day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="CTNE3QKEU5HYXC3QQ4VUYPIJWQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Try taking a short walk or marching in place. “Light activity can help reduce muscle pain and stiffness because it encourages blood flow to the area,” she says. After about three days, try to resume your normal activities, but if it hurts, scale back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="K4R6V7Y5M5G5JM4BJZCICVQYRM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;You can do a bit of self-massage, too. This increases blood flow to the muscle, which can reduce inflammation and speed healing, says Tiffany Shubert, chair of the American Physical Therapy Association Geriatrics/National Council on Aging Task Force. One method: Put a tennis ball between your body and a wall or the floor, then roll up and down on the sore area. You can also roll a foam roller on tight, achy muscles. But avoid massage guns. “There’s always the concern it could be too rough for some older adults and lead to a fracture,” Shubert says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="XKJ2QEDTZ5CULE4MZB72UIUPVI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Feel like you need something more for the pain short term? Over-the-counter oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories such as ibuprofen (Advil and generic) can raise the likelihood of gastrointestinal bleeding in older adults. Instead, use acetaminophen (Tylenol and generic) or an OTC topical NSAID cream such as diclofenac. “Follow dosing labels carefully,” Gardner says. “A small amount is still absorbed by the bloodstream into the body.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="EFHO74UVBFBPXFZJ5CUZLLEJ5I" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Another option is a topical cream or ointment containing the herb arnica, says Benjamin Kligler, a professor of family and community medicine at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City. A &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8537440/" target="_blank"&gt;2021 review published in the journal Medicines&lt;/a&gt; found that arnica may be comparable to standard medications for muscle strains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="DH52YFSQLVCHLIUJRFNINPWW2M" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;If your pain persists for more than a couple of days or eases and then returns, ask your doctor about seeing a physical therapist. “There may be other factors driving your muscle pain, for example, underlying arthritis or weak hip muscles that place more stress on your knees,” Gardner says. A PT can figure out the cause and recommend appropriate strengthening and stretching exercises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="UYHL6DPJWFAAFHQITVH552K3PM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Aches from respiratory infections&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="CEL277I2TBBVRMIECTZAMTRYV4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;If you have the flu or covid-19, the muscles all over your body may really hurt. “Older adults often feel muscle aches more intensely during a virus than younger ones, as their muscles tend to be tighter and weaker,” says Michael Hochman, an internist in Oak Park and Sunland, Calif.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="QVL43KETC5A3XPQFCL43IZ6NP4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;What to do: Call your doctor for an antiviral prescription (Paxlovid for covid-19 or Tamiflu for the flu). This may ease symptoms and help you recover faster. And while you’re sick, drink plenty of fluids because dehydration can worsen achiness, he says. Water is best. You can also take the over-the-counter pain reliever acetaminophen (Tylenol and generic) to ease aches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="YR4BS27UB5GYFOP2QMYT4DG7BU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;More than 32 percent of people between the ages of 70 and 79 experience uncomfortable nighttime leg cramps at least five times a month. “It’s very common because older adults are more vulnerable to factors that raise the risk of muscle cramps, such as dehydration or electrolyte imbalances,” Kligler says. The natural shortening of your tendons as you age can also make the cramps more likely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="NGDMWZA7HBCWBK5SHWC72MR75U" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;If a painful leg cramp wakes you up at night, Kligler recommends stretching your calf. You can do this while standing up or even while lying down in bed. For the latter, with the affected leg straight in front of you and flat on the bed, point your toes toward the ceiling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="EQSFNPFRHNBXTCITKJ7U2O7YE4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;If that doesn’t provide sufficient relief, try walking around your home until the cramp subsides. After that, elevate your leg to get more blood flowing to the area. You can also take a hot shower or a warm bath (add in some Epsom salts if you like), or use a heating pad on the area that’s cramped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="AM6QFKQBDBEHNGACTXKG6ABHGY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;If you’re prone to nighttime muscle cramps, stretch your calves and hamstrings at least once a day. A &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8127570/" target="_blank"&gt;2021 Cochrane review&lt;/a&gt; concluded that while this won’t eliminate cramps, it may make them less severe. Kligler also recommends a supplement of about 100 to 200 mg of magnesium before bedtime. But check with your doctor first because magnesium can cause diarrhea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="4WA33NNBARFV7MQ5HERH6PUODQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;If you feel achy every day for more than a couple of weeks, see your doctor. You may have a medical problem that needs attention. For widespread pain, for instance, your doctor may have you evaluated by a rheumatologist for fibromyalgia, a chronic condition marked by deep muscle aches and stiffness. “It often starts in your neck or shoulders before spreading to your middle and lower back, arms and legs, and chest wall,” says Don Goldenberg, a rheumatologist and professor emeritus of medicine at Tufts University School of Medicine in Boston. You may also notice specific tender points near joints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ZBTVMYBFZVFXRNJYTM7KVPWQ3Y" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“One of the best treatments available is cognitive behavior therapy, not because fibromyalgia is ‘all in your head’ but because it gives you coping tools to help live with the condition,” Goldenberg says. Low-impact activities such as walking, water aerobics, tai chi and gentle yoga may help, too. “We know that people who do moderate exercise regularly with fibromyalgia have lower pain levels.” You may also need an antidepressant that targets the brain chemicals that process pain. If that doesn’t work, your doctor may recommend an anticonvulsant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="XIF2D4IVCVAE7E3OAHLBUY6ZPU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Another condition that can cause muscle pain is polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR), which occurs almost exclusively in people over age 50, Goldenberg says. “We think of it anytime we have an older adult complain of new-onset aches, pain and stiffness in their neck, shoulders, upper back and hips, particularly in the morning,” he says. Treatment is a long-term (a year or two, or even more) low dosage of a steroid such as prednisone. Your doctor should also monitor you closely for sudden loss of sight, he says. This, and symptoms such as new headaches and high fever, may be signs of a serious condition called giant cell arteritis, which &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9909075/" target="_blank"&gt;one small 2023 study&lt;/a&gt; found was present in more than 40 percent of people with PMR. Treatment for this is usually a short course of high-dose steroids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="Y43R7NQ2BNBZDGL54HJMANMSK4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Statin drugs for lowering cholesterol, such as atorvastatin (Lipitor and generic) and rosuvastatin (Crestor and generic), can cause a rare side effect of muscle pain. This occurs in fewer than 5 percent of people, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/article/s0140-6736(22)01545-8/fulltext#" target="_blank"&gt;2022 paper&lt;/a&gt;, but can be quite uncomfortable. “Patients often tell me that it feels like they got hit with a truck — it’s a whole-body, flu-like experience,” says Chad Worz, chief executive of the American Society of Consultant Pharmacists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="XDNLGJCAAZEYXHHZGGTQL4DFOU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;If you notice this kind of pain, let your doctor know. They may want you to stop taking your statin drug for about a week, says John Batsis, a geriatrician at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine in Chapel Hill. If your symptoms improve, the medication was probably the culprit. You can then work with your doctor to reduce the dosage of your current medication or try a different statin altogether. And if these steps don’t help, talk to your doctor about other options for &lt;a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/health/high-cholesterol/your-guide-to-cholesterol-control-a2665297083/" target="_blank"&gt;managing cholesterol&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p id="MX42FHQYCNA47FRI3ZJH4W7M4Q" class="wpds-c-esEUdQ wpds-c-esEUdQ-hqvHjm-isBold-false wpds-c-esEUdQ-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="MX42FHQYCNA47FRI3ZJH4W7M4Q" data-testid="article-header"&gt;Copyright 2024, Consumer Reports Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="NGIOUE72HRGJHDJS2MZ36HBWDU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Consumer Reports is an independent, nonprofit organization that works side by side with consumers to create a fairer, safer and healthier world.

 &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Jo Frost, best known as Supernanny, has opened up about a life-threatening health condition&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I've survived more anaphylactic shocks than I'm prepared to go into detail about right now.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And, driving home just how life-threatening anaphylactic shock can be, she said:  'If you ignore the severity of this medical condition, it's as bad as shoving a loaded gun in my face.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ms Frost continued that she is one of 'millions' of people who '&lt;span&gt;live cautiously and anxiously...with not nearly enough compassion, education and empathy' from people who do not suffer from extreme allergic reactions. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;She added that she—and no doubt other sufferers—feel forced to take full responsibility for what they put in their bodies as others do not take allergies seriously, calling out 'lazy' restaurant staff and large food corporations who are not transparent about their production methods.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'I'm unapologetic for my medical condition. I did not ask for it, and it does not define who I am and the impact that I make in the world daily,' she said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'But it does impact how I live my life daily, like the precautions I take, the energy I have to use to discern with hyper vigilance whether you do know what you're talking about when you're in a restaurant or just winging it, because you can't be arsed to go to the back of the kitchen and truly ask the chef.' &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;She also slammed food manufacturers who 'dodge accountability legally and put your greed before my safety' by placing "it may contain" labels on their products.   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'It means that your inclusion of health and safety standards doesn't apply to me, just non anaphylaxis people out there,' she said.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Ms Frost first shot to fame in 2004 when she fronted international hit show Supernanny &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;In the show, she helped parents who were at the end of their tether with their unruly kids &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'And by the way, I speak on behalf of those who also have coeliac disease too, because we are all not faddy eaters, I'm not looking to be treated special. I'm looking to be treated with the same dignity and attentiveness as you just showed others.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;a target="_self" class="class" href="/health/article-14542313/coeliac-disease-symptoms-Olympic-rebecca-adlington-diagnosis.html"&gt;Coeliac disease&lt;/a&gt; is a genetic autoimmune condition which means it develops when your body decides that healthy cells are foreign and so it sends antibodies out to 'protect' your body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When someone has coeliac disease, their body triggers an immune response to gluten entering their systems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;During this process, antibodies are released that damage the lining of their gut and can cause a number of unpleasant symptoms, some of which are not even tummy-related. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="art-ins mol-factbox floatRHS health" data-version="2" id="mol-ffacf770-6093-11f0-a21b-5ddd939b6e9d" data-permabox-url="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-14903303/Supernanny-Jo-Frost-reveals-little-known-health-condition-kill-bad-shoving-loaded-gun-face.html"&gt; &lt;h3 class="mol-factbox-title"&gt;Symptoms of anaphylaxis &lt;/h3&gt; &lt;div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"&gt; &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="mol-bullets-with-font"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Swelling of your throat and tongue&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Difficulty breathing or breathing very fast&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Difficulty swallowing, tightness in your throat or a hoarse voice&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wheezing, coughing or noisy breathing&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Feeling tired or confused&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Feeling faint, dizzy or fainting&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Skin that feels cold to the touch&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="class"&gt;Blue, grey or pale skin, lips or tongue – if you have brown or black skin, this may be easier to see on the palms of your hands or soles of your feet&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;Source: NHS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ms Frost rounded off her impassioned post by urging establishments to improve the training of their staff, and for food firms to generally do better at creating products that everyone can enjoy without fear of falling ill or dying. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: 'I don't need your mumbling insults, your passive aggressive comments or your ignorance, just your need to be willing to learn. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Educate your staff, change your policies, menus, work spaces, school training, event spaces for all, to champion children who are all ours, really, in this world, and show empathy and understanding to each other.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2012, she told US magazine &lt;a class="class" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.allergicliving.com/2013/07/16/profile-tvs-nanny-jo-frost-on-her-allergies/"&gt;Allergic Living&lt;/a&gt; that she had been hospitalised by her allergies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The worst I’ve dealt with left me in hospital for a couple of days and my blood pressure went really low. [This incident happened three years ago, brought on by a restaurant meal.] &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I had been told, very confidently, that were no nuts in a particular meal, and there were. It left me never in the same place again.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She added that the experience had made her much more cautious about eating out. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'What has changed is my ability to trust those who may not be fully informed. You have to read between the lines. At a restaurant if they say, “I think so,” that is not – “I know so”,' she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Now in a restaurant, I ask: “Are you sure?” and “Can I see the chef?” because I have to be in control of my life and responsible for my life, so I will do what’s necessary to do that.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She added that while filming Supernanny, all foods which could cause an allergic reaction—and pets—were removed from the family's home and it underwent a very deep clean before shooting began. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ms Frost added: 'I don’t see myself as a sufferer. I just know there are certain things that I can’t do. For instance, I would love to go horseback riding, but I can’t; it’s life or death. So there are things you can do and things you can’t. For instance, I waterski and cycle, things like that.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 14 Jul 2025 11:26:06 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>学校欺凌者称我为“鲸鱼” -所以我使用简单的家庭方法减掉了一半的体重，而且不花钱-每日邮报 | School bullies called me 'whale' - so I lost HALF my bodyweight using a simple at-home method that cost nothing - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 16-stone law student who was branded a 'whale' by school bullies says she dropped from a size 18 to a tiny size six by using a simple at-home method.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Jessica Turner, 20, shed an incredible 8st 3lb after deciding she had had enough of taunting by cruel fellow pupils. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Though admitting she was always 'chubby', Jessica said she piled on the pounds after turning to junk food for comfort whilst at school. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This, combined with no exercise, saw the 5ft 3in student from Caterham, Surrey eventually tip the scales at 16st 5lb and balloon to a size 18. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Jessica says she was picked on by classmates for her weight, with some branding her 'too slow' when walking up stairs, while others dubbed her a 'whale'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;So when the Covid &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/coronavirus-lockdowns/index.html" id="mol-81983710-6097-11f0-9cdf-11124d039d40"&gt;lockdown&lt;/a&gt; hit in 2020, Jessica decided to take things into her own hands. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The then-15-year-old began doing daily at-home YouTube workouts by watching videos from fitness influencers Joe Wicks and Chloe Ting. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She also cut out junk food from her diet - instead focusing on eating enough protein. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Jessica Turner, 20, shed an incredible 8st 3lb after deciding she had had enough of taunting by cruel fellow pupils&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Now a size six, weighing 8st 2lbs and a successful fitness influencer herself, Jessica says she's had the last laugh—as cruel lads who tormented her at school now slide into her Instagram DMs but don't get any reply&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now a size six, weighing 8st 2lbs and a successful fitness influencer herself, Jessica says she's had the last laugh—as cruel lads who tormented her at school now slide into her Instagram DMs but don't get any reply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Throughout my life I had been quite a chubby girl and struggled with my weight so until that point I didn't know what it felt like to feel confident in my body,' said Jessica.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I looked at food as a source of comfort.

The guidelines are being issued at the 13th International AIDS Society Conference (IAS 2025) on HIV Science, in Kigali, Rwanda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LEN, the first twice-yearly injectable PrEP product, offers a highly effective, long-acting alternative to daily oral pills and other shorter-acting options. With just two doses per year, LEN is a transformative step forward in protecting people at risk of HIV – particularly those who face challenges with daily adherence, stigma, or access to health care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While an HIV vaccine remains elusive, lenacapavir is the next best thing: a long-acting antiretroviral shown in trials to prevent almost all HIV infections among those at risk," said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. “The launch of WHO’s new guidelines, alongside the FDA’s recent approval, marks a critical step forward in expanding access to this powerful tool. WHO is committed to working with countries and partners to ensure this innovation reaches communities as quickly and safely as possible.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new guidelines come at a critical moment as HIV prevention efforts stagnate with 1.3 million new HIV infections occurring in 2024 – with disproportionate impact among key and priority populations, including sex workers, men who have sex with men, transgender people, people who inject drugs, people in prisons, and children and adolescents. WHO’s recommendation on LEN signals a decisive move to expand and diversify HIV prevention, giving people more options to take control over their health with choices that fit their lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Simplified testing: a major barrier removed&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of these guidelines, WHO has recommended a public health approach to HIV testing using HIV rapid tests to support delivery of long-acting injectable PrEP, including LEN and cabotegravir (CAB-LA). The simplified testing recommendation removes a major access barrier by eliminating complex, costly procedures and enabling community-based delivery of long-acting PrEP through pharmacies, clinics, and tele-health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Next steps: call for implementation&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;LEN joins other WHO-recommended PrEP options, including daily oral PrEP, injectable cabotegravir and the dapivirine vaginal ring, as part of a growing arsenal of tools to end the HIV epidemic. While access to LEN outside clinical trials remains limited at the moment, WHO urges governments, donors and global health partners to begin rolling out LEN immediately within national combination HIV prevention programmes – while collecting essential data on uptake, adherence and real-world impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Additional WHO recommendations at IAS 2025&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the first time, WHO’s &lt;a href="/publications/i/item/B09471-eng"&gt;treatment guidelines&lt;/a&gt; include a clear recommendation for the use of long-acting injectable cabotegravir and rilpivirine (CAB/RPV) as an alternative switching option for antiretroviral therapy (ART) for adults and adolescents who have achieved full viral suppression on oral ART and do not have active hepatitis B infection. This approach is designed to support people living with HIV facing adherence challenges to oral regimens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Updated guidelines on service delivery integration include recommendations to integrate HIV services with noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) such as hypertension and diabetes, as well as mental health care for depression, anxiety and alcohol use disorders into HIV services, alongside interventions to support ART adherence. Additionally, new guidelines on &lt;a href="/publications/i/item/9789240104907"&gt;management of asymptomatic STIs recommend screening of gonorrhoea and/or chlamydia in key and priority populations&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For people living with HIV who have &lt;a href="/publications/i/item/B09434"&gt;mpox&lt;/a&gt; and are either ART naive or have experienced prolonged ART interruption, rapid initiation of ART is strongly recommended. Additionally, early HIV testing is advised for individuals presenting with suspected or confirmed mpox infection. &lt;a href="/publications/i/item/B09434"&gt;WHO’s standard operating procedures&lt;/a&gt; further emphasize HIV and syphilis testing for all individuals with suspected or confirmed mpox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In response to the broader challenges facing HIV programmes, WHO has also issued new &lt;a href="/publications/i/item/9789240112759"&gt;operational guidance&lt;/a&gt; on sustaining priority HIV services in a changing funding landscape. The guidance aims to provide a stepwise framework to help countries prioritize services, assess risks, monitor disruptions, and adapt systems to protect health outcomes and preserve progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have the tools and the knowledge to end AIDS as a public health problem,” said Dr Meg Doherty, Director of WHO’s Department of Global HIV, Hepatitis and STI Programmes and incoming Director of Science, Research, Evidence and Quality for Health. “What we need now is bold implementation of these recommendations, grounded in equity and powered by communities.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HIV remains a major global public health issue. By the end of 2024, an estimated 40.8 million people were living with HIV with an estimated 65% in the WHO African Region. Approximately 630 000 people died from HIV-related causes globally, and an estimated 1.3 million people acquired HIV, including 120 000 children. Access to ART continues to expand, with 31.6 million people receiving treatment in 2024, up from 30.3 million in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At a time of reduced funding for HIV and health, WHO’s new and updated guidelines offer practical, evidence-based strategies to sustain momentum. By expanding prevention and treatment options, simplifying service delivery and promoting integration with broader health services, they support more efficient, equitable, and resilient HIV responses. Now is the moment for bold implementation to ensure these gains translate into real-world impact.&lt;br&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Note to the editor&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHO at the 13th IAS Conference on HIV Science&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The IAS 2025, the&lt;a href="https://www.iasociety.org/conferences/ias2025" data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;13th IAS Conference on HIV Science&lt;/a&gt; is being held in Kigali from 13 to 17 July 2025. It is the world’s most influential meeting on HIV research and its applications. This biennial conference presents the critical advances in basic, clinical and operational HIV research that move science into policy and practice. Through its programme, the meeting sets the gold standard of HIV science, featuring highly diverse and cutting-edge research. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At IAS 2025, WHO will present new normative guidance through key satellite sessions and engage at the highest level to highlight innovations and promote health equity, while sounding the alarm on the risks posed by declining global health funding.

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcz6k9oa00pq26p3f87923l9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The World Health Organization is now recommending that countries include an HIV drug newly approved for prevention, lenacapavir, as a tool in their efforts to fight HIV infections – especially for groups most at risk and in areas where the burden of HIV remains high.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcz6o04d00013b6n6xdo5c18@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The &lt;a href="https://programme.ias2025.org/Programme/Session/202" target="_blank"&gt;global recommendation&lt;/a&gt; – issued Monday at the International AIDS Conference in Kigali, Rwanda – comes about a month after the US Food and Drug Administration approved lenacapavir as a twice-yearly injection for the prevention of the human immunodeficiency virus or HIV. Lenacapavir had been approved in 2022 to treat certain HIV infections and, in trials for prevention, it&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;was found to dramatically reduce the risk of infection and provide almost total protection against HIV.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcz6o04d00033b6nc6niv3x3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “These new recommendations are designed for real-world use. WHO is working closely with countries and partners to support the implementation,” Dr. Meg Doherty, director of WHO’s Department of Global HIV, Hepatitis and Sexually Transmitted Infections Programmes, said in a news briefing.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcz6o04d00043b6n9h2bxakw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The first recommendation is that a long-acting injectable, lenacapavir, should be offered as an additional prevention choice for people at risk for HIV and as part of combination prevention. With that, we call it a strong recommendation with moderate to high certainty of the evidence,” Doherty said. The second recommendation in the guidelines is that rapid diagnostic tests like at-home tests can be used to screen someone for HIV when they are starting, continuing or stopping long-acting medication to prevent infection – called pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcz6o04d00053b6nmrqu0gnt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            HIV spreads primarily through unprotected sex or sharing needles. It attacks the body’s immune system, and without treatment, it can lead to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, or AIDS. Globally, &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/data/gho/data/themes/hiv-aids" target="_blank"&gt;about 40 million people were living with HIV&lt;/a&gt; at the end of 2023, according to WHO.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcz6o04d00063b6ngrqsd2xz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            PrEP has been used to prevent HIV infections for years. In the United States, this may involve taking pills, such as a daily medication called Truvada, or getting injections, such as every two months of the medication Apretude.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcz6o04d00073b6n19o4g4ut@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But twice-yearly injections of lenacapavir, or LEN, have become another option in the prevention toolbox – not just for the United States but for the world.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcz6o04d00083b6n4qm4m7f6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “LEN is a six-monthly injectable option, and it may be particularly attractive for people who prefer fewer clinic visits or have challenges with daily oral PrEP. … It could improve adherence and reach more people who need HIV prevention and can be used in pregnant and breastfeeding women,” Doherty said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcz6o04d00093b6nywpmrx3e@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “WHO is providing technical assistance to countries interested in adopting LEN and simplified testing strategies, in coordination with global partners like the Global Fund, UNAIDS and several other partners and donors,” she said. “We call on governments, funders, implementers and civil society to work together for implementing and integrating LEN into the HIV programs. And we believe time to act is now.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcz6o04d000b3b6nhk43rz6a@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There has been growing concern around funding for global HIV prevention efforts.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcz6o04d000c3b6nho3k73bv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            International assistance accounts for 80% of prevention programs in low- and middle-income countries, according to the United Nations. But in the past six months, the United States has significantly withdrawn funding for much of its foreign assistance.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcz6o04d000d3b6n0bo0omhp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The Trump administration has &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/30/politics/bush-obama-trump-usaid"&gt;dismantled the US Agency for International Development&lt;/a&gt;, or USAID, and reduced funding for the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or &lt;a href="https://www.state.gov/about-us-pepfar" target="_blank"&gt;PEPFAR&lt;/a&gt;, which acts as the largest commitment by any nation to address a single disease in history.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcz6o04d000e3b6nc7q1c15y@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Gilead Sciences, maker of lenacapavir, announced Wednesday that it has reached an agreement with the nonprofit Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria to supply lenacapavir for HIV prevention at no profit to the company. Under this agreement, Gilead’s pricing reflects only the cost of producing and delivering lenacapavir.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcz6o04d000f3b6n7mn6vimf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We are providing the medicine at no profit to Gilead, and in enough supply to reach up to two million people in low- and lower-middle-income countries ahead of generic lenacapavir becoming available,” Gilead Chairman and CEO Daniel O’Day &lt;a href="https://www.gilead.com/news/news-details/2025/gilead-finalizes-agreement-with-the-global-fund-to-accelerate-access-to-twice-yearly-lenacapavir-for-hiv-prevention-for-up-to-two-million-people-in-primarily-low--and-lower-middle-income-countries" target="_blank"&gt;said in a news release&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcz6o04d000g3b6n7uctffwp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The company added that the cost of lenacapavir under this agreement remains confidential.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcz6o04d000h3b6nlwm1wypb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In the United States, the only place where lenacapavir has received approval for HIV prevention&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;so far, the drug has an annual list price of $28,218 when used for HIV prevention. The cost is similar to the price of other prevention medicine options, according to Gilead.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcz6o04d000i3b6nt16k9mgc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Lenacapavir can “fundamentally change the trajectory of the HIV epidemic,” but only if it reaches the people who need it most, Peter Sands, executive director of the Global Fund, said in the news release.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcz6o04d000j3b6nfhoe3oo6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Our ambition is to reach 2 million people with long-acting PrEP. But we can only do that if the world steps up with the resources required,” he said. “This is a pivotal moment — not just for the fight against HIV, but for the fundamental principle that lifesaving innovations must reach those who need them most — whoever they are, and wherever they live.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcz6o04d000l3b6nzj2h4j4i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The &lt;a href="https://www.unaids.org/en/UNAIDS-global-AIDS-update-2025" target="_blank"&gt;United Nations warned in a report&lt;/a&gt; released Thursday that millions more people could die from HIV-related causes by 2029 if funding for HIV programs permanently disappears.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcz6o04d000m3b6n7x0a95fr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Among the 60 low- and middle-income countries included in the report, 25 have indicated increasing their domestic budgets for HIV response efforts next year. But the report noted that may not be sufficient to replace the scale of international funding that these countries have been heavily reliant on.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcz6o04d000n3b6np0qd0tbe@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We know that PEPFAR had committed $4.3 billion to over 50 countries &lt;a href="https://2021-2025.state.gov/pepfar-world-aids-day-2023/update-on-pepfars-programming-budget-for-2024-2025/" target="_blank"&gt;in 2025&lt;/a&gt;, and that support was suddenly ended in January of 2025,” Mary Mahy, director of &lt;a href="https://www.unaids.org/en/aboutunaids/unaidsleadership/bios/mary-mahy" target="_blank"&gt;UNAIDS’s Data for Impact&lt;/a&gt; department, said in a news briefing.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcz6o04d000o3b6n698i8lji@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “If none of the PEPFAR funding is replaced, we’d expect something like 4 million additional deaths between 2025 and 2029, and another 6 million additional new infections,” she said. “We also know that drug resistance would likely occur with some of those people going off treatment.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcz6o04d000q3b6nm8y8s3lx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Some countries already have seen effects of the rollback of funding for HIV programs, according to Mahy. In Nigeria, facilities reported that there were about 40,000 people who received PrEP at least once during the later part of last year. That number dropped to fewer than 7,000 in April, &lt;a href="https://aidsinfo.unaids.org/services" target="_blank"&gt;according to UNAIDS data&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcz6o04d000r3b6nwqah161l@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A similar trend emerged in Kenya, where there has been a decline in the number of women living with HIV who recently gave birth&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;and received medications to reduce their risk of transmitting the virus to their newborns. About 3,000 women already received medications and nearly 900 initiated medications in October 2024, but those numbers fell to only about 300 already receiving and 100 starting medications in April.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcz6o04d000s3b6necbfw9yb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “This is not just a funding gap — it’s a ticking time bomb. … We have seen services vanish overnight. Health workers have been sent home. And people — especially children and key populations — are being pushed out of care,” UNAIDS Executive Director Winnie Byanyima &lt;a href="https://www.unaids.org/en/resources/presscentre/pressreleaseandstatementarchive/2025/july/20250710_global-aids-update?c" target="_blank"&gt;said in a news release Thursday&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcz6o04d000t3b6no0kvmgs8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There is still time to transform this crisis into an opportunity,” Byanyima said. “Countries are stepping up with domestic funding. Communities are showing what works. We now need global solidarity to match their courage and resilience,”

The study analysed people born between 2008 and 2017 and estimated that 15.6 million individuals globally from this generation are at risk of developing gastric cancer in their lifetime. Worryingly, almost two-thirds of these cases will occur in Asia, largely due to high population numbers and ongoing exposure to risk factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;India and China could see 6.5 million gastric cancer cases combined&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study highlights that India and China together could account for approximately 6.5 million new gastric cancer cases in the coming decades. This projection positions Asia as the global hotspot for the disease. The rise is largely driven by factors such as rapid population growth, increasing life expectancy, and a continued prevalence of key risk factors—many of which are still not adequately addressed through public health measures. These include poor sanitation, limited access to healthcare, and dietary habits that may increase stomach cancer risk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts say this could make gastric cancer one of India’s biggest future health crises if timely action is not taken.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;keyword id="24374347" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="Helicobacter-pylori-infection" source="keywords"&gt;Helicobacter pylori infection&lt;/keyword&gt; causes most gastric cancer cases in India&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most important takeaways from the study is that Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection is the leading cause of future gastric cancer cases—accounting for about 76% of them. This bacterium infects the lining of the stomach and can remain undetected for years. Over time, it causes inflammation that can lead to ulcers and eventually cancer. In India, where access to preventive screening is limited and awareness is low, H. pylori often goes untreated, significantly raising the risk of long-term health complications. The study urges stronger surveillance and early intervention programmes to tackle this hidden epidemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Gastric cancer is rising in India faster than in many regions&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, gastric cancer is the fifth most common cause of cancer-related death worldwide, but its burden is not evenly distributed. While some regions, like Sub-Saharan Africa, report relatively low incidence rates today, the study warns of a six-fold increase in cases in those areas over time. In contrast, India’s numbers are expected to rise more sharply and sooner due to existing health inequalities, limited diagnostic infrastructure, and lack of widespread awareness about early symptoms. This puts millions of Indians at a heightened and preventable risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Early detection could prevent most gastric cancer cases&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research points to a clear solution: early screening and treatment of H. pylori can dramatically reduce future cases of gastric cancer—by as much as 75%. In countries like India, where healthcare resources may be stretched, focusing on population-wide, low-cost screening initiatives could be a game-changer. Treating H. pylori with antibiotics and simple follow-up care could save countless lives and significantly ease the burden on the healthcare system. These preventive steps are not only scientifically sound but also financially viable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Younger populations in India face rising gastric cancer risk&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most alarming finding from the study is that gastric cancer is increasingly affecting younger individuals, especially those born after 2008. This is a major shift from previous decades when the disease primarily affected older adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Combined with India’s ageing population, this trend could create a dual burden of both young and elderly patients requiring long-term cancer care. Without timely intervention, India risks reversing years of public health progress in cancer control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;India must take public health action against gastric cancer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;To reduce its future gastric cancer burden, India needs to adopt a multi-pronged public health strategy. The study recommends:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nationwide screening campaigns to detect and treat H. pylori early&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Public education initiatives to raise awareness of gastric cancer symptoms, such as persistent indigestion, bloating, and unexplained weight loss&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Strengthening diagnostic infrastructure, especially in rural areas where healthcare access is limited&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Promoting healthy dietary and lifestyle habits, such as reducing salt-preserved foods, stopping tobacco use, and increasing intake of fruits and vegetables&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;These actions are essential not only to control gastric cancer rates but also to build long-term resilience in India’s public health system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;With projections estimating over 1.6 million new gastric cancer cases in India alone, the country is at a crossroads. The study’s findings are a powerful reminder that prevention is not just possible—it is necessary. Investing in screening, early detection, and health education can prevent hundreds of thousands of deaths and reduce the financial and emotional toll on families. If India acts now, it can turn the tide and prevent gastric cancer from becoming an unstoppable epidemic in the decades to come.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Also Read: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/the-first-60-minutes-after-a-heart-attack-make-all-the-difference-why-the-golden-hour-is-crucial/articleshow/122380076.cms" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;The first 60 minutes after a heart attack make all the difference: Why the ‘Golden Hour’ is crucial&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="57"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Mon, 14 Jul 2025 05:41:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>忘记10,000步—研究揭示了根据您的年龄，您每天应采取的最少步数-汤姆指南 | Forget 10,000 steps — study reveals the real number of minimum daily steps you should take, according to your age - Tom's Guide</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi6AFBVV95cUxQZDR5U1d1MS0ybzB5WTVWblVlci1MRHF0dnh2VWxpVnE3ZFlJZmZKT3JtdGk4Ti00UDlQY1NDRTdOMDdiemo1T1NpekVVWnBRVk0wOW9wTW1qTWJxVnFuYnpDT1BGVE1zaEI3RnhFQjFHWDlIWmxHdTNFdk9DZjdCdFJLQVhIMHlRb2VTa2NxMTNvRDhnMWJPeEJKY1pvYnFPbmZoMmVtYldKQ0swV2JNZkEzNUxJYzAxNE9sYlFfU3JuVVc5aWZJUE9SMmdqM2lwYklKMnU3MkRlUm9TZ0hRUDRyV3ZLYzhp?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-body" class="text-copy bodyCopy auto"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lately, more and more people are becoming aware that 10,000 steps is no longer the gold standard — it was actually a very successful and slightly misleading marketing campaign that gathered a lot of momentum fast and had people checking the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-fitness-trackers,review-2066.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-fitness-trackers,review-2066.html"&gt;best fitness trackers&lt;/a&gt; regularly during walks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While some research has suggested that 7,000 steps is enough to keep you happy and healthy, a meta-analysis from 2022 published in &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpub/article/PIIS2468-2667(21)00302-9/fulltext" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpub/article/PIIS2468-2667(21)00302-9/fulltext" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;The Lancet&lt;/a&gt; found you can still achieve health benefits for less, and age could determine how many steps per day you need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s everything you need to know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-what-is-the-study"&gt;&lt;span&gt;What is the study?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: Getty/stevecoleimages)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The meta-analysis assessed 15 studies — seven published and eight unpublished — and found that more steps were associated with lower mortality risk; the results plateaued at between 6,000-8,000 for adults aged 60 and over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For younger adults aged below 60, results plateaued at 8,000 to 10,000. In this study, researchers found “inconsistent evidence” that step intensity was associated with mortality beyond step volume. This suggests a “curvilinear association and range” in daily steps and all-cause mortality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, another study published in &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/52/12/776.abstract" target="_blank" data-url="https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/52/12/776.abstract" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;BMJ&lt;/a&gt; found that your cadence can matter — a pace of 100 steps per minute could be classified as moderate-intensity exercise and boost your cardiovascular fitness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But while we can clearly see there’s a range you should aim for, according to your age, is there a minimum?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-4zcqgyDGKvDnVKa5D6aRPg" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-4zcqgyDGKvDnVKa5D6aRPg slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get instant access to breaking news, the hottest reviews, great deals and helpful tips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 2023 meta-analysis suggests there is: 2337 for cardiovascular mortality and 3867 for all-cause mortality. The study, published in the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37555441/" data-url="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37555441/" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;European Journal of Preventive Cardiology&lt;/a&gt;, assessed over 226,000 participants to determine the minimum figure we should be aiming to reach each day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In short, anything fewer than roughly 2,300 per day could increase your risk of cardiovascular events such as stroke or heart disease. And as your step count increases, your risk could decrease over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-should-you-increase-your-step-count"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Should you increase your step count?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: Shutterstock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you find you’re short on time,&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/fitness/these-3-walking-workouts-boost-your-metabolism-and-build-lower-body-strength" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/fitness/these-3-walking-workouts-boost-your-metabolism-and-build-lower-body-strength"&gt; walking workouts&lt;/a&gt; can help you reach the minimum number of steps. It’s also worth learning about a process called &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/features/non-exercise-activity-thermogenesis-why-neat-could-help-you-burn-more-calories" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/features/non-exercise-activity-thermogenesis-why-neat-could-help-you-burn-more-calories"&gt;NEAT&lt;/a&gt;, which stands for “Non-Exercise Activity Thermogenesis,” and basically accounts for all activity and energy expenditure you can achieve outside of eating, sleeping and dedicated workouts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Think of playing with your kids, carrying groceries, or using one of the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/best-picks/best-standing-desks" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/best-picks/best-standing-desks"&gt;best standing desks&lt;/a&gt; during your workday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same 2023 meta-analysis found that &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/fitness/i-doubled-my-step-count-every-day-for-2-weeks-heres-what-happened" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/fitness/i-doubled-my-step-count-every-day-for-2-weeks-heres-what-happened"&gt;increasing your step count&lt;/a&gt; could lead to better health. A 1,000-step increment decreased the risk of all-cause mortality by 15%, while a 500-step increment decreased the cardiovascular risk of mortality by 7%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remember, though, the universal exercise guidelines currently recommend a minimum of 150 minutes of aerobic activity per week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walking, particularly in nature, has been associated with boosted mood and creativity, reduced anxiety and fewer feelings of depression. And as we know, walking counts toward aerobic activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Activities such as &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/fitness/color-walking-is-trending-heres-everything-you-need-to-know" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/fitness/color-walking-is-trending-heres-everything-you-need-to-know"&gt;color walking&lt;/a&gt; and&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/fitness/i-swapped-my-regular-walks-for-intuitive-walking-and-i-cant-believe-i-havent-tried-it-sooner" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/fitness/i-swapped-my-regular-walks-for-intuitive-walking-and-i-cant-believe-i-havent-tried-it-sooner"&gt; intuitive walking&lt;/a&gt; can also boost your step count without feeling like a workout, so I recommend giving these a try if you’re short on steps for your age range.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your daily step count doesn’t need to be achieved all in one go, so if you consider a 5k walk might take you over one hour (and roughly 6,000-7,500 steps), then you could break this up into manageable chunks during your day.

published Monday in Pediatrics&lt;/a&gt;, a journal of the American Academy of Pediatrics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-dcdad9" class="body-graf"&gt;Nearly all occurred at home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4c73c0" class="body-graf"&gt;The cases included exposures to nicotine pouches, chewing tobacco, regular cigarettes, vapes and nicotine replacement products like gum and lozenges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1e8a3f" class="body-graf"&gt;But it’s nicotine pouches, like the&lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/zyn-nicotine-pouches-tobacco-free-health-harm-rcna157214" target="_blank"&gt; wildly popular Zyn&lt;/a&gt;, that are behind the most significant rise in accidental nicotine poisonings among young kids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-06454a" class="body-graf"&gt;The new research found that the rate of poisonings involving nicotine pouches among kids under 6 rose from 0.48 per 100,000 children in 2020 to 4.14 per 100,000 in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4a0f75" class="body-graf"&gt;That’s an increase of 763% in just three years — a startling finding that correlates with a surge in sales of nicotine pouches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b03682" class="body-graf"&gt;Nicotine pouches — which users tuck between their lip and gum and later discard — can contain as much as 6 milligrams of nicotine, a stimulant, and have been promoted as tobacco-free, spit-free and hands-free alternatives to cigarettes and chewing tobacco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2e1abe" class="body-graf"&gt;They are not, however, approved by the Food and Drug Administration as nicotine replacement products used to help quit smoking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7d195d" class="body-graf"&gt;A&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2782874" target="_blank"&gt; 2021 study&lt;/a&gt; from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Office on Smoking and Health (one of several&lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/hhs-cut-quit-smoking-programs-tips-cdc-fda-rcna199251" target="_blank"&gt; public health groups dismantled under the Trump administration&lt;/a&gt;) found that sales of nicotine pouches rose dramatically in the past decade, from $709,000 in 2016 to $216 million by mid-2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a7d634" class="body-graf"&gt;“It was just a matter of time before they fell into the hands of younger kids,” said Dr. Molly O’Shea, a Michigan pediatrician and spokesperson for the American Academy of Pediatrics. “It’s unfortunate, but not shocking.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-7c79a4" class="body-heading"&gt;Why is nicotine toxic to little kids?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e3c2f6" class="body-graf"&gt;Nicotine is a chemical that’s highly toxic and could easily exceed a fatal dose in small children, according to a &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00204-013-1127-0" target="_blank"&gt;2013 study&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-03ea4d" class="body-graf"&gt;The chemical increases heart rate and blood pressure, and could lead to nausea, vomiting or even coma, the study authors wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f1d54f" class="body-graf"&gt;Most cases included in the new research weren’t serious enough to warrant medical attention. But 39 children had significant side effects, like trouble breathing and seizures, said Natalie Rine, an author of the new study and director of the Central Ohio Poison Center at Nationwide Children’s Hospital in Columbus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-51604c" class="body-graf"&gt;Most nicotine poisoning cases, 76%, were babies and toddlers under age 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ff8ee3" class="body-graf"&gt;Two children, a 1-year-old boy and another boy about a year and a half old, died after ingesting liquid nicotine used in vapes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-8f2baa" class="body-graf"&gt;“It’s good that the majority of kids in the study actually did pretty well. Most kids had either minor symptoms or no symptoms and didn’t require any medical management,” Rine said. “But two deaths is a lot, especially for something considered a preventable death.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-f607f3" class="body-heading"&gt;How to reduce nicotine poisonings in kids&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c6943e" class="body-graf"&gt;Kids are curious by nature. Babies and toddlers in particular explore their worlds by putting things in their mouth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ef21ba" class="body-graf"&gt;And they’re masters at breaking into drawers and cabinets to find new “toys.” Canisters of nicotine pouches are not equipped with child-resistant packaging. They taste good, too. Mint and fruit flavors are almost always added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e39b78" class="body-graf"&gt;O’Shea said it’s critical that all nicotine products are placed far out of reach of children. “That doesn’t mean in your purse, in your back pocket or on the counter,” she said. “It means locked away.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e0baa0" class="body-graf"&gt;It’s not just parents and other adult caregivers who must be mindful of their nicotine products. An &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2833331" target="_blank"&gt;April study&lt;/a&gt; from the Keck School of Medicine of the University of Southern California found the use of nicotine pouches among high school students nearly doubled between 2023 and 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b33dc2" class="body-graf"&gt;“It’s easy for a teenager to be using this product and have parents be unaware,” O’Shea said. “It’s important for parents to be talking with their teenagers about products like this and having open dialogue in a nonjudgmental way in order to ascertain any risk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c7440e" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;Rine also recommends adding the national poison control number to cellphones: 1-800-222-1222.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Mon, 14 Jul 2025 04:01:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirAFBVV95cUxQVmV5Q0I4dGV6dmJiOVRZM1Nmd0RDRHE1c0pJaTdUZm84OGFPN2dwdER3MWRxNk1ac2NJY0IxVkhCUnY5NHJjQW00V0lmbVFjNDM0blhoUFpXYXVxMVZGTkxCN19FUkd5TmFhSUJRaGVQTVQzQUFRQk5OY21qQTl2MkdwbE1HLVVCRGFZNGZnMjdEZEhZWUlzR2hfNUEtSWRBeUhPYVhFVmJaTnJy0gFWQVVfeXFMTVVfQWI4eGxrT1N0Z0w1ZmdRZDc1WDFJRGZldXJwTDloRGszRWl1ay0tZklyTlNFVUhTaENia3R1MExzX0VRZVFpWEVwYjY5ejN6UDZvaGc</guid></item><item><title>青少年结肠癌上升：美国顶级DOC警告5个警告信号-印度时报 | Colon cancer rising among youngsters: Top US doc alerts about 5 warning signs - The Times of India</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihwJBVV95cUxNWjc2aDQzaHlla05GdVRXbWllS083UXNJellEVEVzTmYyRklYVnBlUzZDd3lmYU1LZUNCNV9qa3A5cmVoM0o4NHh0a1FXdmI5ak5fcGJCSnJIMFJvaURPQUJUb1QxMC1zLUJxbVFHRGdpdFAyTFpCUU84UTRSdnhVWHdyV0tFSWhRSm5OR0tkNjJKWHBac2pQemJPdFAzUlZPV0RtN1N5QUM3WHNZWVJFY2MwbF9yUVpfRGRqS1RHMTYtMWloSzVuMjBIQ2Z6QkJ0WnlQeUY1dThjMTJkQlRjQVg0NGlteU9lc0MxYlFkRXJHNHIzMHpaZWpaLW9mV1pINTVBODZMRQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;div class="MwN2O"&gt;&lt;div class="vdo_embedd"&gt; &lt;div class="T22zO"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colon cancer, which was common in older adults, is, however, increasingly being diagnosed in younger people. Though age remains a risk factor for this cancer, recent studies are pointing to a troubling trend - millennials are facing rising rates of this deadly disease. A recent &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/bjs/article/112/7/znaf102/8191209" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; published in BJS found that compared to people born in 1950, those born in 1990 have twice the risk of developing colon cancer. Dr. Joseph Salhab, a Florida-based gastroenterologist, has spoken about the alarming rise in cases of colon cancer among young adults. The doctor has revealed five critical warning signs that should not be ignored. Early detection is key to successful treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Rectal bleeding&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Salhab said that rectal bleeding is one of the most alarming signs of colon cancer. If you notice blood in the stool or on toilet paper, it should not be dismissed. This can look either dark or bright red. While it may be caused by benign conditions like hemorrhoids, persistent or recurrent bleeding certainly requires immediate medical attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Childhood Cancer: Causes, Treatments &amp;amp; Cure: Expert Oncologist Speaks&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Unexplained abdominal pain&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Belly pain should not be easily dismissed. If you have belly pain with no known cause, that doesn’t go away or hurts a lot, you should get it checked. Persistent abdominal discomfort that lingers despite changes in diet or lifestyle is a red flag. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This pain may feel like cramping or bloating; however, it could be a subtle but critical indicator of colon cancer. If the discomfort lasts longer, talk to a healthcare provider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Weakness or fatigue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feeling tired all the time is not a good sign. Fatigue or weakness, even after proper rest could signal an underlying issue. People tend to dismiss this symptom, however, Dr. Salhab has waned that it could be a crucial &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DL0oiYPyaP7/?hl=en" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;sign&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;. Young adults, who often lead busy lives, may attribute this to stress or lack of sleep. This could delay diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Changes in bowel habits&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;How you poop matters. Changes in bowel habits, especially one that lasts more than a few weeks should raise concern. These changes could be either increased constipation, diarrhea, or even how often you poop. If these changes persist, you should talk to your doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Shruti Haasan Reacts To Justin Bieber's Online Meltdowns| 'Planetary Mental Health In Shambles'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Other symptoms &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Salhab also listed some other early signs of colon cancer. These include unexplained weight loss, loss of appetite, night sweats, or recurring low-grade fevers. Though these symptoms may be due to other health issues, when combined, they could point to colon cancer. So it is important to get it checked. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The incidence of GI cancers in adults younger than age 50 is rising globally. Ongoing research efforts investigating the biology of early-onset GI cancers are critical to developing more effective screening, prevention, and treatment strategies,” lead author Sara Char, of the above-mentioned research, said. Lifestyle factors such as poor diet, sedentary behavior, and obesity, along with genetic predispositions, may also contribute to the risk of colon cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Mon, 14 Jul 2025 03:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihwJBVV95cUxNWjc2aDQzaHlla05GdVRXbWllS083UXNJellEVEVzTmYyRklYVnBlUzZDd3lmYU1LZUNCNV9qa3A5cmVoM0o4NHh0a1FXdmI5ak5fcGJCSnJIMFJvaURPQUJUb1QxMC1zLUJxbVFHRGdpdFAyTFpCUU84UTRSdnhVWHdyV0tFSWhRSm5OR0tkNjJKWHBac2pQemJPdFAzUlZPV0RtN1N5QUM3WHNZWVJFY2MwbF9yUVpfRGRqS1RHMTYtMWloSzVuMjBIQ2Z6QkJ0WnlQeUY1dThjMTJkQlRjQVg0NGlteU9lc0MxYlFkRXJHNHIzMHpaZWpaLW9mV1pINTVBODZMRQ</guid></item><item><title>梅毒感染急剧上升，女性感染人数最多- standardmedia.co.ke | Syphilis infections rise sharply with women most hit - standardmedia.co.ke</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="tbl_art"&gt;

&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;Kenya is reporting a surge in syphilis, while Baringo County leads in Hepatitis B infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="div-gpt-ad-1616524592174-0" class="ad"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;Approximately 1.8 per cent of the population tests positive for the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;This is according to a new report by the National Aids and STIs Control Programme (NASCOP) and UNaids&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;Despite the high number of infections, only a small proportion of those who test positive for syphilis seek treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;The report, titled ‘‘Triple Elimination: Private Health Sector and Professional Association’’, reveals that the infections were recorded in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="div-gpt-ad-1616513706683-4" class="ad"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;In 2024, 16 per cent of those infected with syphilis were women, yet &lt;a href="https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/counties/article/2001478429/governments-asked-to-adopt-new-guidance-of-testing-stis"&gt;only nine per cent of them received treatment&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;Most of the women who tested positive for the sexually transmitted disease were identified during Antenatal Clinics (ANC), alongside HIV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;In 2024, for instance, the country registered a total of 1,766,099 pregnancies, among the 1,468,615 enrolled for ANC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;Globally, at least eight million people were infected in 2022, including 700,000 infants who acquired the infection from their mothers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;A NASCOP official, Frankline Sangok, said that although the number of syphilis infections is high, screening is not done optimally due to a lack of test kits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;“We have a problem with screening for syphilis because of a lack of kits for testing,” said Sangok during the release of preliminary findings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;Top counties in syphilis testing include Laikipia, Nyeri, Nakuru, Makueni, Uasin Gishu, Nyamira, Machakos, Kirinyaga, Kakamega, Homa Bay, and Kajiado.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;Others are Murang’a, Mombasa, Nyandarua, Nairobi, Kilifi, Kisii, Busia, and Bomet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;The disease presents a painless sore at the site of infection, while secondary syphilis may include a non-itchy rash—often on the palms and soles along with fever, swollen lymph nodes, and flu-like symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;According to the World Health Organisation, if a pregnant woman who is infected does not receive early and effective treatment, she can transmit the infection to her unborn infant, commonly known as congenital syphilis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;Among interventions for optimal testing and treatment of the disease, according to NASCOP and UNAids, are addressing vulnerabilities and inequalities that sustain new infections and impede progress, tackling health barriers to quality services, ensuring supply chain sustainability, and building social capital and community intelligence to diagnose and treat syphilis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;Amid dwindling donor support, the ministry is banking on leadership and alignment of resources with national priorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;The report was released during a public-private partnership engagement meant to onboard all stakeholders in the elimination of syphilis, HIV, and hepatitis B.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;Private hospitals are expected to help mobilise resources and share accurate data with the ministry for proper planning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;LVCT Health representative, Patrick Oyaro, said there is a need to document data to support planning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;“Data is key. There is no way you will plan appropriately without data. This shall help in procurement of commodities and treatment,” said Dr Oyaro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;Meanwhile, three per cent of the Kenyan population has Hepatitis B.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;Baringo County is leading in Hepatitis B cases at 12 per cent, followed by Migori and Turkana counties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;The Head of Viral Hepatitis and Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs) at NASCOP, Nazila Ganatra, said stigma greatly affects the eradication of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;“Lack of awareness and stigma are among the challenges derailing the elimination of Hepatitis,” Dr Ganatra said in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;Hepatitis is the &lt;a href="https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/health/health-science/article/2001258135/donated-blood-has-hiv-syphilis-report-shows"&gt;inflammation of the liver&lt;/a&gt; and may present with pain or bloating of the belly, dark urine, fatigue, and general body weakness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;Other symptoms include loss of appetite, nausea, and vomiting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;If left untreated, it can damage vital organs including the kidneys and lungs, and beyond that, can lead to death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;According to the expert, adherence to treatment can suppress the virus and prevent underlying health complications such as liver cirrhosis, liver cancer, and kidney failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;Patients widely use tenofovir and lamivudine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;Globally, at least 304 million people are living with hepatitis — 254 million of them afflicted by Hepatitis B, and Hepatitis C affecting another 50 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;Data from NASCOP shows that in Kenya, about 1.9 million people are infected with Hepatitis B and C viruses, with the majority (1.56 million) having Hepatitis B.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;An additional report by the Kenya Population-based HIV Impact Assessment (KENPHIA) 2018 estimates Hepatitis B prevalence at three per cent among the general population, and 4.7 per cent among people living with HIV/AIDS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;Ganatra noted that research is ongoing to establish the causes of increased cases in these regions, but said stigma significantly limits access to care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;The Ministry of Health, through NASCOP, has set up a unit to scale up awareness, screening, and treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;“We want to create more awareness of the disease in the population because it is &lt;a href="https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/health/health-science/article/2001494541/study-uncovers-overlooked-sexual-health-crisis-among-adults-over-50"&gt;treatable and preventable&lt;/a&gt;,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;Further, the ministry is working towards the elimination of mother-to-child transmission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;“One of the agendas of elimination is ensuring that a mother attending ANC is tested for HIV, syphilis, and Hepatitis, for a comprehensive approach to disease reduction,” added Ganatra. &lt;/p&gt;

Having &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8009483/americans-adults-dementia-study-ways-to-reduce-your-risk/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Alzheimer’s disease;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/a&gt; means living with a progressive disorder that causes brain cells to degenerate and die, leading to a continuous decline in memory, thinking skills and the ability to perform everyday tasks. Sadly, as the disease progresses, even basic activities and communication become challenging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several factors influence the risk of developing dementia, with some being completely beyond your control. Aging is the most significant risk factor, as individuals over the age of 65 are more susceptible. Genetics also play a crucial role, with specific genetic mutations directly linked to Alzheimer’s disease. However, along with unchangeable factors, certain lifestyle choices can help lower the risk of cognitive decline, with diet being a pivotal piece of the puzzle. “Some of the best foods for brain health are antioxidant-rich wild blueberries, salad greens for B vitamins, salmon for its anti-inflammatory fatty acids, fiber-rich black beans, and walnuts, the best source of plant-based omega-3 ALA among nuts,” says &lt;a href="https://maggiemoon.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Maggie Moon, M.S., RD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Maggie Moon, M.S., RD&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;There are some foods you should avoid when focusing on brain health support too, with candy being the #1 food on that list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why You Should Limit Candy for Brain Health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taking steps to reduce dementia risk is one positive step for brain health. While there isn’t one food that will cause dementia, high-added-sugar candy tops the list of foods that should be limited on a brain-healthy diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Candies are not your brain’s friend,” Moon says. She points to a study that found that eating too much added sugar more than doubled the risk for dementia. “That includes added sugar from candies, as well as other sweets like pastries, sweetened café drinks and sodas,” she says. Researchers think that high blood sugar and insulin levels are risk factors for Alzheimer’s because insulin resistance may also occur in the brain, which may impact memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, everything can be eaten in moderation in a healthy, balanced eating plan. “While fine once in a while, research has found that a diet that is consistently high in added sugar may increase the amyloid plaque buildup in the brain,” says &lt;a href="https://www.lauramali.com/laura-ali-registered-dietitian-nutritionist/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Laura M. Ali, M.S., RDN;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Laura M. Ali, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;. "These plaques disrupt the communication system in our brain, and scientists have found that people with Alzheimer’s disease tend to have more of these plaques.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, says Ali, one study found that every 10 grams of added sugar consumed per day (equivalent to 2½ teaspoons of sugar or 8 gummy candies) was associated with a 1.3% to 1.4% increased risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease. Those with the highest daily added sugar intake had 19% higher odds of developing Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Other Ways to Reduce Your Risk of Dementia&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Limiting sweetened candy doesn't guarantee that you won't get dementia, but it is a positive step forward. Along with limiting added sugar in your diet, here are some other ways to reduce your dementia risk:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exercise by participating in both aerobic activity and resistance exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you smoke cigarettes, take the first steps to quit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Limit alcohol intake. If you regularly drink alcohol, try to do so in moderation. Excessive drinking is linked to cognitive decline. Moderate drinking means two drinks or less in a day for men and one drink or less in a day for women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stay socially engaged. Maintaining social connections builds your cognitive reserve to maintain good brain function with age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have chronic diseases, such as high blood pressure and diabetes, make sure you’re managing these well. Stiffness in arteries and blood vessels can damage the brain. If you need help or individualized advice, reach out to a healthcare professional.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Include brain-healthy foods in your diet. The MIND diet emphasizes foods like whole grains, nuts, berries, vegetables and olive oil, which research shows may help support brain health. “The brain-healthy MIND diet limits foods high in saturated fats and added sugars because both are linked to oxidative stress, inflammation and the brain plaques and tangles associated with Alzheimer’s disease,” says Moon. She clarifies that this diet limits—but does not eliminate—fried foods, pastries and sweets, red meat, whole-fat cheese and butter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Our Expert Take&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nothing will guarantee that you will live a life free from dementia. But certain steps may help reduce your risk, with your dietary choices being one factor. And along with eating brain-healthy foods, limiting your candy intake can help keep you cognitively sharp. Enjoying a small handful of candy corn on Halloween or conversation hearts on Valentine’s Day won’t “cause” dementia. “It’s important to remember that no single food eaten once, or even once in a while, is going to make or break your brain health,” Moon adds.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/food-to-limit-to-reduce-dementia-risk-11769343" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:EATINGWELL;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;EATINGWELL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 14 Jul 2025 00:47:46 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMia0FVX3lxTE1ydEZtRm53RV9NRUpXQ1VVc0MzY21JdGNKSXVyR3RmTkNBYVMxTTdDRnl4d0xuWGFqOU1FM3A3S1VaV2ZjVU1tVnQtVkVMNF9IM1AtcGxqUTlYNGlLVVgyalpSTDEzRWNXQXJB</guid></item><item><title>对家长减少儿童食物过敏的一条建议- ScienceAlert | One Piece of Advice to Parents Slashed Food Allergies in Children - ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimgFBVV95cUxObXFJanNFZFVENWhVQWlNVExEX1Z1dDMyZVduWmxVYVRXdmhJdEdva2NtNVNRMmV0TXlDeXRRMWRBaHZfNmtzVHRqSE9Od1dfd0g0M0l6ei1zMGFjZm5LbWZXdkhfTGxVRzhOQ21XRGlKU2J2RG9wNHdmN2hZZ2pNU1IzT2ZuQm9pSUlRZDU5X3c5cDlEVkVnRGJB?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;New research highlights a crucial time window very early on in life, during which the introduction of eggs and peanut butter into the diets of babies significantly reduces the chances of them &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-common-and-dangerous-allergens-doesn-t-appear-on-food-labels-in-the-us"&gt;becoming allergic&lt;/a&gt; to these foods later on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings run counter to previous advice given to parents to avoid giving these foods to their kids until they're at least a year old over concerns that they might trigger allergic reactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, researchers led by a team from the University of Western Australia compared the experiences of two groups of children in Australia: 506 whose parents got no specific feeding advice, and 566 whose parents were advised to start adding eggs and peanut butter to the diets of the infants at around six months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/skin-injuries-and-food-allergies-may-have-a-mysterious-connection?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;Skin Injuries And Food Allergies May Have a Mysterious Connection&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For the babies in group two – whose caregivers followed the updated guidelines and introduced peanut butter and egg around six months of age – egg allergy reduced from 12 percent to 3 percent, and peanut allergy reduced from around 6 percent to 1 percent," &lt;a href="https://www.thekids.org.au/news--events/news-and-events-nav/2025/july/peanuts-and-eggs-reduces-allergy-risks/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Summer Walker, a health scientist at the University of Western Australia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, earlier introduction of these foods at the six-month mark made a notable difference to the number of kids who went on to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/immunotherapy-may-reduce-the-severity-of-peanut-allergy-reactions-says-new-study"&gt;develop allergies&lt;/a&gt; by 12 months of age. Cow's milk was also included, though here the difference was smaller.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The advice itself &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/introducing-peanuts-and-eggs-early-in-life-might-lead-to-less-allergies"&gt;isn't new&lt;/a&gt;, and the six-month milestone has in fact now been added to the official Infant Feeding and Allergy Prevention Guidelines proposed by the Australasian Society of Clinical Immunology and Allergy (ASCIA). Testing the guidelines in real population groups confirms the recommendations are safe and effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_167163" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-167163" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/AllergyGraph.jpg" alt="Allergy risk chart" class="wp-image-167163 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/AllergyGraph.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/AllergyGraph-600x200.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-167163" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers tracked allergic reactions in babies up to 12 months old.

(AP)  — &lt;/span&gt;A resident of northern Arizona has died from pneumonic plague, health officials said Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plague is rare to humans, with on average about seven cases reported annually in the U.S., most of them in the western states, according to federal health officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The death in Coconino County, which includes Flagstaff, was the first recorded death from pneumonic plague since 2007, local officials said. Further details including the identify of the victim were not released.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;MORE | Disease Cases in Utah:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plague is a bacterial infection known for killing tens of millions in 14th century Europe. Today, it's easily treated with antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bubonic plague is the most common form of the bacterial infection, which spreads naturally among rodents like prairie dogs and rats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are two other forms: septicemic plague that spreads through the whole body, and pneumonic plague that infects the lungs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pneumonic plague is the most deadly and easiest to spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bacteria is transmitted through the bites of infected fleas that can spread it between rodents, pets and humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People can also get plague through touching infected bodily fluids. Health experts recommend taking extra care when handling dead or sick animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most cases happen in rural areas of northern New Mexico, northern Arizona, southern Colorado, California, southern Oregon and far western Nevada, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;_____&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>KUTV</author><pubDate>Sun, 13 Jul 2025 21:52:38 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikAFBVV95cUxOa0tCSWNSMzBmT292M3lZbmdvTENCQ052bDNsMUdSYlBXTzdvZUFBUm9jandGQk1KWnRZZml4anY0Mmpzb0ZkR3RTQmxkY0dxcUpINVg5T1RSTnVSM3d4MXZ0bnIwN0VvejhobzRvdEZHYXRINWZaVjZ6RWlNSTZwOXpHZEZKYlRweTZFRUo1V0U</guid></item><item><title>常见的基因突变大大增加了男性患痴呆症的风险- Earth.com | Common genetic mutation dramatically increases the risk of dementia in men - Earth.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipAFBVV95cUxPeVhJQ2xhMkw1QmxsREFBcUpLSkgwY2NJQ2pleXFZYjR0S21nTFlmZEFOX0NTNHZiUDhJcS1iRDZRdlV0UHRGa1lGS1NFamtKX2JpRlozY1JHRjlFbEpoT1JIaDBVeHRlb2FNaDZKWjVSN09zRFlYQ1FrZG5GLVpTNzU5OTYtVkVtbUdSMTlaNm4tSnlMWmgydXRrTnNEbWFKaDBCTg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page_content__AwOj6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;About one man in 36 carries two copies of a tiny change in the HFE gene and that detail can more than double his odds of developing dementia, according to a new analysis of nearly 12,200 Australians and Americans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dementia already affects about 433,000 Australians, and while women still outnumber men, this fresh genetic signal shows that older males with the variant face a steeper climb toward memory loss. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-hfe-gene-men-and-dementia"&gt;HFE gene, men, and dementia&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The haemochromatosis gene keeps the body’s iron traffic moving smoothly, yet its &lt;a href="https://www.haemochromatosis.org.uk/h63d-carrier-also-known-as-h63d-heterozygous" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;H63D version&lt;/a&gt; is anything but rare, turning up in one in three people as a single copy and in roughly one in 36 as a double hit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;H63D does not usually overload the liver the way the better‑known &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC165699/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;C282Y variant&lt;/a&gt; can, but laboratory work shows that mutant HFE can upset cellular iron sensors and let free iron trigger damaging chemical reactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-genes-iron-brains-and-memory"&gt;Genes, iron, brains and memory&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iron is vital but volatile, and when it piles up inside microglia, the brain’s immune cells, it sparks oxidative stress and inflammation tied to &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/alzheimers-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20350447" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Alzheimer’s&lt;/a&gt; pathology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reviews of animal and human data echo the theme: iron dyshomeostasis fans reactive oxygen species, injures neurons, and may even set off ferroptosis, a specialized form of cell death linked to cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HFE variants have also been linked to Parkinson’s disease and motor neuron disorders, suggesting that iron mismanagement may be a shared pathway across multiple brain conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8661115/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Studies&lt;/a&gt; have shown that abnormal iron levels in regions like the substantia nigra and motor cortex are associated with earlier onset and faster progression of these diseases in genetically susceptible individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-the-aspree-data-revealed"&gt;What the ASPREE data revealed&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://aspree.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;The ASPREE trial&lt;/a&gt; followed 19,114 healthy seniors for a median 6.4 years to test low‑dose aspirin, generating a gold‑mine of aging data in the process. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Genome scans within ASPREE showed that men with two H63D copies logged an adjusted hazard ratio of 2.39 for incident &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/risk-of-dementia-is-much-higher-than-previously-thought/"&gt;dementia&lt;/a&gt;, while women with the same genotype saw no extra risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Having two copies of the variant more than doubled the risk of dementia in men, but not women,” &lt;a href="https://staffportal.curtin.edu.au/staff/profile/view/john-olynyk-6669ecca/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Professor John Olynyk&lt;/a&gt;, of Curtin University Medical School, who co‑led the project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-only-men"&gt;Why only men&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/girls-diets-strongly-influence-when-they-begin-puberty/"&gt;Menstruation&lt;/a&gt;, pregnancy, and lower mid‑life ferritin give women a natural outlet for iron, which may blunt the variant’s impact; haemochromatosis complications likewise appear later and milder in females.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brain‑imaging studies find that women who stop menstrual bleeding early accumulate more iron in deep brain regions, hinting that lifelong iron exposure could be the pivot that tips male brains toward damage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sex hormones complicate matters too, because &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/heart-health-after-menopause-what-every-woman-should-know/"&gt;estrogen&lt;/a&gt; modulates iron metabolism and offers anti‑inflammatory benefits that may shield neural circuits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HFE analysis is already part of routine work‑ups when doctors suspect iron overload, but the new results suggest that broader screening in aging men could flag a hidden &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/dementia-was-extremely-rare-in-ancient-times-so-why-is-it-now-so-prevalent/"&gt;dementia&lt;/a&gt; risk before symptoms start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Identifying carriers is inexpensive, and unlike many predictive markers, this one points to an actionable pathway, iron handling and its downstream inflammatory effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-practical-steps-today"&gt;Practical steps today&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team found no clear link between blood ferritin levels and dementia, yet keeping iron in the normal range, treating chronic inflammation, staying active, and eating a plant‑biased diet all intersect with brain health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regular physical activity alone can slash dementia risk by roughly 30 percent, according to &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/health-topics/physical-activity" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; estimates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors also emphasize blood pressure control, smoking cessation, and social engagement, interventions that help every older adult, variant carrier or not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Current &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/one-particular-sleep-stage-slow-wave-deep-is-most-important-for-preventing-dementia/"&gt;dementia&lt;/a&gt; prevention efforts often rely on broad lifestyle advice or age thresholds, but this variant suggests a need for sex‑aware screening policies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If men with double H63D copies truly carry double the risk, early genetic testing could steer them toward more aggressive prevention long before symptoms appear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-men-dementia-and-the-future"&gt;Men, dementia, and the future&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://research.monash.edu/en/persons/paul-lacaze" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Professor Paul Lacaze&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="https://research.monash.edu/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Monash University&lt;/a&gt;, hopes that untangling how H63D alters brain pathways will spark medicines that block the harm even when the gene cannot be changed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future work will track variant carriers with MRI iron mapping and fluid biomarkers to catch early inflammatory changes, then test whether diet, phlebotomy, or anti‑ferroptotic drugs can tilt the balance back toward healthy aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Genetics rarely hands scientists such a common, sex‑specific clue, and this one arrives in time for a generation of men now crossing the 70‑year threshold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://www.neurology.org/doi/10.1212/WNL.0000000000213743" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Neurology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt;

With no traditional risk factors and a dentist who initially dismissed her concerns, the news came as a shock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In March 2020, she underwent a glossectomy – removing part of her tongue and reconstructing it using tissue from her thigh – followed by a neck dissection to address spreading cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two months later, Powell began what she describes as the &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@jamieraepowell/video/7516616874776382762" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:“most morbid” experience of her life;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;“most morbid” experience of her life&lt;/a&gt;: 30 sessions of head and neck radiation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, as a survivor, the 41-year-old mother of two reflects on the complex aftermath of living with a changed voice, altered taste, and the quiet resilience required to move forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I first realized something was wrong when I thought I had bit my tongue in my sleep because I woke up with a bump,” Powell tells PEOPLE exclusively. “I wasn’t too worried at first, I just thought it was strange.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not long after the unusual discovery, she asked her dentist about the bump, but he told her not to worry. Weeks passed, and the bump remained, despite the tongue’s tendency to heal quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Growing more concerned, Powell finally went to urgent care in January 2020 and was referred to an Ear, Nose and Throat doctor (ENT) a month later. After inspecting the raised, square patch on her tongue, the doctor decided to take an immediate biopsy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A week goes by without hearing anything and then one day, someone just calls you and says, ‘You have cancer,’” Powell recalls. “It’s like I didn’t even know who I was after that moment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Courtesy of Jamie Powell&lt;/p&gt; The bump on Jamie Powell's tongue.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Up until that point, she had gone four months without a diagnosis, dismissed by providers because she didn’t fit the typical risk profile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I believe my tumor grew in those months,” she says. “It was scary and frustrating not to know what was going on and not having anyone listen to me.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result, on March 23, 2020, Powell underwent a glossectomy, which required a week-long hospital stay, right at the beginning of the COVID-19 lockdown. She also had a neck dissection to remove all the lymph nodes on her left side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Courtesy of Jamie Powell&lt;/p&gt; Jamie Powell after surgery.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I couldn’t talk or eat. I had a feeding tube and I used my iPad to communicate to the doctors and nurses,” Powell explains. “I then had to do 30 rounds of radiation to my head and neck, and that was absolute hell.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During radiation, a mesh mask was molded to her face and bolted to the table to keep her completely still throughout each session. “Day after day, you endure the burning, get blisters all over your mouth and food and water taste like sewage,” she reveals. “It’s awful.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Healing from surgery was a slow process. She had to retrain her brain to form sounds and piece them into words, all while her tongue felt like a foreign object.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The healing process is so frustrating; to this day, I have lifelong side effects I deal with every day,” Powell reveals. “I don’t taste food, I can only eat soft foods, and my voice is different.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Courtesy of Jamie Powell&lt;/p&gt; Jamie Powell holding the mesh mask used during radiation.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Communication was a daily challenge, especially with her children, who often couldn’t understand her. The loss of clear speech left her feeling angry and heartbroken.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I remember the surgeon describing the surgery to me. I was just numb, and I heard him say that my voice will be different,” she recalls. “I instantly thought of my kids. How will I sing to them? How will I tell them how much I love them?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To this day, Powell’s voice remains muffled, and certain sounds are harder to say, along with several other lingering side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Never miss a story — sign up for &lt;a href="https://people.com/people-news-daily-newsletter-sign-up-8692701" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:PEOPLE's free daily newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;PEOPLE's free daily newsletter&lt;/a&gt; to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Radiation to the head and neck was so brutal. It left me with limited mobility in opening and closing my mouth,” she explains. “During the night, my jaw tightens and every morning I have to physically pry my mouth open and stretch it out to get movement. It’s become my 4 a.m. morning routine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With her taste buds burned off, everything besides coffee and peanut butter tastes like “wet cardboard” to Powell. “For months after radiation, I couldn’t taste anything, then one morning I made my coffee and I could actually taste it - I cried,” she reveals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Powell also has no salivary glands, leading to a consistently dry mouth. She has to take sips of water after every bite – an adjustment that she’s slowly gotten used to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Courtesy of Jamie Powell&lt;/p&gt; Jamie Powell, her husband and two sons.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Just don’t ask me to go to dinner because I have to make the choice of either eating or talking. I can’t do both,” she warns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Five years since her diagnosis and surgery, Powell is determined to &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@jamieraepowell/video/7052732350035299630" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:share her experience;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;share her experience&lt;/a&gt; with cancer through social media, as well as her podcast, &lt;em&gt;Young Tongues.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I couldn’t find many people like me, my age, that had gone through this before. I remember feeling alone going through this and not wanting anyone to feel this way, so I videoed it all,” she explains. “I journaled and I talked about the raw honesty of not feeling like &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt;. Cancer had stolen my identity and I had no idea who I was.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sharing her symptoms and lessons from recovery felt therapeutic, but also purposeful. “That’s the thing, cancer devours your mental health along with your physical,” she says. “I wanted others to know it was okay to feel this way.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By spreading her story, Powell also hoped to raise awareness that cancer doesn’t always follow the rules – it can affect anyone, even younger people with no risk factors. Speaking out became both healing and a way to help others recognize symptoms that are often overlooked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Most oral cancers are missed until it’s in the later stages,” she explains. “I’ve learned that no one should go through this alone.

In a controlled study, women with higher oxytocin levels before sleep fragmentation reported fewer mood symptoms the following day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sleep interruptions were shown to significantly increase both mood disturbance and oxytocin, indicating a potential buffering role. These findings highlight oxytocin as a promising biological factor in supporting women’s mental health during vulnerable reproductive transitions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mood Buffer:&lt;/strong&gt; Higher baseline oxytocin reduced mood disturbance after sleep loss.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sleep Disruption Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; Sleep fragmentation and hormone changes worsened mood and raised oxytocin.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clinical Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; Oxytocin may be a natural modulator to support mental health during postpartum and menopause.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Endocrine Society&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oxytocin, often called “the love hormone,” may play a protective role in mood disturbances triggered by sleep loss and hormonal shifts during key reproductive transitions like postpartum and menopause, according to a study being presented Saturday at ENDO 2025, the Endocrine Society’s annual meeting in San Francisco, Calif.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers at Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Harvard Medical School studied the combined impact of sleep interruption and estrogen suppression on mood and oxytocin levels in healthy premenopausal women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their findings suggest that oxytocin may help reduce the negative mood effects brought on by fragmented sleep, which is an often-overlooked consequence of reproductive transitions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We found that oxytocin levels rise in response to stress-related sleep disruption, and that women with higher oxytocin levels before disrupted sleep experienced less mood disturbance the next day,” said Irene Gonsalvez, M.D., associate psychiatrist at Brigham and Women’s Hospital and instructor at Harvard Medical School in Boston, Mass.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These results point toward oxytocin as a potential biological buffer during periods of hormonal and emotional vulnerability.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Women frequently experience disrupted sleep during the postpartum and menopausal periods that are associated with sharp hormonal fluctuations. Yet these disturbances are often minimized or seen as routine inconveniences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study provides new biological evidence that such sleep interruptions are linked to meaningful changes in emotional health, and that oxytocin may serve as an important protective factor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the study, 38 healthy premenopausal women completed two 5-night inpatient protocols: one during a natural hormonal state and another after estradiol suppression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After two nights of uninterrupted sleep, researchers fragmented participants’ sleep for three nights to simulate patterns commonly experienced during postpartum and menopause. Mood disturbance and oxytocin levels were assessed throughout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Findings indicated that sleep interruption significantly increased both mood disturbance and oxytocin levels, and that higher oxytocin levels before sleep disruption were linked to reduced mood disturbance the following day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Higher incidences of mood disturbance associated with sleep disruptions were also linked to increased oxytocin levels the next day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; “Millions of women struggle with mood symptoms during reproductive transitions, yet treatments often focus narrowly on antidepressants or hormone therapy,” Gonsalvez said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Understanding oxytocin’s potential as a natural mood modulator could help us better support women’s mental health during these times.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;This research was supported by the Brigham and Women’s Hospital Connors Center WHISPR Award, the Dupont-Warren HMS Research Fellowship, and the National Institute on Aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this oxytocin, mood, and sleep research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#c2a1b5abaeaeaba3afb182a7aca6ada1b0abaca7ecadb0a5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Colleen Williams&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://endocrine.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Endocrine Society&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Colleen Williams – Endocrine Society&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;The findings will be presented at ENDO2025&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Sun, 13 Jul 2025 20:27:14 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiZkFVX3lxTE5iRUVDWGFVczFXYW9fRW9Dd0J3SFlDQ3FRcE9Hc2JqekxrT3FWYlZQeUpEX3dlajNsM3NxMXRMR1l4SWZHcldoLUpyWUxKVENhSFk0RDZ4MmhMdEZXbG4xaXVrRGxmQQ</guid></item><item><title>每周注射可能彻底改变帕金森氏症的治疗-神经科学新闻 | Weekly Injection Could Revolutionize Parkinson’s Treatment - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidEFVX3lxTE5DNFB4UzV4eUdHb2tFWEk4Q0dvek8yVUI5bHBxVGVEY1JJS0k0OS1tNzM4QUd6aXNrMllrQ0dYX1kzT1BRLUVKVWYxbm5mVGpTQXRZYmNHWWFISHRsU0NXT3BzeThFbXpNbHdKUnZER3dOa1ZT?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;Researchers have developed a long-acting weekly injection that delivers steady doses of levodopa and carbidopa, potentially transforming care for Parkinson’s disease.

Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their findings have been reported in the journal &lt;em&gt;Drug Delivery and Translational Research&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The biodegradable formulation is injected under the skin or into muscle tissue, where it gradually releases the medication over seven days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parkinson’s disease is the second most common neurological disorder, affecting more than 8.5 million people worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently there is no cure and the symptoms – tremors, rigidity and slow movement – are managed with oral medications that must be taken several times a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The frequent dosing is a burden, especially for elderly patients or those with swallowing difficulties, leading to inconsistent medication levels, more side effects, and reduced effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lead researcher Professor Sanjay Garg, from UniSA’s Centre for Pharmaceutical Innovation, says the newly developed injectable could significantly improve treatment outcomes and patient adherence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our goal was to create a formulation that simplifies treatment, improves patient compliance, and maintains consistent therapeutic levels of medication. This weekly injection could be a game-changer for Parkinson’s care,” Prof Garg says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Levodopa is the gold-standard therapy for Parkinson’s, but its short life span means it must be taken several times a day.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UniSA PhD student Deepa Nakmode says the in-situ implant is designed to release both levodopa and carbidopa steadily over one week, maintaining consistent plasma levels and reducing the risks associated with fluctuating drug concentrations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“After years of focused research, it’s incredibly rewarding to see our innovation in long-acting injectables for Parkinson’s disease reach this stage. Our invention has now been filed for an Australian patent,” Nakmode says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The injectable gel combines an FDA-approved biodegradable polymer PLGA with Eudragit L-100, a pH-sensitive polymer, to achieve a controlled and sustained drug release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Extensive lab tests confirmed the system’s effectiveness and safety:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;More than 90% of the levodopa dose and more than 81% of the carbidopa dose was released over seven days.&lt;br&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The implant degraded by over 80% within a week and showed no significant toxicity in cell viability tests.&lt;br&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The formulation can be easily administered through a fine 22-gauge needle, minimising discomfort and eliminating the need for surgical implant.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The implications of this research are profound,” Prof Garg says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By reducing the frequency of dosing from multiple times a day to a weekly injection is a major step forward in Parkinson’s therapy. We’re not just improving how the drug is delivered; we’re improving patients’ lives.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prof Garg says the technology could also be adapted for other chronic conditions such as cancer, diabetes, neurodegenerative disorders, pain management, and chronic infections that require long-term drug delivery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The system can be tuned to release drugs over a period ranging from a few days to several weeks depending on therapeutic needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UniSA scientists hope to start clinical trials in the near future and are exploring commercialisation opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this Parkinson’s disease and neuropharmacology research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#83e0e2ede7faade4eae1f0ecedc3f6edeaf0e2ade6e7f6ade2f6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Candy Gibson&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://unisa.edu.au" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of South Australia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Candy Gibson – University of South Australia&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13346-025-01892-y" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Development of an in-situ forming implant system for levodopa and carbidopa for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease&lt;/a&gt;” by Sanjay Garg et al. &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Drug Delivery and Translational Research&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Development of an in-situ forming implant system for levodopa and carbidopa for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long-acting injectables have gained attraction as a system for treating chronic conditions due to their increased efficacy, safety, and patient compliance. Currently, patients with Parkinsons need to administer oral medications multiple times a day which imposes the significant risk of non-compliance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study aimed to design an in-situ implant-forming system for controlled delivery of levodopa and carbidopa for up to 1 week which will reduce the need for multiple dosing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The combination of poly-lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA &lt;sub&gt;50:50&lt;/sub&gt;) and Eudragit L-100 was used to prepare the implants and the formulation was optimized to achieve a controlled release over 7 days. The optimized formulation containing 26% PLGA and 6% Eudragit L 100 displayed a favorable release profile and injectability with low viscosity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The optimized formulation in vitro release study revealed an initial burst of 34.17% and 37.16% for levodopa and carbidopa in the first 24 h and about 92% and 81% release within 7 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A good correlation was observed between the in-vitro drug release data and ex-vivo drug release with a correlation coefficient of 0.91 for levodopa and 0.90 for carbidopa. Viscosity analysis showed the Newtonian behavior of the formulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Syringeability analysis of the formulation showed that the maximum force required for expelling the formulation was 32.98 ± 0.72 N using a 22 G needle. The in-vitro degradation studies revealed 81.89% weight loss of implant in 7 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The prepared formulation was assessed for in-vivo performance using a convolution modeling technique using a convolve function in R software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The predicted AUC 0-∞ h for the in-situ forming implant was 26505.5 ng/ml with Cmax, 399.3 ng/ml, and Tmax 24 h assuming 100% bioavailability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results justify that the prepared in-situ implant forming system can be a promising system for the delivery of levodopa and carbidopa for Parkinson’s patients.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Sun, 13 Jul 2025 20:10:44 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidEFVX3lxTE5DNFB4UzV4eUdHb2tFWEk4Q0dvek8yVUI5bHBxVGVEY1JJS0k0OS1tNzM4QUd6aXNrMllrQ0dYX1kzT1BRLUVKVWYxbm5mVGpTQXRZYmNHWWFISHRsU0NXT3BzeThFbXpNbHdKUnZER3dOa1ZT</guid></item><item><title>医生说，每天两种水果可以促进肠道健康，对抗癌症风险- AOL.com | Two of these fruits a day can boost gut health, fight cancer risk, doctor says - AOL.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia0FVX3lxTE81eHV1Y29sMkg4M0JzUENlNkZEbEUzdmo4WHBsM2pTUndoTTdVZjVSWG9vcUpxR1pETURBNHpMRThuYUktbk9UNFU2cThoMnhBRjFHdnpvMFQ4MFFEMWxxd21ZQWhIRGx1QXVZ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eating two of a specific type of fruit each day may keep the gastroenterologist away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Trisha Pasricha, a gastroenterologist at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, "prescribes" two kiwis a day to her patients to &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/digestive-health" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:help with digestion;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;help with digestion&lt;/a&gt; and deliver a boost of vitamins and antioxidants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I hesitate to say there's any one magic fruit out there that will cure all your gut health woes, but in some respects, kiwis do seem to rise above some of the other tried-and-true methods out there, like prunes or psyllium fiber," Pasricha told Fox News Digital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/eating-common-foods-before-bed-could-trigger-sweet-dreams-night-terrors" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Eating These Common Foods Before Bed Could Trigger Sweet Dreams Or Night Terrors;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eating These Common Foods Before Bed Could Trigger Sweet Dreams Or Night Terrors&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A single kiwi packs up to eight grams of fiber, which prevents constipation and promotes regular bowel movements, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/food-drink/food/healthy-foods" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:the superfood;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;the superfood&lt;/a&gt; also contains actinidin, an enzyme that helps digestion by breaking down proteins.

Harvard psychologists once pinged thousands of phones and found that minds drift 46.9 percent of waking hours, a rate higher than any other single activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, a fresh wave of &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/key-neurons-act-as-ringleaders-to-guide-decision-making/"&gt;neuroscience&lt;/a&gt; has determined that daydreaming is actually a great thing for the mind. They may sharpen memory, spark ideas, and solve hard problems with no conscious effort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-daydreaming-brains-in-action"&gt;Daydreaming brains in action&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pinphd.hms.harvard.edu/people/nghia-nguyen" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Nghia D. Nguyen&lt;/a&gt;, a doctoral researcher at&lt;a href="https://hms.harvard.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt; Harvard Medical School&lt;/a&gt;, pointed a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/materials-science/two-photon-microscopy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;two‑photon microscope&lt;/a&gt; at thousands of visual‑cortex neurons in lab mice and watched them relive a flash of light after it vanished.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Reactivations early in a session systematically differed from the pattern evoked by the previous stimulus, they were more similar to future stimulus response patterns,” wrote Nguyen, showing that mental replay predicts tomorrow rather than echoing yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those replays often rode bursts called &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4648295/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;hippocampal sharp‑wave ripples&lt;/a&gt;, brain waves tied to learning. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By linking these ripples with activity in the visual part of the brain, the study suggests that daydreaming helps shape how the brain sees and understands things over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-locking-in-learning"&gt;Locking in learning&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research suggests that spending time in quiet wakefulness after an experience can help improve learning and memory. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cognitive neuroscientist &lt;a href="https://www.furman.edu/people/erin-j-wamsley/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Erin Wamsley&lt;/a&gt; later confirmed the point, showing that ten minutes of quiet wakefulness outperforms equal time spent watching videos when volunteers recall word lists the next day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During these brief rests, the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/default-mode-network" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;default mode network&lt;/a&gt;, a midline circuit that hums whenever attention drifts, lights up. Its spontaneous chatter appears to shuttle fresh experiences toward long‑term storage without the need for sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ideas-instead-of-problem-solving"&gt;Ideas instead of problem solving&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Daydreaming fosters creativity because the brain’s ability to make novel connections between seemingly unrelated concepts is heightened during daydreaming episodes,” said &lt;a href="https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/psychology/faculty/bsb57" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Benjamin Baird&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Baird tested that hunch by giving participants a dull task, then asking them to list new uses for a brick; idea counts jumped after the mind‑wandering break.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Functional MRI &lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.0900234106" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href="https://psych.ubc.ca/profile/kalina-christoff-hadjiilieva/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Kalina Christoff&lt;/a&gt; show that during daydreaming, the brain’s planning system connects with the part that handles memory and &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/silent-mind-when-the-inner-voice-fades/"&gt;imagination&lt;/a&gt;. This brief connection helps mix past experiences with current goals, which can lead to new ideas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Daydreaming gives the brain space to work through unresolved problems. Nguyen’s study in mice supports this, showing that early brain activity patterns helped shape how the brain responded to future stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Human work echoes the theme. People who let thoughts roam before tackling tricky anagrams solve more items than peers forced to stay on task, reinforcing the problem‑solving edge of a wandering mind. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-brain-health-and-daydreaming"&gt;Brain health and daydreaming&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 2008 &lt;a href="https://www.jpain.org/article/S1526-5900%2808%2900254-X/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;experiment&lt;/a&gt; asked volunteers to picture a favorite meal while one hand sat in ice water; pain tolerance rose and anxiety fell compared with controls. Mental drift seems to buffer stress by letting attention skate away from discomfort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same mechanism can tame everyday tension. People who pause and let &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/human-brains-use-storage-trick-to-keep-your-memories-in-sequential-order/"&gt;memories&lt;/a&gt; flow report lower cortisol spikes than colleagues who ruminate on tasks, hinting at a low‑cost antidote to chronic pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Employees who are allowed brief mental breaks return with sharper focus and more novel ideas. Smartphone tracking &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1192439" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;shows&lt;/a&gt; that unfocused intervals are not rare, so harnessing them beats fighting them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Firms that schedule short “mind‑wander minutes” during meetings report quicker brainstorming sessions afterward. The practice costs nothing yet aligns with evidence that micro‑rest knits fresh information into usable patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-simple-ways-to-wander-well"&gt;Simple ways to wander well&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Daydream‑friendly moments hide in plain sight. Researchers at the &lt;a href="https://www.virginia.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Virginia&lt;/a&gt; explain that a warm shower dilutes external noise just enough to let thoughts roam, a sweet spot for originality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similar benefits arise during a slow walk or while washing dishes. The trick is to choose safe, repetitive activities that free attention without demanding precision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-activating-new-brain-networks"&gt;Activating new brain networks&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brain imaging &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrn3856" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;shows&lt;/a&gt; that when a person is not actively focused on a task, a specific group of regions called the default mode network becomes more active. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This network, which includes the medial prefrontal cortex and posterior cingulate cortex, is involved in internal thought, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/our-brain-has-a-meal-memory-that-controls-hunger/"&gt;memory&lt;/a&gt; retrieval, and imagining future events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers believe this network helps the brain simulate possibilities, plan actions, and rehearse outcomes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of wasting energy, the brain uses these quiet moments to stitch together pieces of knowledge and past experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-daydreaming-brains-are-a-good-thing"&gt;Daydreaming brains are a good thing&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists still probe whether the human visual cortex shows the same predictive drift seen in mice, yet early imaging hints at overlap. If so, the simple habit of letting thoughts wander could act as daily &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/action-observation-network-human-brain-perception-see-what-we-expect-to-see-mind-eye/"&gt;brain&lt;/a&gt; training no app can match.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next time focus fizzles, look away, breathe, and let the scene inside your head unfold. The wandering may be doing quiet work you will appreciate tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06810-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Sun, 13 Jul 2025 19:10:13 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMivAFBVV95cUxNaDRidk9EeHdOM0RjQVplV0UteWpKdDBxU2xteng5aEtjcDJ2OTlFUTRkbEVZRFRUaVl1S0Vyenc2NldYcUZHR3BDRE1lVG1VdDlmMW5fN1Ewd3FMYzBQQWROYjRfRjJ2TlQ0YVM1VGtaQWlYcVBRVGxJNmozVmw1TUZFcjIwSmxwUW5TU2RXY1dNTTZVUDI4Y3Z1YTF4YWhWRFR4UDRxM05nR2NIclpudkdtTnBYX2RnOGxiMA</guid></item><item><title>Mondayitis可能会对您的身体产生致命影响- ScienceAlert | Mondayitis Could Have a Deadly Effect On Your Body - ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihgFBVV95cUxPRXozbWhZdUMzVGt1TGJXZHZkMTNyb0hISldHZzZQSmRTOTBxbDBHcnJfU0IzcGdpLVpwTXNrUjdMYzE5S0NFTnF6cVdZbGhId0VNUXJPWGhsYlhndHAzWUwxVnhRSUtpTHoxTE51M0JSblJZeXVZYXJYaWJOWjlBTklEWktHQQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Don't like Mondays? You might be at higher risk of stress-related health problems, including cardiovascular disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Modern society has built up Mondays to be the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/heres-how-to-rewire-your-brain-so-you-actually-look-forward-to-mondays"&gt;least-liked day&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; of the week. We've just come back from a relaxing weekend and now have to face all the responsibilities we've been ignoring, knowing there's the longest possible time before another weekend.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not only did a recent study by researchers from the University of Hong Kong (HKU) identify a link between anxiety towards the first day of the working week and elevated levels of a stress hormone, the connection persisted even after retirement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While correlations do not equal causation, a jump in the stress signal cortisol is closely connected with risk of illnesses. Which could explain why a&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s10654-004-8783-6"&gt;2005 meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; found that there's anywhere up to a 19 percent increase in cardiovascular events on Mondays compared to other days of the week.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-confirm-the-worst-day-of-the-week-for-severe-heart-attacks?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;Scientists Confirm The Worst Day of The Week For Severe Heart Attacks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this latest study, researchers investigated a possible link between feelings of anxiety towards Mondays and physical health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team examined 3,511 adults aged 50 years and over, taking part in the English Longitudinal Study of Aging (ELSA). Participants reported their levels of anxiety on different days of the week, while hair samples were also taken and analyzed for levels of the stress hormone cortisol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study found that people who reported feeling particularly anxious on Mondays had cortisol levels around 23 percent higher than those who felt anxious on other days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_167289" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-167289" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/monday-anxiety-642x381.jpg" alt="Not Liking Mondays Could Be Killing You" class="wp-image-167289 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/monday-anxiety-642x381.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/monday-anxiety-699x415.jpg 699w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/monday-anxiety-768x456.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/monday-anxiety-1536x911.jpg 1536w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/monday-anxiety-2048x1215.jpg 2048w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/monday-anxiety-600x356.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-167289" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Charts illustrating levels of cortisol and Monday anxiety. (Chandola et al., &lt;em&gt;J. Aff. Dis.&lt;/em&gt; 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;This association seems to suggest that Monday anxiety affects the &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal-hpa-axis"&gt;hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis&lt;/a&gt;, the body's main stress management system. But chronic stress can overstimulate the HPA axis and lead to immune system issues, metabolic diseases like  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="167282" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; or  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="167282" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, and cardiovascular disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This could be the biological mechanism behind the earlier findings of increases in cardiovascular events on Mondays, suggests the team on the new study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It might seem like an obvious work-related hazard, but strangely the study found that even retirees still felt higher stress levels on Mondays, along with the negative health effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Mondays act as a cultural 'stress amplifier'," &lt;a href="https://www.hku.hk/press/press-releases/detail/28420.html"&gt;says Tarani Chandola&lt;/a&gt;, sociologist at HKU. "For some older adults, the week's transition triggers a biological cascade that lingers for months. This isn't about work – it's about how deeply ingrained Mondays are in our stress physiology, even after careers end."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe Garfield was onto something.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="p1"&gt;The research was published in the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2025.119611"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Journal of Affective Disorders&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

It is transmitted to humans most often through mosquitoes.

It cannot be passed from human to human.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most cases have been found in the Americas, Africa and Asia. Brazil has the most cases, with over 141,000, followed by Argentina with over 2,500 so far in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In total, there have been approximately 220,000 chikungunya cases and 80 related deaths across 14 countries/territories since the beginning of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Réunion and Mayotte, two French islands off the east coast of Africa, have ongoing outbreaks of chikungunya, with the former recording 51,000 cases as of May 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mayotte has seen 560 cases, with the island moved to the epidemic phase, which indicates intense and widespread transmission of the virus throughout the territory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The transmission of dengue and chikungunya virus in mainland Europe has been linked by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) to travellers who have caught the virus outside the region, then gone to countries within Europe with &lt;a href="/topic/mosquitoes"&gt;mosquitoes&lt;/a&gt; that are able to carry the virus after biting the person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The risk of locally acquired chikungunya and dengue virus transmissions is therefore increasing,” the ECDC said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the symptoms?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘Chikungunya’ comes from a word used by the Makonde people in Tanzania, where the disease was first discovered in the 1950s, which means “that which bends up”. This describes the contorted posture of infected people who experience severe joint pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alongside joint pain, people can also experience an abrupt onset of fever, joint swelling, muscle pain, headaches, nausea, fatigue and rashes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The joint pain can be debilitating and usually lasts for a few days, but it has been known to last for weeks, months or even years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If an infected person does not experience joint pain, the symptoms will be mild and can go unrecognised as chikungunya.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people will recover fully from the infection. There have been some occasional cases of eye, heart, and neurological complications, while newborns and older people with underlying medical conditions are at a higher risk of severe disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patients with severe disease should be hospitalised because of the risk of organ damage or death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once someone has recovered from chikungunya, they are likely to be immune to future chikungunya infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is there a vaccine?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UK government has approved a vaccine against chikungunya disease, containing a form of the virus that has been weakened so it cannot multiply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vaccine works by training the immune system to recognise the virus, which will then produce specific antibodies to attack it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It can only be obtained via a prescription and given to those who plan to travel abroad where the virus is present.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month, the government released a further announcement to say that the Commission on Human Medicines has temporarily restricted the use of the vaccine in people aged 65 and over as a precautionary measure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To prevent getting bitten by mosquitoes, the World Health Organisation advises using insecticides; wearing clothing that minimises skin exposure; using window and door screens, and insecticide-treated mosquito nets; and applying certain repellants to skin and clothing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A travel doctor’s guide on being prepared&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Richard Dawood, a travel medical specialist at Fleet Street Clinic, explained to &lt;em&gt;The Independent&lt;/em&gt; how the vaccination can help travellers prevent getting sick from the chikungunya virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said: “This is a new situation for us. Until a very short time ago, we had no vaccine, and the only approach to prevention was to make careful use of insect repellents and insect precautions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So now we've got this extra tool in the armoury, and because the vaccine gives long-lasting protection, it's something that could be considered if you are planning to travel over a period of time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It's a fairly expensive vaccine, but if you're going to be travelling over a period of years to Southern Europe and beyond, it may be something that could be considered.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When asked about getting the vaccination for a trip to France, Mr Dawood advised to look at the decision in terms of where you will be travelling over the next few years rather than in the context of a single trip.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The risk from a one-off short trip to France is probably very small,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There's been only a very small number of cases so far. So statistically, you're not very likely to, but over time, as somebody who loves to travel and loves going to hot countries, then I would probably want to be protected against it in the long term.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wherever you are travelling, Mr Dawood advised holidaymakers to “do your homework”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said: “If there's an actual outbreak at your destination, then I would say no hesitation, definitely have the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Taking a bit of time and getting some really focused travel health advice for your particular trip is very worthwhile because it can save you from getting a vaccine that you don't need or that may not be sensible for you, and it can help prioritise the really important things for your trip. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-ii" class="sc-looa6c-0 cPCVUJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Travel clinics can also offer advice on things like insect bite precautions and reducing the risk in other ways, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://shows.acast.com/green-list-travel-with-simon-calder-and-the-independent"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;For more travel news and advice, listen to Simon Calder’s podcast&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Sun, 13 Jul 2025 17:48:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirAFBVV95cUxObmtYX2VaUFpjMVRFUDRlWmlLeGdJQ2hfR0t1bEF6Tzk3ZmpwTGZfUklSLXFOS0pCMjEzRzJGZUNSRHRYRkdfZktJSi1CZ3Y4WWdYYkJnRk9LMHNOOGs5NFI3Z0hPaTcyUjJpbjNFRGtoZE9ZSHprNW9TV1hYU0Utd0NoekFxYURlNHhHbm1OR3YzUUtvWW0tX1FacWNkRXlKTFRlVUt0ZklUeWFD</guid></item><item><title>需要多少阳光才能获得足够的维生素D ？ - WKBN.com | How much sun is needed to get enough vitamin D? - WKBN.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijAFBVV95cUxNZGtyWGhTUmtJSFFrd21Oa0N1dlo5bFhIUXRidm1sUVR3UGNNWUpUMm5hN1ZCRFg2OFJuOU5VT1RVMEhOdURKQTE0UFI4cDgxQXozVnk4RnVJd0lSc3ZrR2F5VVAyZExEdzN5RkhQajNraGdaY2E2ZkYyYVNCNXJQWnNQMWhMSm50aW5hdtIBkgFBVV95cUxPSmdSTVlybVo5MThqeHlGS05idU9Nd3ZsV3BnN2ktQnJMdkpNb05QS0RNVjRud1hqWUdSY2swOHEtb3poQjAzRXpUd1FtTThCMDdvd09uTElLVDNVc1p1bVp6NW9JdERxR2RuYURQQUlOeHp3Z2x6aGlfcTF0M1V5bW5iS1o4RENjVUdOTUN4cnNtQQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-content article-body rich-text "&gt;
		
		


&lt;p&gt;(WKBN) – Now that it’s summertime, more people are spending time in the sun to get vitamin D — and doctors say that’s a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Vitamin D is important for bone and cardiovascular health, as well as for the immune system and muscle function.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You only need a few minutes of sun exposure several times a week. &lt;a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/how-much-sunshine-you-need-daily" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;According to the Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;, 10 to 30 minutes of sun exposure each day is enough for vitamin D production, and can also boost your mood and improve your sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p hidden data-minutemedia-viewport="mobile" data-player-id="nojq1euy" data-stn-player="" data-s2n-api="minuteMediaS2NApi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;While some foods have vitamin D, it’s usually not enough. The sun is the best source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p hidden data-minutemedia-viewport="desktop" data-player-id="nojq1euy" data-stn-player="" data-s2n-api="minuteMediaS2NApi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Vitamin D supplements are also available but you should talk to your doctor first.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Keep in mind that if you are taking vitamin D through a supplement, that it may interact with some of the medications that you may also be taking for other conditions. For instance, certain cholesterol medications, certain blood pressure medications and certain heart medications may actually interact with vitamin D. So check with your doctor to make sure that you’re not taking anything that could potentially be hurting you,” said Dr. Neha Vyas, with the Cleveland Clinic.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;She says to remember to wear sunscreen when you’re out in the sun — it won’t stop you from getting vitamin D.&lt;/p&gt;

A new study published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2025.116574" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Psychiatry Research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; has found that stress related to election news and the buildup before the election was linked to higher risks of depression and anxiety among young adults. Interestingly, stress about the election results themselves was not tied to increased mental health symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers set out to examine how different aspects of election-related stress affect mental health among young adults in the United States. Presidential elections are among the most high-profile events in American civic life, and in recent years they have become increasingly stressful for many people. Past studies have shown a rise in stress levels during election seasons, but few have looked closely at how specific kinds of election-related stress might relate to clinical symptoms of depression or anxiety. This study was designed to fill that gap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 2024 presidential race was particularly intense. It came after years of political turmoil and was marked by widespread concerns about threats to democracy, fears of election-related violence, and deep divisions in public opinion. Many Americans reported feeling overwhelmed or anxious during the election period. For young adults, who are still developing emotionally and often face financial and social instability, this kind of stress can be especially hard to manage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand how election stress affects young people’s mental health, researchers used data from the COVID-19 Adult Resilience Experiences Study (CARES), a long-running survey of young adults in the United States. This study followed participants from the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic into early 2025. The current analysis focused on a group of 778 people who completed surveys both in 2022 and in the months following the 2024 presidential election.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers looked at three kinds of election-related stress: distress in the lead-up to the election, distress caused by the election outcome, and distress from news coverage related to the election. They used standard screening tools to measure symptoms of depression and anxiety, looking specifically for signs that participants might be at risk for at least moderate levels of these conditions. They also accounted for a wide range of background factors, such as participants’ political views, education level, employment status, race, gender identity, and sexual orientation, as well as prior mental health history, financial distress, and emotional resilience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings showed that stress from election-related news was associated with a higher likelihood of experiencing symptoms of both depression and anxiety. Young adults who felt more distressed by the news around the time of the election were more likely to score above the clinical threshold for moderate depression and anxiety symptoms. Stress in the weeks and months before the election—the anticipation phase—was also linked to increased depression symptoms, but it was not tied to anxiety symptoms. Surprisingly, stress related to the actual results of the election did not predict symptoms of either depression or anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also found that some groups were more vulnerable than others. Participants who identified as part of gender or sexual minority groups were more likely to experience depressive symptoms. Financial stress was also a strong predictor of both depression and anxiety. Having symptoms of depression or anxiety in 2022 was a powerful predictor of whether someone would still meet the threshold for those conditions in 2025. These patterns suggest that both existing mental health challenges and ongoing life stressors continue to shape how young adults respond to political stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers suggest that stress from constant exposure to news—especially on social media—may play a major role in shaping young adults’ emotional responses to elections. Because young people are more likely to get their news online, they may be more affected by the constant stream of political content. Even those who try to avoid politics may struggle to tune it out. This constant exposure may lead to feelings of helplessness, fear, or hopelessness, all of which are associated with depression and anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;News about the 2024 election may have been especially distressing for this sample, which was predominantly made up of liberal-identifying women and individuals from gender or sexual minority groups. Many of the key issues covered in election news—such as reproductive rights and transgender healthcare—directly affect these groups. As a result, these participants may have felt personally threatened by some of the policies or rhetoric they saw in the news. This could help explain why news-related stress had such a strong link to mental health symptoms in this group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anticipatory stress, or stress experienced in the lead-up to the election, was also linked to a higher risk of depression. This kind of stress may have contributed to depressive symptoms by fueling negative thoughts, emotional fatigue, or feelings of powerlessness. In contrast, it did not appear to increase anxiety. The researchers speculate that this may be because many participants in the study were already bracing themselves for an outcome they viewed as likely, which may have led to sadness and withdrawal rather than fear or panic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, stress about the election result itself—whether participants were upset about who won or lost—was not linked to an increased risk of either depression or anxiety. This finding runs counter to the assumption that disappointment or outrage over the outcome is the most emotionally damaging part of the election. Instead, it suggests that the stress leading up to the vote, and the non-stop news coverage surrounding it, may be more harmful than the result itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors point out some limitations in their study. For instance, the measures of election-related stress were based on single questions, which might not capture all the nuances of how people experience stress. Because some of the stress questions were asked after the election, it’s possible that participants’ answers were influenced by the results. But the study’s design controlled for many background factors, which helps strengthen the reliability of the findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results suggest that mental health professionals may need to pay closer attention to the emotional toll of election periods, particularly among young adults. For people who are already experiencing symptoms of depression or anxiety, the months leading up to an election may be a time of increased vulnerability. Clinicians might consider helping patients manage their media consumption, use cognitive behavioral techniques to address unhelpful thought patterns, or practice mindfulness to reduce anticipatory stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead, the researchers call for more real-time studies to understand how people react emotionally during political events. Future work could also examine whether similar patterns appear among politically conservative or moderate young adults, or how different types of news content affect stress levels. The study adds to growing evidence that politics can have a powerful impact on emotional well-being—especially for those just beginning to find their place in civic life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2025.116574" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;2024 presidential election stress and its association with depression and anxiety among U.S. young adults: A two-wave survey study&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Chang Zhao, G.

							&lt;p data-pm-slice="1 1 []"&gt;We don’t talk enough about what actually leads to good sleep. Not just eight hours of laying in bed and hoping for the best, but waking up genuinely rested—refreshed, not groggy, alert instead of annoyed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turns out, science has quite a bit to say about it. And no, the solution isn’t just taking melatonin or blacking out your room like a cave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From daily choices to mindset shifts, the quality of your sleep is mostly determined by what you do &lt;em&gt;long before&lt;/em&gt; you hit the pillow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are six daily habits backed by research that lead to deeper, more restorative sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. Get sunlight exposure within the first hour of waking&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I had to pick one habit that made the most difference to my energy and sleep quality, it’s this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting outside for even 5–20 minutes of sunlight in the morning regulates your circadian rhythm—that internal clock that controls sleep and wakefulness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href="https://www.hubermanlab.com/newsletter/using-light-for-health"&gt;Dr. Andrew Huberman&lt;/a&gt;, a neuroscientist at Stanford, explains, "Viewing sunlight within the first hours of waking (as soon as you can, even if through cloud cover) &lt;strong&gt;increases early-day cortisol release&lt;/strong&gt; (the ideal time for elevated cortisol) and prepares the body for sleep later that night. "&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even on cloudy days, the natural light outside is far more powerful than indoor lighting. Morning light suppresses melatonin production and signals to your brain that it’s time to be awake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you delay that exposure or avoid it entirely, your internal clock drifts. That’s when people start feeling wired at night and sluggish in the morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like to take a short walk or just drink my coffee on the balcony. It sounds small, but it resets everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. Move your body (but not too late)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don’t need to run marathons to sleep better. Even a brisk 30-minute walk improves sleep quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exercise has been shown to reduce sleep onset (how fast you fall asleep), increase deep sleep, and reduce symptoms of insomnia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s the catch: timing matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exercising too close to bedtime raises your core body temperature and releases stimulating hormones like cortisol, which can make falling asleep harder. &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/does-exercising-at-night-affect-sleep"&gt;Experts&lt;/a&gt; generally recommend exercising at least 2 hours before bedtime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I learned this the hard way after doing 9pm strength workouts that left me restless for hours. Now I aim for lunchtime or late afternoon activity—a rhythm that works with my body instead of against it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3. Cut off caffeine earlier than you think&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of us underestimate just how long caffeine hangs out in our system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to a study published in the &lt;a href="https://jcsm.aasm.org/doi/10.5664/jcsm.3170#:~:text=Caffeine%20had%20the%20most%20consistent,significance%20(p%20%3D%200.08)."&gt;&lt;em&gt;Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, consuming caffeine even &lt;strong&gt;six hours before bedtime&lt;/strong&gt; significantly reduced sleep quality and duration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Caffeine has a half-life of about 5–6 hours, meaning if you have a cup at 3pm, half of it is still active at 9pm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re a habitual coffee drinker, try shifting your last cup to before noon. That one tweak alone can reduce tossing and turning at night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally, I switched to herbal teas after lunch. It wasn’t easy at first, but my sleep felt noticeably deeper within a few days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4. Eat meals on a consistent schedule&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We often focus on &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; we eat for health, but &lt;em&gt;when&lt;/em&gt; we eat also plays a major role in how we sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eating late at night, especially heavy meals, can disrupt the body's natural overnight repair processes. Your digestion is still working overtime when it should be winding down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As noted by experts at &lt;a href="https://wellbeing.jhu.edu/blog/2022/12/09/timing-is-everything-why-eating-on-a-regular-schedule-supports-overall-well-being/"&gt;Johns Hopkins University&lt;/a&gt;, "Misalignment of your mealtimes with your bodily clock can cancel out all the benefits of your healthy diet."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What helped me most? Keeping dinner at least 2–3 hours before bed and avoiding big meals after 8pm. My sleep started to feel cleaner—less interrupted, fewer wakeups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;5. Wind down without screens&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ve heard this before. But it bears repeating because it’s still one of the biggest culprits of poor sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The blue light from screens &lt;a href="https://www.webmd.com/sleep-disorders/sleep-blue-light"&gt;suppresses melatonin production&lt;/a&gt;—the hormone that tells your brain it's time to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it’s not just the light. It’s the stimulation. Newsfeeds, emails, social scrolling—they keep your brain in a state of anticipation and alertness. Not exactly ideal when you’re trying to wind down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Try a 30-minute no-screen buffer before bed. Read a physical book. Journal. Stretch. Listen to music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I switched to an old-school alarm clock so I could charge my phone in the other room. Best decision I made this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;6. Do something that reduces stress before bed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, your body can’t sleep if your mind is still in fight-or-flight mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stress activates the sympathetic nervous system, keeping cortisol levels elevated and preventing deep rest. That’s why even if you’re tired, racing thoughts or unresolved stress can sabotage your sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fix? A pre-bed ritual that shifts you into parasympathetic mode (aka rest-and-digest).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That could be meditation, breathwork, writing down your worries, or even something tactile like folding laundry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href="https://www.drshelbyharris.com/"&gt;Dr. Shelby Harris&lt;/a&gt;, author of &lt;em&gt;The Women’s Guide to Overcoming Insomnia&lt;/em&gt;, says: "Sleep is not an on/off switch. Instead, think of the brain on a dimmer switch to ease your mind and body into sleep."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, it’s writing 3 lines about my day in a notebook. Not a full-blown journal, just a few bullet points. It signals closure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Final thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good sleep isn’t just a nighttime activity. It’s the byproduct of what you do all day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don’t need a perfect routine, but a consistent one that tells your body: this is when we rise, this is when we rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start small. Stick to one or two habits and watch how your nights (and mornings) change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your future self will thank you before the alarm even goes off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fiber supports healthy digestion, helps regulate blood sugar and cholesterol levels, and promotes a sense of fullness that can aid in appetite and weight management. It’s also linked to a lower risk of heart disease, type 2 diabetes and certain cancers, including colorectal and colon, Zenker noted. “Low fiber diets are linked to microbiome imbalances and lower microbial diversity, both of which are associated with increased risk of inflammatory diseases.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Different types of fiber offer different benefits. “Soluble fiber helps regulate blood sugar and lower cholesterol — great for patients with diabetes or heart disease risk,” said &lt;a href="https://www.bespokeconciergemd.com/providers/dr-michael-ednie" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7907052" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Dr. Michael Ednie&lt;/a&gt;, founder of Bespoke Concierge MD based in Scottsdale, Arizona. This type of fiber dissolves in water to form a gel that helps lower cholesterol and regulate blood sugar. “Insoluble fiber promotes regularity and helps prevent constipation, which is crucial for colon health,” Ednie said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then there’s prebiotic fiber, which serves as food for the beneficial bacteria in your gut. “As those bacteria ferment prebiotic fibers, they produce short-chain fatty acids like butyrate, which have anti-inflammatory effects and support gut barrier function. Prebiotics have also been linked to improved mineral absorption and even mood regulation via the gut-brain connection,” Ednie said. Garlic, onions, bananas and asparagus are all excellent sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just like variety in your overall diet supports better nutrition, eating different types of fiber helps build a healthier, more resilient gut microbiome. “Different fibers feed different strains of beneficial bacteria, which leads to better gut health, stronger immune function and lower inflammation overall,” Ednie explained. While there’s no strict formula for how much of each fiber type you need, he suggests aiming for about two-thirds insoluble fiber and one-third soluble fiber.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fibermaxxing can backfire on your digestive system.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

It is the body's control center responsible for the smooth functioning of everything from heart rate to breathing and movement. In the current era of health-conscious consumption, we are aware of a variety of foods that can be eaten to improve brain health such as leafy greens, nuts, berries, coffee, tomatoes, and fatty fish. These foods are known to provide the brain with vitamins, minerals, antioxidants and healthy fats that are consumed for optimal functioning and cognitive health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, it seems there are also some foods that you must steer clear of when aiming for top-notch brain health as they can cause some terrifying neurological damage and even death. In a TikTok going viral on the internet, neurologist Baibing Chen revealed three foods that he tries to avoid as they may cause neurotoxins and brain parasites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;What are these three foods? Let's find out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Certain &lt;keyword id="27775671" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="tropical-reef-fish" source="keywords"&gt;tropical reef fish&lt;/keyword&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-pos="0" class="id-r-component QbQNS undefined

Eating undercooked pork from unhygienic sources where you have no guarantee of hygiene and control measures puts the eater at the risk of all sorts of parasitic infections. The worst of them according to Chen is neurocysticercosis- a parasitic infection caused by eating tapeworm eggs that can lodge themselves in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Little-known fact is that it’s actually one of the leading causes of acquired epilepsy worldwide,” he shared. He added that this can not be the case in just developing countries but also in developed countries in areas with poor sanitation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;keyword id="27775672" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="damaged-tin-cans" source="keywords"&gt;Damaged tin cans&lt;/keyword&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-pos="0" class="id-r-component QbQNS undefined

If a can is bulging, cracked or severely dented, it's a red flag for botulinum contamination, he warned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The bacterium produces botulinum toxin, which is one of the most potent neurotoxins we know." Even a tiny amount of the neurotoxin can block the brain's ability to signal the muscles to move. “The result is flaccid paralysis, blurred vision, respiratory failure and, without antitoxin, it can be deadly.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also added that the more dangerous part about the toxin is that it's odourless and tasteless and thus one wouldn't be able to figure it out by smelling or tasting. Additionally, heating the food might not be enough to completely neutralise it and thus throwing it away might be the safer option. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Sun, 13 Jul 2025 15:02:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimwJBVV95cUxNaUxuOVdKS01NSExRSGdTZzNKdGhHSnY3WnUyZjM2cnBEMklIVy0zbFdLclhZNTB4MUdBMTJqR0pYd1EzMmtzbmtaM3BZVFJxVEdxanpzVkhzYnVKdzFlb0tSNHVUSDRtaVpaUEtjTld3QmxDZTI1VGdaQ2EzbGwzdmJ2ekE2MmNLN3Z1T2NKb0JZd2NfUjl0WWlUS25BbmZCMGRlbW1nYklXX1lIdzluOEZDREZlSWtQQm16TUpiUndXUEprSmgyQmUtY1Y4T2lJREItOC1zam9tSkl4R3htLTlQTzJOSF9zSFhNeVVRRFFJRXpoRHF3WV81RUNRak95UW5mSVNmaGlxN2ZoaFYzZkZ2aFpVc0dNTDZn0gGgAkFVX3lxTE5jOHBydmJTR3dya0dvNV9qb2lLaWFoUTJob0lVZW1PaUNKX052VmprempSaHRsTDF6ZEhpRTZnUTN1VXBXejBXaUtwU0VyV2RCblFDVE41ejhPRnNoS1dQcFhXMG11SXZUd3hGdU9NcnowUGFYSVBDN0d5TjFwRlYyNjZLcVF6YkpOUWdLVm9SVEM5V0ViYjdCT2lwRWI1NG9vRFZISWRxb0tEWG40SVlMOGhmbUdjXzVPMjV5ZDc4dEVCS3JQLUJlcnFUZGxkTVBxek1za21vVm9yLVJWdXBnOExGSkp4ZWF5QUUtVWkybmNVVjNJRmM1ekhDRDdzZDAxckZfcC1lVThQclNwSDlhRGdvZnd2Z1NxUFJFd0tTRg</guid></item><item><title>WashU的长期新冠肺炎诊所计划让苦苦挣扎的患者担心他们的护理- STLtoday.com | WashU’s plans for its Long COVID clinic leave struggling patients worried about their care - STLtoday.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqgFBVV95cUxPN1lCZlhOcVEyT1I2S1RQRnJZQ1FVZ0ZacGpKUU5FYXh3UnlwRmw1Yi03RWsyZFFtb0FPSzVsR29QUVlPeUk1d1I1bklPd3AzeFNYZHduVGNFTUpneTZRYmZ2aXhySVpIUkVzTHYwRGVDUnk5N3pxRHRLWFp5ajVoWkpqLU92SENEeVVWeko3endGcmJuV21tVFVYUWNRYlB5VGZYRjJENlRiZw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody" id="article-body" class="lee-track-in-article asset-content "&gt;

        &lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;ST. LOUIS — They face different symptoms of Long COVID, but they all share one common experience — finding answers at a clinic run by Washington University School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For three years, Emily, 34, from St. Louis, said she suffered with crushing fatigue, nausea, a racing heart rate and difficulty breathing after getting COVID-19 in August 2020. Her first appointment with a nurse at the Care and Recovery After COVID-19 (CARE) Clinic was life changing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“She said everything I was describing was in line with the experiences of other patients and consistent with what we know about Long COVID,” Emily said. “After three years, I could name my condition definitively, and a health care professional wasn’t afraid to take my suffering seriously.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The WashU clinic opened in October 2020 — about seven months into the COVID-19 pandemic — and &lt;a href="https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/metro/article_abfd9080-8434-5253-9dba-ae8d50e1659e.html" target="_blank"&gt;hundreds of patients have since come through its doors&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now those patients are facing confusion and distress after being told the clinic would  be closing at the end of this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several interviewed by the Post-Dispatch say they’ve been given vague reasons as to why. Their future appointments have been canceled, and they are unsure how their care will be coordinated in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many patients only wanted to be identified by their first names because of stigma associated with the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I am terrified to lose access to the only doctors who not only believed but understood me,” said Jess, 36, of St. Louis. “I’ve come so far in my progress, and I am scared to lose everything I’ve worked so hard for without the support of Long COVID-competent providers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://infectiousdiseases.wustl.edu/people/victoria-j-fraser" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Victoria Fraser&lt;/a&gt;, chair of the university’s Department of Medicine, said plans to close the clinic were spurred by the abrupt departure of its leading physician, whose spouse got a job in another state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We got unfortunately very short notice that she was leaving, so we really didn’t have another physician to take over the practice,” Fraser said in an interview Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The university is working on a “transition plan,” she said, which may involve replacing the physician and reopening the clinic, or it may not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;If not, university leaders are making sure that patients — many of whom have complex conditions — continue to receive ongoing care from their team of specialists, Fraser said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That’s why the transition is not super-simple at this point,” she said. “We’re working with a number of different specialists to figure out how we can care for these patients in the best way possible.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://physicians.wustl.edu/specialties/infectious-diseases/post-covid-19-clinic" target="_blank"&gt;clinic’s website&lt;/a&gt;, which had informed visitors of the closure and directed patients to ask their primary care physicians for “the appropriate specialist,” was updated Friday to say the university is working on a transition plan for patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“&lt;span&gt;We remain fully committed to providing high-quality care and support to individuals living with Long COVID, and we will share additional information with patients as plans for the clinic are finalized&lt;/span&gt;,” it now states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The site provides a phone number and email address of a community health worker who can connect callers to medical specialists and support resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patients say they are fearful that losing the clinic means losing a knowledgeable resource on the latest Long COVID research, referrals to specialists who have developed expertise in treating Long COVID symptoms and access to participating in clinical trials for new treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;They fear they will lose the progress they have made in improving their health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emma, 38, of St. Louis County, was healthy and lifting weights five days a week before she got COVID-19 in May 2022. She found her way to the CARE Clinic after six months of dealing with extreme fatigue, migraines, nausea, allergic reactions and other symptoms. Until then, providers had only responded to her with shoulder shrugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Through the therapeutics and the referrals I’ve gotten from the Long COVID clinic, I am just now starting to get something that resemblances a life back,” Emma said. “I can tend my garden. I can play with my nieces. Stairs are still my nemesis, but they don’t knock me down anymore.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The patients also worry about those who get sick in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Losing the CARE Clinic is a devastating blow. It affects current patients who have spent years struggling with daily tasks and also future patients who will need answers, support and treatment,” said Alex, 36, of Jefferson County. “The closure of this clinic makes it feel like help is slipping away when we need it most.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_top" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Long COVID’s broad reach&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Angela, 47, who lives in the Metro East, found herself with debilitating neurological issues, chest pains and gastrointestinal problems after getting COVID in June 2022. A year later, she has lost her 20-year career in the utility industry and become disabled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;With her husband working, her two sons have become her caregivers, she said. “It is truly a nightmare.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coming to the clinic, however, gave her hope for a cure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/covid/long-term-effects/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Long COVID&lt;/a&gt; is a chronic condition that includes a wide range of symptoms that occur after a COVID-19 infection and last at least three months. The symptoms can range from mild to severe — including organ damage and blood clots — and can even result in a disability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around 23 million Americans had symptoms of Long COVID in 2023, &lt;a href="https://covid19community.nih.gov/sites/default/files/2023-02/CEAL-WhatYouNeedtoKnowLongCOVID-English.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;according to the National Institutes of Health&lt;/a&gt;. The burden is thought to be even higher now — &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/jid/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/infdis/jiaf030/7972782?redirectedFrom=fulltext&amp;amp;login=false#google_vignette" target="_blank"&gt;around 44 million&lt;/a&gt;.

And about a quarter of adults with the disease report significant limitations in performing daily activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hundreds of Long COVID clinics opened across the country at the start of pandemic, but many are now closed, &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2025/04/long-covid-clinics-closing/682251" target="_blank"&gt;according to an April article published in The Atlantic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A reporter called 171 clinics and found 61 had closed, 15 were unreachable and 11 did not have a medical doctor or nurse on staff. Only 79 were accepting new patients. The closest to St. Louis are in Kansas City and Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only clinic in North Carolina — the University of North Carolina COVID Recovery Clinic — closed its doors last month. &lt;a href="https://www.med.unc.edu/phyrehab/patient-services/services-and-specialties/covid-recovery-clinic" target="_blank"&gt;A press release&lt;/a&gt; blamed “the loss of multiple funding sources,” with officials &lt;a href="https://www.newsobserver.com/news/local/article308422905.html" target="_blank"&gt;offering few details&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The closures come as Long COVID remains poorly understood and managed. No prescriptions, supplements or over-the-counter medications are approved to prevent or treat Long COVID, and more research is needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“With each clinic that shuts down, our communities lose not just care but also hope for recovery and a better quality of life,” said Laurie Jones, executive director of the worldwide patient advocacy organization &lt;a href="https://www.meaction.net" target="_blank"&gt;#MEAction&lt;/a&gt;, especially as people continue to get COVID-19. “Shutting down these clinics is not only harmful, it’s dangerously short-sighted.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the Biden administration &lt;a href="https://www.ahrq.gov/news/newsroom/press-releases/long-covid-grant-awards.html" target="_blank"&gt;undertook efforts to increase understanding of the disease and improve care&lt;/a&gt;, the Trump administration’s efforts to cut federal spending and crack down on student protests it deems as antisemitic has caused &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/03/19/myalgic-encephalomyelitis-chronic-fatigue-syndrome-columbia-program-shutdown" target="_blank"&gt;post-COVID research programs at universities like Columbia University&lt;/a&gt; to take a hit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of a “reorganization,” the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services in March &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/03/24/trump-administration-shuttering-office-of-long-covid-research-and-practice-00246836" target="_blank"&gt;also shut down&lt;/a&gt; the Long COVID Advisory Committee and the Office of Long COVID Research and Practice, which helped coordinate Long COVID research across the nation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanmic/article/PIIS2666-5247(25)00094-1/fulltext#:~:text=Millions" target="_blank"&gt;HHS also tried to cancel&lt;/a&gt; a $1.7 billion federal Long COVID research program — &lt;a href="https://recovercovid.org" target="_blank"&gt;Researching COVID to Enhance Recovery (RECOVER)&lt;/a&gt; — stating it would “no longer waste billions of taxpayer dollars responding to a non-existent pandemic that Americans moved on from years ago.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the research program was rescued from the chopping block after pushback from patients and researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The program recently discovered that &lt;a href="https://recovercovid.org/news/recover-research-qa-pediatric-long-covid" target="_blank"&gt;up to 5.8 million American children have Long COVID&lt;/a&gt;, suggesting it could now be the most common chronic condition among children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Washington University is one of 12 universities participating in the RECOVER research program, which aims to accelerate scientific progress and provide patients with services they need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The university was awarded a &lt;a href="https://medicine.washu.edu/news/long-covid-clinic-expanding-reach-to-vulnerable-metro-rural-communities" target="_blank"&gt;five-year $4.5 million RECOVER grant in the fall of 2023 to identity patient needs and improve care across Missouri&lt;/a&gt; through efforts such as working with community clinics and the University of Missouri to increase primary care physicians’ knowledge about the disease, especially in underserved and rural areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The university is &lt;a href="https://stlouisihn.org/our-work/clinical-community-integration/long-covid-care" target="_blank"&gt;also participating in studies&lt;/a&gt; testing medications to improve symptoms such as fast heart rate, dizziness and fatigue; a rehabilitation program to prevent energy crashes; and a procedure to improve the sense of smell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;University officials say the research will continue and not be impacted by the clinic’s closure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the university did not disclose the number of patients the clinic has been treating, Fraser mentioned that the figure “has been declining significantly” over time. These slowing numbers have also been seen nationally, she said, as patients’ symptoms gradually improve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But there still are a number of patients who are suffering, and we understand that and want to best help them however we can,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;‘Terrified of backsliding’&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long COVID patients at the CARE clinic say they have been guided through numerous helpful interventions, including simple things such as compression stockings, not eating certain fruits and vegetables, drinking salt water and taking antihistamines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;They describe receiving physical therapy plans that understand how their energy can be depleted and send them into a worsening cycle — knowledge that has helped many maintain their careers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The clinic also funneled them to specialists in areas such as cardiology, neurology and orthopedics that became experienced in identifying symptoms and treatment strategies tailored to each patient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jess describes having gone from needing a wheelchair to being able to go on a 20-minute walk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emily said after her first appointment, she started speech, occupational and physical therapy with practitioners who had built a body of knowledge to support Long COVID patients. She learned skills to help her memory and attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The Long COVID clinic was a door to health care professionals who were actively researching, learning and re-tooling effective approaches,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rusti Levin, 72, of St. Louis, said she caught COVID-19 for the first time in February and went to the clinic in May. During a two-hour appointment, she learned lifestyle interventions and was connected to an array of specialists. Now her follow-up appointment at the clinic in November has been cancelled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I don’t know what to expect,” Levin said. “I will wait to hear from the different departments to see what is happening with the rest of the Long COVID specialists, and if I can continue to see them in spite of the clinic shutting down.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lee-article-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The clinic also brought clinical trials to St. Louis, which many patients say they participate in.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Eating more fiber can have a positive affect on your cholesterol levels and overall heart health. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Experts recommend foods like raspberries, beans, chia seeds and oats. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lifestyle factors, like getting regular exercise and avoiding smoking, can also reduce your risk.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Maintaining &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7912602/foods-to-boost-your-good-cholesterol/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;healthy cholesterol levels&lt;/a&gt; is one of the most effective ways to protect your heart, and the good news is that making simple diet and lifestyle changes can have a significant impact. “When it comes to managing cholesterol, fiber is your best friend, but it’s often missing from the typical American diet,” says &lt;a href="https://blog.myfitnesspal.com/author/melissa-jaegermyfitnesspal-com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Melissa Jaeger, RD, LD&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, 95% of U.S. women, and 97% of men, don’t meet the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/how-much-fiber-should-you-be-eating-11752876" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;recommended intake of 14 grams of fiber&lt;/a&gt; per 1,000 calories eaten.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “Instead of focusing on foods to reduce in your diet to manage your cholesterol, consider what nutrients you can add,” says Jaeger, who points to fruits, vegetables, legumes and whole grains as go-to fiber-rich choices.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Fiber is a type of carbohydrate found in plant food that mostly travels through the digestive system intact. Insoluble fiber helps support regular bowel movements, while soluble fiber plays a crucial role in lowering cholesterol levels. “During digestion, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-nutrient-to-help-lower-cholesterol-8399539" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;fiber binds to cholesterol particles&lt;/a&gt;, moving them out of the body,” says &lt;a href="https://www.steponefoods.com/pages/about-elizabeth-klodas-md" class="pseudoStyle" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Elizabeth Klodas, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, a preventive cardiologist. Some types of fiber may also support healthy cholesterol levels by interacting with the gut microbiome.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

Not only does each cup of cooked oats have 4 grams of fiber, but most of that fiber is soluble fiber, the type that’s especially beneficial to lowering cholesterol.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Beta-glucans in oats possess gel-forming properties that help remove cholesterol from the intestines and also &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/2059033/best-and-worst-foods-to-eat-for-gut-health/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;influence gut bacteria&lt;/a&gt;, supporting cholesterol reduction through several mechanisms, including the production of short-chain fatty acids.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; One-third of an avocado provides 3 grams of fiber.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; And you don’t have to resort to guacamole to enjoy one, either. Jaeger recommends blending &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/262759/spinach-avocado-smoothie/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;avocado into smoothies&lt;/a&gt;, serving it with scrambled eggs and adding a few slices to salads and sandwiches.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; One large study found that people with an elevated waist circumference who ate one avocado per day for six months experienced reductions in &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7836633/high-cholesterol-diet-plan-for-beginners/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol levels&lt;/a&gt; compared with those who ate their usual diet sans avocado.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Researchers believe this effect may be related to avocados’ influence on gut microbiota and their phytosterol content, in addition to the high amount of fiber.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Not only do chia seeds have 9.8 grams of fiber in every ounce, but they’re also an excellent source of other cholesterol-fighting compounds like omega-3 fatty acids and antioxidants.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; A review found that &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/food-to-eat-more-of-if-you-have-high-cholesterol-11736513" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;eating chia seeds&lt;/a&gt; may be especially beneficial for lowering total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol in individuals with obesity or type 2 diabetes.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Chia seeds also contain &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/high-fiber-3-ingredient-snack-recipes-11765364" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;fiber, fat and protein&lt;/a&gt; that promote satiety and help prevent overeating, which could lead to weight gain and/or prevent loss and raise ‘bad’ cholesterol,” says &lt;a href="http://www.christinabadaracco.com" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Christina Badaracco, M.P.H., RDN, LDN&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Move more&lt;/strong&gt;: Research supports that adding an extra aerobic session each week, an extra week of exercise or extra time to your current sessions can all support healthier cholesterol levels.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ”The greatest benefit of exercise doesn’t come from moving up from running half-marathons to full marathons, it comes from doing something when you used to do nothing,” encourages Klodas. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get your numbers checked&lt;/strong&gt;: Klodas recommends getting your cholesterol (along with blood sugar and blood pressure) checked on a routine basis, because you can’t necessarily feel when these numbers are higher than they should be. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Replace saturated fats with unsaturated fats&lt;/strong&gt;: While there are some cardiovascular benefits associated with full-fat dairy, which is often high in saturated fat, the benefits do not outweigh the replacement of saturated fats with unsaturated fat sources when it comes to your cholesterol.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Avocados, avocado oil, olive oil, nuts and seeds are all excellent sources of &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/swap-to-lower-risk-of-heart-disease-and-diabetes-8679543" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;heart-healthy unsaturated fats&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-sc-block-adslot-inline"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quit smoking (or just don’t start)&lt;/strong&gt;: Compared to nonsmokers, current smokers’ total cholesterol is 3% higher on average and triglycerides are up to 15% higher, along with an increased risk of heart disease and stroke.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

The scientists sequenced remains from 1,313 individuals and found genetic traces of 214 different pathogens. These range from hepatitis B viruses to the bacterium that causes plague.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scale of the study provides an opportunity for researchers to test ideas about how culture, climate, and migration changed disease pressure over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-skeletons-hold-disease-secrets"&gt;Skeletons hold disease secrets&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was led by evolutionary geneticist Eske Willerslev of the &lt;a href="https://globe.ku.dk/"&gt;University of Copenhagen&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.cam.ac.uk/"&gt;University of Cambridge&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’ve long suspected the transition to farming and animal husbandry opened the door to a new era of disease,” Willerslev said. “Now DNA shows us it happened at least 6,500 years ago.”   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His team sifted through more than 400 billion sequencing reads and used chemical damage patterns to confirm which fragments truly came from ancient microbes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analysis uncovered infections in roughly three‑quarters of the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/scientists-decipher-the-genetic-history-of-400-medieval-skeletons/"&gt;skeletons&lt;/a&gt;, indicating that illness was a constant companion rather than a rare ordeal. The oldest sample, dating back about 37,000 years, contained mostly oral bacteria still common today. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results revealed that blood-borne infections didn’t show up until people began settling down, storing grain, and living closely with sheep, goats, and cattle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-farming-sparked-new-infections"&gt;Farming sparked new infections&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Livestock pens and crowded villages arrived in Eurasia around 8,000 years ago, and the genomic record registers an immediate uptick in disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A clear inflection point appears at 6,500 years ago, the moment when &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7563794/"&gt;zoonotic pathogens&lt;/a&gt;, the kind that jump from animals to humans, first show up consistently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One notorious example is &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(15)01322-7"&gt;Yersinia pestis&lt;/a&gt;, the plague bacterium, whose oldest genetic trace dates back to about 5,500 years ago in western Russia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This pushes the timeline of plague back two millennia and shows the microbe shadowing early farmers long before recorded pandemics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-waves-of-new-infections"&gt;Waves of new infections&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A second surge of infection follows the migration of &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature14507"&gt;steppe pastoralist&lt;/a&gt; groups roughly 5,000 years ago, when horse‑drawn wagons carried people, livestock, and microbes across the continent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Skeletons from that period revealed &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/stone-age-farming-population-decimated-by-plague-dna-skull/"&gt;plague&lt;/a&gt;, relapsing‑fever spirochetes, and the parasites that cause vivax malaria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such waves of infection probably devastated local communities, clearing ecological space for newcomers and turning pathogens into unlikely allies of conquest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ancient immune‑gene data hint at strong selection beginning in the Bronze Age – a genetic fingerprint of relentless pressure from emerging pathogens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-human-infections-from-animals"&gt;Human infections from animals&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The catalog reveals that cowpox relatives, leptospirosis bacteria, and meat-borne yersiniosis showed up soon after pigs, sheep, and goats were domesticated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This finding aligns with estimates that around 60 percent of emerging infections come from animals. Close contact clearly reshaped the disease landscape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also found skeletons that harbored two or more bugs at once, and these co-infections can worsen outcomes. An ancient Viking‑Age skull carried both hepatitis B and plague DNA, demonstrating how mixed infections may have driven sudden mortality spikes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Curiously, no clear evidence of tuberculosis surfaced, probably because its bacteria rarely circulate in high numbers in healthy blood. But as the team notes, absence of proof doesn’t mean ancient lungs were safe – only that some microbes leave fewer traces in the molecular record.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-ancient-infections-teach-doctors"&gt;What ancient infections teach doctors&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Mutations that were successful in the past are likely to reappear,” said lead author Martin Sikora. She noted that the ancient genomes can help scientists anticipate future mutations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaccine makers already test candidate antigens against panels of modern strains – a practice encouraged by the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/teams/health-product-policy-and-standards/standards-and-specifications/norms-and-standards/vaccine-standardization/regulation-and-quality-control-of-vaccines"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; – and prehistoric DNA provides a deeper benchmark. Comparing lineages over millennia highlights which protein targets stay stable and which drift.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Old plague sequences, for instance, are missing the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8547695/"&gt;ymt gene&lt;/a&gt; that helps modern strains survive in fleas. This points to the key step that turned a local infection into a global pandemic threat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similar evolutionary tipping points could lurk in viruses still endemic in bats or rodents. Public‑health planners can combine the new database with &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/climate-tipping-points-how-close-are-we-to-irreversible-change/"&gt;climate&lt;/a&gt; and land‑use models to gauge spillover risk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-pathogens-rewrote-human-genes"&gt;Pathogens rewrote human genes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The skeletal archive captures natural selection in action. It shows that human alleles linked to inflammatory responses became more common after farming took hold. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same alleles, still common today, now raise the risk of autoimmune disorders in industrialized nations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Immunologists argue that this trade‑off is the cost of survival: genes that helped ancestors fight livestock‑borne bugs can misfire in cleaner modern environments. &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/oldest-human-dna-ever-found-tells-story-of-lost-branch-on-human-neanderthal-family-tree/"&gt;Ancient DNA&lt;/a&gt; provides the infection history that scientists need to test that idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Infectious diseases have left lasting impressions on human genomes, as selective pressures from pathogens have continuously shaped human genetic variation,” wrote the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Where and when different human pathogens first emerged, how and why they spread, and how they affected human populations are important but largely unresolved questions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09192-8"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Sun, 13 Jul 2025 14:45:20 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijwFBVV95cUxQYWFjTFlEZHlXWWQwM1paczZOcGhmcmRxNG80cjkyZU1IOUE5clo3aTlpUWU5N1FZUU5BWWVLSnBMVXA0YnNFb0J4UU9PS3V5QTFEZnVMNGwzS0ctZ0NrZFVkQ1h5UEY5SF9xNGRXcURWeDJhaTVRNXhJS19HdEt4VUJQX25iUkNkS0MwdzU0TQ</guid></item><item><title>哌甲酯： ADHD药物仅抑制男性的冲动性，与大脑接线差异有关- PsyPost | Methylphenidate: ADHD drug curbs impulsivity in men only, linked to brain wiring differences - PsyPost</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMitgFBVV95cUxQU3EzbVBoSGttZE9QbURiQy1fc2hTV0RDdm04ZVYzU3VhUGVCdVJDSGdnY0VPeTZxWEJuYm45d3NIWE9LSGhpX3lxMllCVHF2clotZDB6V0ZRNUZ6eTdmSW44aUt3bWVZOEpSY2ZGMDdtZVNUQmhIdjIwOFZodjk1TVkydGcyQjhtSEE5RW82aWxmTmJIVnF0bERtYzJHYm90dFdSVnNTejMyWG45NEhGVG1UQWwtdw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="content-inner "&gt;&lt;p data-start="104" data-end="463"&gt;A recent study of young adults in Israel found that a 20 mg dose of methylphenidate reduces choice impulsivity in men, but not in women, immediately after taking the drug. In men, the drug’s effects appeared to be related to the structural integrity of neural fibers in the forceps major region of the corpus callosum. The study was published in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811925001995?via%3Dihub"&gt;&lt;em data-start="450" data-end="462"&gt;NeuroImage&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start="465" data-end="886"&gt;Impulsivity refers to the tendency to act quickly without fully considering the consequences, often leading to risky or inappropriate behavior. It is a common feature of both everyday behavior and clinical conditions such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, substance use disorders, and certain mood disorders. Impulsivity is a complex trait that can affect decision-making, emotion regulation, and self-control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start="888" data-end="1390"&gt;There are several types of impulsivity. Motor impulsivity involves acting without thinking, such as blurting out answers or interrupting others. Attentional impulsivity is characterized by difficulty staying focused and being easily distracted. Choice impulsivity refers to a preference for smaller immediate rewards over larger delayed ones, reflecting difficulty with delaying gratification. Cognitive impulsivity involves making decisions quickly without adequately processing available information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start="1392" data-end="1942"&gt;Study author Maryana Daood and her colleagues aimed to assess whether methylphenidate affects choice impulsivity. Methylphenidate is a stimulant medication commonly used to treat attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder by increasing levels of dopamine and norepinephrine in the brain, which can improve attention and self-control. It is sold under brand names such as Ritalin, Concerta, and Medikinet. Since impulsivity is a central feature of ADHD, verifying that a commonly used treatment reduces this specific behavior has important implications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start="1944" data-end="2136"&gt;The study included 48 young adults recruited through advertisements at the University of Haifa in Israel. The average participant age was between 26 and 27 years, and 28 participants were men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start="2138" data-end="2577"&gt;Each participant took part in two data collection sessions. During each session, they completed structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans—both at rest and while performing a delay discounting task, a measure of choice impulsivity. In one session, participants received a 20 mg oral dose of methylphenidate. In the other session, they received a placebo capsule identical in appearance but without active ingredients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start="2579" data-end="2933"&gt;Participants were randomly assigned to one of two groups. One group received methylphenidate in the first session and placebo in the second; the other group received the treatments in the opposite order. Neither the participants nor the researchers administering the treatments knew which capsule was taken in each session, making the study double-blind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start="2935" data-end="3206"&gt;In addition to the two experimental sessions, participants completed the delay discounting task on two earlier occasions. This task assesses how much a person devalues a reward based on the time they have to wait for it. It is commonly used to measure choice impulsivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start="3208" data-end="3724"&gt;Neuroimaging data showed that men had greater white matter integrity in three brain tracts: the anterior thalamic radiation, the cingulum bundle, and the forceps minor of the corpus callosum. Methylphenidate significantly reduced choice impulsivity in men but not in women. In men, the drug’s effectiveness was greater among those with lower neural fiber integrity in the forceps major. In contrast, in women, the drug’s impact was more pronounced among those with higher white matter integrity in the forceps minor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Taken together, results uncover sex-specific effects of MPH [methylphenidate] on choice impulsivity, accounted for by inverse associations between choice impulsivity under MPH and the structural integrity of distinct segments of the corpus callosum,” study authors concluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study sheds light on the effects of methylphenidate on choice impulsivity. However, it should be noted that the study was conducted on a small group of healthy young adults, not on individuals with ADHD or with increased impulsivity. Results on larger groups or on individuals with particularly high impulsivity might differ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2025.121196"&gt;The impact of methylphenidate on choice impulsivity is inversely associated with corpus callosum fiber integrity across sexes,&lt;/a&gt;” was authored by Maryana Daood , Leehe Peled-Avron , Rachel Ben-Hayun , Michael Nevat , Judith Aharon-Peretz , Rachel Tomer , and Roee Admon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Sun, 13 Jul 2025 14:06:29 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitgFBVV95cUxQU3EzbVBoSGttZE9QbURiQy1fc2hTV0RDdm04ZVYzU3VhUGVCdVJDSGdnY0VPeTZxWEJuYm45d3NIWE9LSGhpX3lxMllCVHF2clotZDB6V0ZRNUZ6eTdmSW44aUt3bWVZOEpSY2ZGMDdtZVNUQmhIdjIwOFZodjk1TVkydGcyQjhtSEE5RW82aWxmTmJIVnF0bERtYzJHYm90dFdSVnNTejMyWG45NEhGVG1UQWwtdw</guid></item><item><title>由健康专家支持的自然缓解头痛的食物- CNET | Foods That Naturally Relieve Headaches, Backed by Health Pros - CNET</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMingFBVV95cUxNQnV2SVdSYXExUHAxbmZiWk9rQU1uRnJIZi1yOHdYQXZQd0lfMEZzVzRkZW1ObC00YS1jZ1ExaHlhbmJjT0NDX3ZLWVlXNjJfNVdyVHEzdlJPYzRadFBTd05aWkJCaTBzYzA0bi1PYkNSVnM3WXRwMFFHbGM1SC1wclM4VC1oVUxuc3dkWjJ1ZmlWRlM1Q0dwRXYzUGx4UQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article class="c-ShortcodeContent c-ShortcodeContent-theme:default sm:u-col-2 md:u-col-6 lg:u-col-12"&gt;&lt;p class="u-speakableText-p1"&gt;What you eat could be the key to easing your headache or migraine symptoms. Though adjusting your diet is far from a miracle cure, when paired with other healthy habits, like maintaining your &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/medical/summer-hydration-daily-water-requirements/" target="_self"&gt;hydration&lt;/a&gt;, getting enough exercise, getting enough &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/sleep/best-sleep-tracker/" target="_self"&gt;sleep&lt;/a&gt; and managing &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/mental/7-strategies-to-reduce-stress-and-feel-more-joy-today/" target="_self"&gt;stress&lt;/a&gt;, it's a low-effort way to relieve your pain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="u-speakableText-p2"&gt;"The most important thing I tell patients is that migraines are highly individualized," says &lt;a href="https://somerset-medical.com/about/" target="_self"&gt;Dr. Nicholas Church&lt;/a&gt;, a board-certified member of the American Board of Family Medicine and the American Academy of Family Physicians. "What helps one person may not help another, and what's a trigger for one might be therapeutic for someone else."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Church advises patients to keep a "headache diary" to track these factors and see if they notice any triggers. To understand how what you eat can affect your headaches, we talked to dietitians and doctors to determine which foods ease symptoms and which might be contributing to your pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;1. Omega-3-rich foods like walnuts&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I recommend &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/nutrition/health-benefits-omega-3-foods-add-into-diet-with-these-foods/" target="_self"&gt;omega-3-rich&lt;/a&gt; fish, such as salmon, mackerel and sardines," says Church. "These fish are high in anti-inflammatory fats (EPA and DHA), which can reduce inflammation throughout the body, including in the vascular system and brain."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Citing a &lt;a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/374/bmj.n1448" target="_self"&gt;2021 randomized controlled trial&lt;/a&gt;, Church explains that because migraines are believed to involve inflammatory and vascular changes in the body, &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/nutrition/best-omega-3-supplements-for-a-healthy-heart/" target="_self"&gt;omega-3 fatty acids&lt;/a&gt; may help reduce their frequency or intensity when eaten regularly. "The study's findings also align with earlier data showing that omega-3s help regulate prostaglandins, which play a role in headache inflammation," says Church. Prostaglandins are hormone-like substances that impact bodily functions like inflammation, pain and menstrual cramps. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-all-top spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fatty fish also contain &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/nutrition/feel-low-on-energy-try-these-11-vitamin-d-rich-foods/" target="_self"&gt;vitamin D&lt;/a&gt;, coenzyme Q10 and B vitamins like riboflavin, which support healthy brain metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kiran Campbell, a registered dietitian nutritionist at &lt;a href="https://www.mynetdiary.com/bio-kcampbell.html" target="_self"&gt;MyNetDiary&lt;/a&gt;, also mentions a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2161831323014503#sec5" target="_self"&gt;2024 meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt; revealing that omega-3 fatty acids can reduce the frequency, duration and severity of migraines. She adds that plant-based sources include chia seeds, walnuts, flaxseed and algae oil. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example foods:&lt;/strong&gt; salmon, mackerel, sardines, chia seeds, walnuts, flaxseed and algae oil&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large c-shortcodeImage-hasCaption"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_caption g-inner-spacing-right-small g-text-xxsmall"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chia and flax seeds are great sources of omega-3s. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;mikroman6/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;2. Magnesium-rich foods like spinach&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.uws.edu/faculty/byname/daniel_redwood/" target="_self"&gt;Daniel Redwood&lt;/a&gt;, the director of Human Nutrition and Functional Medicine at the University of Western States, explains, "Attention to the potential importance of &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/nutrition/different-types-of-magnesium/" target="_self"&gt;magnesium&lt;/a&gt; in migraine grew in prominence with the discovery (&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2584000/" target="_self"&gt;Ramadan, 1989&lt;/a&gt;) that people with migraines had lower levels of this mineral in their red blood cells, serum and brain tissue."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-small c-shortcodeImage-pullRight"&gt;&lt;a rel href="https://www.cnet.com/health-tips/" target="_blank" class="c-shortcodeImage_imageContainer"&gt;   &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Paul Daidone, medical director at &lt;a href="https://trueselfrecovery.com/" target="_self"&gt;True Self Recovery&lt;/a&gt;, seconds this, stating that food rich in magnesium -- like pumpkin seeds, spinach and avocado -- may reduce the severity and occurrence of migraines. He cites a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8912646/" target="_self"&gt;2022 study&lt;/a&gt; examining the potential connection between magnesium deficiency and migraine, which describes how magnesium deficiency is implicated in migraine attacks due to processes like cortical spreading depression, oxidative stress, neurotransmitter imbalance and electrolyte imbalance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Although clinical evidence of the acute dietary magnesium deficiency as a direct migraine trigger remains limited, scientists are investigating the involvement of intra- and extracellular magnesium levels in migraine pathogenesis," Daidone explains. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Schonze Del Pozo, a board-certified internal medicine physician and medical director at &lt;a href="https://eastsacconcierge.com" target="_self"&gt;East Sacramento Concierge&lt;/a&gt;, states that many of the patients she sees for headaches and migraines are &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/nutrition/5-best-magnesium-supplements/" target="_self"&gt;deficient in magnesium&lt;/a&gt;. She also cites a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22426836/" target="_self"&gt;2012 study&lt;/a&gt; in the Journal of Neural Transmission entitled "Why all migraine patients should be treated with magnesium." As a result, she recommends a healthy diet of magnesium-rich dark leafy greens like spinach, kale, broccoli and Swiss chard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example foods: &lt;/strong&gt;pumpkin seeds, spinach and avocado, kale, broccoli and Swiss chard&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;3. Ginger&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Many swear by ginger as a way to help with migraines," states &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/drknobel/?originalSubdomain=uk" target="_self"&gt;Dr. Maria Knöbel&lt;/a&gt;, a general practitioner and medical director of &lt;a href="https://medicalcert.co.uk/about/" target="_self"&gt;Medical Cert UK&lt;/a&gt;. "Studies have proven that ginger reduces nausea and can decrease the inflammation that leads to migraine pain. Ginger has helped patients during my practice, whether they take it as ginger tea or in supplement form." She references a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23657930/" target="_self"&gt;2014 study&lt;/a&gt; that found ginger powder to be as effective as the medication sumatriptan in treating acute migraine attacks, but with fewer side effects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ginger tea may be especially beneficial because, Knöbel states, "It's important to drink enough water, as well as eat ginger. Drinking enough water might stop your migraine from getting any worse."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Church also recommends &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/nutrition/dont-miss-out-on-the-7-hidden-health-benefits-of-ginger/" target="_self"&gt;ginger because it contains&lt;/a&gt; natural anti-inflammatory compounds like gingerol. "I've had patients find relief from migraines or migraine-related nausea using ginger tea, powder or chews," he explains. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29768938/#link={%22role%22:%22standard%22,%22href%22:%22https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29768938/%22,%22target%22:%22%22,%22absolute%22:%22%22,%22linkText%22:%222019%20study%22}" target="_self"&gt;2019 study&lt;/a&gt; also found that 400mg of ginger extract, in addition to 100mg of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ketoprofen, may help treat migraine attacks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large c-shortcodeImage-hasCaption"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_caption g-inner-spacing-right-small g-text-xxsmall"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ginger tea combines the benefits of ginger with the hydration of water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Muhamad Zulkarnaen/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;4. Nuts and seeds like pumpkin seeds&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Another group of foods I recommend are nuts and seeds, including almonds, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds and walnuts," Church states. "Like leafy greens, these are rich in magnesium, and some also provide &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/nutrition/vitamin-e-health-benefits-nutritional-sources-and-drawbacks/" target="_self"&gt;vitamin E&lt;/a&gt;, which has been shown to help with menstrual migraines and migraines with aura." A &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4359851/#sec3" target="_self"&gt;2015 study&lt;/a&gt; reflected this. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example foods: &lt;/strong&gt;almonds, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds and walnuts&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;5. Cinnamon&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Cinnamon contains a high amount of antioxidants that may also reduce headache frequency," Campbell explains. "Stir it into your morning oatmeal or tea, or bake it into muffins and breads." She cites a randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32638445/" target="_self"&gt;2020 trial&lt;/a&gt;, stating, "Studies suggest that cinnamon supplementation may lower inflammation, cutting down on migraine frequency, severity and duration."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large c-shortcodeImage-hasCaption"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_caption g-inner-spacing-right-small g-text-xxsmall"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The antioxidants in cinnamon may help treat headaches and migraines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;FreshSplash/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;6. Foods rich in vitamin B2, like eggs&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A well-known [1998] &lt;a href="https://www.neurology.org/doi/10.1212/wnl.50.2.466?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;amp;rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&amp;amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed" target="_self"&gt;randomized controlled trial&lt;/a&gt; found that 400 mg of riboflavin daily significantly reduced migraine frequency and severity over a three-month period," Church says. Though this high dose usually comes from supplementation, riboflavin-rich foods support the same metabolic processes in migraine prevention. These foods can include eggs, dairy and lean meats. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Riboflavin is essential for mitochondrial energy production, and many researchers believe that migraines stem in part from dysfunction in energy metabolism within brain cells," Church adds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Redwood adds, "There exists a small but promising body of research on the effectiveness of some nutritional supplements for migraines, especially riboflavin (vitamin B2), coenzyme Q10 and magnesium. The first research-based indicator of riboflavin's potential as a migraine treatment appeared in a small 1946 article by a medical physician, published in the Canadian Medical Association Journal, which reported dramatic effectiveness from what would now be considered low-dose B2 supplements."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33779525/" target="_self"&gt;2022 systematic review&lt;/a&gt; and meta-analysis found that supplementation of 400mg/day of vitamin B2 for three months affected the duration, frequency and pain score of migraine attacks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example foods:&lt;/strong&gt; Eggs, dairy and lean meats &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;7. Turmeric &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Curcumin is the active compound in turmeric and, according to Campbell, is "high in antioxidant power and shines especially when paired with omega-3s." To add it to your diet, consider sprinkling it into smoothies, curries or teas. Campbell references a randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32727335/" target="_self"&gt;2021 trial&lt;/a&gt; that concluded, "Present findings revealed that n-3 fatty acids and curcumin co-supplementation can be suggested as a promising new approach in migraine headache management." However, more studies are needed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large c-shortcodeImage-hasCaption"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_caption g-inner-spacing-right-small g-text-xxsmall"&gt;&lt;p&gt;When combined with omega-3s, turmeric may help with migraine headache management. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Rawlstock/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;8. Whole grains like brown rice&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Church mentions that whole grains like quinoa, brown rice and oats may also be beneficial since they "provide a steady release of glucose, preventing &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/medical/what-can-your-blood-sugar-tell-you-i-tracked-mine-for-a-month-to-find-out/" target="_self"&gt;blood sugar crashes&lt;/a&gt; that can trigger headaches, and are good sources of &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/nutrition/high-fiber-foods-to-improve-your-digestion/" target="_self"&gt;fiber&lt;/a&gt;, B vitamins and trace minerals." He cites a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9846638/#abstract1" target="_self"&gt;2023 cross-sectional study&lt;/a&gt; of 12,710 participants with all data collected from a 1999-2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. It found that for every 10 grams of fiber added to the diet, there was an 11% reduction in the odds of having severe headaches or migraines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"By providing magnesium, iron, and &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/nutrition/8-science-backed-reasons-you-should-take-vitamin-b/" target="_self"&gt;B vitamins&lt;/a&gt;, whole grains support brain health, oxygen delivery and a stable glucose supply, which are all relevant to migraine prevention," concludes Church.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37216708/" target="_self"&gt;2023 comprehensive review&lt;/a&gt; also found that curcumin is a promising candidate for preventing and controlling migraines due to its anti‑inflammatory, antioxidative, anti-protein aggregate and analgesic effects. However, additional studies are needed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example foods:&lt;/strong&gt; quinoa, brown rice and oats&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;9. Water-rich foods like watermelon&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/drkimberlyidoko/?hl=en" target="_self"&gt;Dr. Kimberly Idoko&lt;/a&gt;, a developmental neurobiologist and board-certified neurologist, reveals that dehydration can also trigger headaches, which is why staying hydrated can significantly improve migraine treatments. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"&lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/nutrition/eat-your-way-to-peak-hydration-with-these-6-electrolyte-rich-foods/" target="_self"&gt;Water-rich foods&lt;/a&gt; like cucumber, watermelon and citrus fruits also help you stay hydrated," adds Church.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large c-shortcodeImage-hasCaption"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_caption g-inner-spacing-right-small g-text-xxsmall"&gt;&lt;p&gt;To prevent dehydration-caused headaches or migraines, enjoy more water-rich foods like watermelon. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Anucha Muphasa/500px/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Foods that may trigger headaches or migraines&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chocolate, cheese and alcohol:&lt;/strong&gt; "In one &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17403039/" target="_self"&gt;[2007] study&lt;/a&gt; of over 500 migraine sufferers, 44% reported at least one food as a trigger.

Over a 5-year period, doctors at a neurology clinic in Israel treated 36 children and adolescents (average age 9) with severe daily or near-daily headaches who drank an average of 11 quarts of cola drinks per week," says Redwood. "At the end of a gradual withdrawal period (because too speedy a withdrawal can trigger even worse headaches), 33 of these 36 young people were headache-free, a truly stunning result. Nearly all cola drinks contain substantial amounts of caffeine (&lt;a href="https://ift.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1750-3841.2007.00414.x" target="_self"&gt;Chou and Bell, 2007&lt;/a&gt;)."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note: 11 quarts of cola per week is extreme, and the average person doesn't consume this much caffeine. Moderate caffeine intake is still OK, according to Amelia Ti, a registered dietitian and diabetes educator in New York City who is also part of CNET's medical review board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, when it comes to caffeine, Church notes, "&lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/nutrition/cutting-back-on-coffee-is-hard-tips-for-making-it-easier/" target="_self"&gt;Caffeine&lt;/a&gt;, used strategically, can enhance the absorption of pain relievers and constrict dilated blood vessels in the brain, which may ease migraine pain. This is why many over-the-counter headache medications include it. Studies have shown that 40–100 mg of caffeine (the amount in a small cup of coffee or strong tea) &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5655397/#:~:text=This%20review%20provides%20evidence%20for,mg%20enhance%20benefits%20in%20migraine." target="_self"&gt;can reduce migraine&lt;/a&gt; or tension headache pain.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Eating early in the day and front-loading your calories supports greater weight loss versus eating later.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Experts suggest eating breakfast at least 12 hours after your last meal for the most benefits.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Breakfast is linked to better diet quality, cognitive benefits and reduced risk of cardiovascular disease.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You’ve probably heard that breakfast is the most important meal of the day. And experts agree that, in most cases, some breakfast is better than no breakfast. That’s because skipping breakfast is associated with an increased risk of obesity, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-happens-to-your-body-when-you-have-insulin-resistance-8400321" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;insulin resistance&lt;/a&gt; and metabolic syndrome.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; But does it matter &lt;em&gt;when&lt;/em&gt; we eat breakfast? 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Emerging research suggests that &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7826585/best-times-to-eat-for-weight-loss/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;meal timing is important&lt;/a&gt;, especially for weight loss. “Studies show that front-loading calories earlier in the day supports greater weight loss, even under the same daily calorie intake,” says &lt;a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/lindsay-fencl-rd-cd-35a6251b2" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Lindsay Fencl, RD, CD&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Here’s what dietitians have to say about the best time to eat breakfast, why eating earlier might be better and the many other benefits of breakfast.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-why-this-is-the-best-time-to-eat-breakfast-for-weight-loss"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Why This Is the Best Time to Eat Breakfast for Weight Loss &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Eating earlier in the day aligns naturally with your &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/irregular-circadian-rhythms-linked-to-heart-disease-8425247" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;circadian rhythm&lt;/a&gt;, the body’s internal clock, which regulates the sleep-wake cycle, hormone release and metabolism. In other words, our bodies are more efficient earlier in the day, when it comes to digesting food and burning calories, as compared to the latter part of the day.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It makes sense when you think about it: Food provides fuel, and you need that energy when you’re awake during the day versus when you’re sleeping at night. In fact, studies show that &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7891068/best-worst-late-night-snacks-according-to-a-dietitian/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;late-night eating&lt;/a&gt; is associated with weight gain and increased risk of chronic diseases like diabetes.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; But when should we eat breakfast? “There is not an exact time that is best to have breakfast, as this may depend on the person and their typical schedule,” says &lt;a href="https://melissamitri.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Melissa Mitri, M.S., RD&lt;/a&gt;. “However, it’s clear that eating something matters, as research suggests a connection to eating earlier and greater weight loss.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Mitri does suggest waiting to eat breakfast until at least 12 hours after your previous meal as a good starting point, due to the metabolic benefits of an overnight fast. “For example, if you ate dinner at 7 p.m., then your breakfast would be at 7 a.m. or later,” explains Mitri.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There is one study that found a sweet spot when it comes to specific breakfast timing and weight loss. Results of the study showed that eating breakfast between 6:45 and 7:30 a.m. led to more weight loss over 12 weeks versus eating breakfast between 8:10 and 9:10 a.m.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Caveat: This was one study. More research needs to be done to validate these findings. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-other-benefits-of-breakfast"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Other Benefits of Breakfast &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Supports Near- and Long-Term Brain Function &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Eating breakfast could protect your brain from age-related cognitive decline. A recent study provided cognitive tests to more than 850 adults every 18 months. The researchers also looked for signs of neurodegeneration. The results showed that breakfast skippers did not perform as well on the cognitive tests compared to those who ate breakfast. Those who skipped the first meal of the day were also at greater risk of experiencing cognitive decline and signs of neurodegeneration.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “A quality breakfast, ideally consumed within two to three hours of waking, is linked to a wide range of health benefits, including better mood, improved cognitive function, smarter food choices and more effective weight management,” says Fencl. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Increases Diet Quality &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Eating breakfast may lead to eating a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7938737/top-healthy-eating-habits-according-to-a-dietitian/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;higher-quality diet&lt;/a&gt; overall. Research shows that skipping breakfast led to a two-point decrease in Healthy Eating Index Scores. Missing the first meal of the day lowered scores in the fruit, whole grain, dairy and empty calories categories.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Reduces Risk of Cardiovascular Disease &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A quality breakfast can also do your heart some good. A clinical trial found that subjects who consumed 20% to 30% of their total calories at breakfast had lower BMIs and smaller waistlines, along with a 9% to 18% reduction in &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8035440/what-causes-high-triglycerides/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;triglyceride levels&lt;/a&gt; and a 4% to 8% increase in HDL cholesterol levels.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-other-tips-for-managing-your-weight"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Other Tips for Managing Your Weight &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In addition to eating a balanced breakfast early in the day, and at least 12 hours after your last meal, follow these other habits for successful weight management. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eat a balanced lunch and dinner. &lt;/strong&gt;At most lunches and dinners, aim to follow the balanced plate framework, making half your plate vegetables, a quarter of your plate whole grains and a quarter of your plate protein. This helps keep you full and satisfied.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eat mostly whole foods. &lt;/strong&gt;Choose whole foods like fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, nuts, seeds and legumes. These foods not only pack protein and fiber to keep you full, but also provide important vitamins, minerals and antioxidants that keep inflammation at bay. Consume refined sugars in moderation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get your steps in. &lt;/strong&gt;Walking is one of the most underrated forms of exercise for weight loss. Research shows that walking for 50 minutes, just four times a week (at moderate to vigorous intensity) can help with weight loss and losing fat in the belly region.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lift weights. &lt;/strong&gt;Strength training helps build and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/how-to-maintain-muscle-mass-while-losing-weight-8706542" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;preserve lean muscle mass&lt;/a&gt;. When you lose weight, you lose both fat and muscle, unless you’re doing something to preserve that muscle mass. Less muscle means a slower metabolism. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290619/trying-to-lose-weight-heres-why-strength-training-is-as-important-as-cardio/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;strength training&lt;/a&gt; at least two days per week.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-sc-block-adslot-inline"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get seven to nine hours of good-quality sleep. &lt;/strong&gt;Sleep is just as important as diet and exercise when it comes to weight loss. Research shows that just one night of sleep deprivation decreases leptin, the satiety hormone, and increases ghrelin, the hunger hormone.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;This may lead to more snacking the next day, specifically on foods higher in fat and carbohydrates.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manage stress. &lt;/strong&gt;Stress leads to &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/how-to-know-high-cortisol-levels-11762693" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;elevated cortisol&lt;/a&gt;, the stress hormone. The carbs you crave when you’re stressed? It’s biological. Cortisol increases cravings for sugary and fatty foods. Elevated cortisol is also associated with an increase in belly fat. Practicing &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/can-you-practice-mindful-eating-to-lose-weight-11739943" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;mindfulness techniques&lt;/a&gt;, meditation and exercise can all help reduce stress, which can impact weight loss.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Eating breakfast early in the day aligns with your circadian rhythm. Your body is more efficient in the first part of the day at digesting food and burning calories compared to the latter. When it comes to timing, experts suggest waiting at least 12 hours after your last meal. Eating breakfast is also associated with a better-quality diet, short- and long-term cognitive benefits and a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease.&lt;br&gt;
