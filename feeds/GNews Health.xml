Endometriosis. Fibromyalgia. Multiple Sclerosis. Postherpetic neuralgia.

He and his research team also found that there is a molecule that the brain can release for pain relief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We focused on the lateral parabrachial nucleus (lPBN), a major entry point of sensory information from the periphery and the first site of integration of many affective behavioral states,” Betley said in a study recently published in the journal &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74968X1596630&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41586-025-09602-x&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.popularmechanics.com%2Fscience%2Fhealth%2Fa69014450%2Fscientists-found-the-potential-off-button-for-stopping-chronic-pain%2F" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Nature;cpos:6;pos:1;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “Populations of neurons in the lPBN […] respond to acute [pain-related] stimuli, and prolonged activation of excitatory lPBN neurons can drive a chronic pain-like state.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9119955/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:parabrachial nucleus;cpos:7;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;parabrachial nucleus&lt;/a&gt; is made up of different neuron clusters in the &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK560589/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:dorsolateral pons;cpos:8;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;dorsolateral pons&lt;/a&gt; of the brainstem. Known as Y1R neurons, they transmit sensory information (such as taste and &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/environment/a23834/record-hot-years-could-be-new-normal-by-2025/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:temperature;cpos:9;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;temperature&lt;/a&gt;) in addition to pain, also regulating appetite and threat signals. While Y1R neurons exist in various subpopulations, what they have in common is the expression of receptors for &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00869/full" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:neuropeptide Y or NPY;cpos:10;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;neuropeptide Y or NPY&lt;/a&gt;, which regulates types of brain activity like metabolism, heart rate, immune function, blood pressure, and even stress reduction. Other studies that involved monitoring neural activity and running computer models showed a link to chronic pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Betley and his research team used painful stimuli (such as exposure to a hot surface) to activate Y1R neurons in mice, and as they predicted, the mice showed behaviors associated with persistent &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1" href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/a33433129/neanderthal-low-pain-tolerance/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:pain;cpos:11;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;pain&lt;/a&gt;, such as paw licking. When the Y1R neurons were blocked, pain became much less persistent, and the mice only had short pain responses after being exposed to the same stimuli. There was one group of Y1R neurons that stayed active during licking, which suggests that a subpopulation of Y1R neurons is responsible for part of the Y1R response during extended periods of pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Y1R neurons do not directly cause pain, they are thought to be involved in a larger network that is behind painful sensations. The way these neurons are organized allows them to receive sensory inputs, including pain signals sent from the spinal cord, which the neurons then send to multiple regions of the &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:12;pos:1" href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/health/a69001666/ultrasound-helmet-parkinsons-breakthrough/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:brain;cpos:12;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;brain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Something else the researchers wanted to see was whether pain took precedence over survival. They temporarily deprived the mice of food and water and also introduced a frightening stimulus (like the scent of a &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:13;pos:1" href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/a67955893/early-humans-eaten-by-leopards/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:predator;cpos:13;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;predator&lt;/a&gt;), and when faced with these perceived threats to their survival, the mice experienced significantly less pain. It turned out that production of neuropeptide Y increased in the parabrachial nucleus when the animals were faced with something that could literally mean life or death. Betley’s findings could mean that someday, a drug that signals neurons to produce more NPY could be a viable and safe alternative to painkillers such as opioids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This mechanism is an efficient and tunable system that enables urgent needs to shift brain state away from pain and towards other states that promote &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:14;pos:1" href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/math/a29653543/math-zombie-apocalypse/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:survival;cpos:14;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;survival&lt;/a&gt;,” he &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:15;pos:1;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74968X1596630&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41586-025-09602-x&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.popularmechanics.com%2Fscience%2Fhealth%2Fa69014450%2Fscientists-found-the-potential-off-button-for-stopping-chronic-pain%2F" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:said;cpos:15;pos:1;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;. “Future work could build from these findings to test other endogenous or pharmacological interventions that curb pain state.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 14 Oct 2025 13:12:21 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiAFBVV95cUxPc2tlQ0hZTHRDMVJLZmtEb2dpRnAyNFlRSUxoSnVWZk1xeTQ4WDJoS1VJT1Vad2dSQU5MdnNUTWRsTllFUkZ2MzBPTVdPcFVKM2t5YzI4NXBkMldBYy1rWGNqTS1TTXNWZ2s2anMyOUpvMzFheDNrRExFRGlNMklRXzVCQTJSTnFq</guid></item><item><title>新的美国新冠肺炎疫情指南使射击变得更加困难-路透社</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/new-us-covid-guidelines-add-confusion-complications-americans-seeking-shots-2025-10-14/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Reuters</author><pubDate>Tue, 14 Oct 2025 12:03:41 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMixwFBVV95cUxNenFJandGSWYwcXB1eWIyZDZKdnM2ZGZNdkxDc0Iyb1c1NGhhX0NIN1l4Sy13V2Fsb3IyUW9wOVlRSEx3NW00b0FfM09DZnRXS21saC1JekVJd01zTUtUaXd1N0h6dnFCcjh6eUNBdXZ1TVB4d1BzaWlOVlZFNEdsSmU4VmxvYVhXVHFPOWxIUjIxSWdvZjZRY2xRTWJ0M3FFWWNEckdlQlhwaDB1QVdMSFF0ZEpIOTVfSXpLbHBnTjBBSEcxUlYw</guid></item><item><title>为什么肩膀伸展感觉很好背后的科学-《华盛顿邮报》</title><link>https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/10/14/back-shoulder-stretch-relief/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="KE6AM3M2XJFRDN3UAR7HTCGKJA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;We roll our shoulders and stretch our backs because it feels relaxing, refreshing and maybe even rejuvenating.

His goldfish had died the year before. Their dog Copper had passed away a month earlier, and his mother Tricia Reagan tried to explain that the same thing happened to his half sister Sarah. But Copper had lived to 105 in dog years. Sarah Saponara was just 21.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;His mother said his sister took medication that wasn’t hers. It had dangerous stuff in it, and it made her die. Death, she explained, meant he wouldn’t see Sarah again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Two years passed before Miles and Tricia really talked about &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; she died again. It would come up randomly — at the grocery store, the park and the zoo: “Tell me how Sarah died."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;As Miles grew older, he had more questions: &lt;em&gt;Where did Sarah get the medicine? Did the doctor give it to her? Could all medicines hurt you? &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Sibling grief is real and powerful, but it's often overlooked, especially when the grieving sibling is a young child. In the age of widespread access to drugs like fentanyl, overdose deaths have become a heartbreaking reality for more families. For parents, that means facing the impossible task of helping their young kids make sense of loss far too early.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="gnt_em gnt_em_img"&gt;&lt;img class="gnt_em_img_i" fetchpriority="high" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/10/13/USAT/86677445007-img-6643-copy-2.jpeg?width=960&amp;amp;height=958&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp" decoding="async" alt="Sarah Saponara was 21 when she died of overdose after taking a counterfeit Percocet laced with fentanyl.

She started seeking out other drugs to capture that same feeling. At first it was weed, then ketamine and Xanax.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;She struggled with bipolar disorder and ADHD, but when she was on drugs, she felt like her brain was balanced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;By the time Sarah went to college, she didn’t have a drug of choice, but she was addicted to being in an altered state. She ended up dropping out after four semesters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;On an acid trip, she once threw herself out of a moving car on the highway. That was one of the times Tricia felt like she might lose her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Sarah’s addiction uprooted their lives. If Tricia had 100 metaphorical marbles to give to other people, she gave 96 of them to Sarah. At one point, Tricia was worried the person selling Sarah drugs would come to their house, and she sent Liliana, her then-13-year-old middle child, to go live with an uncle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The panic attacks, anxiety and anger hit Liliana in waves: &lt;em&gt;How could Sarah afford drugs, but not food? Why did she keep using? &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;It took years for her to truly understand the ways addiction had taken control of Sarah’s actions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“It was really heartbreaking to have to experience Sarah be so dismissive,” Liliana, now 18, says, “There was a lot of anger when she died.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Though they didn’t know the name for it at the time, they were experiencing anticipatory grief — the process of grieving a future loss, which can involve feelings of anxiety, sadness and anger. With overdose-specific loss, those feelings are often more complicated and grouped with the stigma of losing someone to substance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“It wasn't until after she died that I could say, we went through something horrific,” Tricia says. “It was freaking terrible.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="gnt_em gnt_em_img gnt_em_img__inset"&gt;&lt;img class="gnt_em_img_i" fetchpriority="high" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/10/13/USAT/86667389007-img-3271.jpeg?crop=3024,3549,x0,y356&amp;amp;width=300&amp;amp;height=353&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp" data-gl-srcset="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/10/13/USAT/86667389007-img-3271.jpeg?crop=3024,3549,x0,y356&amp;amp;width=600&amp;amp;height=706&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp 2x" decoding="async" alt="Sarah was the oldest of three siblings.

She was with her girlfriend and their roommate. Just hours after snorting the drug, Sarah awoke to find her girlfriend unresponsive beside her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Tricia got the call in the middle of the night: They were at the hospital, and Sarah's girlfriend was dead. She stayed by her daughter’s side. During a brief break to take a conference call, Tricia left the apartment. When she returned with lunch and knocked on Sarah's roommate's door, there was no answer. She and Sarah found him dead, too. A fatal overdose from the same batch of drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Later, Sarah admitted they'd known the heroin had killed her girlfriend but had both used it again anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“I couldn't understand why she would do that,” Tricia says. “From a distance, it's clear to me that substances have a power that I do not understand…. Her brain was no longer able to process it in a rational way.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Six months later, Sarah was gone. She never forgave herself for surviving that tragedy, her mom says. She overdosed at least twice and was in the ER just three days before her death. What eventually killed her on Feb. 17, 2021, was a counterfeit Percocet, laced with fentanyl. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;In that final year of Sarah’s life, Tricia hardly slept.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Every morning, she checked Sarah’s location and social media. If too many hours went by without hearing from her, Tricia would drive by her apartment, heart racing, to check she was there. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Even though she’d imagined the ways Sarah could die thousands of times, nothing compared to the wall of grief that hit her when it actually happened. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Sarah had been the soundtrack to their lives. She played 17 instruments. At her rural conservative high school in Ashland, Virginia, she was the first openly gay member of the homecoming court and was voted class clown. When she died, it was like the music stopped. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Tricia wanted to collapse, but she had two other kids to raise. The fear was paralyzing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“One of the hardest things about parenting, when you've lost a kid to overdose, was (thinking) what role did I play in getting Sarah to where she was? And how can I make sure I don't make that same decision with my other children?" Tricia says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Liliana, seven years younger than Sarah, had memories.

It was her sister’s. Sarah had once nearly been struck by lightning, and that Christmas, Tricia got her the lamp and a bracelet with a poem that read: "Believe me when I tell you that girls like you are made of lightning — hard to forget and remembered by all."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;There are often feelings of anger, regret and guilt that come with the loss of a loved one to overdose, and it’s important to seek out overdose-specific grief resources.

It finds its own quiet places to live. In the corner of their kitchen, there’s a small space that Miles calls “Sarah’s house.” Over the years, he’s filled it with little things for her: a few photos from family trips, small toys, and, one Christmas, a tiny doll bed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“She needs a bed in her house,” he told Tricia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;She smiled and asked gently, “Do you think she sleeps there?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Miles shook his head. “No,” he said. “She’s in the stars.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you or someone you love is struggling with a substance use disorder contact the &lt;a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/find-help/helplines/national-helpline" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;SAMHSA National Helpline&lt;/a&gt; at 1-800-662-HELP (4357) for information and resources.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rachel Hale’s role covering Youth Mental Health at USA TODAY is supported by a partnership with Pivotal and Journalism Funding Partners.

  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="speakable"&gt;A Washington man appeared to be destined to develop &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/nervous-system-health/alzheimers" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/a&gt; — but against all genetic odds, he has eluded the common dementia for decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="speakable"&gt;Researchers at the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis recently published a study focusing on Doug Whitney, 76, who lives near Seattle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He has a rare inherited &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/genetics" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;genetic mutation&lt;/a&gt; in the presenilin 2 (PSEN2) gene, which virtually guarantees early-onset Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/study-reveals-why-super-agers-maintain-outstanding-memory-80s" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;STUDY REVEALS WHY ‘SUPER AGERS’ MAINTAIN ‘OUTSTANDING MEMORY’ INTO THEIR 80S&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of Whitney’s family members who inherited the gene have experienced cognitive decline starting in their early 50s or sooner, according to a WashU press release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whitney, however, shows no signs of mental decline. WashU researchers wondered if the reason for his continued cognitive health could help protect others against the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="image-ct inline"&gt; &lt;div class="info"&gt;&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Doug Whitney, Alzheimer's research participant, appeared to be destined to develop Alzheimer’s disease — but against all genetic odds, he has eluded the common dementia for decades.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;(UWash Medicine/Megan Farmer)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a study published in the journal Nature Medicine, the researchers analyzed his genetic data and brain scans, identifying "changes in genes and proteins" that could explain how he has defied the odds to remain &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/mental-health" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;mentally sharp&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also discovered that Whitney’s brain had virtually no buildup of tau, the hallmark protein that signals the onset of cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/new-mri-brain-scan-predicts-alzheimers-risk-years-before-symptoms-develop" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;NEW MRI BRAIN SCAN PREDICTS ALZHEIMER'S RISK YEARS BEFORE SYMPTOMS DEVELOP&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These extensive studies indicate a remarkable resistance to tau pathology and neurodegeneration," said senior study author Randall J. Bateman, M.D., the Charles F. and Joanne Knight Distinguished Professor of Neurology at WashU Medicine, in the press release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Urged by his cousin, Whitney first came to WashU in 2011 to participate in a study focused on families with inherited forms of Alzheimer’s, as many of his relatives had developed early-onset disease. At the time, he believed he did not have the gene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="pull-quote"&gt;&lt;p class="quote-text"&gt;"He actually was able to escape the expected course of the disease."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whitney’s mother was one of 14 children, nine of whom had the Alzheimer’s gene. Ten of them died before they were 60. Whitney’s own brother developed the disease before dying at age 55.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I was 61 at the time — well past the age where it should have onset," he told Fox News Digital during an on-camera interview. "But they tested me, and lo and behold, I did have the gene. I was amazed."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="image-ct inline"&gt; &lt;div class="info"&gt;&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In a study published in the journal Nature Medicine, the researchers analyzed Whitney's genetic data and brain scans.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;(UWash Medicine/Megan Farmer)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers were just as "confounded," Whitney recalled. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/medical-research" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;tested me&lt;/a&gt; three times to make sure that there wasn't some slip-up. But it's true. I had the gene. And now I'm 76 years old and still haven't had any symptoms."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cognitive clues&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jorge Llibre-Guerra, M.D., an assistant professor of neurology and co-first author of the study, echoed that it was a "big surprise" to learn that Whitney was a carrier of the genetic mutation — officially known as an "exceptional resilience mutation carrier."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He actually was able to escape the expected course of the disease," he said in the release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/omega-3-may-help-protect-women-from-alzheimers-disease-new-study-says" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;OMEGA-3 MAY HELP TO PROTECT WOMEN FROM ALZHEIMER’S DISEASE, NEW STUDY SAYS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, in this most recent study, the WashU researchers aimed to explore potential reasons for Whitney’s absence of Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If we are able to uncover the mechanism behind this resilience, we could try to replicate it with a targeted therapy designed to delay or prevent the onset of Alzheimer’s, leveraging the same &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/health-care" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;protective factors&lt;/a&gt; that have kept Mr. Whitney from developing this disease to benefit others," said Llibre-Guerra.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="image-ct inline"&gt; &lt;div class="info"&gt;&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Doug and Ione Whitney often work on puzzles together to help maintain mental sharpness.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;(UWash Medicine/Megan Farmer)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who have the PSEN2 mutation tend to have an "over-production" of amyloid protein, which &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/brain-health" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;builds up in the brain&lt;/a&gt; during the first stage of Alzheimer’s, according to the researchers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the second stage, as symptoms of cognitive decline begin, there is typically a buildup of tau protein in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/missing-link-alzheimers-disease-found-study-human-brain-tissue" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;'MISSING LINK' TO ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE FOUND IN STUDY OF HUMAN BRAIN TISSUE&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Whitney’s case, brain scans showed a "significant accumulation" of amyloid, but almost a complete absence of tau.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One theory for how Whitney may have escaped his genetic fate stems from his time &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/military/navy" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;in the Navy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="image-ct inline"&gt; &lt;div class="info"&gt;&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The researchers discovered that Whitney’s brain (not pictured) had virtually no buildup of tau, the hallmark protein that signals the onset of cognitive decline.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;(AP Photo/Evan Vucci, File)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the researchers analyzed Whitney’s cerebrospinal fluid, they found a "a significantly higher-than-normal level" of "heat shock" proteins, protective molecules that cells produce when they’re under stress, including &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/disasters/heat-wave" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;high heat exposure&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During his many years of working as a shipboard mechanic in the Navy, Whitney was exposed to high temperatures for extended periods of time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/dementia-risk-slashed-one-common-health-intervention-study-finds" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;DEMENTIA RISK SLASHED WITH ONE COMMON HEALTH INTERVENTION, STUDY FINDS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In the engine room of ships, the temperatures … would range from 100 to 110 degrees, for four hours at a time," he told Fox News Digital. "They concluded that possibly there was some gene or protein that could mutate and protect me genetically from the disease."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We don’t yet understand how or if heat shock proteins may be mediating the effect," Llibre-Guerra noted in the release. "However, in this case, they may be involved in preventing aggregation and misfolding of tau proteins, but we do not know for sure."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="image-ct inline"&gt; &lt;div class="info"&gt;&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"They tested me three times to make sure that there wasn't some slip-up.

This quiet mineral helps you relax, sleep better, and manage stress. Yet, experts say most people don’t get enough of it through food or lifestyle habits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The most overlooked mineral in modern life&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Low magnesium is easy to miss because its symptoms overlap with everyday tiredness or stress. Despite being vital for more than 300 chemical reactions in the body, this mineral often goes unnoticed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Magnesium-Consumer/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;National Institutes of Health (NIH)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, magnesium supports muscle and nerve function, blood pressure control, and energy production. Yet most people don’t get enough from their diet.

It also activates the part of your nervous system that helps you relax and sleep. When levels drop, people often report anxiety, muscle tension, or disturbed sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/13/6/1846" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;review published in Nutrients&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; and summarized by &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/should-you-take-magnesium-supplements" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Harvard Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; notes that magnesium deficiency can cause fatigue, headaches, and muscle cramps. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also plays a role in heart health. Low levels have been linked to high blood pressure and arrhythmia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The modern lifestyle problem&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The issue is not lack of awareness. It is how we live. Diets high in processed food, chronic stress, and excess coffee or alcohol all deplete magnesium. Even sweating during workouts or living in polluted cities increases magnesium loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Refined grains and packaged snacks, staples of urban diets, contain little magnesium because processing removes the nutrient-rich outer layer. Over time, this slow depletion adds up, especially for people with restrictive diets or gut issues like IBS or celiac disease that reduce absorption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Signs your magnesium may be low&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms of magnesium deficiency appear slowly and are easy to miss. Common signs include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Muscle cramps or twitching eyelids&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Restless sleep or frequent awakenings&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fatigue despite adequate rest&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Headaches or migraines&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tingling or numbness in hands and feet&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Unexplained anxiety or low mood&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;If these sound familiar, a blood test can help. However, magnesium levels in blood reflect only a small part of thebody’s total magnesium. Doctors usually consider symptoms and diet together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Magnesium and better sleep&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Magnesium helps the brain relax by binding to GABA receptors, the same neurotransmitters targeted by many sleep medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3703169/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;clinical study in the Journal of Research in Medical Sciences&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; found that older adults who took magnesium supplements slept better, woke up less often, and had improved melatonin levels.

Antidepressants had similar carryover effects, as did proton pump inhibitors, medications millions take for acid reflux and heartburn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The microbiome is the body's collection of beneficial bacteria. Its health relies on a diverse population of bacteria to fight disease, absorb nutrients and regulate immune and metabolic systems. It is influenced by everything from diet and lifestyle to the medications a person takes, including common prescription drugs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The new study confirmed that commonly prescribed medications, ranging from antibiotics to antidepressants, consistently reduce the &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13882945/The-microbiome-miracle-Good-bacteria-dont-just-live-gut-body-help-ward-deadly-illnesses-cancers-infections-doctors-reveal-nurture-ultimate-guide.html"&gt;diversity of gut bacteria&lt;/a&gt;, sometimes for years.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A less diverse microbiome is linked to a weaker gut barrier, chronic inflammation and a compromised immune system. This state of imbalance, known as dysbiosis, creates a state of chronic inflammation and weakened immune defense that is a recognized breeding ground &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14639877/Scientists-cancer-diet-mistake-gut-health-leukemia.html"&gt;for cancer development&lt;/a&gt;, specifically, colorectal &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-5bca6ea0-a862-11f0-b36e-c3dba671310f"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dysbiosis creates a gut environment dominated by cancer-promoting bacteria, which can trigger tumor growth by stimulating blood vessel formation, uncontrolled cell division and the evasion of cell death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption" aria-label="To enrich screen reader interactions, please activate Accessibility in Grammarly extension settings"&gt;The Estonian team's findings impact tens of millions of Americans. Annually, hundreds of millions of antibiotic prescriptions are written, while about 30 million people each take benzodiazepines, beta-blockers or SSRIs (stock)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To investigate the long-term effects of medications on gut bacteria, an Estonian study genetically analyzed stool samples from 2,509 adults. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;By revisiting 328 of them four years later with new samples and checking their prescription records, they pinpointed the effects of common drugs like acid reflux pills, antidepressants and anxiety medications. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ninety percent of 186 medications tested disrupted the gut microbiome, and for many, including antibiotics, antidepressants and proton pump inhibitors, the effects persisted for over three years after the last dose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Antibiotics have the most severe and long-lasting impact on the gut microbiome. The study found that the effects of drugs like azithromycin and penicillin remain detectable for over three years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The reduction in bacterial diversity from antibiotics never fully recovered, suggesting the damage is permanent or lasts for many years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Like antibiotics, benzodiazepines were associated with fewer species of bacteria, changing the overall composition of the gut microbiome. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The drugs' effects persisted for over three years and were cumulative, with more prescriptions leading to greater gut imbalance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Among all non-antibiotic drugs, beta-blockers were one of the top disruptors of the gut microbiome, accounting for a significant portion of the variation in people's gut bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) also caused long-term damage to the gut microbiome, reducing diversity and creating a pro-inflammatory state that can fuel cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These changes to people's microbial ecosystems persisted for years after people stopped taking the medication. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The second round of testing, though smaller, solidly proved that proton pump inhibitors and various antibiotics also have lasting impacts on the gut microbiome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A dysbiotic gut often has a ‘leaky’ barrier, allowing bacteria and their toxins to enter the bloodstream. This triggers a persistent, low-grade inflammatory state throughout the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A depleted microbiome is less effective at detoxifying harmful compounds and produces lower levels of protective molecules like butyrate, leaving the body more vulnerable to exposures or events that damage the cells’ DNA and can initiate the development of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers deduced in 2024 that changes in the gut microbiome, including the proliferation of bad bacteria, including some previously unknown strains, has been linked to &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-70702-1"&gt;between 23 and 40 percent&lt;/a&gt; of colorectal cancer cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They proved that these newly discovered bacteria can directly trigger the growth of precancerous growths in the colon. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also found that the gut microbiome can create a pre-cancerous environment by causing changes in colon cells that are crucial for the structural integrity of tissues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption" aria-label="To enrich screen reader interactions, please activate Accessibility in Grammarly extension settings"&gt;The bar graph portion of the graphic shows that beta-blockers were the top disruptor. The study used a color-coded chart (in shades of blue below) to show that most common medications are strongly linked to a major loss of gut bacterial diversity. Darker shades of blue indicated a stronger negative correlation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr. Oliver Aasmets of the University of Tartu Institute of Genomics and lead author of the latest Estonian study, said in a statement: ‘Most microbiome studies only consider current medications, but our results show that past drug use can be just as important as it is a surprisingly strong factor in explaining individual microbiome differences.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Their findings were published in the journal &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/msystems.00541-25"&gt;mSystems&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These findings apply to tens of millions of Americans. In the US, healthcare providers wrote approximately 270 million antibiotic prescriptions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Around 30 million Americans take benzodiazepines and 30 million take beta-blockers. Further, approximately 30 million Americans take SSRIs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

with MND a decade ago and uses a ventilator at night. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Mr Setters said that after the NHS decision that MND patients no longer qualified, patients were "being turned away" from their GP and directed to a pharmacy where the vaccine costs about £100.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) said doctors and

progressive, neurological disease that gradually destroys motor neurons in the brain and spinal cord.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;It is usually life-shortening and there is currently no cure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;It causes muscle weakness, and over time can lead to difficulty moving, with patients needing a ventilator to help them breathe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Describing his condition, Mr Setters said: "My breathing is compromised and I have to use overnight non-invasive ventilation to make sure sufficient carbon dioxide is extracted from my body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"Any infection, especially a serious one like Covid, could be very serious for

class="gnt_ar_b"&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The World Health Organization sounded the alarm Monday about a &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/13-10-2025-who-warns-of-widespread-resistance-to-common-antibiotics-worldwide" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;growing threat of drug-resistant bacteria&lt;/a&gt; around the globe that could undermine life-saving treatments, an issue Wayne State University researchers have been warning about for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;One in 6 laboratory-confirmed bacterial infections that led to common infections in people worldwide in 2023 were resistant to antibiotic treatments, according to a WHO report released Monday that reviewed data from more than 100 countries. From 2018-23, antibiotic resistance increased in more than 40% of the pathogen-antibiotic combinations monitored, rising to more than 70% in some African nations, the report found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;This growing threat to global health, including in the United States, compromises the ability of antibiotics and other drugs to treat infections and protect patients during surgeries, said WHO officials, who called the growing resistance to antibiotics "widespread, increasing and unevenly distributed."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"Antimicrobial resistance is outpacing advances in modern medicine, threatening the health of families worldwide,” WHO Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a Monday statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="gnt_em gnt_em_img"&gt;&lt;img class="gnt_em_img_i" fetchpriority="high" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/-mm-/46ffa7acfb1aa06c1b12a1e01effc5ff0fe17641/c=0-142-2453-1522/local/-/media/2016/05/27/DetroitNews/B99399644Z.1_20160527070610_000_G37V7K45.2-0.jpg?width=660&amp;amp;height=372&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp" data-gl-srcset="/gcdn/-mm-/46ffa7acfb1aa06c1b12a1e01effc5ff0fe17641/c=0-142-2453-1522/local/-/media/2016/05/27/DetroitNews/B99399644Z.1_20160527070610_000_G37V7K45.2-0.jpg?width=1320&amp;amp;height=744&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp 2x" decoding="async" alt="This 2006 colorized image from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows a strain of E. coli bacteria.

The reported number of clinical cases of Candida auris — a type of yeast that is resistant to antifungal medications and can spread in health care facilities — increased almost fivefold from 2019 to 2022, the CDC found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"We are so interconnected, and organisms spread very easily," Michigan Chief Medical Executive Natasha Bagdasarian told The Detroit News on Monday. "There are different patterns depending on place, but the (drug-resistant bacteria) are really everywhere. What’s happening on the other side of the globe really impacts us here."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;More than 2.8 million antimicrobial-resistant infections occur each year in the United States, according to the CDC, which added that its &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/antimicrobial-resistance/media/pdfs/2019-ar-threats-report-508.pdf" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;2019 report&lt;/a&gt; found that more than 35,000 people die as a result. Antimicrobial-resistant infections were associated with nearly 5 million deaths worldwide in 2019, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2821%2902724-0/fulltext" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;report released in The Lancet medical journal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Wayne State researchers have been studying the impacts of drug-resistant bacteria for years, after drug-resistant bacteria were found among Detroit patients, said Dr. Teena Chopra, an assistant dean in the Wayne State School of Medicine, where she is an infectious diseases expert. She and other Wayne State experts have been stressing it is critical to stop the spread of the drug-resistant bacteria, especially in Detroit and southeast Michigan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"It's been getting worse for years now," Chopra said Monday. "Drug resistance is here ... and, given the population of Detroit who are on antibiotics, it's one of the biggest problems."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Detroit is one of America's most impoverished big cities, with a majority Black population that has more chronic health conditions. One of the first reported outbreaks of drug-resistant bacteria occurred in Detroit in the early 1980s, involving intravenous drug users and other patients with medical conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Ghebreyesus warned that doctors around the globe need to use antibiotics responsibly, since an overreliance on antibiotics to treat a variety of ailments has helped lead to the crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"Our future also depends on strengthening systems to prevent, diagnose and treat infections and on innovating with next-generation antibiotics and rapid point-of-care molecular tests," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;Impacts of drug-resistant bacteria&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Detroiters have higher percentages of obesity, diabetes and blood pressure, Chopra said. These conditions require a person to be on antibiotics to treat them, she said. If the antibiotics aren't as effective, people could die of the diseases, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;People with other infections, such as those of the bloodstream, urinary tract and gastrointestinal tract, are also at risk of being exposed to drug-resistant bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;In its report, the WHO &lt;a&gt;examined worldwide resistance&lt;/a&gt; to 22 antibiotics used to treat common infections. From 2018 to 2023, antibiotic resistance increased an annual average of 5% to 15% in the monitored antibiotics, the report found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The WHO report also looked at eight common bacterial pathogens worldwide, including E. coli and K. pneumoniae, which can lead to severe bloodstream infections that frequently result in sepsis, organ failure and death. The report found that 40% of E. coli infections and 55% of K. pneumoniae infections globally are now resistant to third-generation cephalosporins or a form of antibiotics that includes penicillins, which are the first-choice treatment for these infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The CDC said last month that infections of a type of drug-resistant bacteria called NDM-producing carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2025/2025-cdc-report-finds-sharp-rise-in-dangerous-drug-resistant-bacteria.html" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;have surged more than 460%&lt;/a&gt; in the United States between 2019 and 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The estimated U.S. cost to treat infections caused by six antimicrobial-resistant germs frequently found in health care is more than $4.6 billion annually, according to a CDC study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Across the world, the WHO report estimated that antibiotic resistance is highest in the South-East Asian and Eastern Mediterranean regions, where 1 in 3 reported infections was resistant. The South-East Asian region covers a quarter of the globe's population, while the Eastern Mediterranean area covers countries such as Afghanistan, Egypt, Tunisia and Pakistan, or about 10% of the world's population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;In the African region, 1 in 5 infections was resistant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;Causes of drug-resistant bacteria&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The increased use and misuse of antibiotics or antimicrobials, along with other stressors, such as pollution, create conditions for microorganisms to develop resistance and bacteria in water, soil and air can become resistant to common antibiotics following contact with resistant microorganisms, the WHO report said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"As soon as antibiotics started, bacteria developed to be able to resist them," Michigan's Bagdasarian said. "Now multiple different classes of bacteria can resist them."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The exposure to the bacteria can occur through contact with polluted waters, contaminated food, the inhalation of fungal spores, and other pathways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="gnt_em gnt_em_img"&gt;&lt;img class="gnt_em_img_i" fetchpriority="high" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/presto/2020/12/15/PDTN/b3dc3b83-4623-4c93-a1a4-0fd7d71a06a4-Teena_Chopra_MD_2020_hori.jpg?width=660&amp;amp;height=440&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp" data-gl-srcset="/gcdn/presto/2020/12/15/PDTN/b3dc3b83-4623-4c93-a1a4-0fd7d71a06a4-Teena_Chopra_MD_2020_hori.jpg?width=1320&amp;amp;height=880&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp 2x" decoding="async" alt="Drug-resistant infections have been a problem that has worsened over the decades, said Dr. Teena Chopra, an infectious diseases expert at Wayne State University in Detroit.

People who lack access to doctors are more likely not to seek treatment, which allows the bacteria to become a more serious problem and potentially spread, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;An outbreak of community-associated methicillin-resistant S. aureus, or a drug-resistant bacterium, was reported as early as 1982 in Detroit, where more than half of the patients were intravenous drug users, and the other half had medical conditions that also put them at risk, according to a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5314345/" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;paper by the Infectious Disease Clinics of North America&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The proportion of community-acquired staphylococcal infections resistant to methicillin rose from 3% in March 1980 to 38% in September 1981 among 165 patients seen at Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit, according to a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7114629/" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;1982 paper&lt;/a&gt; published in the Annals of Internal Medicine. "Drug abuse, serious underlying illness, previous antimicrobial therapy, and previous hospitalization were all associated with the development of this infection," according to the paper's abstract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Other strains of drug-resistant bacterium were also discovered during this outbreak, according to a paper in the National Library of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;What can be done&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Although the number of countries reporting bacteria-resistance issues has ballooned fourfold to 104 countries since 2016, almost half of the countries did not report data in 2023, the WHO said. And it warned that about half of the reporting countries still lacked the systems "to generate reliable data."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Generating more reliable data, especially in underserved areas, by 2030 can help inform treatments and policies to fight this public health threat, according to the WHO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;For patients, Chopra said, only use antibiotics when prescribed by health care professionals and take all of the prescribed antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;But she also pointed to sweeping changes she believes could help slow the rise of the bacteria. Legislation requiring scientists to check for and report the bacteria, worldwide standards on the use of antibiotics for livestock and more federal funding for research to treat the infections would help, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Investments in and creating incentives for the creation of novel antibiotics that bacteria haven't yet formed a resistance to is another solution, Chopra and Bagdasarian said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Another solution is antibiotic stewardship, which is already common in most U.S. hospitals, Bagdasarian said. This is a program in which doctors and pharmacists learn the appropriate use of antibiotics to prevent resistance, improve patient outcomes, and preserve antibiotic effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;For those suffering from an infection or showing symptoms, such as fever, a headache or fatigue, Chopra suggested seeing a primary care physician as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"The faster we see it, the faster we can treat it," she said. "Any delays in detection could make it harder to treat and cause it to spread."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;But this time of year, especially, it's important to make sure patients are being treated for the right condition, Bagdasarian said. Viral infections can't be treated by antibiotics, and using antibiotics to treat respiratory infections will lead to overuse, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"We want to avoid a future where we have bacterial infections that we can’t treat," Bagdasarian said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;em&gt;satwood@detroitnews.com&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Detroit News</author><pubDate>Tue, 14 Oct 2025 03:01:30 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi9wFBVV95cUxPclFfRUZZU1c3UHB2Mk85UVZCWURZUkFVaWpMUkp2U2N3NnJzMUZ6UDlNb0dfd2FKRlRrbDFDQktBRDZpR2ZRcVhYUXMyVWFPVnlSVHI4dXVKTFRBRkVySi1rWTBKZ2lmTm9oR0hhU05MZHEtbUhuRnFmaDBqajVrS2V4UWw2bm9KUzhZeDRDUThMTk9rQmxtcEw1SHRSczVuNmFtaVV0MGVydXFJSVBSYUtlUTNOSnNJNkc1YVQ3U2tPcm9aYlg0bmJTOW54ZEg4dDJKYzVoZk5XckROY1RXM2tMSy1xbmlwMTVqSTBVYnZpTUZWMG1B</guid></item><item><title>研究显示，天然甜味剂促进脱发的常见治疗方法- ScienceAlert</title><link>https://www.sciencealert.com/natural-sweetener-boosts-a-common-treatment-for-hair-loss-study-reveals</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;A leading treatment for &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_hair_loss"&gt;androgenetic alopecia&lt;/a&gt; (AGA) – the classic pattern hair loss – could be made more effective with the clever addition of the natural sweetener stevioside, derived from the stevia plant (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stevia_rebaudiana"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stevia rebaudiana&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/drugs/18238-minoxidil-topical-solution-or-foam"&gt;Minoxidil&lt;/a&gt; is a popular treatment for AGA that is rubbed into the scalp: it works by revitalizing hair follicles with increased blood flow, but not much of it gets absorbed into the skin. Various forms of &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2023.126013"&gt;microneedle&lt;/a&gt; patches have been tested to improve penetration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a new study, researchers from China and Australia combined stevioside with microneedle patches, primarily because stevioside helps minoxidil dissolve much better in water. Using this method, much more minoxidil should get under the skin to the hair follicles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/decades-of-studies-link-suicide-risk-with-common-hair-loss-treatment"&gt;Decades of Studies Link Suicide Risk With Common Hair Loss Treatment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The approach was tested in mice that had been genetically engineered to lose hair, and the results were promising. Much more of the minoxidil made it into the skin, and more hair grew back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is a significant increase in hair follicle transition to the growth phase, which resulted in 67.5 percent coverage of the treatment area by day 35," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/adhm.202503575"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers in their paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Collectively, the results highlight the potential of the stevioside microneedle delivery system for the treatment of AGA."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_177065" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-177065" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/MouseResults.jpg" alt="Mice baldness" class="wp-image-177065 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/MouseResults.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/MouseResults-512x415.jpg 512w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/MouseResults-600x486.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-177065" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The new treatment significantly improved hair growth in mice. (Zhang et al., &lt;em&gt;Adv. Healthc. Mater.&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;For mice treated with a standard minoxidil solution, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/surprise-hair-loss-breakthrough-a-sugar-gel-sparks-robust-regrowth"&gt;hair grew back&lt;/a&gt; in just 25.7 percent of the coverage area by day 35, which is a significant improvement to minoxidil on its own. Hair growth started around a week earlier, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As promising as these results are, they're for mouse hair and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-hair-loss-drug-approved-restores-80-of-hair-loss-in-some-alopecia-patients"&gt;not human hair&lt;/a&gt;. The researchers are still experimenting with the microneedle delivery system and the minoxidil mix to find the best method of delivery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The benefits and drawbacks of various technical methods, such as metal or soluble microneedles and sustained-release systems, should be evaluated in conjunction with specific clinical scenarios," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/adhm.202503575"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further testing will be required in larger animal studies before human  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/clinical-trials" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73032" data-postid="177062" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; can get underway, and only at that point can scientists assess how these microneedle patches might work on people – while any side effects or other complications can also be weighed up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long-term viability also needs to be assessed. Current minoxidil treatments need to be applied &lt;a href="https://drhair.co.uk/blog/how-often-should-i-apply-minoxidil/"&gt;at least once a day&lt;/a&gt;, and while microneedle delivery might change that, it needs to be suitable for regular applications.&lt;br&gt;

"Using stevioside to enhance minoxidil delivery represents a promising step toward more effective and natural treatments for hair loss, potentially benefiting millions worldwide," &lt;a href="https://newsroom.wiley.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2025/Can-a-Stevia-derived-sweetener-improve-hair-loss-treatment/default.aspx"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; pharmacologist Lifeng Kang, from the University of Sydney in Australia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/adhm.202503575"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Advanced Healthcare Materials&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

But based on the records gathered, the WHO estimates one in three bacterial infections in south-east Asia and the eastern Mediterranean were resistant to antibiotics in 2023, and one in five in Africa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) arises when pathogens evolve to withstand the drugs used to kill them. In 2021, 7.7 million people globally died from bacterial infections. Drug resistance contributed to 4.71 million of the deaths, with 1.14 million directly attributed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The report raises serious concerns about gram-negative bacteria – those protected by an outer shell – such as &lt;em&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Klebsiella pneumoniae&lt;/em&gt;, which cause some of the most severe bacterial infections that often lead to sepsis, organ failure and death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Hutin said 40% of &lt;em&gt;E&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; coli&lt;/em&gt; and more than 55% of &lt;em&gt;K&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; pneumoniae&lt;/em&gt; are resistant to third-generation cephalosporins, the first choice treatment for such infections. In the WHO African region, resistance often exceeds 70%, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Resistance to critical second-choice antibiotics, particularly carbapenems and fluoroquinolones, was also rising among key gram-negative bacteria such as &lt;em&gt;Acinetobacter&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;K&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; pneumoniae&lt;/em&gt; and salmonella, the report found. “These antibiotics are critical for treating severe infections and their growing ineffectiveness is narrowing the treatment options,” Hutin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Dr Manica Balasegaram at the Global Antibiotic Research and Development Partnership said the report added to evidence that drug-resistant infections had reached “a critical tipping point”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“The most difficult-to-treat gram-negative infections are now beginning to outpace antibiotic development, either because the right antibiotics are not reaching the people who need them, or because they are not being developed in the first place,” he said. “As a result, the number of AMR deaths is &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2824%2901867-1/fulltext" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;now expected to rise sharply&lt;/a&gt;, increasing by 70% by 2050.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“It’s not enough to develop new antibiotics, they have to be the right ones, those that target infections that have the greatest public health impact. We are failing to replace the antibiotics that are being lost to resistance, and this latest WHO report shows that the consequences of that are now finally beginning to be felt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Until now, the AMR narrative has focused rightfully on the overuse of antibiotics, but this isn’t enough. To avoid the tipping point, we must now also focus efforts on accelerating innovation and increasing their appropriate use.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Prof Sanjib Bhakta, who works on drugs to tackle AMR at University College London, said the WHO report revealed “an alarming escalation in resistance”, particularly among gram-negative bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;He said combating AMR required “tailored global action” from strengthening surveillance and diagnostics to ensuring equitable access to narrow-spectrum antibiotics. Preventing infections was also important through cleaner water, better sanitation and hygiene and vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Crucially, renewed investment is needed to support interdisciplinary, blue-sky research aimed at discovering novel therapeutic interventions against drug-resistant bacteria,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="d59ac631-67a1-41f5-8764-9ab5f26a9d65" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.GuideAtomBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="GuideAtomWrapper" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props="{&amp;quot;id&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ea05a110-2f0f-41ea-ba0a-8d9189dbddb7&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Contact us about this story&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;html&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Secure Messaging in the Guardian app&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

While 1.13million Americans are living with HIV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A preacher talks to drug users in Philadelphia in 2023 as good Samaritans distribute food and warm clothing for those affected by the drug epidemic and homelessness (file image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The US drug epidemic has slowed in recent months, however, amid a crackdown on drug trafficking by the Trump administration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Overdose fatalities have dropped nearly 24 percent over the 12 months to April 2025, the latest available, with an estimated 76,516 fatalities, compared to an estimated 101,363 fatalities over the previous year-long period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is not clear whether bluetoothing is already taking place in the US, but some experts have warned that addicts may be put off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They say that one reason the practice is not more widespread is that it tends to deliver users with a diminished high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It often is not clear how much of a high those who infuse themselves with another drug users blood receive, with this potentially being no different to a placebo effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Catharine Cook, the executive director of Harm Reduction International, a nonprofit based in the UK, told the &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/08/world/asia/bluetoothing-drug-blood-sharing.html"&gt;New York Times:&lt;/a&gt; 'It's the perfect way of spreading HIV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'&lt;span&gt;It’s a wake-up call for health systems and governments, the speed with which you can end up with a massive spike of infection because of the efficiency of transmission.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In Fiji, in 2014 the country had fewer than 500 people living with HIV, but by 2024 this number had surged to approximately 5,900.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the same year, the Pacific island nation recorded 1,583 new cases of HIV, equivalent to a 13-fold increase on its usual five-year average. About half of all new infected patients said they had been sharing needles.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above shows drug overdose deaths by year in the US&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above shows the percent change in drug overdose deaths from April 2024 to April 2025&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Kalesi Volatabu, executive director of the non-profit Drug Free Fiji, described to the &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0m42dwvlk8o"&gt;BBC &lt;/a&gt;the moment that she witnessed the practice firsthand.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I saw the needle with the blood, it was right there in front of me,' she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This young woman, she'd already had the shot and she's taking out the blood, and then you've got other girls, other adults, already lining up to be hit with this thing.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She added: 'It's not just needles they're sharing, they're sharing the blood.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Estimates suggest about 33.5 percent of drug users in the US share needles, which also poses a risk of transmitting HIV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts warn that the virus, alongside other diseases such as hepatitis, can get onto the needle if it is used by an infected person, and then be transferred to another individual who also uses the same needle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In general, HIV rates in the US have fallen since 2017. However, due to disruptions in care in 2020 from the Covid pandemic, which means HIV cases were likely missed, new diagnoses have been slightly increased. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the CDC, in the US and its associated territories, there were 39,201 new HIV diagnoses in 2023, the latest data available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is an increase from the 37,721 new cases in 2022. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Of the 2023 cases, the newest CDC report on HIV shows 518 diagnoses were associated with intravenous drug use. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts emphasize that HIV is no longer a death sentence, saying that there are drugs available that can slow the virus' replication and allow someone infected to live a full and normal life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The practice of bluetoothing was first recorded in Tanzania around 2010, where it quickly spread from the country's inner city to the suburbs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In Zanzibar, a tourism haven in the nation where the practice took hold, researchers found HIV rates were up to 30 times higher than those recorded in the mainland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It has also been recorded in Lesotho, a small African nation bordering South Africa, and Pakistan, where people have sold half-used blood-infused syringes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Tue, 14 Oct 2025 00:27:05 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinAFBVV95cUxPZjdTWGFEZl9iRDlfUlFMQ1dEY2t4Qkw5VEREME52VzZocFlxYXZyWFJpYS1KU19iZDV6SGptUkR6aVQxUjNPQm01dDBjWjhwd01ZdlhPUFhOMUxQT3g2MVZXRTlYMFR3UEpFM1BLamQ2NDBFa1NySXdObEppSkc0dExDb2pQVm5jRmM5VlM4V3Z0MTc4MWdBT1hjQzLSAaIBQVVfeXFMT2ItYXB6YUtORVpkeThycUg3MTRiYS1US3ZjVkY5elF2TkozMmdCYmt6cE9seWJmZTNMOVJkY0dqcm52MzRYMjJENUtJRHhza05HekkxelplVFZRQzU2UVk1R0VfbWVrRjJUYURaYU43MWVDYkhPd0c1TEJmNHRNb2ZmTnZsa3hCUzZZZlA3THRpUENXelJSQ054MnotNWhBN2F3</guid></item><item><title>新的1天手术在同一手术中切除癌症并重建乳房- ABC新闻-突发新闻、最新新闻和视频</title><link>https://abcnews.go.com/US/new-1-day-surgery-removes-cancer-reconstructs-breast/story?id=126492962</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="xvlfx ZRifP TKoO eaKKC EcdEg bOdfO qXhdi NFNeu UyHES " data-testid="prism-article-body"&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao MvWXB TjIXL aGjvy ebVHC "&gt;When the results of her routine mammogram came back with a diagnosis of stage 0 DCIS breast cancer in multiple areas of her right breast, Athaliah McPherson, a hairstylist and mom of one, said she wasn’t surprised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"I knew something was off," McPherson told ABC News.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;McPherson’s diagnosis was not life-threatening in and of itself, but left unchecked, it might have developed into something more serious. Typically, doctors treat DCIS with partial or full breast removal surgery, sometimes followed by radiation or hormone therapy to lower future risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;McPherson was referred to the Montefiore Cancer Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;There, her team -- led by Dr. Pedro Piccinini, a plastic and reconstructive surgeon, and Dr. Maureen McEvoy, a breast surgical oncologist -- recommended McPherson undergo a new procedure called total breast reconstruction, which combines mastectomy (breast removal) and reconstruction in a single surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;McPherson recalled that her aunt had been diagnosed with the same type of breast cancer and faced multiple complications after her mastectomy. She was open to an alternative, and six months after her diagnosis, McPherson decided total breast reconstruction was a “no-brainer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Combining the two procedures allows for the removal of breast tissue and rebuilding the breast immediately, instead of doing two separate operations. The surgeon places the breast implants between the chest muscles to provide added stability, helping reduce the risk of distortion, movement, infection and fluid buildup. By avoiding the need to cut through or lift muscle, it can also lessen pain, speed recovery, and create a more natural breast shape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="oLzSq QrHMO fnRUo pvsTF EhJPu vPlOC zNYgW OsTsW RMeqy daRVX ISNQ sKyCY eRftA acPPc MENS nFwaT MCnQE mEeeY SmBjI xegrY rPLsU iulOd NIuqO zzscu lzDCc aHUBM IEgzD OjMNy eQqcx SVqKB GQmdz jaoD VWDdR ONJdw vrZxD OnRTz gbbfF roDbV GPGwb oMlSS gfNzt oJhud eXZcf zhVlX "&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="InlineImage GpQCA lZur asrEW " data-testid="prism-inline-image"&gt;&lt;figure class="kzIjN GNmeK pYrtp dSqFO " data-testid="prism-figure"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="nMMea bNYiy Mjgpa dGwha DDmxa jgKNG RGHCC aBIU PriDW lZur " data-testid="prism-caption"&gt;&lt;p class="HXPPJ barbu yKsXL IzgMt VcHIt uhSzI YGNMU cRAsZ xqMcl QtRul "&gt;&lt;span class="hsDdd OOSI GpQCA lZur VlFaz " data-testid="prism-truncate"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="gtOSm FbbUW tUtYa vOCwz EQwFq yCufu eEak Qmvg nyTIa SRXVc vzLa jgBfc WXDas CiUCW kqbG zrdEG txGfn ygKVe BbezD UOtxr CVfpq xijV soGRS XgdC sEIlf daWqJ "&gt;Medical personnel use a mammogram to examine a woman's breast for breast cancer.

That delay often heightens the emotional distress of a breast cancer treatment while the patient waits to regain her breast shape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Compared to traditional mastectomy, the immediate impact of total breast reconstruction is, as Piccinini told ABC News, "better results, lower complication rates, shorter hospital stays and reduced overall costs." He added that the procedure is covered by most insurance plans, making it more accessible to patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;“The first day after surgery, I was up and walking,” McPherson said. “I was back to work within six weeks.” She credits her quick recovery to the ease of the surgery, and active lifestyle, and the care she received at Montefiore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;“I am 100% happy with my results,” McPherson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The two-for-one approach represents a notable shift in breast cancer surgery, said Piccinini. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Improving a patient’s physical appearance after breast cancer treatment can have a powerful ripple effect. Patients often become “more outgoing, experience improved relationships, and develop a stronger self-image,” Piccinini explained. These benefits can contribute to better health outcomes and, in some cases, longer survival, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;McPherson agreed. “Do something that will help you feel better, make you look better, and help you have the will to live,” she advised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Piccinini and his team are presenting their technique to other oncologists at national conferences throughout the country, aiming, he said, to spread the word and advance the standard of care for all breast cancer patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;As for McPherson, she is currently in remission. Her advice to other women: “Do not skip your yearly mammogram.” And if you do get a diagnosis, explore all your options for treatment and recovery, she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC eTIW sUzSN "&gt;&lt;em class=" "&gt;Cyrus Mowdawalla, MD, is a resident physician in Internal Medicine from Montefiore Medical Center and a contributing correspondent of the ABC News Medical Unit.  &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>ABC News - Breaking News, Latest News and Videos</author><pubDate>Tue, 14 Oct 2025 00:01:34 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMingFBVV95cUxQbzYxQ3NCZ1lEaW5mZk8zT0IteUx1R2VfU3VwbC02MDlpYTh1ckdBaGFNTzlJazNBWUtYTUl1c19yS2NlZXNteUdBbDQ4cGV4SXV6Z0VSTWN5aDVVTkNUTWlPV2RiMDJmYk5TSHFrbnNjOVFZRGpyanc4c3lacTVNRFVnSGxvbTFLdFhiN05yN2FJVWdNdWFOV0kxdDhIZ9IBowFBVV95cUxQQVZpN2hJWkVPbVhLNzdLMy13UW1UU0dPbkQwNGxYc0t4NXM4US1DTU50UzZDU2dOcEx3Q3JZWC1sQlhjdmhFR2NSSkpubzdfMHRqM09xc0k4SGlaZkxROXprQXpWaW8xdTlVMnNfaGtDcmk3SmVabGFWckZJOVpHbXdqdXVNWnhyT2pNS3dHQnN5dDhfM0JLZmlDcy05bU9LblE4</guid></item><item><title>认识黑色霉菌TRUTHERS有毒物质在庄园中滋生- UnHerd</title><link>https://unherd.com/2025/10/meet-the-black-mould-truthers/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="pianocontentwrapper"&gt;
                                                            &lt;p&gt;A strange affliction is spreading around the internet, infecting celebrities, influencers and civilians alike. Its sufferers are spurned by the medical establishment, scoffed at by disbelievers, spurred into “truther” evangelism and struck down by a torrent of mysterious symptoms for which there is no cure. Sound familiar? No, it’s not long Covid, nor Lyme disease, nor even chronic fatigue syndrome. It’s mould.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="midcontent1" class="unherd_ad_switch"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever since a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11795499/#:~:text=Abstract,these%20internal%20and%20external%20reviews." target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;now-retracted study&lt;/a&gt; by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention linked black mould to infant pulmonary haemorrhage in the Nineties, mould mania has been raging. On TikTok, #toxicmoldillness posts number in the hundreds of millions of views. Reddit is a trove of evacuation diaries: families forced to abandon their mouldy homes, possessions and pets. GoFundMe hosts pages begging us to “Save the Tyler Family from their Toxic Mould Nightmare!” and “Help Kimberly Heal: A Young Woman’s Fight Against Toxic Mould”. And while sufferers appear to span the political spectrum, the crusade has been taken up with particular zeal by the online Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chronic inflammatory response syndrome, or CIRS, is having a moment. While the condition is not recognised by most medical bodies, true believers report a cascade of symptoms resulting from “mould toxicity” which are oddly evocative of long Covid: neurological impairment, fatigue, respiratory woes, hormonal upset, and so on. Of course, science does accept the pathology of mould: many of us will remember the death of the toddler Awaab Ishak in Rochdale, eight days after his second birthday. Awaab had grown up in a council house filled with black mould, which sent him into respiratory arrest. In the dank houses of rainy England, mould is a real and grave concern. But what mould does not do, as far as the science shows us, is cause CIRS. The &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/damp-and-mould-understanding-and-addressing-the-health-risks-for-rented-housing-providers/understanding-and-addressing-the-health-risks-of-damp-and-mould-in-the-home--2" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;British government’s guidance&lt;/a&gt; on mould exposure published in the wake of Awaab’s death lists potentially fatal respiratory illness, irritation or rashes on the eyes and skin — but that is it. Under the heading “mental health effects”, it acknowledges that poor mental health may result from mould but does not concede any psychoactive or neurological effects, rather pointing to “unpleasant living conditions”, “frustration” and “social isolation” as causes. The advice is conservative but clear: the mammoth list of CIRS symptoms are simply not attributable to mould. Likewise the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology offers a robust breakdown of CIRS’s plausibility, &lt;a href="https://www.aaaai.org/tools-for-the-public/conditions-library/allergies/toxic-mold?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;noting&lt;/a&gt; that companies were offering urine-testing kits which were “problematic” and “lacked standardisation”. These are not disinterested parties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tell that to the internet. Or to the actress &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CsFJnJPvaj8/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Tori Spelling&lt;/a&gt;, who flits in and out of urgent care with children in tow in a “continual spiral of sickness” which she blames on repeated “mould infections”. Or to Brandi Glanville of &lt;em&gt;Real Housewives&lt;/em&gt; infamy, whose bizarre, disfiguring health battle has involved a parasite “&lt;a href="https://www.aol.com/brandi-glanville-spent-70k-treating-175913330.html?guccounter=1&amp;amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAKa7poqEyrP275T4ehrvotGGUlXvVV4N1mc2IGy8jsIBvnIFr_SFQZNDbTuvPp1oX09NrsYLfI0rJIzZtOv5KkK5P7t8RufybUjmdZNpqVia4wR5EdLkxTKIk6SSZtYqL99zWprQujrY-VFHkEkqQ-qtQ4zASut-Hq13TQNC0aRK" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;moving in her face&lt;/a&gt;” (a more likely explanation, of course, would be a botched plastic surgery job). In one Instagram video, she &lt;a href="https://www.tvinsider.com/1173899/brandi-glanville-health-update-lymphatic-drainage-treatment-face/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;shakes uncontrollably&lt;/a&gt; while undergoing Hollywood-approved lymphatic drainage; in the caption she blames “black mold poisoning from a toxic house we lived in”. Mould mania has even made it to the American Cabinet: RFK Jr., the pseudoscience-swilling health secretary, has linked it to &lt;a href="https://fortune.com/well/article/rfk-jr-environmental-toxins-autism/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;autism&lt;/a&gt; (a typically nuance-crushing claim &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32819265/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;not backed by evidence&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then there’s Chris Williamson, the ex-&lt;em&gt;Love Island&lt;/em&gt; contestant turned life-coaching podcaster who this month released an incredibly unsettling vlog entitled “&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IU4D_kjty2k"&gt;It’s Time to Talk About My Health&lt;/a&gt;”. At the time of writing, the video had 1.2 million views. In it, Williamson, a big name in the aspirational masculinity market, describes a time of acute personal crisis: brain fog, loss of libido, emotional numbness and depression. The culprit? “My body was filled with environmental mould.” He lives in hotel rooms, paranoid about fungus lying in wait at home. He endures byzantine testing rituals — waking in the night to breathe into tubes, avoiding light, timing fluids to the ounce — then undergoes increasingly baroque homeopathic procedures because, as one white coat testifies, “traditional allopathic medicine hasn’t caught up”. The vlog culminates in Williamson undergoing a procedure to “clean his blood” in Mexico, completing the cycle from masculine rationalist to raving medieval bloodletter, undone by invisible devils in the body and desperate for physical catharsis. His mouldy manifesto seems to be the final form of the manosphere’s “biohacking” obsession: pain, purification, Sisyphean struggle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="midcontent2" class="unherd_ad_switch"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the archetypal mould truther is Jordan Peterson, coincidentally a guest on Williamson’s podcast and a star of that same male self-improvement scene. In August, the Canadian psychologist’s daughter, Mikhaila Peterson, announced that her father was “taking time off of everything” due to CIRS, having recently been “exposed to a particularly mouldy environment” while cleaning out his late father’s house. Peterson was said to have been “near death”, spending “almost a month in the ICU”; the mould was to blame for “cancelled shows, cancelled events, sporadic appearance of being run down and general weepiness”. Peterson had been battling CIRS since 2017, she said. But the case was not straightforward; it was not even the first time Mikhaila was announcing that her father had been close to death. In 2020 she told the world how he’d been debilitated by a separate struggle, this time with benzodiazepine withdrawal. Five years later, an invisible enemy had clawed him back to despair. Peterson’s case is murky and unusual — but Mikhaila’s account did not acknowledge these complicating factors: “The fact that doctors don’t generally recognise that mould exposure in indoor air is causing chronic health issues is insane,” she wrote. Fungus was also the key factor in “our food sensitivities and inability to tolerate anything other than meat” (she and her father both live on an all-meat diet).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not anyone’s place to argue with someone who says they are ill; many of those in the “mouldie” community (self-christened, may I add) are likely to be genuinely unwell, just not in the way they think. In our anti-scientific climate, advice from bodies such as the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mold-health/about/index.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt; is being degraded by chronic and poisonous scepticism. CIRS did not spring from nowhere: it thrived in the cracks of the public square over years of populist feeling. What CIRS really represents is paranoia, distrust, and a fatal lack of understanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The diagnosis is, by no coincidence, also a metaphor for the Peterson mythos. He himself is the archetypal internet patriarch — a proponent of self-discipline, wary of pollution both moral and cultural, laid low by spores in the walls. His family sees this illness as both biochemical and “spiritual” (Mikhaila’s words); it represents an establishment sickness that ignores the little guy and abandons him to splutter his last. But the entire diagnosis rests on contested laboratory markers and anecdotal recovery stories, and the interventions of practitioners who are financially incentivised to keep patients’ paranoia alive. As in all health panics, empirical weakness is rhetorical strength. If the experts deny it, that only proves the conspiracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="su-pullquote su-pullquote-align-left"&gt;“The diagnosis is a metaphor for the Peterson mythos.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frankly, the cult of CIRS has driven “mouldies” mad. Two sufferers who were interviewed for an article in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/people-afraid-of-toxic-mold.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;The Cut&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; come across as hypervigilant exiles: one, a woman from Florida, says: “My nose is like a detector of mould. I smell it in almost every house I go to.” A Maryland man says: “There’s actually thousands of us who are living in their vehicles or RVs or tents.” This life-wrecking paranoia is what CIRS is all about: not being believed, fighting an enemy you cannot see but that you insist is there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that same article, &lt;em&gt;The Cut&lt;/em&gt; describes online forums where users trade reports of “mould rage” — sudden mood swings and the surfacing of harrowing repressed memories blamed on spores in the vents. As with any contested condition, there remains a basis of scientific truth: mould can make you hallucinate. Ergot, the fungus from which LSD is derived, does so when ingested. In the Middle Ages, grain infected with this could, when baked into bread, send entire villages into delirium (the condition was known as &lt;a href="https://www.ejog.org/article/0028-2243(95)02104-Z/pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;St Anthony’s Fire&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;em&gt;Uncanny&lt;/em&gt;, the BBC’s podcast about hauntings, recently featured a case in which a young man believed that a ghost was helping him wash his hair in the shower; the resident paranormal sceptic suggested that the mildew in his flat may have triggered visions. Under real-world conditions, simply breathing in mould would not provide a sufficient dose to cause delirium: &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39162373/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;stress, anxiety, depression&lt;/a&gt;, sure, but not the neurological effects (brain fog, dementia etc) described by CIRS. For many, the link is nonetheless powerful and evocative: the spore stands in for entropy, psychic seepage. One of the internet’s favourite in-jokes is that the writer and women’s rights campaigner J.K. Rowling has been “turned evil” by black mould which appeared, in one photograph of her living room, to be growing on the walls; “her &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GreenAndPleasant/comments/1eg1p6e/jk_rowling_posts_selfie_revealing_her_mansion_is/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;TERF brain worms&lt;/a&gt; may be caused by fungal spores,” writes one snivelling Redditor. Of course, what looked to be a spreading infestation was actually just &lt;a href="https://x.com/idolomantiss/status/1820962747070263451" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;an unusual wallpaper&lt;/a&gt;; but the creeping corruption of mould is a far more compelling story than that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The allure of CIRS lies both in its metaphorical power — the idea of hidden toxicity everywhere — and its simplicity: if you can name the mould, you can kill it. The problem is that depending on quack procedures which claim to remove fungus from the blood is unmoored from science and reality and will not help these people, many of whom evidently need some sort of intervention — medical or otherwise. It was just weeks ago that the Right &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DPFhFG0jA_R/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;was ridiculing&lt;/a&gt; the snowflake nepo baby Violet Affleck for telling the UN that everyone should be wearing masks, and that politicians were stealing young people’s future by allowing the pernicious spread of long Covid. Long Covid is also the subject of a culture war, fuzzily understood and probably commonly misidentified, but compared to CIRS it at least holds water as a diagnosis. If we really do have a mould problem, it’s that “mouldies” themselves represent a creeping degradation of science and trust in establishments, the inner rot of fact-free paranoia which is yanking us back to the Dark Ages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What would you do if you discovered your name in a list of experts on sex robots despite having never studied sex robots? &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That was the situation for one rather panicked researcher who reached out to us in late September after discovering his name among several singled out in a review article for the “greatest number of published works” on sex robots. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Published in February in &lt;em&gt;Humanities and Social Sciences Communications&lt;/em&gt;, the bibliometric analysis of the field aimed “to provide a clearer understanding of the issues surrounding sex robots,” the original article stated. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id="more-133090"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The article included a list of the 10 authors who the paper claimed published the most articles on sex robot research. Of those, seven are robotics researchers who don’t study sex robots. The remaining three are a cardiologist, a prosthodontics professor and a researcher who we could not find proof exists. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researcher who contacted us was keen to get the paper, which he called “defamatory,” retracted. While we typically prefer to name sources, and credit any investigative work, we’re honoring his desire to distance himself from the paper and are therefore omitting his name — and the identities of the others named in the article — from our story so as not to increase the chances a search or AI tool will forever associate his name with “sex robots.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researcher first alerted &lt;em&gt;HHSC&lt;/em&gt; to issues with the paper in late September, according to emails we have seen. The journal, published by Springer Nature, temporarily &lt;a href="https://archive.is/BCq4H"&gt;took the article page down&lt;/a&gt; on September 26. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Given the context, access to the paper was removed as soon as we had undertaken an initial assessment,” Gino D’Oca, the chief editor of &lt;em&gt;HHSC&lt;/em&gt;, told us. In a similar move earlier this year, Springer Nature &lt;a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/07/16/springer-nature-to-retract-machine-learning-book-following-retraction-watch-coverage/"&gt;removed a link&lt;/a&gt; to a book containing nonexistent references before restoring a retracted and watermarked version days later. The publisher confirmed at the time that removal from the website is part of the retraction process. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Among the issues the researcher identified were discrepancies between the dataset, which contains a list of over 1,000 papers from journals indexed in Web of Science, and the authors’ claims. For example, the authors said &lt;em&gt;IEEE Transactions on Robotics&lt;/em&gt; had published 30 papers on sex robots. Our search of the journal yielded no results, and the researcher who contacted us said the journal appeared just once in the authors’ dataset. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researcher who contacted us had also reached out to someone who does study sex robots, who “confirmed that the paper is fake,” he said. Both researchers, and at least five others, contacted the journal directly to request the retraction, according to a document we have seen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The journal issued a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-025-06061-7"&gt;retraction notice&lt;/a&gt; on October 7, stating the analysis “employed inappropriate search terms and formulas, affecting the resulting reported data on the research field, including individual authors and journals.” The text of the original article &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-025-04430-w"&gt;has been removed&lt;/a&gt; from both the website and the PDF.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;D’Oca told us &lt;em&gt;HHSC &lt;/em&gt;is looking into other work by one of the corresponding authors, &lt;a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6900-8831"&gt;Shen Liu&lt;/a&gt;. Liu is a psychology researcher at Anhui Agricultural University in Hefei, China, who authored  &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-024-02665-7"&gt;another paper&lt;/a&gt; in the journal  purporting to use the &lt;a href="https://rec.ustc.edu.cn/share/0d874150-b039-11ee-be97-f5a41b2eeb6e"&gt;same&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/UMDR3Y"&gt;dataset&lt;/a&gt; as the now-retracted article. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Neither Liu nor co-corresponding author Na Zhang, also at Anhui, responded to our multiple requests for comment via email. The authors agreed with the retraction, according to the notice.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Other issues we spotted include a network analysis of authors that includes three “brought together by their mutual focus on robot-assisted radical cystectomy,” and others who perform nephrectomies. While these bladder and kidney surgeries are robot-assisted, they are unrelated to sex robots. The review also cites at least one work that does not exist and whose only other mention is in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-024-02665-7"&gt;another article&lt;/a&gt; by Liu. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For their analysis of journals publishing sex robot research, the authors use the term “Influential Factor (IF)” instead of “Impact Factor,” describing the term as a “paramount metric for evaluating scholarly impact.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The paper has been cited once, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science. &lt;/p&gt;

So it’s a common thing,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b42c3a" class="body-graf"&gt;Chronic constipation can &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5976340/" target="_blank"&gt;severely impact&lt;/a&gt; people’s lives and limit their physical abilities, worsening their &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11532788/#jgh370042-sec-0020" target="_blank"&gt;quality of life and work productivity&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a1d5ee" class="body-graf"&gt;“If you’re chronically constipated, you may not be able to even participate in physical activity, because you feel bloated, you’re in pain, you’re achy, it may affect your mood,” said Anderson-Haynes, who also owns 360 Girls and Women, a nutrition and health practice based in Boston.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-183804" class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How is chronic constipation treated?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-cfe66e" class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. William Chey, professor of gastroenterology at the University of Michigan and incoming president of the American College of Gastroenterology, said most studies on treating chronic constipation have focused on fiber supplements, like psyllium, and medications, like bisacodyl, senna and amitiza.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e44c9f" class="body-graf"&gt;He added American guidelines “focus pretty heavily on medical therapies for chronic constipation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e42409" class="body-graf"&gt;&lt;a href="https://gi.org/topics/constipation-and-defection-problems/" target="_blank"&gt;Traditional constipation treatments&lt;/a&gt; include increasing fiber intake through foods like prunes and other fruits and vegetables, drinking more water, and using different kinds of laxatives. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-991acc" class="body-graf"&gt;While the new guidelines include certain fiber-rich foods and fiber supplements, there’s no guidance on a “high-fiber diet” overall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1e9420" class="body-graf"&gt;“When we were building these guidelines, and looking at the literature, we were expecting a lot more evidence on a high-fiber diet, and there simply isn’t enough in constipation,” Dimidi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7c2955" class="body-graf"&gt;“There’s plenty of evidence that a high-fiber diet is very beneficial for our overall health and also for elements of gut health, such as reducing the risk of colorectal cancer,” she added. “But when it comes to constipation, specifically, we just don’t have enough evidence to say that it improves constipation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-d8156f" class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the new recommendations?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-94ace4" class="body-graf"&gt;Chey, who wasn’t involved with the new guidelines, said the recommendations “provide a valuable road map to things that [people] can try as they’re waiting to see their primary care physician.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e07c0b" class="body-graf"&gt;He added that people with more severe cases of constipation may need to see a gastroenterologist. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-5476a9" class="body-graf"&gt;The recommendations include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul id="anchor-a0beb2" class="break-above body-ul body-list-el"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fiber supplements: More than 10 grams of fiber supplements, such as psyllium, per day can improve stool frequency and consistency and aid in reducing straining. Fiber supplements should be slowly introduced and dosage gradually increased.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Probiotics: Certain strains of probiotics, including, &lt;em&gt;B. lactis&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Bacillus coagulans&lt;/em&gt; Unique IS2, may help some people with symptoms. If taking one, patients should take a supplement of their choice and follow the manufacturer’s instructions for at least four weeks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Magnesium oxide supplements: 0.5-1.5 grams daily can help with stool frequency and consistency, reduce symptoms such as bloating and abdominal pain and improve overall quality of life. Dosage should start at 0.5 grams per day and be gradually increased weekly.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Kiwis: Three daily, with or without the skin, can help improve stool frequency but not consistency.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rye bread: Six to eight slices of rye bread per day can also aid stool frequency, but not consistency. The authors noted that this amount may not be realistic for some people.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;High mineral-content water: In combination with other treatments, 0.5-1.5 liters per day of high mineral-content water may also help. One of the key minerals in high mineral-content water, magnesium, is a known laxative. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-cc9cdb" class="body-graf"&gt;The one recommendation that gives Chey pause is for probiotics. “People’s microbiomes ... vary a lot from location to location based on diet, based on genetics, based on the environment, and so it’s very hard to make any generalizable statements about the use of specific probiotics,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-488116" class="body-graf"&gt;Still, overall, he said, “I think these kinds of recommendations are going to be very helpful.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d3d2a9" class="body-graf"&gt;Dimidi said she hopes the release of the guidelines can “empower” those with chronic constipation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-25ea91" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“We’re hoping [the guidance] means that clinicians are very well-informed and can provide personalized advice to their patients that is very effective,” she said. “But also that people themselves with constipation can access now evidence-based information, feel empowered to take control of the symptoms and improve a condition that has a tremendous impact on quality of life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Mon, 13 Oct 2025 21:12:08 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirAFBVV95cUxPUTBOTnVzMlZaZ3hadHBZYWZVbzRoZnRyMC1sSVE5MDRMTU1FVk5STjhVYTNqQjlGMUJIYzNaNE1xSVRjOWdMUW1VdEYzUjlRMG56SGVhSEZCNUd3Y2VTeDFZOWp6OFRfS2JOVzFseDJoSV93UlJJOXZZckNJaUJXbkdDM2R0VHk0MnAwcmdTVGpTUFNmX1Q1ZEpJejBfRFB5NnFxX3JFSmhWRGN00gFWQVVfeXFMTTltVU5SQ2JVdDc2RUFWQlR3TE5ZMS10V0FacFcySTkxc0ZmRTZtOWtGRm1FdDVDV0ZiZXJ6UmEydGVmTWtNeFVzbXlla2tvTnR0bnI5dGc</guid></item><item><title>科学家终于发现了长期新冠肺炎最致命的症状背后的原因--男性健康</title><link>https://www.menshealth.com/health/a69020230/long-covid-brain-fog-cause-study-oct-2025/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-journey-body="standard-article" class="article-body-content article-body standard-body-content css-n3hm4j et2g3wt7"&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="0" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="0.0"&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="0.1"&gt;REMEMBER COVID?

Changes in AMPA receptor activity have been previously associated with &lt;a href="https://www.menshealth.com/health/a68998780/depression-symptoms-heart-disease-diabetes-risk/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.menshealth.com/health/a68998780/depression-symptoms-heart-disease-diabetes-risk/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="depression" data-node-id="4.1" class="body-link css-1d8p8n5 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="4.1.0"&gt;depression&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.menshealth.com/health/a60755629/this-is-what-having-schizophrenia-is-really-like/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.menshealth.com/health/a60755629/this-is-what-having-schizophrenia-is-really-like/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="schizophrenia" data-node-id="4.3" class="body-link css-1d8p8n5 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="4.3.0"&gt;schizophrenia&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and dementia.&lt;br data-node-id="4.5"&gt;&lt;br data-node-id="4.6"&gt;Since people with brain fog have trouble processing and remembering information, the researchers of the new study hypothesized that &lt;a href="https://www.menshealth.com/health/a45101133/how-long-does-covid-last/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.menshealth.com/health/a45101133/how-long-does-covid-last/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="COVID" data-node-id="4.8" class="body-link css-1d8p8n5 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="4.8.0"&gt;COVID&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; may have disrupted AMPA receptor activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="5" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;The team used a new type of PET imaging brain scans to examine the number of AMPA receptors in living human brains of 30 people with long COVID. They compared their brain scans to 80 individuals without long COVID.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="6" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Amongst people with long COVID, there was an abnormally high density of AMPA receptors. And the more AMPA receptor activity there was, the more severe people reported their cognitive impairments.&lt;br data-node-id="6.1"&gt;&lt;br data-node-id="6.2"&gt;“This is a potentially promising study that raises an interesting hypothesis about a risk factor for mild cognitive impairment ("brain fog"). The specific receptor (AMPA) seems to be upregulated in this small cohort of patients who have brain fog, and normal in healthy controls,” says &lt;a href="https://www.osfhealthcare.org/providers/deepak-nair-1464703" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.osfhealthcare.org/providers/deepak-nair-1464703" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Deepak Nair, MD" data-node-id="6.4" class="body-link css-1d8p8n5 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="6.4.0"&gt;Deepak Nair, MD&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a neurologist at OSF Healthcare in Illinois who was not involved in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="7" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Increases in AMPA activity is only one half of the story. The other half is something researchers have long suspected—that COVID infections provoke an overactive brain &lt;a href="https://www.menshealth.com/health/a38771689/immune-system-strong/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.menshealth.com/health/a38771689/immune-system-strong/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="immune response" data-node-id="7.1" class="body-link css-1d8p8n5 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="7.1.0"&gt;immune response&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="8" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;In the study, they found several inflammatory markers linked to increases in AMPA receptor levels. According to the researchers, the immune response may be behind these changes in AMPA receptor numbers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="9" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Keep in mind, this new study is in its early phases. Dr. Nair notes it would have been helpful to know if the control group—people who did not have long COVID—had prior COVID infections and how that might have affected the results. Still, the new findings align with &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0315486" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0315486" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="research" data-node-id="9.1" class="body-link css-1d8p8n5 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="9.1.0"&gt;research&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from earlier this year that found people with brain fog experience chronic inflammation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="10" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;So where does this leave people who are currentlystill dealing with long COVID brain fog? The study didn’t make or suggest a new treatment but instead could provide scientists with guidance on what to target. For example, doctors may want to prescribe drugs that block AMPA receptor activity to lessen brain fog symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="11" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;"Our findings clearly demonstrate that long COVID brain fog should be recognized as a legitimate clinical condition,” adds Takuya Takahashi, a professor at Yokohama City University in Japan and senior study author. “This could encourage the healthcare industry to accelerate the development of diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for this disorder."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-node-id="13" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-exclude="true" id="journey-inline" class="css-ciejky e1ye6jr30"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Men's Health</author><pubDate>Mon, 13 Oct 2025 21:11:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijwFBVV95cUxPOVIxODhZbWJfb1FhMFVmaFJpUk02azhNMzU3T3RRWUl6dmNHMGpHZUk4N0hWR0E5aDRuMGtzTDhyLU5KaHJkYmgzUW5OMERJdnc0elpNTXlBTnc4dGtTUlNteUN3b2NPNUZoUzJZN3YzOVZpNXdWcXFab1ZnUmJVZWJ1bmNnT1JFckcwQmREMA</guid></item><item><title>150多名未接种疫苗的儿童在SC麻疹爆发中隔离了21天- Ars Technica</title><link>https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/10/over-150-unvaccinated-kids-quarantined-for-21-days-in-sc-measles-outbreak/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
                      
                      
          &lt;p&gt;Health officials in South Carolina are warning that the highly infectious measles virus is spreading undetected in communities in the northern part of the state, specifically Spartanburg and Greenville counties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week, officials in Greenville identified an eighth measles case that is potentially linked to the outbreak. Seven outbreak cases had been confirmed since September 25 in neighboring Spartanburg, where transmission was identified in two schools: Fairforest Elementary and Global Academy, a public charter school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across those two schools, at least 153 unvaccinated children were exposed to the virus and have been put in a 21-day quarantine, during which they are barred from attending school, state officials said in &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baOoDM-Bn2g"&gt;a press conference&lt;/a&gt;. Twenty-one days is the maximum incubation period, spanning from when a person is exposed to when they would develop a rash if infected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's unclear how the latest case in Greenville became infected with the virus and how they may link to the nearby Spartanburg cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"What this case tells us is that there is active, unrecognized community transmission of measles occurring in the Upstate [northern region of South Carolina], which makes it vital to ensure that the public have received their measles vaccinations," the South Carolina Department of Public Health said in &lt;a href="https://dph.sc.gov/news/dph-confirms-states-11th-measles-case-greenville-county-eighth-related-current-outbreak"&gt;an announcement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two recommended doses of the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine are about 97 percent effective at blocking the infection, and that protection is considered lifelong. Without that protection, the virus is extremely contagious, infecting 90 percent of unvaccinated people who are exposed. The virus spreads easily through the air, lingering in the airspace of a room for up to two hours after an infected person has left.&lt;/p&gt;

In the final step, the contestant is asked whether they want to change their mind and select the remaining option A or stick with their original choice, B.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dubbed the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem"&gt;Monty Hall problem&lt;/a&gt; after an American game show host, this famous puzzle has entertained mathematicians for decades. But it can also tell us something about how the human mind and brain function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why do some people choose to change their minds while others stick with their first choice? What would you do and what might your choice reveal about your mind?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Choosing when to change&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research on changes of mind uses the concept of “metacognition” to explain when and how mind changes occur. Broadly speaking, metacognition refers to psychological and biological processes that inform us about how well we are doing the task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a sense, metacognition is that inner voice telling us we are either on track or that we should try harder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intuitively, changes of mind may be triggered by low confidence in our initial choice. Yet, when my colleagues and I &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tics.2022.02.004"&gt;reviewed the research&lt;/a&gt; on changes of mind about a range of different kinds of decisions, we found many studies showing people change their minds less often than you might think. This was surprising, given how often we feel uncertain about our choices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, when people do choose to change their mind, it is often &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhae179"&gt;for the better&lt;/a&gt;. This ability to accurately gauge whether to change your mind is referred to as metacognitive sensitivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our research has found people often &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s42003-025-07646-3"&gt;make better decisions&lt;/a&gt; about whether to change their minds when they are put under time pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding more about how we decide to change our minds may lead to ways to train our minds to make better choices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Our brains show when we will change our minds&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another interesting question about changes of mind is &lt;em&gt;when&lt;/em&gt; do people choose to change their minds. The answer to this question might seem obvious, as people can change their minds only after they have made the first choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To find out more about this process, we measured people’s brain activity before they even made their initial choice in a laboratory task that involved answering questions about moving images on a screen. We successfully &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhae179"&gt;predicted&lt;/a&gt; changes of mind seconds &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s42003-025-07646-3"&gt;before&lt;/a&gt; they took place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings suggest brain activity that predicts changes of mind could be harnessed to improve the quality of the initial choices, without needing a change of mind later. Training based on this brain activity may help people in sensitive professions such as health or defence make better choices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why don’t we change our minds more often?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research on metacognition has provided robust evidence that changes of mind tend to improve choice outcomes. So why are people so reluctant to change their minds?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are at least two possible reasons. First, deciding to change your mind is typically a result of making extra cognitive effort to analyse the quality of the initial choices. Not every decision requires that effort, and most everyday choices can be good enough rather than perfect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, choosing a wrong brand of orange-flavoured soft drink will probably not significantly impact our wellbeing. In fact, consumer research shows buyers tend to report higher product satisfaction when offered fewer choices, a phenomenon called “&lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9780470939338.ch6"&gt;the paradox of choice&lt;/a&gt;”. This suggests having more choices and, therefore, greater opportunity to change one’s mind may be more cognitively effortful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, frequent changes of mind may signal personality traits that are not socially desirable. Meaningful and fulfilling interpersonal relationships rely on the ability to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.brainres.2005.12.126"&gt;predict and rely on&lt;/a&gt; another person’s actions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Erratic and frequent changes of mind could negatively impact relationships and people may avoid doing this to improve their social integration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The future of changing your mind&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The science of changes of mind is an exciting field of research, developing at a fast pace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future developments in the field might focus on identifying specific brain activity markers of subsequent correct changes of mind. If reliable and valid markers are found, they could be harnessed to help people become experts on when they should change their minds to achieve better professional and social outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oh, and coming back to the Monty Hall problem: if you ever do find yourself offered this choice by a game show host, you should definitely change your mind. In this scenario, for mathematical reasons, switching away from your first pick will &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/the-monty-hall-problem-going-with-your-gut-will-get-your-goat-14195"&gt;double your chances of winning&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/263907/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation"&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;img class="lazyload" decoding="async" src="" data-src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/263907/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article is republished from &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com"&gt;The Conversation&lt;/a&gt; under a Creative Commons license.

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;An international study has uncovered a new vulnerability in prostate cancer cells that could help improve treatment for one of the most common cancers affecting men.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                &lt;p class="w-100 my-4 d-print-none"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;The research, published in the journal &lt;i&gt;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&lt;/i&gt; , was led by scientists from Flinders University in Australia and South China University of Technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It reveals that two enzymes—PDIA1 and PDIA5—play a crucial role in helping prostate cancer cells grow, survive, and resist treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These enzymes act as molecular bodyguards for the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/androgen+receptor/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;androgen receptor&lt;/a&gt; (AR), a protein that fuels prostate cancer. When PDIA1 and PDIA5 are blocked, the AR becomes unstable and breaks down, leading to cancer cell death and tumor shrinkage in both lab-grown cells and animal models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team also found that combining drugs that block PDIA1 and PDIA5 with enzalutamide, a widely used prostate cancer medication, significantly boosted the treatment's effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We've discovered a previously unknown mechanism that &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/prostate+cancer+cells/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;prostate cancer cells&lt;/a&gt; use to protect the androgen receptor, which is a key driver of the disease," says senior author, Professor Luke Selth, Head of Prostate Cancer Research and Co-Director of Flinders Health and Medical Research Institute's Cancer Impact program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"By targeting these enzymes, we can destabilize the AR and make tumors more vulnerable to existing therapies like enzalutamide."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lead author, Professor Jianling Xie, who started the research while at Flinders University, says that this &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/combination+therapy/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;combination therapy&lt;/a&gt; worked well in patient-derived tumor samples and in mice, suggesting strong potential for future clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;"This is an exciting step forward," says Dr. Xie, now at South China University of Technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our findings show that PDIA1 and PDIA5 are not just helpers of cancer growth but they're also promising targets for new treatments that could work alongside existing drugs."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the role of these enzymes goes beyond protecting the AR. The study found that PDIA1 and PDIA5 also help cancer cells manage stress and maintain &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/energy+production/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;energy production&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blocking them causes damage to the cells' mitochondria—the parts of the cell that generate energy—and leads to oxidative stress, which further weakens the cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This dual impact of hitting both the AR and the cancer's energy supply makes these enzymes especially attractive targets," adds Dr. Xie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It's like cutting off both the fuel and the engine at the same time."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professor Selth adds that while current drugs that block PDIA1 and PDIA5 show promise, more work is needed to make them safe and effective for use in patients. Some of the existing compounds may affect &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/healthy+cells/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;healthy cells&lt;/a&gt;, so future studies will focus on developing safer inhibitors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer in men worldwide. Although treatments like &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/hormone+therapy/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;hormone therapy&lt;/a&gt; and AR-targeting drugs have helped many patients, resistance to these therapies is a major challenge. This new discovery could help overcome that hurdle and improve outcomes for men with advanced prostate cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        &lt;p&gt;Before the pandemic helped fuel the growth of vaccine politicization across the country, less than 1% of Austin school district’s kindergarteners in the fall of 2019 failed to comply with the state’s vaccine reporting requirements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Five years later, the Austin Independent School District had some of the state’s highest number of kindergarteners who neglected those state requirements — about 1 in 5 kindergarteners had not proven they were fully vaccinated against measles and did not file an exemption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Texas Tribune analysis has found that this explosion of vaccine non-compliance has played out across many school districts in the state in recent years, helping to push Texas’ measles vaccine coverage to the lowest it’s been since at least 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We definitely were on a better trajectory (before the pandemic),” said Alana Bejarano, executive director of health services and nursing for the Austin school district, which reported a 23% delinquency rate for the measles vaccines among their kindergarteners.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;“I don’t know that I can pinpoint the concrete answer, except (preschool and kindergarteners) were born at a time where everything kind of went off track and getting them back into that, you know, that’s been difficult.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Tribune examined kindergarten measles vaccination compliance because it’s the earliest the state documents school vaccination rates and measles can be especially deadly for young children. The state’s two measles deaths this year were girls ages 6 and 8. Under Texas vaccine requirements, most kindergarteners must show they are fully vaccinated against measles or file an exemption to enroll in school; most who are not fully vaccinated have an exemption.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;During the pandemic, the statewide measles vaccine delinquency rate — a term the Texas Department of State Health Services uses to track students not compliant with those requirements — more than doubled.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;The Tribune estimated the number of vaccine-delinquent kindergarteners in each district by comparing delinquency rates and enrollment totals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In school districts with the most delinquent kindergarteners in the 2024-25 school year, the latest data available from the state, as much as 44% of their kindergarteners were delinquent in the measles vaccines, and their delinquencies also outnumbered exemptions, which was not the case at the state level. Those school districts had vaccine delinquency rates as small as a fraction of a percent just five years prior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The five other vaccinations required for kindergarten followed similar increases in delinquency rates during the same time period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pandemic is the driving force behind the increase in vaccine delinquency, school district officials say. Many children are entering school after falling behind on their immunizations during the pandemic, making it an untenable task for resource-strapped school districts to chase after parents to vaccinate their children or submit an exemption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, access to vaccines, especially free and low-cost doses, have also dwindled over the last several years amid funding cuts and the politicization of vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;State laws and rules don’t dictate who has to enforce vaccine compliance, although the Texas Department of State Health Services administers the law and school districts have traditionally been among the first line of enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While school districts acknowledge they are enrolling students not compliant with state vaccine requirements, district officials say they are caught in a no-win situation. Pushing vaccines too hard could lead to retaliation from groups and politicians opposed to vaccine mandates, and district officials don’t want to disenroll students — public schools have a responsibility to educate all children and so much of their funding is tied to attendance, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We encourage our school nurses to advocate strongly to promote and protect public health at their campus,” Becca Harkleroad, executive director of the Texas School Nurse Organization. “But ultimately it’s up to the superintendent and the principal to decide how strictly they are going to enforce it or if they are going to enforce it.”&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;Statewide, the percentage of kindergarteners who were delinquent in getting the measles vaccine more than doubled to 2.68% between 2019-20 and 2024-25, the latest data available. The delinquency rate jumped to 3.1% in 2021-22, surpassing the number of students who had an exemption. Those rates have not returned to pre-pandemic levels, although the exemption rate has returned to exceeding the delinquency rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that a year ago 25,000 Texas kindergarteners were not fully vaccinated against measles. Of those, more than 16,000 had an exemption, and about 9,000 did not have an exemption and under the state’s definition, were vaccine delinquent.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;The overall vaccine delinquency rates may be small, but anything that causes vaccination levels to fall means more children are vulnerable. Ideally, schools try to keep their vaccination levels at 95% to help protect those children with compromised immune systems or medical conditions that keep them from being vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to vaccine delinquency, the state also tracks the percentage of students who are vaccinated, formally exempt from vaccinations, and provisionally enrolled because of vaccination status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most unvaccinated students in Texas are permitted to enroll because they have an exemption form or a note from a doctor. They can also provisionally enroll without proving vaccination status if they are homeless, military dependents or in foster care and their records cannot be obtained by the start of the school year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Texas measles kindergarten vaccination rate of 93% is the lowest it’s been since at least 2011, ranking the state 18th nationally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The decrease in vaccination rates overall is certainly a concern because it leaves our population vulnerable to different infections,” said Dr. Erin Nicholson, a pediatric infection physician at Texas Children’s Hospital and an assistant professor at Baylor College of Medicine. “And we saw that front and center with the measles outbreak that recently happened.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Schools: A first line of defense against infectious disease&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the time most children enter kindergarten, they have received two MMR vaccination doses, &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.bswhealth.com/conditions/measles-rubeola/mmr-vaccine" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;which will provide lifelong protection&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; against measles, as well as mumps and rubella for most people. The MMR vaccination for kindergarteners is considered one of the &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://odphp.health.gov/healthypeople/objectives-and-data/browse-objectives/vaccination/maintain-vaccination-coverage-level-2-doses-mmr-vaccine-children-kindergarten-iid-04" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;most important immunization targets by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;State health officials audit school vaccination records each year for accuracy, by sampling school district records, explains Chris Van Deusen, spokesperson for the Texas Department of State Health Services. But there is nothing in state rules that requires DSHS to enforce the vaccination requirement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result, the de facto enforcement has traditionally fallen to school districts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the state’s highest kindergarten measles delinquency rates were in larger school districts and charter networks: KIPP Texas Public Schools (44%), Spring ISD (30%), Austin ISD (23%), Dallas ISD (20%), and Houston ISD (7%).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The five public school systems with the highest counts made up more than half of all delinquent kindergartners in the state, despite enrolling less than 10% of the state’s public school kindergarteners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some district officials, including Dallas, say they try to follow state requirements by sending home students who do not have completed vaccination requirements or an exemption. But, they enroll those students, contributing to the district’s vaccine delinquency rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Austin school district will also enroll the students who don’t meet vaccine requirements, but they wait to send those students home until their parents have been notified of their vaccine delinquency three times, Bejarano said. They can return once they have proof of vaccination or the exemption form.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;State data doesn’t track how many vaccine-delinquent students school districts send home. It also doesn’t reflect changes to vaccine delinquency later in the year because the data is based on surveys school districts submit in the first half of the school year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While some school districts say they try to send home students who don’t meet vaccine requirements, Houston ISD officials said they are keeping those students in the classroom. They, too, dedicate time and resources to track all students’ vaccination status and try to communicate information with parents about the need for staying up to date on the schedule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, they are “not excluding students from learning based on vaccine status,” according to a statement to the Tribune.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chanthini Thomas, a school nurse who retired from her job at Houston ISD’s Bellaire High School last summer, said the conflicting messages from the district, resource reductions and the yearlong chase to get vaccine paperwork in was frustrating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You have little support,” she said. “Why would you say … that’s a requirement to any school for the state of Texas but then you put out a mandate from the district to say, don’t let immunizations prevent enrollment? And the reason is because they need the numbers, because the numbers were dwindling.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like many other urban school districts, HISD is battling &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://perc.tamu.edu/blog/2025/06/texas-enrollment.html?utm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;declining enrollment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — and the funding that comes with it — as more families move toward better job opportunities and lower housing costs in the suburbs or choose charter and private schools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As school nurses have told the Tribune over the summer, school districts choose to enroll unvaccinated children so they can keep “butts in the seats” and the base amount of money they receive from state and local sources to educate each student — &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.texastribune.org/2025/03/28/texas-school-funding-explainer/#:~:text=When%20Texas%20school%20districts%20talk,meet%20each%20student%27s%20educational%20needs." target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;about $6,160&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I see the school as being in a tough spot,” said Melissa Gilkey, a University of North Carolina professor who studies vaccine efforts at schools. “We work so hard to minimize absenteeism … that I do have some sympathy for that idea that it’s hard to exclude them for one health service.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;KIPP Texas Public Schools, a charter network with campuses across the state, declined an interview but insisted it was following the state immunization requirements. Its kindergarten measles vaccine delinquency rate was less than 1% in 2019 compared to 44% last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spring ISD, north of Houston, reported last year that more than 30% of its kindergarteners were measles vaccine delinquent. The district informed the Tribune it also follows state rules closely but said its high MMR delinquency rate was evidence of “enrollment and access issues” and that Spring ISD was “actively working to strengthen this process.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Spring district cited family’s frequent moves in the area, limited access to health care and language barriers as reasons there’s a delay in getting student shot records updated in time for school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are committed to improving compliance rates and ensuring our students are protected against preventable diseases,” said Shane Strubhart, the Spring ISD spokesperson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Access to vaccines has dwindled&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pandemic disrupted preventive health care, becoming most apparent in some of the most recent kindergarten classes, filled with students born around the first COVID-19 outbreak. The COVID-19 pandemic not only interrupted home and school life, experts say, it upended regular health checkups younger children typically receive before they start school and that impact continues to be felt today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Families “going to see the doctors got off track for everyone during the pandemic,” Austin ISD’s Bejarano said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For low-income and immigrant families who already found health care access a challenge, more are struggling to find what Bejarano calls their “medical” home, a regular primary care doctor who can either vaccinate their children or answer concerns and perhaps direct them to the state’s exemption process if they feel strong enough to opt out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“COVID didn’t do vaccination or education and many other things as a whole, any favors,” said Jennifer Finley, executive director of health services for Dallas ISD. The district’s kindergarten measles delinquency rate jumped to 20% last school year compared to 1% during the 2019-20 school year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diminished vaccine access is also a factor. Up until the early aughts, public health departments, churches and even lawmakers would hold free or low-cost immunization clinics over the summer for families.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2004, the Dallas school district turned away hundreds of students, who walked and drove to nearby clinics for free or low-cost vaccines, according to a Dallas Morning News article.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the pandemic, those resources are even fewer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It really stopped during the pandemic,” Finley said. “Some of the folks lost their funding.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schools rely heavily on local public health departments to help them with vaccination clinics. Once the threat of COVID lessened, public health departments used those funds to add more staff and hold more vaccination clinics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But two things began &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.texastribune.org/2025/08/18/texas-school-vaccination-budget-cuts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;impacting vaccination efforts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; by local health departments. First, those leftover funds were clawed back early by the Trump administration this year, prompting some staff to look for other jobs, thereby causing staff shortages in public health vaccination departments. And second, public health officials suspect more immigrant families are shying away from vaccination because of stepped-up immigration efforts and deportations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Texas, there are an &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.texastribune.org/2025/01/18/texas-border-schools-donald-trump-mass-deportations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;estimated 111,000 immigrant children&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, all of whom do not qualify for state Medicaid health insurance coverage, attending school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We typically have big lines and the waiting room is packed. Our whole lobby is packed,” Dr. Phil Huang, the director of the Dallas County Health and Human Services Department, told the Tribune in August. “This year it has not been that way.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vaccine hesitancy changing school messaging&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the pandemic, many parents watched as debates raged over the safety of the quickly-developed COVID-19 vaccine. As a result, they are asking more questions about all childhood vaccinations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In many cases, parents are spreading MMR doses out and that, too, could be the reason for more kindergartners showing up with an incomplete vaccination status, Bejarano said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The main concern (among parents) is basically, ‘Am I doing the right thing for my child, that is in their best interest and help me understand what the risks are of these infectious diseases that vaccines are trying to prevent,’” Nicholson, the Texas Children’s physician, said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before COVID, many doctors adopted an imperial tone — “you should do this because I’m the expert,” she said. That changed after the pandemic. “We are looking at how we talk to these parents, because the last thing that we want to do is come across as condescending.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;School nurses have also worked tirelessly to try to find a winning formula to reach families of vaccine-delinquent kids. At a national school nurse conference in Austin this summer, an entire session was devoted to teaching nurses how to have tension-free conversations with parents who are skeptical of vaccine requirements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, school nurses just want to inform parents of their two options to stay compliant with state rules: either provide proof of vaccination or an exemption, Bejarano said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’ve made these large campaigns and we are really kind when they register, letting them know what is the law, what the exemptions (are),” Bejarano said. “I just think the district in general is understanding we need to do better when it comes to public health and getting these rates up.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The good news, she says, is that the greater efforts made by school nurses in the fall to try to help parents become vaccine compliant tends to push down the high delinquency rates by the end of the school year. Data provided to the Tribune by Austin ISD proved that out. That 23% delinquency rate for kindergartners recorded in the fall of 2024 fell drastically to 6% by May 2025 possibly due to the fear produced by the measles outbreak in the months prior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I do think that everybody came together in the Austin community and really did try to push for that” compliance, Bejarano said. “And I think that’s why it helped the rate last year.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finley points to other lesser-known reasons complicating the back-to-school vaccination picture. Among them, an influx of students came to Texas from other states, many already armed with vaccination exemptions or with incomplete vaccination histories who are having to be re-educated about Texas requirements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starting Sept. 1, Texas parents can more easily obtain a vaccine exemption form by downloading it off the state’s website, but how that will impact the delinquency gap won’t be seen until data is released next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="optimizelyHubpeekId" class="optimizelyHubpeekClass"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nicholson, Finley, Bejarano and others say they would like to see more data that clearly explains the rising delinquency rate and how many students who were once marked delinquent end up becoming fully vaccinated or obtaining an exemption by the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Does it mean, you know, people are just struggling with paperwork?” Nicholson said. “Or does it mean that really those vaccinations are falling?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;___&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This story was originally published by &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.texastribune.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;The Texas Tribune&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and distributed through a partnership with The Associated Press.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Many forms of cancer are devastating. But pancreatic cancer is one of the most deadly and aggressive forms there is. There are several reasons for this, including its stealthy progression, rapid metastasis (the way it spreads), and late detection. In fact, early detection is so rare there's a five-year survival rate of 13.3%. Over 80% of patients die due to metastatic progression within two years of diagnosis. But scientists may have discovered a way to slow it all down by studying a receptor that normally helps cancer cells spread, called ALK7. This is explained in a report published in &lt;a href="https://molecular-cancer.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12943-025-02384-w" target="_blank"&gt;Molecular Cancer&lt;/a&gt;.  Interconnected ALK7-driven pathways typically promote pancreatic cancer cells, or pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). To really understand what's going on, you have to look at two concepts related to cancerous tumors, called extravasation and intravasation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The term extravasation describes a general leak of fluids or substances from human blood vessels into surrounding tissues. It can mean blood, medication, or, in this case, the cancerous cells. It's a multi-stage process through which most cancers spread. But to do that, cells must first bypass a fleshy barrier of sorts. Intravasation describes that process: the invasion of those cells through the basement membrane (or wall) of a blood vessel. The tumor cells breach the fibrotic stroma and vascular barriers, and once they're through, they can propagate using extravasation much more efficiently, thereby traveling to remote parts of the body, including other organs. But by leveraging ALK7 receptors and turning them off, scientists believe they can stop these two processes, thus stopping the spread of cancer. If true, that could lead to higher survival rates, better treatments, and maybe even a method to prevent late-stage progression altogether. In some ways, it's not unlike a &lt;a href="https://www.bgr.com/science/revolutionary-new-one-second-cancer-treatment-could-replace-radiation/" target="_blank"&gt;revolutionary new one-second cancer treatment&lt;/a&gt; that could potentially replace radiation, currently a core treatment for most cancers.&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;/div&gt;
				            &lt;div class="columns-holder "&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Scientists have actually known about the ALK7 pathways for a time. Some studies have shown them to be anti-metastatic, and others the opposite, pro-metastatic, meaning there are arguments it either supports or prevents progression. The scientists studying the ALK7 pathways in the Molecular Cancer study believe that discrepancy is because of variations in either the different types of cancer or the differences in how the various studies were carried out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To investigate, scientists injected PDAC cells into the pancreas of five-to-six week-old immunodeficient NSG mice and then administered inhibitors of "ALK family receptors" — ALK7 among them — and monitored tumor growth for three weeks. The findings suggest there is a way to reduce or stunt tumor growth using these pathways. But, of course, further testing will be necessary, and if those prove successful, rigorous development and then clinical trials are in order before anything usable is produced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this is not the first time a previously known factor was revisited by researchers. For example, &lt;a href="https://www.bgr.com/science/ai-helped-design-an-innovative-new-cancer-treatment-plan/" target="_blank"&gt;AI solutions have helped design an innovative cancer treatment&lt;/a&gt; plan, and it's one that uses available drugs — the kind used to treat high cholesterol and alcohol dependence. AI is also helping to improve &lt;a href="https://www.bgr.com/science/mindblowing-ai-breakthrough-can-detect-cancer-99-of-the-time/" target="_blank"&gt;cancer detection with a 99% accuracy rate&lt;/a&gt;, and that's absolutely mindblowing. It means aggressive and deadly forms of cancer, like pancreatic cancer, could be spotted early before they're debilitating and dangerous. But rapid detection pales in comparison to the achievement of truly stopping the spread through treatment. It's early to say, but the ALK7 discovery could prove revolutionary for slowing PDAC.&lt;/p&gt;

(Sorry if I’ve forever ruined your fave whiskey for ya!) Startling, oh yes. Thinking back, I had been nursing achy hamstrings following a &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a35994889/kettlebell-upper-body-workout/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a35994889/kettlebell-upper-body-workout/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="kettlebell workout" data-node-id="0.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;kettlebell workout&lt;/a&gt; a few days prior. And since my pee certainly hinted that something wasn’t working right internally, I suspected the two were connected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="1" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Until that workout, I hadn’t picked up a kettlebell in months. It had been my primary form of exercise for six years—I even got certified to teach it—but I was starting to burn out, so I swapped in a less intense Pilates practice. Now I was ready to ease back into the swing of things (key word: &lt;em data-node-id="1.1"&gt;ease&lt;/em&gt;). &lt;br data-node-id="1.3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="2" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;I began with a 30-pounder and did one-minute intervals of swings, squats, and presses, eventually moving up to 45 pounds. I’d worked with that weight before—but again, it had been awhile. I left the gym hobbling (oh, my hammies!) but otherwise fine.&lt;br data-node-id="2.1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="4" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;The soreness lingered but wasn’t bad enough for me to cancel Saturday &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a65969935/pilates-strength-training-hybrid-workout-plan-pilates-x-lift/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a65969935/pilates-strength-training-hybrid-workout-plan-pilates-x-lift/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Pilates" data-node-id="4.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Pilates&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em data-node-id="4.3"&gt;A stretch might be good&lt;/em&gt;, I told myself. But I woke up the next day to my unfortunate bathroom sitch. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="body-breakdown" data-node-id="5" class="body-h2 css-1q3hln2 emevuu60"&gt; &lt;strong data-node-id="5.1"&gt;Body Breakdown&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="6" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;I was vaguely aware of the condition known as &lt;strong data-node-id="6.1"&gt;rhabdomyolysis&lt;/strong&gt;, in which injured muscle tissue breaks down and releases its contents into the bloodstream, potentially damaging the kidneys. But I figured there was no way my 25-minute kettlebell sesh could have been intense enough to cause that level of harm. Yet I found myself Googling “that thing when you work out too hard” (who can remember the word &lt;em data-node-id="6.3"&gt;rhabdomyolysis&lt;/em&gt;?). One of the first symptoms I came across: dark, brownish-colored urine.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="7" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;After some initial testing at urgent care, I was referred to the ER, where doctors measured my creatine kinase (CK)—an enzyme found in your muscles that, when elevated, may indicate damage. I learned just how injured I was: A healthy adult’s CK level falls between 22 and 198 U/L (units per liter); mine was a whopping 90,000 U/L. &lt;br data-node-id="7.1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;section data-embed="pullquote" data-lazy-id="P0-13" data-node-id="8" class="embed"&gt;&lt;blockquote data-theme-key="pullquote" class="css-1pxfh3s e1pe3zr91"&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden="true" data-theme-key="title-design-element-before" class="css-0 eagam8p0"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;blockquote class="css-sh2zho e1pe3zr90"&gt;"The tipping point is different for everyone, which is why it’s key to be in tune with your body."&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden="true" data-theme-key="title-design-element-after" class="css-0 eagam8p1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="9" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;When I was told I would have to be admitted for at least a day, it was a strange pill to swallow. I wasn’t suffering from any other symptoms, like dehydration, nausea, or faintness. Yet I spent the night in the hospital spooning an IV bag to flush my kidneys fast enough to avoid damage. (Renal failure can be one of the more serious side effects of rhabdo.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="10" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;I was told to take six weeks off from exercising. When I did venture to my first hardcore class (boxing), I sneaked a peek at my pee for days afterward, just to make sure everything seemed A-OK. Fast-forward a year later, and I’m healthy as ever. &lt;br data-node-id="10.1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr data-node-id="11" class="css-18pb4rg emevuu60"&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="12" class="body-h3 css-1edunm5 emevuu60"&gt;Give It A Rest&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="13" class="body-text css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;I get it: You feel a sense of pride when you fight through the so-sore feels.

But &lt;a href="https://weillcornell.org/tscutler" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://weillcornell.org/tscutler" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Todd Cutler, MD" data-node-id="16.3" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Todd Cutler, MD&lt;/a&gt;, an internist at NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center, says nurses in his ER noticed an uptick in rhabdo cases that coincided with the recent rise in popularity of high-intensity cycling classes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="17" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;It’s not typically an exercise newbie who gets injured, either; it’s often a healthy, relatively fit person who pushes themselves to extremes the first time they try a new workout (or when they return after an absence). It makes sense, given my experience. “If you weren’t fit in the first place, you wouldn’t have been able to do the exercise,” says Dr. Cutler. In other words, my underlying health allowed me to reach the point of overexertion.&lt;br data-node-id="17.1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="less-is-more" data-node-id="18" class="body-h2 css-1q3hln2 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="18.0"&gt;Less Is More&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br data-node-id="18.1"&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="19" class="body-text css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;There’s a fine line between pushing yourself (which nets you gains) and going overboard (which leads to injury). The tipping point is different for everyone, which is why it’s key to be in tune with your body. (Hamstrings feel as if they’re under a blowtorch? Put down the weight!) If you’re trying something new or going back to working out after a hiatus, ease into it, advises &lt;a href="https://nyulangone.org/doctors/1013353556/lauren-e-borowski" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://nyulangone.org/doctors/1013353556/lauren-e-borowski" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Lauren Borowski, MD" data-node-id="19.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Lauren Borowski, MD&lt;/a&gt;, a sports medicine specialist at NYU Langone Center for Women’s Sports Health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="20" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;My new mantra: Match workouts to &lt;em data-node-id="20.1"&gt;current&lt;/em&gt; ability (no matter your past experience).

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a new study using AI and machine learning, EPFL researchers have found that it's not only what we eat, but how consistently we eat it that plays a crucial role in gut health.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                &lt;p class="w-100 my-4 d-print-none"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;The gut microbiota is the community of microorganisms, including bacteria, viruses, fungi and other microbes, that lives in our digestive systems—some of these microbes are helpful and others can be harmful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many previous studies have shown that what we eat has an impact on our gut microbiota. Healthy diets rich in fruit, vegetables, fiber and nuts are strongly associated with increased microbial diversity and better stomach health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But now, for the first time, EPFL research has shown that the regularity with which we eat a &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/healthy+diet/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;healthy diet&lt;/a&gt; is just as important for gut health as the amount of what we consume.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The importance of nutritional quality and regularity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a target="_blank"&gt;new paper, just&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-63799-z" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;i&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/i&gt;, researchers in EPFL's Digital Epidemiology Laboratory, part of both the Schools of Computer and Communication and Life Sciences, confirmed earlier research that certain types of foods, such as fruit and vegetables, contribute to a more diverse gut microbiota. Working with colleagues at the University of California, San Diego, they also made several striking new discoveries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, they found that it's not just the consumption of fruit, vegetables and grains that create a healthy gut microbiota, but whether you eat them regularly or not. While there's always been a hunch that it's important to eat good food regularly, encouraged by campaigns such as 'five fruits and vegetables a day," it has always been just that—a hunch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This research clearly shows that you cannot binge on vegetables on your healthy day and then eat in an unhealthy way for the rest of the week or month," said Associate Professor Marcel Salathé, head of the Digital Epidemiology Lab and co-director of the EPFL AI Center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"In fact, our study suggests that irregular consumption of healthy foods undoes many of their beneficial effects on the gut microbiota. This is a real incentive for future studies to not just look at what people are eating but the patterns of what they are eating over time."&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;h2&gt;Predicting diet from the microbiome&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, the team was also able to show that a person's gut bacteria and what they eat can predict each other with up to 85% accuracy. With just a simple stool sample—an increasingly common component of medical research—advanced &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/machine+learning/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;machine learning&lt;/a&gt; techniques could predict a person's diet using their microbiota and vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"For our collaborators in San Diego, who are some of the world's leading experts in microbiome research, this was exciting," explained Salathé. "Getting such data from a stool sample is relatively easy, but understanding someone's diet is notoriously difficult, it's data that's been challenging to collect."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The power of real-time data&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study was made possible by using detailed nutritional information from about 1000 participants who were part of the &lt;a href="https://www.foodandyou.org/" target="_blank"&gt;"Food &amp;amp; You"&lt;/a&gt; cohort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High-resolution dietary data was collected via the AI-powered app &lt;a href="https://www.myfoodrepo.ai/en" target="_blank"&gt;MyFoodRepo&lt;/a&gt;, developed by the same EPFL lab, which allowed users to log their meals in real time by snapping photos or scanning barcodes. The app's AI then analyzed these entries for nutritional content, later verified by human reviewers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Historically, &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/nutrition+research/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;nutrition research&lt;/a&gt; has relied on food frequency questionnaires and 24-hour dietary recalls. In theory, you could ask somebody to write down everything they eat but in practice it's just not done because it's borderline impossible. Now, the AI is so good that we can do this data collection at a large scale," said Rohan Singh, a Doctoral Assistant in the Digital Epidemiology Lab and lead author of the paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our study has been particularly interesting because when you look at lifestyle-oriented gastrointestinal disorders, they often develop gradually. Since nutrition is one of the big contributors to these diseases, analyses like ours may be able to assess what can be improved in a person's diet. AI can then help nudge people to adjust their food intake accordingly," he continued.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;h2&gt;Looking ahead&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Salathé believes the study's findings suggest that current dietary guidelines may need to be updated to emphasize not just the types and quantities of food, but the regularity of healthy eating behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, while this research project has ended, the MyFoodRepo app continues to be used by the Digital Epidemiology Lab team for other research. They are currently involved in a &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/pilot+project/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;pilot project&lt;/a&gt; on nutrition and cognitive performance, studying potential links between the two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, through the use of barcoded food data from the Food &amp;amp; You study, the researchers are investigating the link between food additives, like emulsifiers, found in ultra-processed foods, and the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/gut+microbiota/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;gut microbiota&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"There's a strong hypothesis that some of these additives really may negatively impact your microbiota, and we have some early indications that this could indeed be the case. We're still in the analysis stage but we are quite excited about early results," said Salathé.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More generally, they are gratified that the MyFoodRepo app is now opening the door to important nutrition studies globally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"From the outset, we knew we needed something extremely consumer-friendly and easy to use, while still providing the data that we needed. We built it to serve our own research needs, but also in a way which others would find useful—and it's now being used in many other nutrition studies globally," Salathé concluded.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cambridge Health Alliance and Harvard Medical School-led research is signaling that adults with psychosis have engaged in a sharp rise in cannabis use after states legalized and commercialized recreational sales.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                &lt;p class="w-100 my-4 d-print-none"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;  
                                         

                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Individuals with &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/psychotic+disorders/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;psychotic disorders&lt;/a&gt; often experience worsening symptoms when using cannabis, and the rapid expansion of commercial cannabis markets in the United States has raised public health concern for the group. Previous research found that &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/cannabis+use/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;cannabis use&lt;/a&gt; among this group is linked to more hospitalizations, and higher relapse rates compared with nonusers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Legalization effects on &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/psychosis/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;psychosis&lt;/a&gt;-related outcomes have seemed inconsistent, possibly due to delays between policy changes, time of analysis and the point where health impacts become measurable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the study, "Cannabis Use Among Individuals With Psychosis After State-Level Commercial Cannabis Legalization," &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/2840020" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;JAMA Psychiatry&lt;/i&gt;, researchers used difference-in-differences models to assess the impact of recreational cannabis legalization on past-30-day cannabis use among U.S. adults with a lifetime history of psychosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analysis included 1,856 adults aged 18 years and older, contributing 7,465 survey responses from 2014 through 2022. The mean age was 36.6 years, 58.2% were female, and 50.2% identified as white.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers used the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) data from 2014 to 2022, and compared trends in states that legalized recreational cannabis with those that did not, adjusting for age, sex, race and ethnicity, and receipt of financial assistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Results indicated no significant change before retail markets opened but a significant increase after commercialization. Past-month cannabis use among individuals with psychosis rose by 9.53 percentage points after recreational cannabis legalization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rise in &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/cannabis/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;cannabis&lt;/a&gt; use among individuals with psychosis after &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/legalization/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;legalization&lt;/a&gt; has clear implications for increased risk of harm to the group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Findings prompted author recommendations for on-package warnings for those with personal or family histories of psychosis and for scrutiny of mental health claims in advertising. Uncertainty remains about the scale and scope of downstream clinical and service impacts, and the team calls for studies that track functional outcomes alongside use patterns.&lt;/p&gt;

In a study of 481 individuals, those with dermatological symptoms such as rashes or itching were over three times more likely to report suicidal thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings suggest that skin issues could serve as an early biological marker of poor psychiatric outcomes, much like a warning sign in physical health. Scientists believe this connection may arise from shared developmental and inflammatory pathways between the brain and skin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increased Suicide Risk:&lt;/strong&gt; Around 25% of patients with skin symptoms experienced suicidal thoughts or attempts, compared to 7% without them.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shared Origins:&lt;/strong&gt; The skin and brain both develop from the same embryonic tissue, potentially explaining their linked vulnerabilities.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clinical Implications:&lt;/strong&gt; Dermatological symptoms may serve as early indicators of more severe mental health outcomes in psychosis.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;European College of Neuropsychopharmacology&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scientists have discovered that mental health patients who have skin conditions may be more at risk of worse outcomes, including &lt;a href="https://neurosciencenews.com/?s=suicide" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;suicidality&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://neurosciencenews.com/?s=depression" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This work, which may aid in identifying at-risk patients and personalising psychiatric treatment, is presented at the ECNP meeting in Amsterdam.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers looked at 481 patients with a first episode of&lt;a href="https://neurosciencenews.com/?s=psychosis" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt; psychosis&lt;/a&gt; (which is the first time an individual experiences a psychotic episode, such as loss of contact with reality, hallucinations and delusions). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-113352"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/skin-conditions-psychosis-neurosicenc.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/skin-conditions-psychosis-neurosicenc-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/skin-conditions-psychosis-neurosicenc-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/skin-conditions-psychosis-neurosicenc-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/skin-conditions-psychosis-neurosicenc-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/skin-conditions-psychosis-neurosicenc-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/skin-conditions-psychosis-neurosicenc-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/skin-conditions-psychosis-neurosicenc.jpg" alt="This shows a woman with a rash on her face." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/skin-conditions-psychosis-neurosicenc.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/skin-conditions-psychosis-neurosicenc-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/skin-conditions-psychosis-neurosicenc-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/skin-conditions-psychosis-neurosicenc-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/skin-conditions-psychosis-neurosicenc-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/skin-conditions-psychosis-neurosicenc-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/skin-conditions-psychosis-neurosicenc-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The brain and the skin both derive from the same embryonic origin – the ectoderm – prompting the researchers to investigate the relation between the skin and mental health. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;On testing, 14.5% were found to have dermatological symptoms (24% female, 9.8% male) such as rash, itching, photosensitivity, etc.  All patients were given 4 weeks treatment with an antipsychotic and then checked for a range of &lt;a href="https://neurosciencenews.com/?s=mental+health" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;mental health&lt;/a&gt; parameters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lead researcher, Dr Joaquín Galvañ &lt;em&gt;(Instituto de Investigación Sanitaria Gregorio Marañón, &lt;/em&gt;Madrid) said:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“After 4 weeks of follow-up, patients with a first episode of psychosis presenting with skin conditions experienced higher levels of depression and risk of suicide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We found that just 7% of the patients without the initial skin conditions had suicidal thoughts or attempts, in contrast, around 25% of the patients with initial skin conditions had suicidal thoughts or attempts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Initial skin conditions are also linked to greater depression and poorer well-being at follow-up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This discovery suggests that the presence of skin conditions indicates that these patients are more at risk for worse outcomes than patients who do not have skin conditions after a first episode of psychosis&lt;em&gt;”.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers note that, if confirmed, this finding has the potential to act as an advance marker for mental health risk, similar to the way, a blood test might indicate a greater risk of cancer or heart disease&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The brain and the skin both derive from the same embryonic origin – the ectoderm – prompting the researchers to investigate the relation between the skin and mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr &lt;strong&gt;Galvañ&lt;/strong&gt; continued:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was already known that between 30% and 60% of people with skin conditions show psychiatric symptoms. What we have done is look at things from the opposite direction; do people with mental health problems have skin conditions, and if so, can this tell us anything useful?  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; “Our findings suggest that dermatological symptoms may represent a marker of illness severity and poor short-term outcomes in the early stages of psychosis, potentially identifying a subgroup of patients with a poorer clinical prognosis who may benefit from early tailored interventions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The reason for the connection is still unclear, but our working hypothesis is that this may be due to the skin and neurological systems having common developmental origins and inflammatory pathways; but this needs to be confirmed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As far as we know this is the first study to show this link in patients with psychosis, so we need follow-up studies to confirm the finding. We also need to understand if this link applies also to a range of other psychiatric conditions, such as bipolar disorder, ADHD, anxiety or depression”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Commenting, Professor Eric Ruhe (Professor of Difficult-to-Treat Depression at &lt;em&gt;Radboud University&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; the Netherlands) said:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is an interesting association between skin problems and a first episode of psychosis. These results need replication in different cohorts but might indeed show a new link between skin and psychopathology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As the skin and the brain derive from the same embryonic origin, this would worth pursuing further, both diagnostically and mechanistically (which may be more interesting). For example, this association might be used to culture skin cells to begin to understand which treatment is appropriate”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is an independent comment, Professor Ruhe was not involved in this work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Key Questions Answered:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq wp-block-yoast-faq-block"&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1760375327707"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;Q: What did researchers discover about psychosis and skin conditions?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;A: They found that patients with skin issues during their first psychotic episode were far more likely to experience depression and suicidal thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1760375344444"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;Q: Why might the skin and brain be connected in this way?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;A: Both originate from the same embryonic tissue (ectoderm) and share inflammatory and signaling pathways that may influence mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1760375360588"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;Q: How could this finding change psychiatric care?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;A: Dermatological symptoms might help identify high-risk patients early, allowing for faster, more personalized interventions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this mental health research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.ecnp.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Tom Parkhill&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ecnp.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;European College of Neuropharmacology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Tom Parkhill – European College of Neuropharmacology&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;The findings will be presented at the 38th ECNP Congress&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Mon, 13 Oct 2025 17:14:08 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiAFBVV95cUxQZnBHNGx3T0pHcWc5WTVxNzBkcVFvNXBsRDBaWGRQa1RFZlJxM2FyS3NGQUVwV3ZUSzJKOGQtcjVtcjJKNm5fZjE3TlhlM2VnOUZUdGxZdjNvUnNHVldoVlQ5NHZ0clZiYkt1Wk9ObGlLT09YYnYySWIwcTBjUzIwMlZfM2YxVEVX</guid></item><item><title>世卫组织警告耐药性感染急剧增加--《纽约时报》</title><link>https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/13/health/who-antibiotic-drug-resistance.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The New York Times</author><pubDate>Mon, 13 Oct 2025 17:07:18 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigwFBVV95cUxOSW0yVm1TbzV0aXpSVTdWNzR6Q0gtaGdSVmpvZGJaQmVYSk5NYVMtV1BYV0F1Z3F4MHIwVlFKNlRYWEpRZzQ4MGlWMjdzZEMyWm5jcmRDSHNzX2E5eG1ybXpVODdJYnlOdmZKNlZoZ1VoSTJrRkp5ZDNLd3EyU2R2X3FqRQ</guid></item><item><title>心理学说， 8个迹象表明你比大多数同龄人衰老得更好- VegOut</title><link>https://vegoutmag.com/lifestyle/d-t-8-signs-youre-aging-better-than-most-of-your-peers-says-psychology/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page__content mt-4"&gt;
							&lt;p data-start="216" data-end="355"&gt;Aging well isn’t about how many candles are on your birthday cake. It’s about how you feel, how you think, and how you show up every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="357" data-end="488"&gt;Sure, genetics play a role. But psychology tells us that much of how we age comes down to our mindset, habits, and daily choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="490" data-end="592"&gt;So how do you know if you’re actually aging well—not just surviving but thriving as you get older?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="594" data-end="724"&gt;Let’s dive into eight signs that you’re aging better than most of your peers, according to research and a bit of lived experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="726" data-end="764"&gt;1) You’ve kept your curiosity alive&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="766" data-end="888"&gt;Ever met someone who seems to have stopped learning at 25? Their conversations sound like reruns of the same TV episode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="890" data-end="1076"&gt;Curiosity is one of the most underrated markers of psychological youth. Research from the Journal of Personality has linked curiosity with greater life satisfaction and even longevity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1078" data-end="1207"&gt;Curious people stay mentally flexible. They’re open to new experiences, which keeps the brain sharp and the spirit adventurous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1209" data-end="1335"&gt;Whether that means trying a new cuisine, picking up a language, or diving into a topic you know nothing about—it all counts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1337" data-end="1495"&gt;Personally, I’ve noticed that when I &lt;a href="https://vegoutmag.com/lifestyle/z-if-you-can-still-do-these-7-things-after-75-youre-in-the-top-10-of-your-age-group/"&gt;stay curious&lt;/a&gt;—whether it’s exploring a new restaurant or reading something outside my usual interests—I feel more alive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="1497" data-end="1541"&gt;2) You focus more on health than on looks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1543" data-end="1671"&gt;Let’s be honest, most of us start hitting the gym in our 20s because we want to look good. But as we age, something changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1673" data-end="1857"&gt;You start caring less about six-pack abs and more about how you feel when you wake up. You begin to value your energy levels, mental clarity, and overall health more than aesthetics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1859" data-end="1973"&gt;That shift in mindset? It’s a sign of maturity—and according to psychology, a strong indicator of healthy aging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1975" data-end="2153"&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12181576/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Studies show&lt;/a&gt; that people who focus on intrinsic goals like wellness, purpose, and vitality tend to be happier and age more gracefully than those fixated on external validation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2155" data-end="2223"&gt;You’re not giving up vanity—you’re just upgrading your priorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="2225" data-end="2267"&gt;3) You’ve learned to manage your stress&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2269" data-end="2378"&gt;If you’ve figured out how to keep your cool when life throws curveballs, congratulations—you’re aging well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2380" data-end="2644"&gt;Chronic stress accelerates biological aging by shortening something called telomeres (the protective caps on your DNA).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2380" data-end="2644"&gt;Psychologists have found that people who develop coping mechanisms—like mindfulness, journaling, or exercise—essentially slow that clock down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2646" data-end="2738"&gt;Think about it: we all deal with chaos. The question is, how much of it do we internalize?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2740" data-end="2891"&gt;The older I get, the more I realize that peace isn’t about a calm environment—it’s about a calm mind. And that kind of calm only comes from practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="2893" data-end="2929"&gt;4) You nurture your relationships&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p data-start="2931" data-end="3165"&gt;Here’s a fascinating fact: Harvard’s &lt;a href="https://www.harvard.edu/in-focus/happiness/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;longest-running study&lt;/a&gt; on happiness—spanning more than 80 years—found that the biggest predictor of long-term health and fulfillment isn’t wealth, career success, or even diet. It’s relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3167" data-end="3375"&gt;The quality of your social connections directly affects how well you age. People with close, supportive relationships tend to live longer, experience less cognitive decline, and recover faster from illness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3377" data-end="3445"&gt;It makes sense. Humans are social creatures, wired for connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3447" data-end="3533"&gt;And let’s face it—good friends keep you laughing, which is pretty much free therapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3535" data-end="3709"&gt;If you make time for people who energize you and distance yourself from those who drain you, you’re not just setting emotional boundaries—you’re extending your lifespan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="3711" data-end="3749"&gt;5) You’ve made peace with your past&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3751" data-end="3826"&gt;You can’t age well if you’re still fighting battles that ended years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3828" data-end="4111"&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11694412/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;According to&lt;/a&gt; psychologists, unresolved regret or resentment can lead to chronic stress, anxiety, and even physical symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3828" data-end="4111"&gt;On the flip side, emotional acceptance—acknowledging your past without letting it define you—is one of the strongest predictors of psychological well-being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4113" data-end="4254"&gt;Aging gracefully doesn’t mean pretending the past didn’t happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4113" data-end="4254"&gt;It means learning from it, forgiving yourself, and moving forward lighter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4256" data-end="4425"&gt;The older I get, the more I understand that &lt;a href="https://vegoutmag.com/lifestyle/8-signs-youre-actually-a-very-difficult-person-according-to-psychology/"&gt;holding grudges&lt;/a&gt; is like carrying extra luggage on a long hike. You’ll get tired faster, and it’s just not worth the weight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="4427" data-end="4461"&gt;6) You keep your sense of humor&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4463" data-end="4531"&gt;Ever noticed that people who can laugh at themselves seem ageless?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4533" data-end="4612"&gt;A good sense of humor isn’t just charming—it’s a powerful psychological tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4614" data-end="4799"&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8496883/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Research shows&lt;/a&gt; that humor helps reduce stress hormones, strengthens the immune system, and even improves memory in older adults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4801" data-end="4902"&gt;But beyond the science, there’s something timeless about not taking life—or yourself—too seriously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4904" data-end="5041"&gt;If you can find the funny side when things go sideways, you’re showing resilience and flexibility—two traits that define healthy aging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="5043" data-end="5079"&gt;7) You’re comfortable with change&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5081" data-end="5185"&gt;Remember how you used to resist change in your 20s because you thought you had everything figured out?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5187" data-end="5247"&gt;Then life showed you that nothing stays the same for long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5249" data-end="5492"&gt;People who age well aren’t necessarily the ones with the easiest lives—they’re the ones who adapt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5249" data-end="5492"&gt;Psychologists call this psychological flexibility, and it’s been linked to better &lt;a href="https://vegoutmag.com/lifestyle/n-5-things-i-do-for-my-mental-health-in-my-50s-that-i-didnt-do-in-my-30s/"&gt;mental health&lt;/a&gt; and emotional stability across the lifespan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5494" data-end="5689"&gt;You might not love every transition, but you’ve learned to roll with them. Whether it’s a career shift, a breakup, or a move to a new city, you don’t cling to what was—you focus on what’s next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5691" data-end="5758"&gt;That mindset doesn’t just make life smoother. It makes it richer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="5760" data-end="5793"&gt;8) You know what truly matters&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5795" data-end="5829"&gt;And finally, here’s the big one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5831" data-end="5932"&gt;If you’ve started prioritizing meaning over metrics—depth over drama—you’re aging better than most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5934" data-end="6186"&gt;Psychology calls this “self-transcendence”: the ability to see beyond the ego and focus on what gives life genuine purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5934" data-end="6186"&gt;People who cultivate this sense of meaning tend to experience more peace, gratitude, and fulfillment, even in difficult times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6188" data-end="6326"&gt;Maybe that means spending more time with family, mentoring younger colleagues, or simply &lt;a href="https://vegoutmag.com/lifestyle/m-the-quiet-rebellion-of-slowing-down/"&gt;slowing down&lt;/a&gt; to appreciate your morning coffee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6328" data-end="6488"&gt;Whatever it looks like for you, that shift from chasing “more” to appreciating “enough” is one of the clearest signs of emotional maturity and graceful aging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="6490" data-end="6508"&gt;The bottom line&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6510" data-end="6606"&gt;Aging well has less to do with anti-wrinkle creams or supplements and more to do with mindset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6608" data-end="6708"&gt;It’s about curiosity, adaptability, connection, and a sense of &lt;a href="https://vegoutmag.com/lifestyle/gen-if-you-want-to-protect-your-peace-keep-these-10-things-private-at-all-costs/"&gt;inner peace&lt;/a&gt; that deepens with time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6710" data-end="6781"&gt;You can’t stop the clock—but you can decide how you meet each moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6783" data-end="6914"&gt;And maybe that’s the real secret: it’s not about staying young forever—it’s about growing older without losing your joy for life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Working in mental health, I often have people telling me that they're on medication for their mental health, so they don't need therapy (and vice versa) when &lt;b&gt;the most effective treatment for mental illnesses is a &lt;a href="https://bestmindbh.com/blog/how-do-medications-and-psychotherapy-work-together-the-life-changing-benefits-of-combining-medication-and-therapy/" target="_blank"&gt;combination&lt;/a&gt; of therapy and medication.&lt;/b&gt; For the bulk of people, they won't need to be on medication forever, either; it's just to help them through this tough stage."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—Anonymous, 31, Australia&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"&lt;b&gt;Severe mental illness is unlikely to be 'cured.'&lt;/b&gt; Recovery is not a black and white thing. Recovery is a gradual thing that looks different for each person. It could be unrealistic to expect your loved one, or yourself, to live exactly the same life as before the onset. But it's also unrealistic to think life with a severe mental illness can't be active and rewarding."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—Anonymous, Early 30s, California&lt;/p&gt;

And that's why taking magnesium oxide supplements was found to have lots of benefits, according to the research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;These included reducing lower tummy pain, bloating, straining - and making it easier to poo. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Regarding probiotics, the guidelines suggest some types can improve some symptoms but there is also a lack of research on the impact of many different probiotic strains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jdlrvG"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Up until now, guidance for doctors treating patients with constipation has been limited and outdated, and focused on advice to increase dietary fibre and water intake, say the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;The new recommendations are based on evidence from 75 clinical trials - all those available - which have been analysed by a panel of experts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Prof Kevin Whelan, senior research author and professor of dietetics at KCL, said the new guidance "marks a promising step towards empowering health professionals and their patients to manage constipation through diet". &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;He said this meant people suffering from constipation could now access up-to-date advice to help improve their symptoms, wellbeing and quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;The British Dietetic Association, which funded the project to produce the new guidelines, said they were an excellent resource for dietitians, doctors and nurses, and supported "a more diet-focused and evidence-based approach to the management of chronic constipation".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;The research and the new guidelines are published in the Journal of Human Nutrition &amp;amp; Dietetics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Mon, 13 Oct 2025 16:24:03 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWkFVX3lxTE9iRUsyVkVYNnBRUFlTSjBWb3h4VHd5aWNWMHliNlhOUUhFVFlOTF9QWHlpajBCY0pna0FMRVh1SUJUNWFUU1QxYnBWb2xmRXNVODN4TVlYeGlDQdIBX0FVX3lxTE5MMVIySjNOVkRoYlU1MGZob0RxbzdaSXlwa3J1WDBDcEY5eVlMdGFnOWQtNEp0SE5SX09scGhLZ1F3eVktbGJSVjYzbFFiRU9oNDR3RmdWT0NhQ2JyallB</guid></item><item><title>与大麻使用相关的基因揭示了与心理健康的关系-神经科学新闻</title><link>https://neurosciencenews.com/genetics-cannabis-mental-health-29804/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;Researchers analyzing data from over 130,000 participants have identified specific genes associated with cannabis use and its frequency, revealing strong links to psychiatric, cognitive, and physical health traits. The genes CADM2 and GRM3, already known for roles in brain communication and impulsivity, appear central to how individuals initiate and sustain cannabis use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also uncovered dozens of other genes tied to risk-taking, schizophrenia, and chronic illnesses such as diabetes and coronary artery disease. These findings could lead to new prevention strategies and potential therapeutic targets for cannabis use disorder, which currently has no approved drug treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Two Key Genes:&lt;/strong&gt; Cannabis use is linked to CADM2 and GRM3, genes involved in brain signaling and impulsivity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Broader Health Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; Genetic predisposition for cannabis use overlaps with over 100 psychiatric, cognitive, and physical traits.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Preventive Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; Findings could inform personalized strategies to predict and prevent cannabis use disorder.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;UCSD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;University of California San Diego of Medicine researchers, in collaboration with the genetic testing company 23andMe, have identified regions of the human genome associated with cannabis use, uncovering new relationships with psychiatric, cognitive and physical health&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings may inform the development of prevention and treatment strategies for cannabis use disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-113344"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/cud-genetics-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/cud-genetics-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/cud-genetics-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/cud-genetics-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/cud-genetics-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/cud-genetics-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/cud-genetics-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/cud-genetics-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain, DNA, and leaves." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/cud-genetics-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/cud-genetics-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/cud-genetics-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/cud-genetics-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/cud-genetics-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/cud-genetics-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/cud-genetics-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;There are currently no FDA-approved drug therapies to treat cannabis use disorder. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was published on October 13, 2025 in &lt;em&gt;Molecular Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Cannabis is widely used, but its long-term effects on health remain poorly characterized,” said Sandra Sanchez-Roige, Ph.D., associate professor of psychiatry at UC San Diego School of Medicine and senior author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers were also interested in the relationship between genetics and traits that contribute to the development of cannabis use disorder, which can interfere with a person’s daily life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While most people who try cannabis do not go on to develop cannabis use disorder, some studies estimate that nearly 30% will,” said Sanchez-Roige.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Understanding the genetics of early-stage behaviors may help clarify who is at greater risk, opening the door to prevention and intervention strategies.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) analyzing relationships between cannabis use and genetic data provided by 131,895 23andMe research participants. They answered survey questions about whether or not they had ever used cannabis, and those who answered yes were also asked how frequently they used the drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’ve known for decades that genetic factors influence whether or not people will try drugs, how frequently they use those drugs, and the risk that they will become addicted to them,” said Abraham A. Palmer, Ph.D., professor and vice chair for basic research in the department of psychiatry at UC San Diego School of Medicine and co-author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Genetic tools like GWAS help us identify the molecular systems that connect cannabis use to brain function and behavior.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study found that lifetime cannabis use was associated with two genes. The first was Cell Adhesion Molecule 2 (&lt;em&gt;CADM2&lt;/em&gt;), a gene involved in cell assembly and in signaling between nerve cells, particularly in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous studies have linked &lt;em&gt;CADM2&lt;/em&gt; to various traits and conditions, including impulsive personality, obesity and cancer metastasis. Frequency of cannabis use was also found to be associated with the &lt;em&gt;CADM2&lt;/em&gt; gene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second gene was Metabotropic Glutamate Receptor 3 (&lt;em&gt;GRM3&lt;/em&gt;), which is involved in communication between neurons and long-term brain plasticity. &lt;em&gt;GRM3&lt;/em&gt; has already been linked to psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We showed that the genetics of cannabis use — both trying it and using it more often — are tied to the genetics of other psychiatric traits, cognitive measures, and even physical health problems,” said Sanchez-Roige.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A secondary analysis revealed an additional 40 genes associated with lifetime cannabis use and four genes associated with frequency of cannabis use. Twenty-nine of these genes had not previously been associated with cannabis-related traits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers then analyzed which health conditions were correlated with a genetic predisposition for cannabis use. They analyzed thousands of traits in two large independent datasets from the National Institutes of Health’s (NIH) &lt;em&gt;All of Us Research Program&lt;/em&gt; and Vanderbilt University Medical Center’s biobank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across the genome, lifetime cannabis use and frequency of cannabis use were genetically correlated with more than 100 different traits including psychiatric conditions (e.g., schizophrenia, ADHD, anxiety and depression), cognitive traits (e.g., executive function and risk-taking) and physical health (e.g., diabetes, chronic pain and coronary artery disease).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They were also associated with an increased risk for tobacco use, infectious diseases including HIV and viral hepatitis, and autoimmune diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is one of the first genome-wide association studies to examine behaviors that precede cannabis use disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Cannabis use exists on a continuum,” said first author Hayley Thorpe, Ph.D., a visiting scholar in Sanchez-Roige’s lab and postdoctoral researcher at Western University. “By studying these intermediate traits, we can begin to map how genetic risk unfolds before cannabis use disorder develops.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are currently no FDA-approved drug therapies to treat cannabis use disorder. The authors hope that the biological discoveries generated by GWAS will support future efforts to identify therapeutic targets and preventative interventions against the disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional co-authors on the study include: John J.

        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the case of marine mammals, the researchers say it appears that Alzheimer's-type neuropathology and disorientation may result from "chronic exposure" to toxic molecules produced by cyanobacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies of villagers on the Pacific island of Guam show that chronic dietary exposure to cyanobacterial toxins is associated with misfolded tau proteins and amyloid plaques characteristic of Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists say the cyanobacterial toxin BMAA, as well as 2,4-Diaminobutyric acid (2,4-DAB), and N-2-aminoethylglycine (AEG), have been found to be extremely toxic to neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They explained that BMAA triggers Alzheimer’s-like neuropathology and cognitive loss in animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The toxins can be "biomagnified" up the food chain in the marine ecosystem, according to research published in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/commsbio/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Communications Biology&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_middle" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study of 20 common &lt;a href="https://talker.news/2024/10/16/scientists-detect-microplastics-in-dolphins-breath-for-first-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;bottlenose dolphins&lt;/a&gt; stranded in the Indian River Lagoon in eastern Florida showed that their brains contained BMAA and 2,4-DAB.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="inline-asset inline-image layout-horizontal  subscriber-hide  tnt-inline-asset tnt-inline-relcontent tnt-inline-image tnt-inline-relation-child tnt-inline-presentation-default tnt-inline-alignment-default tnt-inline-width-default"&gt;&lt;figure class="photo layout-horizontal hover-expand letterbox-style-default"&gt;&lt;span class="expand hidden-print" data-toggle="modal" data-photo-target=".photo-06daf692-87e6-5fc5-90b9-b195578a743a" data-instance="#gallery-items-9416e610-8a7d-5bad-ad48-db1521eca899-photo-modal" data-target="#photo-carousel-9416e610-8a7d-5bad-ad48-db1521eca899"&gt;

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There are thousands of different types of chili peppers, with some estimates suggesting over 4,000 varieties. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the 2020 study, the researchers noted that the type of chili pepper and amount consumed was variable among the studies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The research involved a meta‑analysis of four large observational studies comparing people who consumed chili pepper vs. those who rarely or never did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The individual studies were based on self‑reported diet and chili consumption (not controlled interventions), and the amount, type, or frequency of chili pepper use was not standardized across the studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This made it difficult to draw conclusions about exactly how much, how often and which type of chili pepper consumption may be associated with health benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Senior author Dr Bo Xu, a cardiologist at the Cleveland Clinic's Heart, Vascular &amp;amp; Thoracic Institute in Cleveland, Ohio, said at the time that the findings highlighted that 'dietary factors may play an important role in overall health'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He added: 'The exact reasons and mechanisms that might explain our findings, though, are currently unknown. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Therefore, it is impossible to conclusively say that eating more chili pepper can prolong life and reduce deaths, especially from cardiovascular factors or cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'More research, especially evidence from randomized controlled studies, is needed to confirm these preliminary findings.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other research has suggested regularly eating chilis may protect against dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Previous studies have found the food has an anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anticancer and blood-glucose regulating effect due to capsaicin, which gives chili pepper its characteristic spice (stock) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A separate 2020 study in mice by scientists in Canada found that feeding them treats made with capsaicin protected against the formation of amyloid plaques, the harmful deposits thought to be responsible for the symptoms of Alzheimer’s, including memory loss and mood swings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Writing in the journal Translational Psychiatry, the researchers said, as well as blocking plaque formation, capsaicin appeared to dampen down inflammation in the brain, also linked to cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Chili peppers aren't the first or only food Johnson promotes. He is also a big advocate of extra virgin olive oil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He&lt;span&gt; has said he consumes a tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil with every meal, every day.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The 48-year-old (pictured, right, with his son) claims to be more than a decade younger biologically than his actual age&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In a YouTube video the health influencer listed what the criteria is to meet the standards for extra virgin olive oil to be beneficial for health, with it needing to be cold pressed, containing polyphenols, oleic acid, third-party testing, harvest date and UV protectant. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to Healthline, extra virgin olive oil is nutritious and contains powerful antioxidants, as well as strong anti-inflammatory properties and may help reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes and fight Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'When you eat it causes damage in your body,' Johnson explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I recently learned it myself, and so EVOO is protective against that damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Studies show improvements in weight management, blood pressure, blood sugar levels, cholesterol, heart health, brain health and mood.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He claimed: 'The scientific evidence is compelling, [and] extra virgin olive oil is in an elite category.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 13 Oct 2025 15:38:28 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipwFBVV95cUxOdUZUYXhOZWtYVDc1Qmljb0RUZmc4UFFxYjQzVXJmSzdia0VGY0RFQzF4aUVNSk9YVDNQTzdXV3AycWJTNThzVGVUS2JIbWhBNmppdl9ZeFI1amtpdURTeXlramFPMmFEcjB3dXI5X1NnZUFkQXR5N281djd0elpNb0VNS19hb2h1X1ZsYmUwYjlyekdvczJLOUJ3OEdLOHI3amRpMC04RdIBrAFBVV95cUxNWVhSSXJnbjJ0bWtsQ25YU25YcjRpdldpUEVTTklkNDJsYkQ5QUlRczh1THZZaE0yTVU4dnlIQmRLTFd5bldYNEJoRXhHbGhIdklzQnB0Vk1rWk9hM0o0MVdSZWhaQVZfVlo5Q1FLeng3enFIRDlBQ1Vwa3BoLU5zaU5FVjJHRXBRRFI3bDNwMUNkWm1vTTBMYWFwZ1ZMc1I5bDJDbktLTUpoWTND</guid></item><item><title>科学家们启动了$ 1420万的项目来解码人体的“隐藏的第六感” -SciTechDaily</title><link>https://scitechdaily.com/scientists-begin-14-2-million-project-to-decode-the-bodys-hidden-sixth-sense/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SciTechDaily</author><pubDate>Mon, 13 Oct 2025 15:27:39 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipAFBVV95cUxOQUNTUGw5N2JHeG1nWjVnYWl3Q2ZCal8tQ1lxUnNvdmhlaE0xSFZ4aXVYX0pnMlFYY0NPMXV0bUxfY0laclZBTGM2SHpOUTI5bHlUQkZCTFBkTE5aS0NxWGpJd01jWHI1Sjc2UHBkSWtTMXFqLUZaNUtCRHZQSzVWNVh6di0xVDIyb1RORC1LWjdiSWpHeFZwUm5mTmpTQ2JrQnRKaQ</guid></item><item><title>为什么人们使用大麻或对大麻上瘾？一项新的研究提供了线索。-《华盛顿邮报》</title><link>https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/10/13/cannabis-marijuana-addiction-genes-study/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="7AD2W4E55NB2LFDDRAKNJOYWV4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The tendency to use cannabis is associated with genes linked to impulsive behavior, obesity, schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, among other traits, according to a study released Monday by researchers at the University of California at San Diego.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Washington Post</author><pubDate>Mon, 13 Oct 2025 15:17:44 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilAFBVV95cUxQQTYtakE3U3Q1d2dFaXBQWG94Mjg0ZEt4Q1ptZlJZNkV5RVItT0VveGg0ZXYyWHg0bXVib3FyZ0x3M0p1RHBpQTdRTFBfNGdhSTZnYzRXNVhaRDBUQk9oZkgwb2d2OVZfZFl3eXdqX3VWV1pocWRRcWN5SUhGNjAwZWM1ZHJqYjEtVnJUZ0RwZXlmZUxI</guid></item><item><title>五种富含“保护性”纤维的蔬菜，可保护身体免受糖的损害-印度时报</title><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/five-vegetables-rich-in-protective-fiber-that-guards-the-body-against-sugar-damage/photostory/124530751.cms</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="COQxt" data-ua-type="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, as per the findings published in Nature Metabolism the fiber not only aids in digestion but also in how the body handles sugar at a molecular level. Lead researcher Cholsoon Jang, PhD, of UCI’s Nutrient Metabolism &amp;amp; Disease Lab and his team discovered that when people eat fructose, gut bacteria in the small intestine metabolizes it before it reaches the liver. However, without enough fiber, the fructose "spills over" burdening the liver and triggering fat buildup. By feeding the gut bacteria with inulin, researchers found that microbes burn through fructose early, stopping the cycle beforehand. One of these bacteria was even able to reverse signs of fatty liver disease, reducing fat accumulation and boosting the liver’s natural antioxidants.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Mon, 13 Oct 2025 15:09:56 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>大多数成年人没有吃足够的蔬菜-这里是您实际需要多少才能更健康地衰老-非常简单</title><link>https://www.realsimple.com/how-many-vegetables-per-day-for-healthier-aging-11826969</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="realsimple-sc-page_1-0" class="comp realsimple-sc-page mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There's no denying that a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/how-to-start-eating-healthier-8425807" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;healthy diet&lt;/a&gt; isn’t complete without a hearty amount of vegetables. “Consuming the daily recommended amount of vegetables ensures you receive the vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants for good health—[reducing the] risk of chronic diseases and [improving] wellbeing,” explains registered dietitian &lt;a href="https://www.360girlsandwomen.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Sue-Ellen Anderson-Haynes&lt;/a&gt;, MS, RDN. It matters less the type of vegetable you’re eating—as most are packed with enough vitamins, minerals, and fiber to reach your health goals—but what's more important is how much you’re eating per day. While you probably know that vegetables &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/simple-healthy-habits-11690833" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;promote good health&lt;/a&gt;, you may still be wondering about the daily recommended amount. Read on to find out what a dietitian recommends.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “The amount of vegetables you should eat depends on many factors such as your sex, age, [and] physical activity,” Anderson-Haynes says. “In general, adults should aim to consume about two to three cups of vegetables per day. A rule of thumb is to make half your plate veggies—this way you will meet or exceed that recommendation.” It’s up to you whether you consume the recommended amount of vegetables at once or if you spread them out between meals. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Currently, only 1 in 10 adults are meeting the daily fruit and vegetable recommendations according to the CDC,” Anderson-Haynes says, meaning most people are eating an insufficient amount of vegetables per day. While eating the daily recommended value of &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/vitamins-and-nutrients-for-longevity-8775736" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;essential nutrients&lt;/a&gt; is much easier said than done, paying more attention to how many vegetables you’re eating during each meal can help you improve your goals and increase your overall intake. The more colorful your plate, the better!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Simply put, the more vegetables you eat, the better your internal and external bodily systems will age. “Consuming vegetables daily not only gives you an outer glow but inner glow as well: allowing maintenance of a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/best-foods-for-gut-health-7098940" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;healthy gut microbiome&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/anti-inflammatory-foods-11684448" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;reducing risk of inflammation&lt;/a&gt;, supporting a healthy weight, satiety, bowel regularity, and providing [heart] disease risk reduction.” By eating the daily recommended amount of vegetables, you’re investing in optimal health for your current and future self.

   &lt;p&gt;Preteens using increasing amounts of social media perform poorer in reading, vocabulary and memory tests in early adolescence compared with those who use no or little social media. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That's according to a new study that suggests a link between social media use and poorer cognition in teens. The &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/10.1001/jama.2025.16613?guestAccessKey=c8bce59a-f799-4c36-817e-dd2c05cf6ae4&amp;amp;utm_source=for_the_media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;amp;utm_term=101325" target="_blank"&gt;findings are published in &lt;em&gt;JAMA&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"This is a really exciting study," says psychologist &lt;a href="https://mitch.web.unc.edu/" target="_blank"&gt;Mitch Prinstein&lt;/a&gt; at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, who wasn't involved in the new research.&lt;/p&gt;   
   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"It confirms a lot of what we have been hearing about from schools all across the country, which is that kids are just having a really hard time focusing on being able to learn as well as they used to, because of the ways in which social media has changed their ability to process information, perhaps."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;While most previous research has focused on the impact of social media use on kids' mental health, "it's critical to understand how social media use during school hours specifically affects learning, especially as so many schools are considering phone bans right now," says study author and pediatrician &lt;a href="https://profiles.ucsf.edu/jason.nagata" target="_blank"&gt;Jason Nagata&lt;/a&gt; of the University of California, San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;A look at reading and memory &lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;To understand that, Nagata and his colleagues used data from one of the largest ongoing studies on adolescents, called the &lt;a href="https://abcdstudy.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study&lt;/a&gt;. Scientists have been following thousands of preteens as they go through adolescence to understand the development of their brains.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;The ongoing study has been surveying kids about their social media use every year and giving them a range of tests for learning and memory every other year. Nagata and his colleagues used data on over 6,000 children, ages 9 to 10, as scientists followed them through early adolescence.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;They classified the kids into three groups based on their evolving patterns of social media use. The biggest group, consisting of about 58% of the kids, used little or no social media over the next few years. The second-largest group, about 37% of kids, started out with low-level use of social media, but by the time they turned 13, they were spending about an hour each day on social media. &lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The remaining 6% of kids — called the "high increasing social media group" — were spending about three or more hours a day by age 13.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;"The dosage effect"&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;All the groups were given a range of tests to measure their cognitive functioning at the start of the study and in early adolescence. For example, the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7659464/" target="_blank"&gt;oral reading recognition test&lt;/a&gt; examined their reading and vocabulary skills. Another test, called the &lt;a href="https://nihtoolbox.org/test/picture-vocabulary-test/" target="_blank"&gt;picture vocabulary test&lt;/a&gt;, had them match the right pictures to words they heard.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"What was notable actually to me and perhaps surprising was that even the low [increasing] social media users, so those who had about one hour a day by age 13, did perform on average 1 to 2 points lower on the reading and memory tasks compared to the non-social media users," says Nagata.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And the high increasing group performed up to 4 to 5 points lower than the non-social media users.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"So those who had the highest social media use have lower scores," notes Nagata, "but even the low users had smaller differences in their cognitive scores."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"That really speaks to the dosage effect of these [apps]," says psychologist &lt;a href="https://madiganlab.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Sheri Madigan&lt;/a&gt; at the University of Calgary, who wrote an &lt;a href="https://media.jamanetwork.com/wp-content/handlers/downloader.php?a=119641" target="_blank"&gt;accompanying editorial &lt;/a&gt;for the study. "It's problematic at really high uses, but it's also problematic at even in small doses."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;While a difference of a few points in test scores may seem insignificant, "it's important to understand that kids are a moving target," explains Prinstein, who is also &lt;a href="https://www.apa.org/about/apa/senior-staff/prinstein-bio" target="_blank"&gt;chief of psychology strategy and integration&lt;/a&gt; at the American Psychological Association.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Even a slight change in what they look like after a short period of time means that they're kind of now pointed on a trajectory that is different from others. That means that two, three, five years from now, we might be talking about some very significant gaps between kids who might have been heavy users or not as heavy users."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;And &lt;a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2025/07/10/10-facts-about-teens-and-social-media/" target="_blank"&gt;other recent research&lt;/a&gt; shows that hours on social media increase later in adolescence, notes Nagata. "We would expect that when they hit age 15, 16, 17, their use will be much higher," which might lead to even larger gaps in cognition and learning in later years, he adds.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In earlier studies, Nagata's team has used the same data from the ABCD Study and found other disturbing trends among underage social media users.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;They &lt;a href="https://www.academicpedsjnl.net/article/S1876-2859(25)00009-9/fulltext" target="_blank"&gt;found that a majority of kids&lt;/a&gt; — nearly two-thirds — start using social media before they turn 13, with the average user having three social media accounts.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;They also found &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9243697/" target="_blank"&gt;high levels of addiction-like symptoms&lt;/a&gt; with smartphones among 10-to-14-year-olds.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Half the kids who had smartphones said that they lose track of how much time they're using their phone," says Nagata. "A quarter who are using social media say they use social media to forget about their problems. And 11% say that social media use has negatively affected their schoolwork."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;An important time for brain development&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Adolescence is a critical period for brain development, notes Prinstein, when the brain is fine-tuning its architecture based on experiences.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"After the first year of life, the adolescent period is the time where we see the most growth and the biggest reorganization of the brain in our lifetimes," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2799812" target="_blank"&gt;recent study&lt;/a&gt;, Prinstein and his colleagues found that teens who are heavy social media users have brains that are more attuned to an existence on social media, with its "rapid, constant feedback," says Prinstein. "What we're finding is that kids become hypersensitive to the kinds of likes, comments, feedback and rewards they might get from peers."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Those findings help explain the results of the new studies, he adds. "It makes perfect sense that if their brain is growing to be optimized for social media activities, it might not be optimized for other things they need to do, like we saw in the [new] study."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The new study also "gives us good-enough evidence that we really need to create some policies that are really specific around creating age limits, for example, on social media apps," says Madigan.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Denmark announced last week that it plans to enforce a &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/08/tech/denmark-children-social-media-ban-scli-intl" target="_blank"&gt;social media ban for users under age 15&lt;/a&gt;, she notes. Australia is requiring social media companies to "take reasonable steps to prevent Australians under the age of 16 from creating or keeping an account" starting December 2025.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Madigan hopes other countries will take note. "I think that we'll see a trickle effect on that. That's going to be really beneficial for kids."&lt;/p&gt;

This tick is especially devastating to cattle and it is important for farmers to be on the lookout,” said Raghu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stephen Young, an entomologist with an Iowa-based USDA lab, wrote Raghu recently noting: “This is likely the first record of Asian longhorned tick in Butler County, Ohio pending verification by other USDA sources.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a late June &lt;a class="Link" href="https://odh.ohio.gov/know-our-programs/zoonotic-disease-program/media/longhorned-tick-distribution-map"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; by the Ohio Department of Health (ODH), the single-digit cases of the tick had been reported in 14 southeast Ohio counties, with none being farther west of that region than Franklin County in Central Ohio and Pike and Ross counties in the state’s south-central region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were no ODH reports of the tick in Butler or other southwest and west-central counties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adding to the problematic nature of the tick is a rapid reproduction rate, said Raghu, because the species’ females are asexual and can reproduce without males.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The female doesn’t have to mate before she can lay thousands of tick eggs.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is a completely different species that isn’t found in our area. And from my talks with experts, this is not going away and will just become more prevalent,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The problem is that the ticks can carry really bad infectious diseases. When a tick bites and it is allowed to feed (on its host) for more than 24 hours, that is when whatever infectious disease it is harboring spreads through their saliva.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Hamilton-based dog was treated and doing fine, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To avoid all species of ticks on dogs and cats, Raghu recommends using tick prevention drugs and other applications year around – not just in the warmer months – and to keep dogs and cats from walking in long grass and taller plants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Every dolphin studied from Florida’s Indian River Lagoon had a brain toxin called 2,4-DAB.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Toxin levels were roughly 3,000 times higher during summer algal bloom months.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Dolphins’ brains showed the same Alzheimer’s-related proteins and gene activity seen in humans.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Scientists say these animals may be warning us about neurotoxin risks in warming coastal waters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MIAMI —&lt;/strong&gt; Less than 200 miles from Miami-Dade County, the place with the highest number of Alzheimer’s patients in America, dolphins are washing up dead with brains full of toxins and riddled with the same disease signatures. Scientists say these marine mammals may be sounding an alarm about coastal waters that millions of people depend on for food and recreation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Florida’s &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/dolphins/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;bottlenose dolphins&lt;/a&gt; have long been considered sentinels for environmental dangers that could affect people. As long-lived mammals at the top of the food chain, they accumulate toxins the same way humans do when eating seafood. Now, research published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s42003-025-08796-0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Communications Biology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; reveals that 20 dolphins stranded along Florida’s Indian River Lagoon between 2010 and 2019 all tested positive for a brain toxin called 2,4-diaminobutyric acid (2,4-DAB). Their brains showed the genetic and physical hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The proximity raises questions. Miami-Dade County recorded the highest prevalence of people living with &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/alzheimers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/a&gt; in the United States in 2024. Whether there’s any connection between human cases and what’s happening to dolphins in nearby waters remains unknown, but the parallels are unsettling enough that researchers are calling for investigation into how harmful &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/toxic-algae-blooms-clilmate-change/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;algal bloom&lt;/a&gt; toxins might be impacting human brain health.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dolphins are particularly valuable for understanding Alzheimer’s risk because they naturally develop the disease’s two main brain changes as they age: &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/amyloid-beta/"&gt;amyloid-beta plaques&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/game-changing-blood-test-alzheimers-tau-tangles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;tau tangles&lt;/a&gt;. When researchers examined dolphin brain tissue under a microscope, they found these same abnormalities. Amyloid-beta deposits scattered through the cortex. Neurons filled with abnormal tau protein. TDP-43 inclusions inside cells and around blood vessels. The physical evidence matched what pathologists see in human Alzheimer’s brains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Summer Blooms Bring Thousandfold Toxin Spike&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers from Hubbs-SeaWorld Research Institute, the University of Miami, and Brain Chemistry Labs examined dolphins that stranded along a 155-kilometer stretch of Florida’s east coast. When they measured brain concentrations of 2,4-DAB, the pattern was stark: during summer bloom months (June through November, when water is warmest), toxin levels were roughly three thousand times higher than during winter months when blooms are minimal.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This neurotoxin comes from microscopic organisms that create harmful algal blooms, those thick mats of cyanobacteria that have plagued the Indian River Lagoon for 15 years. As &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/climate-change/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;climate change&lt;/a&gt; heats coastal waters, these blooms start earlier and last longer. Florida has recorded some of its warmest surface temperatures in modern history over the past decade.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Toxins move up the food chain, concentrating in small fish that larger predators eat. A dolphin consuming many fish per day accumulates substantial amounts over time, and the toxins end up in brain tissue. Similar processes happen when people regularly &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/seafood/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;eat seafood&lt;/a&gt; from bloom-affected waters.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Genetic Changes Mirror Human Alzheimer’s Disease&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When scientists analyzed the complete set of active genes in these dolphin brains, they identified 536 genes with significantly different expression levels between bloom and non-bloom seasons. Many were the same genes disrupted in human &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/alzheimers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dolphins showed decreased activity in genes that produce glutamate decarboxylase, an enzyme responsible for making GABA (a neurotransmitter that helps calm brain activity). Meanwhile, 2,4-DAB appears to block the enzyme that breaks GABA down, creating a chemical imbalance. In human &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/pee-alzheimers-memory-loss/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Alzheimer’s patients&lt;/a&gt;, this same enzyme shows reduced function.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers also found increased activity in genes related to laminin-3, a protein that helps maintain the blood-brain barrier. Elevated levels could signal that this protective shield (which keeps toxins out of neural tissue) is compromised. In human Alzheimer’s patients, the same protein shows up in disease-related plaques.&lt;/p&gt;

(Credit: David Davis)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Three genes particularly stood out. APP produces amyloid precursor protein, which breaks down into toxic peptides that form plaques. MAPT makes tau protein, which tangles in the neurons of dementia patients. TARDBP creates TDP-43, a protein that clumps abnormally in more than half of Alzheimer’s cases with rapid progression. All three showed increased expression in dolphins exposed to higher toxin levels.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Perhaps most concerning was the temporal pattern. Researchers identified 15 genes whose expression correlated with both the amount of toxin in the brain and the year the dolphin stranded. Effects appeared to intensify with each subsequent &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/toxin-in-the-air-algae-blooms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;bloom season&lt;/a&gt;, as if brains were accumulating damage over time. Among these genes were AGER (which encodes a receptor involved in Alzheimer’s disease) and ARHGEF19 (linked to neurological disorders).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dolphins also showed increased expression of the APOE gene, up to 6.5-fold in some animals. In humans, certain versions of APOE are the strongest genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Why This Neurotoxin Matters&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Originally described decades ago, 2,4-DAB provokes tremors, convulsions, and hyperirritability within hours in animal studies. It’s a structural cousin of BMAA (beta-N-methylamino-L-alanine), another algal toxin detected in the brains of human Alzheimer’s patients. Scientists believe 2,4-DAB may be even more toxic than BMAA.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When researchers compared dolphin gene expression data with databases of genes affected by &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/vitamin-sea-scientists-create-way-to-supercharge-shellfish-with-nutrients/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;shellfish&lt;/a&gt; poisoning (caused by other algal toxins), they found that 98% of the dolphin genes overlapped with Alzheimer’s disease, while only 42% overlapped with both conditions. None overlapped exclusively with shellfish poisoning, which means the changes observed were more closely related to neurodegeneration than to acute toxic illness.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Harmful algal blooms are not unique to &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/florida/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt;. As the planet warms, they’re increasing worldwide in both frequency and intensity. Coastal communities from &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/california/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/forever-chemicals-great-lakes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Great Lakes&lt;/a&gt; to the Gulf Coast are dealing with blooms that once were rare or nonexistent.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;People who live near affected waters, who fish recreationally or commercially, or who eat seafood from bloom-affected areas could face exposures similar to what dolphins experience. Toxins accumulate in fish tissue. They can become aerosolized in sea spray. They persist in the environment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Questions naturally follow. Could repeated exposure to algal neurotoxins over years or decades increase Alzheimer’s risk in people? Are certain populations at higher risk based on where they live and what they eat? Should public health officials be monitoring neurotoxin levels in seafood more closely?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Miami-Dade County’s high Alzheimer’s prevalence could reflect many factors: an aging population, genetic backgrounds, healthcare access, environmental exposures. But the county sits on the coast, near waters experiencing repeated harmful algal blooms and hosting dolphins with toxin-damaged brains showing &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/alzheimers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Alzheimer’s signatures&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sentinel species exist for a reason. Canaries in coal mines died from carbon monoxide before miners felt the effects, providing a warning. &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/dolphins/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Dolphins&lt;/a&gt; accumulating brain toxins and developing Alzheimer’s signatures in waters near major population centers may be offering a similar alert. As bloom seasons lengthen and intensify with climate change, these marine mammals are delivering a message from the warming water that coastal communities and public health officials need to hear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-paper-summary"&gt;Paper Summary&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-methodology"&gt;Methodology&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers examined 20 common bottlenose dolphins that stranded along Florida’s Indian River Lagoon between 2010 and 2019, classifying them by stranding date into non-bloom season (December–May, 11 dolphins) and bloom season (June–November, 9 dolphins). From each dolphin, they extracted brain tissue and tested it for neurotoxins using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry, performed whole transcriptome sequencing to analyze gene expression differences, used quantitative PCR to measure seven Alzheimer’s-related genes, and prepared tissue slides to visualize Alzheimer’s-like protein changes under a microscope.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-results"&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Every dolphin tested positive for 2,4-DAB, with bloom-season dolphins showing median brain concentrations approximately 2,900 times higher than non-bloom dolphins. Transcriptome analysis identified 536 differentially expressed genes, with decreased glutamate decarboxylase activity (GABA production) and increased laminin-3 complex expression (blood-brain barrier components). Three key Alzheimer’s genes—APP, MAPT, and TARDBP—showed increased expression correlating with toxin levels, and microscopic examination revealed Alzheimer’s-like changes in all dolphins including amyloid-beta deposits, phosphorylated tau, and TDP-43 inclusions. Fifteen genes showed expression patterns correlating with both toxin concentration and stranding year, intensifying with each bloom season, while APOE gene expression increased up to 6.5-fold in some bloom-season dolphins.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-limitations"&gt;Limitations&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The small sample size of 20 dolphins collected opportunistically over nine years limited statistical power, and researchers could not control for all variables affecting brain health or assess neurological function in living animals. The study could not establish direct cause-and-effect relationships between toxin exposure and brain changes, only correlations, and not all samples included tissue from both brain regions. While dolphins serve as sentinel species for environmental health, differences between dolphin and human biology mean findings cannot be directly extrapolated to human health risks without additional research.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-funding-and-disclosures"&gt;Funding and Disclosures&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This work was funded in part by the Herbert W. Hoover Foundation, the John H. Prescott Marine Mammal Rescue Assistance Grant, the SeaWorld Busch Gardens Conservation Fund, Discover Florida Ocean’s License Plate, and the Brevard County Tourism and Development Council.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Low cholesterol can reduce the risk of dementia, a new University of Bristol-led study with more than a million participants has shown.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                &lt;p class="w-100 my-4 d-print-none"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;The research, led by Dr. Liv Tybjærg Nordestgaard while at the University of Bristol and the Department of Clinical Biochemistry at Copenhagen University Hospital—Herlev and Gentofte, found that people with certain genetic variants that naturally &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/lower+cholesterol/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;lower cholesterol&lt;/a&gt; have a lower risk of developing &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/dementia/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;dementia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study, which is based on data from over a million people in Denmark, England, and Finland, has been &lt;a href="https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/alz.70638" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;i&gt;Alzheimer's &amp;amp; Dementia&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people are born with genetic variants that naturally affect the same proteins targeted by cholesterol-lowering drugs, such as statins and ezetimibe. To test the effect of cholesterol-lowering medication on the risk of dementia, the researchers used a method called Mendelian Randomization—this genetic analysis technique allowed them to mimic the effects of these drugs to investigate how they influence the risk of dementia, while minimizing the influence of confounding factors like weight, diet, and other lifestyle habits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By comparing these individuals to individuals without these genetic variants, the researchers were able to measure differences in the risk of dementia. They found reducing the amount of cholesterol in the blood by a small amount (one millimole per liter) to be associated with up to 80% reduction in risk of developing dementia for certain drug targets.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;"What our study indicates is that if you have these variants that lower your cholesterol, it looks like you have a significantly lower risk of developing dementia," said Dr. Nordestgaard, who now works in the Department of Clinical Biochemistry at Copenhagen University Hospital—Bispebjerg and Frederiksberg hospital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results suggest that having &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/low+cholesterol/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;low cholesterol&lt;/a&gt;, whether due to genes or &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/medical+treatment/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;medical treatment&lt;/a&gt;, can help reduce the risk of dementia. However, the study does not say anything definitive about the effect of the medicine itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the challenges is that dementia typically does not appear until late in life, and therefore research in the area typically requires a very long period of follow-up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is still not known exactly why &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/high+cholesterol/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;high cholesterol&lt;/a&gt; can increase the risk of dementia, but one possible explanation proposed by Dr. Nordestgaard is that high cholesterol can lead to &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/atherosclerosis/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;atherosclerosis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Atherosclerosis is a result of the accumulation of cholesterol in your &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/blood+vessels/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;blood vessels&lt;/a&gt;," Dr. Nordestgaard said. "It can be in both the body and the brain and increases the risk of forming small blood clots—one of the causes of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It would be a really good next step to carry out randomized clinical trials over 10 or 30 years, for example, where you give the participants cholesterol-lowering medication and then look at the risk of developing dementia," Dr. Nordestgaard added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study used data from the UK Biobank, the Copenhagen General Population Study, the Copenhagen City Heart Study, the FinnGen study, and the Global Lipids Genetics Consortium.&lt;/p&gt;
