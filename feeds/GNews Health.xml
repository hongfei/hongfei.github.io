Kennedy Jr. on February 25, 2025. (Photo by Jim Watson/AFP via Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;For vaccine opponents, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s appointment as secretary of health and human services represented something close to nirvana. It was a chance, finally, to take on Big Pharma and to bring their long-stigmatized beliefs into the political mainstream. Perhaps no one in the country has done more than Kennedy to convince people not to vaccinate themselves or their children. Now, he was going to be in charge of the country’s vaccine programs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;Those dreams came crashing down Sunday afternoon, when Kennedy visited the family of the second child to die in the Texas measles outbreak for a trip that was billed as an effort to better understand the federal response to the disease. Buried near the bottom of an X post about his visit, Kennedy &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1908967854394982414" rel&gt;conceded&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; that the measles vaccine is “the most effective way to prevent the spread of measles.” He also said the government was providing “needed MMR vaccines.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That statement went off like a bomb in MAHA-land, where it’s taken as scripture that basic sanitation and vitamin A are the real way to avoid measles, which (they add) isn’t that serious of a disease anyway. The replies to Kennedy’s tweet filled up with former supporters, prominent and not, who thought he had made a grievous error.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“There is no defense for this poorly worded statement,” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://x.com/BusyDrT/status/1909006120297124009" rel&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; Sherri Tenpenny, a prominent anti-vaccine activist who has &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://factcheck.afp.com/doc.afp.com.36YX9NM" rel&gt;called&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; concern about the measles outbreak “hysteria.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Kennedy has a long history of criticizing the measles vaccine, which—to be abundantly clear—is empirically effective and may well constitute one of the great medical breakthroughs of the twentieth century. He said in a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://x.com/SenseReceptor/status/1896700481579204635" rel&gt;video&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; recently released by his Children’s Health Defense group that it’s possible the measles vaccine is causing more deaths than measles itself. He’s been &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/25/opinion/rfk-jr-vaccines-samoa-measles.html" rel&gt;blamed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; for fueling anti-MMR vaccine sentiments in Samoa &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2024/07/how-rfk-jr-falsely-denied-his-connection-to-a-deadly-measles-outbreak-in-samoa/" rel&gt;before and during&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; a fall 2019 measles outbreak that ended up killing 83 people.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;As recently as last month, Kennedy did an interview with Fox News’s Sean Hannity at a Steak 'n Shake where he &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thebulwark.com/p/wheres-the-beef-tallow" rel&gt;expounded&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; on the supposed dangers of the measles vaccine.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Still, Kennedy’s supporters were already &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2025/03/rfks-flip-flop-on-the-measles-shot-is-ripping-the-anti-vax-world-apart/" rel&gt;growing restless&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; in early March, when he wrote an op-ed amid the measles outbreak saying the vaccine should be available to people who want it. Given his previous claims that the vaccine was actually harmful, they wondered, why would he now want to make it available?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Others groped for conspiracy theories to defend Kennedy. Kim Iversen, a former host of the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hill&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;’s daily talk show, speculated on her own show in March that nefarious forces were deliberately spreading the measles in Texas to make Kennedy look bad.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Did somebody go and release measles?” she &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://rumble.com/v6q2vkk-shocked-betrayed-rfk-jr.-flips-on-measles-vaccine-nato-trap-europe-could-dr.html" rel&gt;asked&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;As early as December 2024, Dr. Mary Bowden, a Houston doctor who was &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/suspended-texas-doctor-promoted-ivermectin-covid-treatment-resigns-hos-rcna5833" rel&gt;suspended&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; from her job for pushing COVID-19 misinformation, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://x.com/TheRiftTV/status/1908261647002591606" rel&gt;complained&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; on a podcast that Kennedy was ditching attacks on vaccines for the more politically palatable, blander “Make America Healthy Again” movement. She and other anti-vaccine activists worried that he and the incoming Trump administration would be more preoccupied with eliminating “Red Dye no. 4” and seed oils from the food supply than on going after vaccines.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“He’s our nuclear bomb—we’re in World War III, he’s going to take down Japan,” Bowden said in the podcast interview. “All of a sudden, the nuclear bomb—the target has shifted to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;food&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fury has only grown now that Kennedy managed to eke out one wholly positive statement about vaccines—whether because of bad press or because the death of a second child during the outbreak brought about his Damascene conversion. Former One America News host Liz Wheeler, whose YouTube channel has more than 400,000 subscribers, accused Kennedy of no longer being “based.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“What on earth is going on with Bobby Kennedy,” Wheeler &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://x.com/Liz_Wheeler/status/1909078816007536827" rel&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; in a post on X. “We voted for based. We didn’t vote for ‘needed MMR vaccines.’”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This brewing discontent with Kennedy among the MAHA faithful is also one of the forces behind the obviously fake but increasingly popular “RFK blackmail” conspiracy theory I &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thebulwark.com/p/when-owning-the-libs-matters-more-than-the-constitution-trump-third-term-maga-republicans-daily-wire" rel&gt;touched on last week&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. In this telling, Kennedy only stopped being “based” because someone—presumably Israel—is blackmailing him with some unspecified but damaging material.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is flimsy stuff even by the standards of these conspiracy theories—but if Kennedy continues to acknowledge the reality of the measles outbreak and the value of vaccines, I think it’ll become even more popular.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs='{"url":"https://www.thebulwark.com/subscribe?coupon=5e5ef02e&amp;amp;utm_content=160810591","text":"Get 30 day free trial","action":null,"class":null}' data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"&gt;&lt;a class="button primary" href="https://www.thebulwark.com/subscribe?coupon=5e5ef02e&amp;amp;utm_content=160810591" rel&gt;&lt;span&gt;Get 30 day free trial&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="captioned-image-container"&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fff79dd5c-73c8-497d-aae5-f3859757e421_4475x2983.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption class="image-caption"&gt;Virginia Lt.

Researchers recorded brain activity while participants completed a simple, low-effort learning task based on probability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, participants who let their minds drift performed just as well—if not better—than when fully focused. This suggests that passive states of mind, similar to sleep-like neural activity, can support certain types of unconscious learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Passive Learning Benefits:&lt;/strong&gt; Mind wandering didn’t harm performance and sometimes improved learning in low-attention tasks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brain Activity Link:&lt;/strong&gt; Sleep-like cortical oscillations were associated with better task performance during mind wandering.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spontaneity Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Spontaneous mind wandering was more beneficial than deliberate daydreaming.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;SfN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When people let their minds wander during tasks that require attention and active thinking, it can hurt how well they learn and perform the tasks. But there are more passive kinds of learning that require less attention. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Péter Simor, from Eötvös Loránd University, and colleagues explored how mind wandering influences learning in tasks requiring little attention in their &lt;em&gt;JNeurosci&lt;/em&gt; paper.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108435"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/daydreaming-passive-learning-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/daydreaming-passive-learning-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/daydreaming-passive-learning-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/daydreaming-passive-learning-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/daydreaming-passive-learning-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/daydreaming-passive-learning-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/daydreaming-passive-learning-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/daydreaming-passive-learning-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain and a person." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/daydreaming-passive-learning-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/daydreaming-passive-learning-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/daydreaming-passive-learning-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/daydreaming-passive-learning-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/daydreaming-passive-learning-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/daydreaming-passive-learning-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/daydreaming-passive-learning-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Thus, sleep-like neural activity linked to spontaneous mind wandering promotes learning in tasks that require minimal attention.  Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearly 40 study participants performed a simple learning task while the researchers recorded their brain activity. This simple task was used because participants could make predictions based off probabilities that they learned without awareness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mind wandering while doing the task did not worsen performance, and in some cases even enhanced learning. Spontaneous mind wandering was more beneficial to learning than deliberate mind wandering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During mind wandering and improvements in task learning, oscillatory neural activity in the cortex, resembling the brain activity that occurs during sleep or sleep-like states, occurred. Thus, sleep-like neural activity linked to spontaneous mind wandering promotes learning in tasks that require minimal attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Most cognitive work looks at learning when you are fully engaged. But in real life we spend so much time passively learning! As our brain needs sleep, maybe we also need passive ways of learning, or ‘wakeful rest,’ to recover from tasks that require your brain to be online and engaged,” says Simor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this learning and daydreaming research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#7f121a1b161e3f0c191151100d18" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;SfN Media&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://sfn.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;SfN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;SfN Media – SfN&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1421-24.2025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Mind Wandering During Implicit Learning is Associated with Increased Periodic EEG Activity and Improved Extraction of Hidden Probabilistic Patterns&lt;/a&gt;” by Péter Simor et al. &lt;em&gt;Journal of Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mind Wandering During Implicit Learning is Associated with Increased Periodic EEG Activity and Improved Extraction of Hidden Probabilistic Patterns&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mind wandering, occupying 30-50% of our waking time, remains an enigmatic phenomenon in cognitive neuroscience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A large number of studies showed a negative association between mind wandering and attention-demanding (model-based) tasks in both natural settings and laboratory conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mind wandering, however, does not seem to be detrimental for all cognitive domains, and was observed to benefit creativity and problem-solving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We examined if mind wandering may facilitate model-free processes, such as probabilistic learning, which relies on the automatic acquisition of statistical regularities with minimal attentional demands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We administered a well-established implicit probabilistic learning task combined with thought probes in healthy adults (N = 37, 30 females).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To explore the neural correlates of mind wandering and probabilistic learning, participants were fitted with high-density electroencephalography.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our findings indicate that probabilistic learning was not only immune to periods of mind wandering but was positively associated with it. Spontaneous, as opposed to deliberate mind wandering, was particularly beneficial for extracting the probabilistic patterns hidden in the visual stream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cortical oscillatory activity in the low-frequency (slow and delta) range, indicative of covert sleep-like states, was associated with both mind wandering and improved probabilistic learning, particularly in the early stages of the task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the importance of probabilistic implicit learning in predictive processing, our findings provide novel insights into the potential cognitive benefits of task-unrelated thoughts in addition to shedding light on its neural mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Mon, 07 Apr 2025 19:36:19 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMid0FVX3lxTE84SklhYkNxMGx0UDdRUDE4YmlGdWx1MVVMOTdsZzc2aGo1Skh0UWhDR0JtRGx2ZTVHUTB2WFNKN2pOTG5nZmc2WUZJVVBVLTNubGVud29GMHdoS1Q0djZ1RTNJZ0FGWWtiOTE1ZUYzNmNSWjkzQ2Y4</guid></item><item><title>Childhood Adversity Weakens Brain Connectivity, But Support Protects It - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif0FVX3lxTE9JeElxc2xob3otZC1MQ2duTVhlWF83NFdVM2d4c3NycmVuZ29RUEU3M2YwY2NzV1FnY0pMZnJFMkZHWWxrdm9GSWQtRDQyRXRubWNrNEJGMHowU1g0VUQ5ejZGeGdnRXEzZHlWYXJncWRxM1Zaa3l4ZmpaQVRoOUk?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;New research shows that difficult early-life experiences are linked to weaker white matter connections across the adolescent brain, which may lead to lower cognitive performance.

They develop over the course of childhood, and childhood experiences may drive individual differences in how white matter matures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lead author Sofia Carozza, PhD, and senior author Amar Dhand, MD, PhD, of the Department of Neurology at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, a founding member of the Mass General Brigham healthcare system, wanted to understand what role this process plays in cognition once children reach adolescence. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The aspects of white matter that show a relationship with our early life environment are much more pervasive throughout the brain than we’d thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Instead of being just one or two tracts that are important for cognition, the whole brain is related to the adversities that someone might experience early in life,” said Carozza.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team studied data from 9,082 children (about half of them girls, with an average age of 9.5) collected in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study, funded by the National Institutes of Health and conducted at 21 centers across the U.S., gathered information on brain activity and structure, cognitive abilities, environment, mood and mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers looked at several categories of early environmental factors, including prenatal risk factors, interpersonal adversity, household economic deprivation, neighborhood adversity, and social resiliency factors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carozza and Dhand used diffusion imaging scanning of the brain to measure fractional anisotropy (FA)—a way of estimating the integrity of the white matter connections—and streamline count, an estimate of their strength.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They then used a computational model to compare how these features of white matter were related to both childhood environmental factors and current cognitive abilities such as language skills and mental arithmetic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their analysis revealed widespread differences in white matter connections throughout the brain depending on the children’s early-life environments. In particular, the researchers found lower quality of white matter connections in parts of the brain tied to mental arithmetic and receptive language.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These white matter differences accounted for some of the relationship between adverse life experiences in early childhood and lower cognitive performance in adolescence.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are all embedded in an environment, and features of that environment such as our relationships, home life, neighborhood, or material circumstances can shape how our brains and bodies grow, which in turn affects what we can do with them,” said Carozza.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We should work to make sure that more people can have those stable, healthy home lives that the brain expects, especially in childhood.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers note that their study is based on observational data, which means they cannot draw strong causal conclusions. Brain imaging was also only available at a single timepoint, offering a snapshot but not allowing researchers to track changes over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prospective studies—following children over time and collecting brain imaging information at multiple time points—would be needed to more definitively connect adversity and cognitive performance.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Authorship:&lt;/strong&gt; In addition to Carozza and Dhand, Mass General Brigham authors include Isaiah Kletenik.

However, its role in the relationship between the early environment and later cognition is unclear, in part due to focus on changes in specific gray matter regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study examines white matter differences across adolescents from diverse environments, evaluating both their extent throughout the brain and their contribution to cognitive outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study (N = 9,082, female = 4,327), we found extensive cross-sectional associations with lower white matter fractional anisotropy (FA) and streamline count in the brains of 9- and 10-y-old children exposed to a range of experiences, including prenatal risk factors, interpersonal adversity, household economic deprivation, and neighborhood adversity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lower values of FA were associated with later difficulties with mental arithmetic and receptive language. Furthermore, white matter FA partially mediated the detrimental relationship between adversity and cognition later in adolescence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings advance a white matter-based account of the neural and cognitive effects of adversity, which supports leading developmental theories that place interregional connectivity prior to gray matter maturation.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Mon, 07 Apr 2025 19:20:28 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMif0FVX3lxTE9JeElxc2xob3otZC1MQ2duTVhlWF83NFdVM2d4c3NycmVuZ29RUEU3M2YwY2NzV1FnY0pMZnJFMkZHWWxrdm9GSWQtRDQyRXRubWNrNEJGMHowU1g0VUQ5ejZGeGdnRXEzZHlWYXJncWRxM1Zaa3l4ZmpaQVRoOUk</guid></item><item><title>Common sweetener can destroy some of the most dangerous bacteria - Earth.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilwFBVV95cUxQdkxMY055dDZCT2x0SE9hZXhrWVJFbXdxcVFXQ3dFaHV2NVQ0RDEzZkhxUGNYU1UxLVZLTmFub01QUklzRHZlNE5McC1fZkVkVDRwOTlRZ0FvT0ptckdvNXIxbUdVZjBDMnBoN2xMaU1wS1hJSjV1RjB4ZUt6NmkwbHlQd01mRTZ3NWs0ZlQ3V21xR1ZsZTJF?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page_content__AwOj6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Saccharin, a common artificial sweetener, may soon play a new medical role. Recent research shows it can destroy some of the world’s most dangerous bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Antibiotic resistance is one of the major threats to modern medicine,” said Professor Ronan McCarthy, who led the study at &lt;a href="https://www.brunel.ac.uk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Brunel University London&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Procedures such as tooth extractions and cancer treatment often rely on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/nanoplastics-can-alter-the-course-of-antibiotics-within-our-body/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;antibiotics&lt;/a&gt; to prevent or treat infection. But doctors are increasingly facing cases where the drugs no longer work.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-deadly-pathogens-are-becoming-resistant"&gt;Deadly pathogens are becoming resistant&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) caused 1.27 million deaths in 2019. Nearly five million deaths involved resistant infections. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most dangerous bacteria include &lt;em&gt;Acinetobacter baumannii&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt;, both of which thrive in hospital settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The World Health Organization lists them among its highest-priority threats. These bacteria often infect those with weakened immune systems and resist most antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-the-sweetener-destroys-bacteria"&gt;How the sweetener destroys bacteria&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In exciting work led by our team, we’ve identified a novel antimicrobial – saccharin,” Professor McCarthy said. “Saccharin breaks the walls of bacterial pathogens, causing them to distort and eventually burst, killing the bacteria.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This physical breakdown lets antibiotics enter the bacteria more easily. As a result, saccharin helps conventional drugs work better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Saccharin has been used in food for over a century. It is considered safe for human consumption. Until now, though, little was known about the sweetener’s direct impact on bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-dna-chaos-inside-bacterial-cells"&gt;DNA chaos: Inside bacterial cells&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study reveals saccharin disrupts more than bacterial walls. It also messes with DNA inside bacterial cells. Treated bacteria grow long and thin, unable to divide. Their DNA starts replicating out of control, especially away from the usual origin points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Normally, DNA replication in bacteria starts at a site called the ori and ends at the ter. After saccharin treatment, the researchers observed far more ori and ter points than expected. This suggests multiple rounds of replication continue unchecked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This DNA chaos may stem from saccharin triggering DNA repair processes. These repair systems start replication from damaged spots instead of the usual starting site. As a result, DNA builds up rapidly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-sweetener-weakens-bacteria-s-defense"&gt;Sweetener weakens bacteria’s defense&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Saccharin also changes how &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/frogs-lead-the-way-in-developing-new-antibiotics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;bacteria&lt;/a&gt; maintain their outer layers. The sweetener disrupts proteins and pathways involved in making and protecting the cell envelope. This weakens the bacteria’s defense, making them easier to kill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that saccharin caused bacteria to form strange bulges. These bulges eventually burst, killing the cell. This effect mimics what happens when bacteria are exposed to powerful β-lactam antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-biofilms-and-resistant-strains"&gt;Biofilms and resistant strains&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bacteria often form biofilms – sticky layers that protect them from antibiotics. Saccharin prevents bacteria from forming these biofilms and can also break down ones that already exist. It even worked on polymicrobial biofilms, which are tougher to treat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Saccharin increased how well antibiotics entered resistant &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/cigarette-waste-fuels-antibiotic-resistance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;bacteria&lt;/a&gt; like &lt;em&gt;A. baumannii&lt;/em&gt;. When researchers combined saccharin with carbapenem antibiotics, the treatment became far more effective. Drug-resistant bacteria showed reduced resistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-saccharin-can-treat-wounds"&gt;Saccharin can treat wounds&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test real-world use, scientists embedded saccharin into hydrogels. These hydrogels were applied to burn wounds in a lab model using pig skin. The saccharin-infused gel outperformed silver-based wound dressings, cutting down bacterial infections significantly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Artificial sweeteners are found in many diet and sugar-free foods. We discovered that the same sweeteners you have with your coffee or in a ‘sugar-free’ drink could make some of the world’s most dangerous &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/new-antibiotic-found-in-soil-has-potential-to-fight-superbugs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;bacteria&lt;/a&gt; easier to treat,” said Professor McCarthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-fight-against-antibiotic-resistance"&gt;The fight against antibiotic resistance &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The world may soon face a future where antibiotics no longer cure infections. This is because bacteria are changing and becoming stronger due to the heavy use of antibiotics in both medicine and farming. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When antibiotics are used too often, bacteria learn how to fight back, making treatments less effective. At the same time, scientists aren’t discovering many new antibiotics to replace the ones that are failing. This means common infections could become serious or even deadly again. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without new solutions, the growing problem of &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/antibiotic-resistance-could-cause-a-health-crisis-globally/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;antibiotic&lt;/a&gt; resistance puts millions of lives at risk and makes routine treatments more dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This has created a dangerous situation,” said Professor McCarthy. “We urgently need new drugs to treat resistant infections – and saccharin could represent a new therapeutic approach with exciting promise.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.embopress.org/doi/full/10.1038/s44321-025-00219-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EMBO Molecular Medicine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 07 Apr 2025 19:09:57 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilwFBVV95cUxQdkxMY055dDZCT2x0SE9hZXhrWVJFbXdxcVFXQ3dFaHV2NVQ0RDEzZkhxUGNYU1UxLVZLTmFub01QUklzRHZlNE5McC1fZkVkVDRwOTlRZ0FvT0ptckdvNXIxbUdVZjBDMnBoN2xMaU1wS1hJSjV1RjB4ZUt6NmkwbHlQd01mRTZ3NWs0ZlQ3V21xR1ZsZTJF</guid></item><item><title>Second child dies of measles—anti-vaccine advocate reported it before officials - Ars Technica</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiuwFBVV95cUxQSy1uWVdFU3U2Qk8tZi1NLWRHcmZrcWI2OU9peEFWZlpnbGx3NkNjY1AxdHExYl9TRWhtcVlRSWZsWDk3ZEZjeXJkNU5KWER2dmdjWEZVczRabzcwRXdycUZWdXpVRG1YTDRaQzlTSllYREg3VU80Njg3Z2NIUnJ0c21Zc3B3QXdISy04bFlRZXZSTjMxcDJrMkV5TUFYRGQ5T2NjTnBqdHBIWFpVRTlVVGtySDJYR1FBd3Jn?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Edwards treated the siblings of the first child who died of measles. The family sought care from Edwards for their other four children, who were also unvaccinated and fell ill from measles after their 6-year-old sibling died. Edward's involvement was revealed in an interview with the deceased child's parents, which was led by the rabid anti-vaccine organization Kennedy founded and until recently headed, Children's Health Defense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/03/anti-vaccine-group-founded-by-rfk-jr-weaponizes-childs-measles-death/"&gt;In the interview&lt;/a&gt;, the CHD representatives, like Malone, led the parents to believe that the child's death was not from measles and that vaccines are harmful. The mother of the child concluded in the interview to deter other parents from immunizing their children against measles, despite the death of her daughter: "Don't do the shots. There [are] doctors that can help with measles. [Measles is] not as bad as they're making it out to be," she said, through a translator of low German.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The message from Kennedy and these alternative practitioners has clearly impacted the communities in West Texas. Some unvaccinated children hospitalized with measles have signs of vitamin A toxicity, &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/04/07/vitamin-a-poisoning-measles-rfk-jr/"&gt;doctors told The Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three deaths amid an outbreak with under 600 reported measles cases are also raising questions. &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/signs-symptoms/index.html"&gt;According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;, nearly 1 to 3 of every 1,000 children who become infected with measles will die from respiratory and neurologic complications. Three reported deaths so far in the outbreak could be a statistical blip. But health experts are questioning whether the outbreak is much larger than known—if parents are not bringing their sick children to health providers—and/or if parents are delaying care, relying on unproven treatments, which could up the risk of life-threatening cases. The CDC also estimates that about 20 percent of US children with measles are hospitalized. With 58 hospitalizations reported so far, the percentage is about half of what's expected.&lt;/p&gt;

Among them was hair loss, which can occur as a result of nutrient or protein deficiencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;So, Ms Ramirez of Fort Worth, &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/texas/index.html" id="mol-a5d9ac40-13c0-11f0-93dc-d7dabae5537a" class=""&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt;, began taking a common over-the-counter vitamin that claimed to improve hair, skin and nail health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, soon after beginning the vitamins in late February, she began noticing yellowing of her eyes and skin.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her doctors discovered she was experiencing liver failure, which her gastroenterologist attributed to a typically innocuous ingredient called methylsulfonylmethane (MSM) in her vitamin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Research has found MSM to be generally benign and even protect against liver damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some scientists have said, however, that MSM could exacerbate liver damage in people with pre-existing liver disease, but no cases of this have been reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Still, Ms Ramirez has become jaundiced, with yellowing skin and eyes. She has also undergone surgery to remove her gallbladder because of hard deposits that had built up there, block the flow of bile through the liver and gallbladder. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The gallbladder stores and releases the digestive fluid produced by the liver. But doctors may have to remove it if hard deposits form there, blocking the flow of bile from the liver and gallbladder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ms Ramirez did not say how her doctor concluded that MSM was the culprit, though supplements, which are &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-6269695/Hundreds-natural-supplements-contain-active-drugs-FDA-knows-doesnt-tell-public.html"&gt;not regulated by the FDA&lt;/a&gt;, can be &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13663359/fda-recalls-herbal-supplement-sold-amazon-life-threatening-risk.html"&gt;contaminated along&lt;/a&gt; the production line or come in dosages that are &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14470339/Doctor-reveals-popular-supplements-health-crises.html"&gt;far higher than recommended&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Ms Ramirez of Fort Worth, Texas is experiencing liver failure, which her gastroenterologist attributed to a typically innocuous ingredient called methylsulfonylmethane (MSM) in her hair growth supplement&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ms Ramirez warned her TikTok followers of the risk of taking the supplement, which was made and sold by a [popular drugstore, from her hospital bed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: ‘They couldn’t figure out what was wrong with me, apart from needing my gallbladder removed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'They thought I had hepatitis, and [the tests] were all negative, negative, negative, negative. They’re like, have you started any new medicine, I’m like, no.

Among them was hair loss, which can occur as a result of nutrient or protein deficiencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;So, Ms Ramirez of Fort Worth, &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/texas/index.html" id="mol-a5d9ac40-13c0-11f0-93dc-d7dabae5537a" class=""&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt;, began taking a common over-the-counter vitamin that claimed to improve hair, skin and nail health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, soon after beginning the vitamins in late February, she began noticing yellowing of her eyes and skin.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her doctors discovered she was experiencing liver failure, which her gastroenterologist attributed to a typically innocuous ingredient called methylsulfonylmethane (MSM) in her vitamin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Research has found MSM to be generally benign and even protect against liver damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some scientists have said, however, that MSM could exacerbate liver damage in people with pre-existing liver disease, but no cases of this have been reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Still, Ms Ramirez has become jaundiced, with yellowing skin and eyes.

                                        minutes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="articleContainer"&gt;&lt;p&gt;You're fat and tired.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's not insulin's fault. Insulin is just the messenger. When sugar levels are high in the bloodstream, insulin instructs body cells to open their doors and allow sugar in. But under certain circumstances cells ignore insulin's message and the doors remain shut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the doors stay shut, you've got two problems. One, you don't get enough fuel (sugar) into the cells, so you're tired. Two, sugar stays in the bloodstream where it causes damage. In an effort to prevent this damage, the sugar is removed and stored as fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, you're fat and tired.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How likely is it that you have insulin resistance? "Pretty likely ,and getting more likely all the time," says Dr. Whit Roberts, D.C. of &lt;a href="https://utcountyhealth.com/2-for-1-weight-loss?UTM_source=IR6" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;Health Utah&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The percentage of adults with insulin resistance has doubled in the last 20 years, &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK507839/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;according to research&lt;/a&gt; published in the National Library of Medicine. &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/22206-insulin-resistance" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;Cleveland Clinic reports&lt;/a&gt; this is due to many factors including worsening diets, the exposure to more drugs and toxins, more stress and more fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Insulin resistance is perhaps the most serious epidemic in the world today, Roberts says. "It can lead to all the major killers including heart disease, obesity, strokes, diabetes and &lt;a href="https://www.mdanderson.org/cancerwise/sugar--insulin-resistance-and-cancer--what-is-the-link.h00-159461634.html" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;13 types of cancer&lt;/a&gt;. The good news is that we are learning all the time better ways to reverse it. Some are surprising."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt; Photo: Pixel-Shot - stock.adobe.com&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;One: Sleep&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9036496/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;2022 study&lt;/a&gt; published in the National Library of Medicine showed that people who get less than seven hours of sleep have higher levels of insulin resistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is a problem since well over half my patients have some form of insomnia. They struggle falling asleep, staying asleep, or just getting sound sleep," Roberts says. "That's why at &lt;a href="https://utcountyhealth.com/2-for-1-weight-loss?UTM_source=IR6" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;Health Utah&lt;/a&gt;, improving our patients' quality and quantity of sleep is one of our highest priorities."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting enough sleep, however, is easier said than done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Fortunately, we have found that lowering total body inflammation through a proprietary combination of herbs, foods and therapies leads to improved sleep in almost all of our patients," Roberts says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt; Photo: Nasnunt - stock.adobe.com&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Two: Antioxidants&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second surprising way to reverse insulin resistance is to increase your consumption of antioxidants. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1865087/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;One study showed&lt;/a&gt; that taking 2 grams of vitamin C for two weeks resulted in a significant change in insulin resistance. Roberts explains this is why Health Utah's health and weight loss program relies heavily on eating foods rich in antioxidants. Additionally certain foods with &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7602234/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;high polyphenol and phytonutrient content&lt;/a&gt; are recommended as they have also been found to help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, this is the hard part. Everyone knows they should be eating better. It's just hard when low-quality foods are flavor-enhanced, sugar-laced, caffeine boosted and so convenient. That's why the health and weight loss program at Health Utah focuses heavily on making the transition to healing foods easier. They use a process called framework that engages the subconscious mind to reframe your relationship with food. Weekly classes and educational materials also provide skills, tools, and strategies necessary to achieve sustainable weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt; Photo: hocine - stock.adobe.com&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Three: Lemon juice&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The craziest way science has found to help reverse insulin resistance is drinking lemon juice. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7468735/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;Scientific research&lt;/a&gt; is now reflecting what holistic healers have suggested for years, that lemon juice has a powerful effect for good in the body, even improving sensitivity to insulin and lowering blood sugar levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roberts and &lt;a href="https://utcountyhealth.com/2-for-1-weight-loss?UTM_source=IR6" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;Health Utah&lt;/a&gt; utilize this kind of knowledge in working with their patients. Lemon juice has been a consistent part of their health and weight loss program for over 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When our patients start their health and weight loss program, they begin by cleaning out the body. This requires improving liver function," Roberts says. "Lemons, herbs and in-office therapies facilitate this detoxification as well as the reversal of insulin resistance."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health Utah specializes in sustainable weight loss. Everything they do is geared toward this goal. Their coaching, their classes, their work with the subconscious mind, the fact that they don't count calories or cut out carbs and their focus on reversing insulin resistance create a lasting solution to the health and weight issues of their patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://utcountyhealth.com/2-for-1-weight-loss?UTM_source=IR6" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;Health Utah&lt;/a&gt; invites KSL readers to take advantage of a $59 weight loss package.

found 60 percent of people reported an improvement of their migraine attack after participating in some of form of sexual activity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Having an orgasm may help you get rid of that days-long migraine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The neurologists sent a questionnaire to 306 migraine patients and 96 cluster headache patients who had been treated over a two-year period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The participants were asked to answer eight questions, including whether they had any experience with sexual activity during a headache attack. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A deep analysis into their answers showed out of the 34 percent of people who had experience with sexual activity during a migraine attack, 60 percent saw their attacks improve. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Out of this, 43 percent of people with migraines found their headache changed shortly after orgasm or maximal excitement, about 18 percent reported the change with the time of orgasm, 20 percent found the change at the beginning of sexual activity while another 20 percent had the change within 30 minutes of orgasm or maximal excitement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the case of cluster headaches, out of the 31 percent of the patients that had experience with sexual activity during an attack, 37 percent reported an improvement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While researchers are yet to discover the exact cause of migraines, some believe that specific nerves in the blood vessels can send pain signals to the brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This releases inflammatory substances into the head's nerves and blood vessels - causing a strong throbbing or pulsing pain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Stress, anxiety and emotional triggers can also release chemicals in the brain that contribute to migraines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to Dr Megan Donnelly, a neurologist and headache specialist with Novant Health in Charlotte, North Carolina who was not involved in the study, orgasms and pain affect the same areas of the brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She explained that orgasms stimulate the production of endorphins, which are natural pain relievers in the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The release of endorphins from sex can be a powerful distraction as well as give relief from the pain of a migraine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;During a migraine attack, people may have lower levels of certain neurotransmitters like dopamine and serotonin. Both of these neurotransmitters are released during sexual activity and can improve the ache. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The release of endorphins from sex can be a powerful distraction as well as give relief from the pain of a migraine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, the study also found 33 percent of people who suffered from migraines and 50 percent of people with cluster headaches saw their condition worsen after sexual activity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr. Donnelly noted: 'Although 60 percent of migraine patients surveyed reported an improvement in their headaches with sexual activity, one-third of those with migraines found their headaches worsened with sex.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2019 study published in the Annals of Indian Academy of Neurology found 78 percent of people living with migraines - mostly women - also experienced sexual dysfunction. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, the longer the duration of migraines and the more frequent they were, the lower the sexual functioning among migraine sufferers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The neurologist told &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.mdlinx.com/article/migraines-exploring-sex-as-a-cure-and-cause/7uCku8mRtkVKoyyxPs8hrV"&gt;MDLink&lt;/a&gt;: 'Treating migraines may positively impact sexual dysfunction, but individual responses can vary.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the expert, some migraine sufferers may also be experiencing a condition called sex headache. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pictured: Dr Megan Donnelly, a woman's neurologist and headache specialist with Novant Health in Charlotte, North Carolina &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Headaches associated with sexual activity, sometimes called 'orgasm headaches' or 'sex headaches,' can range from mild to severe and occur during or after sexual activity, often around the time of orgasm. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/324719#:~:text=When%20a%20person%20has%20an,intense%20headaches%20in%20some%20people."&gt;Medical News Today&lt;/a&gt;, orgasms can rapidly increase blood pressure which can cause blood vessels in the head to dilate.  This can trigger sudden, intense headaches in some people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In most cases, they are considered benign and do not have an underlying cause, however, at times sex headaches can be a symptom of a more serious condition, such as problems with blood vessels in the brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These kind of headaches occurs four times more often in men and people are usually in their 40s when it first happens, according to a 2010 study published in The Journal of Headache and Pain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 07 Apr 2025 17:02:55 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipAFBVV95cUxOYkVTSC0xcllZX2lfUzVwcFJFRjBpb2NmV2twLWx3R3ZHaEJKYVNXYmxPbHdHX0YwUjYxOHJNMnFfR1NkQnY3OUx0cWx0OS1VWE9Wc242M0dvUVczdThqTHg1QUpZOExQSUJQRTBnZkVxNEpVd2NrZUQ1RzdvdnFEaGUtdFJVYmhpS2E4NzhmTzZwV2Q1WUx1STNuRFZIemo0SlFTWNIBqgFBVV95cUxOSG43S2ZGVTkyQzN5OFhWMml0OURDeFZETms5UWFORGt3RHpQOWx3RUhJaXFqNE5jVWMxbkxZeUtsQVcxZ0VqUlFzRl9JMi1HbDRrakpLdE8yX2prdWpWODRoaVVxdXdyX2tsWDNmVlZRcDZsXzBreGtUaGlfLXFLcC1JZENTcVRXelE5NUt1YXNrUkR6cUhDaFZYcWU3OG0wX1BXSEJRUUJJdw</guid></item><item><title>Man receives world's first sperm transplant in groundbreaking experiment to reverse infertility - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMivwFBVV95cUxPZGNMRWZnakg1WjZxRDlVT1JKODB1V0Z5NFFzWnBaVms3bFJ6c3F1a1AyZ3cyOU9nTVBOU3NJS3NZbGwzZURSMWZLOE96SEVOM0R2dWppandoeWNoVFVuVFZ5eHBPQXlzYUdSYzl0cExwVXM4cUFiQThENHNObHh0Q2sySFhCMVFMVHNSdXhoT29nbC10WHlXQXkzdy1ySmdPWEUtU09fV2VBSjJheHRRNWwtOElXOVN5UF9FMUVERdIBxAFBVV95cUxQSjIwLU1sbEo4N3p6Ymx4RktxVWplVi1KeThEd3NSazZkVUVWamU4MDZNSVlrYS1fbzhaMm5yYzJIbC1WUWRCdV8xN3dQYWlQWk1mVmlGdFZtZ3ZlaFBCWHN5UmxHR01WbmtpREFmUkRWSnhNZWFVUlYxMTl2UWdBTkREa1dncjJ4bDhlajNOZ1dqVEdZbEVIN2d4R19RcENUZ1N5TGh6X3k3b2tDQjU1eDg4UUFUeXlHXzN2Uk9pNDVqdzBi?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A man in his early 20s has received the world's first sperm-making stem cell transplant in a new procedure that could be groundbreaking for infertility treatment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Until now, the procedure had only been tested in animals. But it successfully allowed male mice and monkeys to father offspring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The patient was diagnosed with azoospermia, a condition that causes no sperm to be present in his ejaculate and makes it impossible to naturally conceive a child, after receiving chemotherapy as a child to treat bone &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-da70d850-13cc-11f0-a4f1-4f5cc1f4a174" class=""&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;But men can develop azoospermia for a number of reasons, including &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13988987/frightening-effect-consuming-soup-body.html"&gt;hormonal dysfunction&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, a blockage along the reproductive tract and certain genetic conditions. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the US, azoospermia affects roughly 645,000 men between the ages of 20 to 50.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For this clinical trial, doctors implanted the man's own stem cells — which were harvested and frozen during his childhood before he underwent chemotherapy  — into his reproductive system. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/sciencetech/article-14531869/paralyzed-man-walks-stem-cell-injection-treatment.html"&gt;Stem cells are capable of developing into many different types of cells in the body&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In this case, the doctors used sperm-forming stem cells, which are present in the testicles at birth and later mature into sperm cells during puberty. If the transplant succeeds, the patient should begin producing sperm. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A man in his early 20s has received the world's first sperm-making stem cell transplant, and this new procedure could be groundbreaking for infertility treatment&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;No sperm cells have been detected in his semen yet, but ultrasounds confirmed his hormone levels and the procedure did not damage the man's testicular tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Going forward, the doctors will analyze a sample of his semen twice a year to see if it contains sperm cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'If refined and proven safe, spermatogonial stem cell (SSC) transplantation could be a revolutionary fertility-restoring technique for men who've lost the ability to produce sperm,' Dr Justin Houman, an assistant professor of urology at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center who was not involved in the study, told &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/fertility-pregnancy-birth/man-gets-sperm-making-stem-cell-transplant-in-first-of-its-kind-procedure"&gt;Live Science&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This treatment may prove especially beneficial for other cancer patients who received chemotherapy before puberty, and thus developed azoospermia, or men with 'genetic or acquired testicular failure,' he added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The historic procedure is detailed in a paper published on the preprint server &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.03.25.25324518v1"&gt;medRxiv&lt;/a&gt;, which features research that is still undergoing review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Young men at risk of developing azoospermia can choose to harvest and preserve their sperm-forming stem cells for future use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If they are diagnosed with the condition after reaching sexual maturity, doctors can then return these stem cells to where they came from: the rete testis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The rete testis are small tubes helps move sperm cells from the testicles to the epididymis: a narrow, tightly-coiled tube that is attached to each of the testicles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;This treatment may prove especially beneficial other cancer patients who received chemotherapy before therapy, and thus developed azoospermia, or men with genetic or acquired testicular failure (STOCK)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is done using an ultrasound-guided needle. In theory, once the stem cells are implanted, they can mature and begin producing sperm — essentially giving the patient a second chance at puberty. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, researchers noted that there is a chance that the patient who participated in this clinical trial may never recover his fertility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They said one reason for this could be that only a small amount of stem cells were harvested from the patient during his childhood to avoid damaging his reproductive tissues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Therefore, it's possible that any sperm production resulting from the transplant may be limited, if it occurs at all. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If the patient never begins producing a sufficient amount of sperm cells, he will still have other options for fathering a child.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Through surgery, doctors could try to recover any sperm cells he does produce and use them for in vitro fertilization (IVF), which involves growing an embryo in a lab with sperm and stem cells that have been harvested from each parent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But there are other risks too, especially for patients with azoospermia who have also been diagnosed with cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For these patients, some of the transplanted stem cells could have cancer-causing genetic mutations that could eventually develop into new tumors, Houman told LiveScience. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;What's more, there's also a 'theoretical risk' that the transplant could trigger a dangerous inflammatory response from the patient, even though it uses their own cells, he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We need to proceed cautiously, and with rigorous oversight,' he said. 'This is promising science — but it's still early days.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Then there are seven supplements you need to add to your routine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Health coach Cory Rodriguez has revealed how to improve all four of these areas of your life by taking a &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14556439/bryan-johnson-pill-aging-longevity.html"&gt;cocktail of daily supplements containing magnesium. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Magnesium is an essential mineral that comes in many forms, each with their own benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The first form of magnesium Mr Rodriguez recommends is &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14555957/The-cheap-powder-gym-fanatics-love-ease-depression-tiredness-chronic-fatigue-long-Covid-Oxford-researchers-say-semi-essential.html"&gt;magnesium glycinate for  sleep&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Sleep Foundation notes this&lt;span&gt; form of magnesium can be easily absorbed by the body and it is recommended by sleep experts to 'promote calm, relaxation, and improved sleep'.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr Naoki Umeda from the Cleveland Clinic recommends keeping your magnesium dosage for sleep at 200mg nightly and taking the supplement about 30 minutes before bedtime. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Next up, Mr Rodriguez says magnesium chloride is the best version for digestion. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts say this supplement can positively impact digestion by acting as a natural laxative, easing constipation, and potentially reducing bloating and cramping due to its muscle-relaxing properties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Health coach Cory Rodriguez has revealed how to improve your sleep, digestion, memory and energy by taking a cocktail of daily supplements&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Annie Price, who is a certified holistic health coach for health company DrAxe.com, explains that magnesium chloride aids digestion by offsetting a decline of gastric acid secretion in the stomach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Gastric acid is produced by the stomach, and she highlights that it's 'absolutely essential to proper digestion because it helps break down foods into smaller absorbable units. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Without enough gastric acid, we not only can have suboptimal digestion, but we can also experience a malabsorption of essential nutrients.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, an excessive intake of magnesium chloride can lead to digestive issues like diarrhea. The recommended dose is 500mg to 1,000mg per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For an extra boost of energy, Mr Rodriguez - who has close to 3million followers on Instagram - advises stocking up on magnesium malate. The dose ranges from 200mg to 400mg per day, depending on your gender, age and health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The nutritional compound, which is a blend of magnesium and malic acid, is touted for promoting energy production. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dietician Ozgenaz Kazan explains: 'Malic acid, a component of magnesium malate, is a key player in cellular energy production. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It takes center stage in the process known as the Krebs cycle, which is a central part of how our bodies generate energy from the foods we eat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This energy production can lead to increased vitality and decreased feelings of fatigue. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'So, if you've been looking for a natural way to boost your energy levels, magnesium malate might be worth considering.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If you're looking to improve your focus and ability to concentrate, Mr Rodriguez recommends magnesium L-threonate as an option. The recommended dosage of this supplement is 2000mg per day, with four 500mg tablets &lt;span&gt;split between mornings and evenings.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In one human study, the supplement was shown to improve learning, recall, memory and cognitive abilities, with older people demonstrating the most improvement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Moving to another area of the body, Mr Rodriguez says magnesium sulfate - commonly known as Epsom salts - can help ease sore muscles and aid relaxation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The salts are a popular addition to warm baths. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Detailing the benefits, Dr Umeda explains: 'The idea is that when you pour Epsom salt into warm water, it dissolves the magnesium and sulfate and allows it to be absorbed into your body through your skin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Mr Rodriguez says that magnesium chloride is the best thing for digestion&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Centuries of user testimonials claim wonderful benefits from using Epsom salt this way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Scientific research, however, isn't quite as vocal in its support. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'There are no definitive studies showing that magnesium can be absorbed through your skin in sufficient amounts to address potential deficiencies of the mineral. And what research has been done offers skepticism.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He says when purchasing Epsom salt, it is important to buy a product that's 100 percent magnesium sulfate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Then he suggests pouring about 300g of Epsom salt into a tub as it fills with hot water. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He adds: 'Once the bath is drawn, test the water for its heat level and adjust as needed. You don't want to scald yourself. Slowly ease yourself into the tub and relax. A 15-minute soak should be enough.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another muscle Mr Rodriguez says magnesium can benefit is the heart. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Magnesium taurate is a dietary supplement made up of magnesium and taurine, an amino acid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Many health brands recommend taking three 500mg capsules per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Explaining why these ingredients can benefit the heart, experts from Health.com note: 'In addition to reducing blood pressure, magnesium taurate may have an overall cardioprotective effect - meaning that it may protect heart health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This could be due to its antioxidant properties, or its ability to reduce cell damage caused by oxidative stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Magnesium supplements, including magnesium taurate, have been found to prevent and treat high cholesterol, cardiac arrhythmias (irregular heartbeats), stroke, and heart disease. They may also help to reduce the overall damage after experiencing a myocardial infarction (heart attack).'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lastly, Mr Rodriguez says magnesium citrate is a great remedy for constipation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some studies have reported positive outcomes using doses ranging from 290mg to 2,000mg per day, depending on individual factors and the severity of constipation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, most experts recommend starting with a smaller dose, such as 200mg to 400mg per day, and then gradually upping the dosage as required.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Physicians from the Cleveland Clinic explain that it works by increasing the amount of water your intestine absorbs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This softens the stool, making it easier to have a bowel movement, while at the same time, it increases pressure, which prompts the muscles in your intestines to move the stool. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the Cleveland Clinic, the recommended maximum daily intake of magnesium supplements for adults is 350 mg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The experts note that excessive intake can potentially lead to side effects like diarrhea, nausea, and cramping. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mr Rodriguez says he generally sticks to magnesium glycinate as i&lt;span&gt;t's 'quite useful for better sleep and this type is also very absorbable by the body, so it does a good job of raising magnesium levels in the blood'.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 07 Apr 2025 16:29:30 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqgFBVV95cUxObHNQT1EwRlRhZFpfS3JCLWFqb3hxczRZMGpwVlN0Qm4xOXJ2R2RYMUVRZm0xc3FEcjlwMDJveFNPZE1jYVZXa3doV2J3WVN2MnByblh0enYxNDlLR3QyMENNVFFnZUxCV1lQcnI2MXI5ZVB6RFpucjEwZ2lya21sSXBTWG9Da2FFTVVhRktidy0xV0tMbXMwUWlaeWJzemVZVDA1dlRQVFRwZ9IBrwFBVV95cUxPNlE5dGl4QVljUnRqZnFYVzdXakdnQndPZGVIc1JhWkpkSWU1dFR6b1FYQnFzS0hma25mYmxQQUUyWXRZekZ0NE85YWVPbEh4NUpOdmxSemt1OFVMOEZxUWdMdGd1czRvZGtnUFJ0Y3hUeFlDc2hMX3FwRDJ4a0xIaTY3eFVacUw0Yk9qa3hIU0tCQWRjQUxyY1ZUNXhEVV9YVGQ1Z3NKV0haZTl0MVRR</guid></item><item><title>Robert F Kennedy Jr claims anti-vax physicians healed ‘some 300 measles-stricken children’ - The Guardian</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigAFBVV95cUxNc0RTOU5taHNzcTBCYmZGVDlReW9qa09fdWJuc2FqZ0xHTmFzd2hTcFJmTjUwOGM5S3E2aTY5Z1ljU3M0TGtkSnlLYjlXMnlSMjFoTWlVUy1lSW5oWlhoeDlxdnMyOUs3U2lzcGNzVDZkVHdYMUJfdWk1aHRqQjhkRA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body-commercial-selector article-body-viewer-selector dcr-11jq3zt"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/robert-f-kennedy-jr" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Robert F Kennedy Jr&lt;/a&gt;

At the time, he had stopped short of endorsing the MMR vaccine, which he minimized as merely a “personal choice” rather than a public health and safety measure that long ago was proven effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1909049021211263268" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt; on Sunday following his presence in Seminole at the funeral of Daisy Hildebrand, an unvaccinated eight-year-old who died on 3 April, Kennedy said he had visited with Richard Bartlett and Ben Edwards – and claimed without evidence the anti-vax physicians had treated and healed “some 300 measles-stricken Mennonite children”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The Texas Medical Board &lt;a href="https://www.tmb.state.tx.us/dl/FB642150-D8B3-A8F6-F5D3-E5832892E381" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;disciplined&lt;/a&gt; Bartlett in 2003 for his “inappropriate treatment of patients with intravenous antibiotics and other medications”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Kennedy’s tweet said Bartlett had used “aerosolized budesonide and clarithromycin” to treat children with measles, two drugs Bartlett reportedly &lt;a href="https://science.feedback.org/review/no-evidence-budesonide-clarithromycin-aspirin-combination-silver-bullet-treatment-covid-contrary-texas-doctors-claim/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;previously claimed&lt;/a&gt; were also ingredients in his “magic bullet” treatment for Covid-19.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Bartlett, who ran a short-lived congressional &lt;a href="https://www.gosanangelo.com/story/news/local/2019/09/27/richard-barlett-odessa-drops-out-congressional-race/3785795002/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;campaign&lt;/a&gt; in 2019, has something of a checkered past. During a lengthy medical career that he has said was “a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Journey-Medicine-Man-Confirmed-Miracles/dp/1943127824" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;calling from God&lt;/a&gt;”, patients &lt;a href="https://www.mrt.com/news/article/Congressional-candidate-faces-allegations-from-7821914.php" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;complained&lt;/a&gt; of receiving “unnecessary diagnostic tests, medications or treatments”. And in 2021, he received a criminal trespass &lt;a href="https://www.oaoa.com/local-news/bartlett-issued-trespass-warning-at-mch/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;warning&lt;/a&gt; after being caught allegedly rifling through trash bags at an Ector county hospital where he did not work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Edwards, meanwhile, has a vaccine-free “wellness practice” at a converted barn building in Seminole where he promotes better nutrition and treats patients with cod liver oil and vitamins to control the measles outbreak, according to &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/west-texas-measles-outbreak-families-forego-conventional-medicine-vacc-rcna194795" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;NBC News&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Like Bartlett, Edwards is an advocate of budesonide, a corticosteroid more commonly used in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease – and inhaled to open airways in asthma patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Kennedy has previously expressed admiration for the pair, telling&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/video/6369595673112" data-link-name="in body link"&gt; Fox News&lt;/a&gt; last month that budesonide has produced “very, very good results”, and that patients had experienced “almost miraculous and instantaneous” recoveries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Conversely, Kennedy talked up the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/mmr" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;MMR&lt;/a&gt; vaccine during his visit to Texas. He said the purpose of the trip was to comfort the families of Hildebrand and Kayley Fehr, a six-year-old whose death in February was the first from measles in the US in a decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“My intention was to come down here quietly to console the families and to be with the community in their moment of grief,” he said in an earlier&lt;a href="https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1908967854394982414" data-link-name="in body link"&gt; post&lt;/a&gt; on Sunday to X.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“In early March, I deployed a CDC [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] team to bolster local and state capacity for response across multiple Texas regions, supply pharmacies and Texas run clinics with needed MMR vaccines and other medicines and medical supplies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Since that time, the growth rates for new cases and hospitalizations have flattened.

 &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Jaban Moore, who specializes in parasitic infections and chronic illnesses, recently shared the common symptoms that indicate your liver may not be functioning well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A zinc deficiency can lead to dermatitis, a skin condition that can cause inflammation, redness, and rashes, including around the mouth&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Dermatitis and rashes around the mouth &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Liver toxicity can cause the body to not effectively absorb certain nutrients, such as vitamin B2 and zinc. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to a 2022 review published in Nutrients Journal, a common complication of zinc deficiency is dermatitis, a skin condition that can cause inflammation, redness, and rashes, including around the mouth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dermatitis often presents as skin irritation around your mouth and looks like a rash that has small fluid-filled or solid-appearing bumps. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another possible cause of dermatitis around the face is vitamin B2 deficiency, which can indicate liver degeneration as it is one of the key organs that requires the particular nutrient to function, according to Dr Moore. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Spider veins &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dilated blood vessels on the chest, abdomen, face or ribs are one of the first signs of liver dysfunction. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Since this organ is highly involved in regulating the chemistry of the blood through purification, problems in the liver can create dysfunctions in blood pressure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This can affect the levels and processing of hormones throughout the body, which can manifest as spider veins, also known as telangiectasias.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These are small dilated blood vessels that appear as red or blue lines on the skin, often resembling a spider web.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Spider veins can also be an early sign of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), where there is a build up of fat molecules in the liver - which can potentially slow down blood flow and create clots in the veins. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Itchy and darkened skin&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A damaged liver can struggle to process and eliminate toxins and bile - leading to a buildup of bile salts in the bloodstream  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This can cause irritation in the nerves and continuous itching across the body, including on your face. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts recommend to avoid scratching the itches as it can worsen the irritation in the nerves and worsen the condition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While treatment options vary based on the severity of the itches, typical solutions include using mild soaps and taking prescription oral medications. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dilated blood vessels on the chest, abdomen, face or ribs may tend to be one of the first signs of liver dysfunction&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Extensive buildup of fat molecules in the liver can also pave the way for acanthosis nigricans, a condition that creates darkened, velvety patches of skin in folds around the neck and armpits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Inflammation in the liver due to fat accumulation makes it less responsive to insulin released from the pancreas, which signals to create glucose - sugar. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This disrupts its ability to process glucose and insulin - making the body resistant to the hormone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;When cells become resistant to insulin, the body produces more insulin to compensate, leading to hyperinsulinemia (high levels of insulin in the blood). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Excessive insulin can accelerate the growth of skin cells in the body and in turn lead to a thickening of the outermost layer of the skin - causing it to darken. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Liver damage can also lead to hormonal imbalances and changes in the liver's ability to metabolize hormones - resulting in skin pigmentation changes that can create a grayish complexion on the face and darker skin in the folds of the neck.    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Rosacea&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Rosacea is a condition that can cause your skin to appear very red with tiny bumps and rashes. It is most commonly visible on the face.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While this facial redness, often affecting the cheeks and nose, itself is not a direct indicator of liver toxicity, it has been linked to fatty liver diseases like NAFLD and NASH (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Fatty liver disease occurs where there is a buildup of fat molecules which can cause liver damage and at times, inflammation - potentially creating a toxic environment in the organ.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some studies suggest that NAFLD and NASH can affect genes that control hair follicles and sebum producing cells - potentially leading to the development of rosacea. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According Dr Moore, while a 2017 article from the American Academy of Dermatology suggests rosacea can be a visible sign of liver dysfunction, not everyone with rosacea has liver issues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 07 Apr 2025 16:06:53 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiogFBVV95cUxOZWtnTDN2YW0xN2dTYmxiTWdVRlhHR0d3Nlc1V3Q4dXNCRFZGTS1BZFVmV2YtV25JTkZKVUgwRU44elFLRlN3MkxPSUhYV0ZYLUFVZmNKZFJOUFppRUNVNGNtOWZwN3BQbFdxYVpfNG0yTHJVSjNTTkxsQnNVb3NDRUdZWkVkcXJJWXpGeEk2QUpobks4MWNaeDBIUGxVX0JtdkHSAacBQVVfeXFMTTdrcktOdTVqTnVibEJTd2MtY0wtVzBra2VXTVZtUDVOeFVVRF9vcW9GSWJ5NmttbmpaVFVuaVdHUjBLaUNpMGkyX1J6cUJJcGtoZXBCNTdPMlkzUC1VSDYzSkVlUDVsMWVCTXZEWGxVSVo3V0E2MVA1VzEtWGZGLUl5SUhnY1FoSGEyWkNTV1B5NHRYVVlOR3hyLVhPMjV2VGk3S0Y2VmM</guid></item><item><title>Wonder drug or waste of money?

As a result, fish oil supplements have been &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/benefits-of-fish-oil#11-benefits" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;touted&lt;/a&gt; as a way of reducing the risk of heart attacks and inflammation, and improving cognitive function and skin health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;This has made fish oil supplements a booming business. Omega-3 supplements are some of the most popular nutritional supplements in the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db399.htm" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.bda.uk.com/resource/supplements.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/fish-oil-market" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;estimates&lt;/a&gt; put the value of the global fish oil market around $3.1bn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="2fa2e4b8-11c0-413b-8496-22e3f1015945" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":4,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"Are whole-grain foods really healthier?","elementId":"2fa2e4b8-11c0-413b-8496-22e3f1015945","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2025/mar/24/are-whole-grains-healthy"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":10,"display":2,"theme":4}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;But the scientific data isn’t as emphatic.

However, what each supplement contains – say, how much EPA and DHA are in each pill – is not consistent. In the US, dietary supplements are not regulated by the Food and Drug Administration, explains Dr Stephen Kopecky, a cardiologist at the Mayo Clinic. (Supplements &lt;a href="https://www.food.gov.uk/business-guidance/food-supplements#legal-requirements" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;are regulated&lt;/a&gt; in the UK.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“You’ve got to turn the bottle around to look at the ingredient label,” Kopecky says. Companies, he warns, “can change their labels week to week”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="InteractiveBlockComponent" priority="critical" deferuntil="idle" props='{"url":"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2023/10/archive-zip/giv-13425WMrLo2pc9VIk/","scriptUrl":"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js","alt":"Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’ ","format":{"design":10,"display":2,"theme":4},"elementId":"da47962f-944b-42fb-bdf5-b6410843d748","isMainMedia":false}'&gt;&lt;figure id="da47962f-944b-42fb-bdf5-b6410843d748" data-alt="Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’ " data-testid="interactive-element-Graphic%20with%20three%20lines%20of%20text%20that%20say,%20in%20bold,%20%E2%80%98Well%20Actually%E2%80%99,%20then%20%E2%80%98Read%20more%20on%20living%20a%20good%20life%20in%20a%20complex%20world,%E2%80%99%20then%20a%20pinkish-lavender%20pill-shaped%20button%20with%20white%20letters%20that%20say%20%E2%80%98More%20from%20this%20section%E2%80%99%C2%A0" data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="element element-interactive element--inline element-inline dcr-w422y2"&gt;&lt;a data-name="placeholder" href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2023/10/archive-zip/giv-13425WMrLo2pc9VIk/" class="dcr-1eupayo"&gt;Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’ &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-are-the-benefits-of-fish-oil-supplements" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the benefits of fish oil supplements?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Experts say it is important to differentiate between the benefits of eating fish and the benefits of consuming fish oil supplements. Omega-3s in fish have been shown to help reduce inflammation and plaque formation, lower blood pressure and triglycerides – a type of fat in the blood – and stabilize and protect cell members in the heart and brain, says Sherry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;But nutrition is complicated. Kopecky says it is unclear whether these benefits come from the omega-3s alone, or a combination of the fatty acids and the way the fish was caught, prepared and served. “There’s all these other factors,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The current fish oil boom is partly attributable to a 1985 &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3990713/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; in the New England Journal of Medicine, says Dr Steven Nissen, a cardiologist at the Cleveland Clinic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The paper found that “mortality from coronary heart disease was more than 50 percent lower among those who consumed at least 30g of fish per day than among those who do not eat fish”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Indeed, says Nissen, people who eat more fish tend to have better health outcomes. But it’s probably not just because they consume more omega-3s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-20" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;skip past newsletter promotion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;aside aria-label="newsletter promotion" class="dcr-av5vqf"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-1xjndtj"&gt;Practical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good life&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SecureSignup" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"newsletterId":"well-actually","successDescription":"Practical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good life"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1eusqlu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy Notice: &lt;/strong&gt;Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

At the same time, she adds, “there has also been some research that shows no benefits and even some harm”. More study is needed on specific dosages and formulations, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;If you do have high triglycerides or cardiovascular concerns, experts suggest you talk to a doctor before taking fish oil supplements. Prescription fish oil is available, says Sherry, and tends to be more regulated than over-the-counter supplements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-are-the-risks-of-fish-oil-supplements" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the risks of fish oil supplements?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Some studies have found that potent fish oil supplements can put people at higher risk of atrial fibrillation – an irregular heartbeat that &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/atrial-fibrillation/what-is-atrial-fibrillation-afib-or-af" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;can lead to&lt;/a&gt; blood clots, stroke and heart complications.

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Future work will be important to understand how risk factors like diabetes and obesity increase risk of dementia to develop effective treatments and prevention strategies.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the study, scientists at the University of Florida analysed the health records 396,963 people over the age of 50 with type 2 diabetes. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;None had a diagnosis of dementia and were either taking GLP-1 medication or sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT-2i) which work by reducing the amount of glucose the kidneys re-absorb allowing it to pass out of the body in urine.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Over a follow-up of a 10 years they found &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;'both GLP-1RAs and SGLT2is were statistically significantly associated with decreased risk' of dementia compared to other medication.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Writing in the journal &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaneurology/fullarticle/2831976?guestAccessKey=903463ed-188b-43f3-a655-a69f968d4580&amp;amp;utm_source=for_the_media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;amp;utm_term=040725"&gt;Jama Neurology&lt;/a&gt;, they added that among&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; GLP-1RAs specifically, 'semaglutide seems to be promising in reducing the risk of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD)'.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They said: 'This finding is particularly intriguing given the existing research on semaglutide's neuroprotective properties.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Responding to the study, Dr Leah Mursaleen, head of clinical research at Alzheimer's Research UK, said: 'The results from this study support the growing evidence that GLP-1RA and SGLT-2 inhibitors medicines may reduce dementia risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We don't know yet why these medicines may be offering a protective effect, and will need more research to understand how they are affecting the brain.'&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Around 900,000 Britons are currently thought to have the memory-robbing disorder.

It marks a 40 per cent uptick on the previous forecast in 2017&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But she added that while the findings are 'interesting', it is important to consider if other factors might be influencing results like overall health, income or education.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It comes as separate research from scientists in Ireland today suggested that GLP-1RAs were also 'associated with a statistically significant reduction in dementia'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study analysed 26 clinical trials involving almost 165,000 patients to determine if drugs like SGLT2is and GLP-1RAs, as well as diabetes medications metformin and pioglitazone, led to a reduction in risk of dementia or cognitive impairment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It found most drugs 'were not associated with an overall reduction in all-cause dementia' although 'GLP-1RAs was associated with a statistically significant reduction in all-cause dementia.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alzheimer's is the most common cause of dementia in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Recent analysis by the &lt;a target="_self" href="/sciencetech/alzheimers-disease/index.html" id="mol-3c2d22b0-f839-11ef-a3a9-255f7f0724da" class=""&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; Society estimates the overall annual cost of the dementia to the UK is £42billion a year, with families bearing the brunt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;An ageing population means these costs — which include lost earnings of unpaid carers — are set to soar to £90billion in the next 15 years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Around 944,000 people in the UK are thought to be living with dementia, while the figure is thought to be around 7million in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia.

Prior to that, rates of invasive strep had been stable for 17 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Invasive group A strep occurs when bacteria spread to areas of the body that are normally germ-free, such as the lungs or bloodstream. The same type of bacteria, group A streptococcus, is responsible for &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/strep-throat-covid-fall-illness-what-know-rcna122152" target="_blank"&gt;strep throat&lt;/a&gt; — a far milder infection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Invasive strep can trigger necrotizing fasciitis, a soft tissue infection also known as &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/science/environment/fear-warming-oceans-flesh-eating-bacteria-rcna75935" target="_blank"&gt;flesh-eating disease&lt;/a&gt;, or streptococcal toxic shock syndrome, an immune reaction akin to sepsis that can lead to organ failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“Within 24 to 48 hours, you could have very, very rapid deterioration,” said Dr. Victor Nizet, a professor of pediatrics at the University of California, San Diego. Cases can transition from “seeming like a routine flu-like illness to rushing the patient to the ICU, fearing for their recovery,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The data came from 10 states, with roughly 35 million people total, that track the infections. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;In 2013, around 4 out of 100,000 people were diagnosed with invasive strep. By 2022, that rate had risen to around 8 out of 100,000. The number of cases rose from 1,082 in 2013 to 2,759 in 2022. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The study identified more than 21,000 total cases of the infection over the nine-year period, including almost 2,000 deaths. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“When you see this high number of deaths, extrapolate that across the country — we’re probably well into more than 10,000 deaths,” Nizet said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Christopher Gregory, a CDC researcher and an author of the study, said the threat of invasive strep to both the general population and high-risk groups has “substantially increased.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The study calls for “accelerated efforts” to prevent and control infections. It also offered a few possible explanations for the rise in cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;First, rising rates of diabetes and obesity, among other underlying health conditions, over the study period made some people more vulnerable to invasive strep. Both diabetes and obesity can lead to skin infections or compromise the immune system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Second, invasive strep is increasing among people who inject drugs, which can allow the bacteria to enter the bloodstream. Infections have also increased in people experiencing homelessness — in 2022, the rate of infections among this population was 807 out of 100,000. Gregory said the rate was “among the highest ever documented worldwide.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Finally, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/strep-throat-rates-remain-high-rcna80424" target="_blank"&gt;strains of group A strep &lt;/a&gt;appear to be expanding and becoming more diverse, which could create new opportunities for infection. Strains that have expanded in recent years seem more likely to cause skin infections than throat infections, according to the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Those strains may also be &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/-arrived-post-antibiotic-era-warns-new-drugs-deadly-superbugs-rcna76601" target="_blank"&gt;driving resistance to antibiotics&lt;/a&gt; used to treat certain cases of invasive group A strep, macrolides and clindamycin. While penicillin is the go-to antibiotic to treat strep infections, it can be used in combination with clindamycin to treat toxic shock syndrome, and doctors sometimes prescribe a macrolide if a patient has a penicillin allergy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Overall, the study found that the rate of infections was highest in adults ages 65 and older, and rose in all adults from 2013 to 2022. But it did not detect an increased rate in children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“That was, to me, the most shocking part of the study,” said Dr. Allison Eckard, division chief for pediatric infectious diseases at the Medical University of South Carolina. “Because clinically, we really are seeing what feels like an increase.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;In late 2022, there were widespread reports from children’s hospitals of &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/kids-health/rise-invasive-strep-a-infections-us-kids-rcna61507" target="_blank"&gt;a spike in pediatric cases of invasive strep&lt;/a&gt;. The CDC &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/kids-health/cdc-warns-rise-severe-strep-a-infections-children-rcna63034" target="_blank"&gt;issued an alert&lt;/a&gt; at the time, noting a possible link to respiratory viruses such as flu, Covid and RSV, which can make people susceptible to strep infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Eckard said pediatric cases have also started to look different in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“We are just seeing more severe cases, more unusual cases, more necrotizing fasciitis, and cases that do raise concern that there is something going on more nationally,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Eckard added that more research should explore whether certain strep strains are becoming more virulent, or if severe strains are becoming more prevalent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Doctors said the rise in group A strep infections also points to the need for a vaccine, especially given the rise in antibiotic resistance. However, Nizet questioned whether that would be feasible now, with &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/top-vaccine-regulators-fda-threatening-new-approvals-rcna198898" target="_blank"&gt;top vaccine scientists leaving the Food and Drug Administration&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“The lack of vaccine is devastating,” Nizet said. “Of course, we’re concerned about the turn of attitudes at the FDA and the CDC that seem to be putting some sticks in the spokes of the wheel of vaccine development.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Mon, 07 Apr 2025 15:02:38 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqgFBVV95cUxQQkNWaDFMcWNYc1l4RzJkQzZjdUpzSUlLYTRUVFFneWFBWWNZWC1iVFlVTEJqUDNZejRabU0tUzlwU1VfZ3J2dWoyM3YyemkwWGIzNlVRcV92am9jVG5NbnBBVUd5VFZ4bUFGekQxUUhVYk9BRmJjSjBLQ1piWjFpOXpQRE9vLThDVTZvVFNxWGZDTXlfLVVnSDNST1ZFbUdqSW9ORjJBOVgwZ9IBVkFVX3lxTE5FcXNWazJLWm93T3ZhemYzUDBkalNWS1ZDdE80bWxTekU3bmd6ZElFNXoyZXdjTlktSHhxaHNfN21YZ1BOM2ZSWHZXSlpTczI4OGNsa0pR</guid></item><item><title>Your Body Fat May Be Shaped by The Month You Were Conceived - ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikgFBVV95cUxQLURQN3NsWk4xZ3JWbTViTThNdzRUTDhRN1BvZ3hQZ0J4a3kwV1RBMTM3Q0pYNXdhdmthSVJyS3dmMVhSWXFXN3RSR0ZBUDZGYmJpcGtBcThFLXJESzZWZXlFUnpnMExJNlE1S2xYTkEyOTNFVEd4TjhLUkM2SGNLWDZTVGRxQmxJbktqbkxNV0dWdw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;The season in which you were conceived could have a surprising impact on how your metabolism works today. The largest study of its kind has found that individuals conceived in colder months store fat differently from those conceived in warmer months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among 356 healthy young male volunteers, researchers in Japan found that those who were conceived in a cold season showed relatively higher &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_adipose_tissue"&gt;brown adipose tissue&lt;/a&gt; activity. Brown adipose tissue is a type of fat that burns energy, keeps us warm, and helps regulate blood sugar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with increased brown fat activity, participants also showed increased energy expenditure, a lower body mass index (BMI), and less fat accumulation around their organs, which indicates better metabolic health overall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In those who are deemed overweight or obese, brown fat activity is &lt;a href="https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/healthy-weight/measuring-fat/"&gt;often lacking&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_157513" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-157513" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/Figure6httpsdoi.org10.1038s42255-025-01249-2.jpg" alt="Your Season of Conception Could Change How Your Body Stores Fat" class="size-full wp-image-157513" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/Figure6httpsdoi.org10.1038s42255-025-01249-2.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/Figure6httpsdoi.org10.1038s42255-025-01249-2-600x351.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-157513" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Summary of the intergenerational effects of preconception cold exposure. (Yoneshiro et al., &lt;em&gt;Nature Metabolism&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;To extend the results to a wider population, the team of researchers considered a second cohort of 286 male and female adults of various ages. Ultimately, they &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s42255-025-01249-2"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; "modest yet significant associations" between conception during cold seasons and brown fat activity, along with decreased BMI, visceral fat area, and waist circumference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on their models, the team suspects that the increase in brown adipose tissue (BAT) activity is what is driving the other metabolic outcomes. BMI on its own, for instance, was not directly associated with the season of conception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings are only correlational, but they support and extend other observational studies, which have found that the &lt;a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-developmental-origins-of-health-and-disease/article/abs/seasonofbirth-phenomenon-in-health-and-longevity-epidemiologic-evidence-and-mechanistic-considerations/E1B3C2F487BE31E3554C462D34A2C204"&gt;season in which someone is born&lt;/a&gt; may &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/baby-girls-born-during-summer-are-more-likely-to-be-healthy-adults-research-suggests"&gt;impact their health outcomes&lt;/a&gt; later in life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current study did not find a significant link between a person's birthday and their metabolic health, but it did find a link with their season of conception, 266 days before birth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings suggest that cold weather may impact the genetic expression of male sperm or female eggs, and these changes may be passed along to offspring when the two germ cells meet and fertilize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This could be a "sophisticated predictive cold adaptation" passed through the generations, which better enables offspring to survive in cold climates, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s42255-025-01249-2"&gt;according to the authors&lt;/a&gt;, led by biomedical scientist Takeshi Yoneshiro from the University of Tokyo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More research is needed to explore that concept, which the authors call "Pre-fertilization Origins of Health and Disease".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the findings are supported by &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-018-0102-y"&gt;past research on mice&lt;/a&gt;, which found that being exposed to certain weather conditions during preconception can enhance the metabolism of offspring, possibly because of epigenetic switches in their father's sperm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the authors of that same study applied their findings to humans, they found that those conceived during cold months were 3.2 percent more likely to possess active brown fat tissue, whereas those conceived in warmer months were more likely to lack active brown fat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers in Japan have now extended those results. In their study, they exposed male participants to a chilly 19 °C (66 °F) for 2 hours. Brown fat activity and metabolic activity were assessed after cold exposure and after sitting at room temperature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brown fat activity was notably higher in those who were conceived in the Northern Hemisphere between January 1 and April 15 and October 17 and December 31, as opposed to those conceived in a warm period between April 16 and October 16.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research team also considered real-world weather before and after each birth, finding a similar association in the conception period with daytime temperatures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"A major strength of our study is the thorough assessment of BAT using the gold-standard method and a large sample size of healthy participants," the authors &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s42255-025-01249-2"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our well-designed approach and the largest sample size in this field allow us to certify the intergenerational influence of cold stress on BAT activity in humans."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yoneshiro and colleagues argue that we need a better understanding of how cellular memories are stored and inherited to truly understand how environmental factors, like cold weather, exercise, or nutrition, can impact sperm, eggs, and the next generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Indeed," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s42255-025-01222-z"&gt;writes&lt;/a&gt; Helmholtz Munich epigeneticist Raffaele Teperino in an independent review of the research, "parental health and exposure to environmental challenges at conception, and maternal health and exposures during gestation and breastfeeding, are emerging as key determinants of offspring health and prenatal risks of complex, noncommunicable diseases."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was published in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42255-025-01249-2"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Nature Metabolism&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

It felt like I had lost the gear for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We talk a lot about strength and muscle gain here on AoM. If you’re looking to get bigger and stronger, you’ll find plenty of articles on those topics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But an area of fitness that we’ve overlooked, but I’m now starting to appreciate more and more as I move into middle age, is muscle &lt;em&gt;power&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What I was experiencing in my basketball match-ups against Gus was a diminishment in this capacity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers have given the age-related loss of muscle power a name: &lt;em&gt;powerpenia&lt;/em&gt;. And growing research shows that it’s a key predictor of whether you’ll be able to pick up your grandkid, climb a flight of stairs, or hoist your keister off the toilet when you’re 70.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s what you need to know about powerpenia — and how to resist it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="h.2ougy1iytcld"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Muscle Decline Trifecta: Sarcopenia, Dynapenia, and Powerpenia&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;You’ve likely heard of &lt;strong&gt;sarcopenia &lt;/strong&gt;— the loss of muscle mass with age. It typically begins around age 40 and accelerates after age 60. Muscle mass typically declines by .5-1% per year after 40. Sarcopenia leads to frailty in old age, which makes it hard for old people to get out of chairs, &lt;a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/health-fitness/health/take-the-simple-test-that-can-predict-your-mortality/"&gt;let alone get up from the floor if they fall down.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then there’s &lt;strong&gt;dynapenia &lt;/strong&gt;— the loss of muscle strength. Sarcopenia contributes to dynapenia, but there are also other things going on that lead to age-related declines in muscle strength. Mostly it comes down to our neuro-muscular system becoming less efficient at activating our muscles. Muscle strength declines along a similar trajectory as muscle mass, with a loss of 0.5–1% per year after age 40.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both sarcopenia and dynapenia can be mitigated and even reversed with regular strength training, which is why we’re big fans of weightlifting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2024, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10961295/"&gt;researchers&lt;/a&gt; introduced a third area of concern: &lt;strong&gt;powerpenia&lt;/strong&gt; — the loss of muscle power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Muscle power is the ability to display strength quickly; it’s explosiveness. Examples of muscle power in action include jumping for a rebound, sprinting, and punching. But muscle power doesn’t just come in handy in sports. Muscle power is also what lets you:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sprint to catch your kid running into the street&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Jump out of the way of an object about to hit you&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lift something quickly&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bound up stairs two at a time&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Catch yourself during a fall&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Powerpenia may be the new age-related muscle concern on the block, but it seems to be the most influential factor in the maintenance of our physical vitality. In fact, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10961295/"&gt;a recent study&lt;/a&gt; found that power — not strength — is the best predictor of whether older people are able to successfully navigate the activities of daily living.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="htlad-Mobile_Inline_MedRec"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The interesting thing about muscle power is that it actually drops faster than muscle size and strength — as much as 2–4% per year after 40. That means by your 60s or 70s, you might still look pretty solid and even test decently on a strength test, but you’ve lost the explosiveness needed to stay agile and independent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why the rapid decline? Three big reasons:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, there’s the loss of fast-twitch muscle fibers. Fast-twitch fibers are responsible for generating quick bursts of strength and speed, and they naturally atrophy faster than slow-twitch fibers as we age and don’t call upon them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, there are the changes in our tendons due to inactivity. If you don’t regularly do activities that require you to display strength quickly, your tendons become stiff and less efficient at storing and releasing energy, making explosive movements harder to perform. The degradation of tendon health from disuse explains why a lot of middle-aged guys injure themselves when they decide to play pick-up basketball for the first time in a decade. It’s why I got a bad case of hamstring tendonitis a few years ago when I decided to do a sprint workout after years of not sprinting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, as we age and don’t call upon our fast-twitch muscles for explosive activity, our brain and nervous system become less efficient at telling our muscles to contract quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="h.nb7xyes20zkg"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to Fight Back Against Powerpenia&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After my lackluster performance in basketball games against Gus and after reading the research on powerpenia, I decided I needed to do something to counteract the decline of muscle power that comes with middle age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, it’s not that hard to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are some things I’ve started to incorporate into my physical training to fend off powerpenia:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="h.3kvc6vtco0i7"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Plyometrics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plyometric exercises develop explosive power by training your muscles and nervous system to react quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You don’t have to devote an entire workout to plyos. You can add one or two plyometric exercises to your regular strength-training routines. Here’s what I’m doing:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before my first lower-body workout of the week, I do the following plyometric exercises:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Power Skipping. &lt;/strong&gt;Perform a regular skip, but jump and lift your knee as high as you can. I do this for 15 yards, three times.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Box Jumps&lt;/strong&gt;. Stand in front of a box or other suitable platform. Try to find a box that’s at least 18″ off the ground. Jump onto the box. To avoid injury, step rather than jump down from the box. Do three sets of five jumps.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before my second lower-body workout of the week, I do the following plyos:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Broad Jumps. &lt;/strong&gt;Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, swing your arms back, bend your knees, and then explosively jump forward as far as possible, using your arms to help propel you. Land softly with your knees slightly bent to absorb the impact and maintain balance. Do three sets of five jumps.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pogo Hops&lt;/strong&gt;. Stand with your feet together and begin jumping straight up as high as you can. When you land, begin the next jump as quickly as possible. Do three sets of ten hops.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before my first upper-body workout of the week, I do the following plyometric exercise:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="htlad-Mobile_Inline_MedRec"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Plyometric Push-up&lt;/strong&gt;. Assume a normal push-up position. Lower yourself to the floor. With explosive force, push off the floor with enough force that your hands leave the ground. Do three sets of five push-ups.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before my second upper-body workout of the week, I do the following plyometric exercise:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overhead Medicine Ball Slam. &lt;/strong&gt;Raise the medicine ball overhead and slam it down as hard as you can. Do three sets of ten slams.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I continue with these plyos, I’ll probably rotate some of them out and substitute some of &lt;a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/health-fitness/fitness/beginners-guide-to-plyometrics/"&gt;the plyometric exercises we’ve written about here&lt;/a&gt; into my routine.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="h.gm5v3el61q5r"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hill Sprints&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hill sprints are one of the most potent weapons against power loss. They engage fast-twitch fibers better than flat-surface sprints while also reducing impact on your muscles and tendons, thus reducing the likelihood of injuries. Besides training for power, hill sprints are a great &lt;a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/health-fitness/fitness/podcast-970-hiit-martin-gibala/"&gt;HIIT exercise&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Find a 20–30-yard hill. After a warm-up, do 4–6 sprints up the hill at 80–90% effort. Walk down slowly to recover. Rest 1–2 minutes between sprints. You just need to do this once a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more tips on doing safe and effective sprints in general, read our &lt;a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/health-fitness/fitness/the-grown-ups-guide-to-sprinting/"&gt;Grown-Up’s Guide to Sprinting.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re looking for another powerpenia-fighting cardio/HIIT exercise, jump roping is a great one. &lt;a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/health-fitness/fitness/how-to-jump-rope-like-a-boxer/"&gt;We’ve got a whole guide to that, too.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If it’s been a long time since you did the kind of explosive exercises outlined above, you may be concerned that trying them will get you injured. Start slowly and gently, to be sure. Doing things like stepping down from the box after your box jumps and sprinting uphill will help lessen the risk of injuries. And you can do things like broad jumps and hill sprints on softer surfaces like grass.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But you do need to steadily ease into these movements to avoid a kind of catch-22: avoid plyometric exercises out of fear of injury, and you actually increase the risk of injury when life suddenly demands an explosive movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only way to safely rebuild this capacity is to train it — gradually and consistently. And once you have it back, don’t stop. Keep training these movements into old age, until the day you’re truly no longer capable of doing them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="h.x8rprkw436kg"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here’s to Powerful Aging&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve been doing these power exercises for about a month now, and I’m already noticing a difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m still not as explosive as my teenage son, but I can better shift myself into that gear when we face off on the driveway court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And knowing that training for power will keep me strong and capable as I age — not just in the game, but in life — is the real win.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="htlad-Desktop_Bottom_Flex"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="htlad-Mobile_Bottom_Flex"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="htlad-Mobile_Inline_MedRec"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="disco-widget" data-widget-id="WI_clin8nf4e002101ppb66qsrzn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Art of Manliness</author><pubDate>Mon, 07 Apr 2025 15:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMic0FVX3lxTE1VZUhiNDJJbUoza2ktMk1RbzRoNXJZQ0pOR0tOR1MxU1ZuNVQ3cVBVUk9Wd3ltRG9CMDhibVNIUERXVmIyZFJtSXN6T1hocXlGV1lDY3laNk93NFZOOTZycHhJVVdNWnJYdmEzdHBqUUZtZlE</guid></item><item><title>ADHD and Music: Why Background Beats May Boost Study Focus - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYkFVX3lxTE9kaXh2eHZjaUdYRV9QcEI5T0pQV0lCSDVSaTE4UVphTHVaTV9NLUJkWVBrS1lUNFh4WUxIRzBXODNVX2JDYVVRTnVwaEZNOWwtOE9yVW1rMHNYcUtILVVmUVBB?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;A new study explored whether young adults with ADHD are more likely to listen to background music during daily tasks. The survey, involving over 400 participants, found that individuals with ADHD prefer listening to music—especially stimulating music—while studying or playing sports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This contrasts with neurotypical individuals, who tend to listen to music more passively, such as when relaxing. The findings suggest that music may help people with ADHD achieve optimal arousal levels for focus, opening new avenues for non-pharmacological support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Study Behavior:&lt;/strong&gt; Young adults with ADHD are more likely to listen to background music while studying and playing sports.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stimulating Sounds:&lt;/strong&gt; Individuals with ADHD prefer energizing music over relaxing tunes, possibly to boost cognitive performance.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Potential Support Tool:&lt;/strong&gt; Musi&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Montreal&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are people with attention deficit disorder with or without hyperactivity (ADHD) more likely to listen to background music while performing daily tasks?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kelly-Ann Lachance, a doctoral student in clinical neuropsychology at Université de Montréal, decided to find out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She and her supervisor, neuropsychologist and psychology professor Nathalie Gosselin, analyzed the responses of 434 young adults between the ages of 17 and 30 to an online survey about music listening habits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108426"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ADHD-music-focus-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ADHD-music-focus-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ADHD-music-focus-neuroscience-770x514.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ADHD-music-focus-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ADHD-music-focus-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ADHD-music-focus-neuroscience-293x196.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ADHD-music-focus-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ADHD-music-focus-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a teen boy working on a laptop while listening to music." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ADHD-music-focus-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ADHD-music-focus-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ADHD-music-focus-neuroscience-770x514.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ADHD-music-focus-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ADHD-music-focus-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ADHD-music-focus-neuroscience-293x196.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ADHD-music-focus-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Since music is ubiquitous and readily available, it could be valuable in helping people manage ADHD symptoms. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In lab studies, we rarely ask about listening habits, and yet it’s important because people differ in the amount of stimulation they need to perform a task optimally,” said Lachance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results were published in &lt;em&gt;Frontiers in Psychology&lt;/em&gt; in January 2025. Lachance said she chose to publish in an open-access journal because she wanted to share her findings with a broader audience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As a future clinician, I want to use research to help the individuals I follow,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Detailed online questionnaire&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Launched at the end of the pandemic, the study relied entirely on data collected through the survey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Some parts of it already existed, so we took the questions on music-listening habits and the subjective effects of background music and put them in an online questionnaire that could be completed in under 15 minutes,” explained Lachance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To determine whether respondents were ADHD or neurotypical, the survey included questions from the Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale for DSM-5 (ASRS-5); 118 of the respondents screened as ADHD and 316 as neurotypical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The ASRS-5 is a quick way to assess ADHD symptoms,” Lachance noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other questions in the survey assessed each respondent’s recent emotional state, level of anxiety and depressive symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Music is used to modulate emotions, so we wanted to include emotional functioning in the study,” explained Gosselin, who is also director of UdeM’s Music, Emotions and Cognition Research Laboratory (MUSEC Laboratory) and a researcher at its parent organization, BRAMS (International Laboratory for Brain, Music and Sound Research).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Playing sports or studying&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study examined differences in background music listening during a host of daily tasks, including cognitive activities such as reading, writing and studying, and less cognitive activities such as cooking, taking public transport and playing sports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It found that people with ADHD reported listening to background music while playing sports and while studying significantly more than did neurotypicals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, neurotypicals spent more hours per week listening to music while not doing anything else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the researchers weren’t completely surprised by the results, they didn’t see them as a foregone conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You could also imagine that music might interfere with performing a cognitively demanding task,” which could have made individuals with ADHD less inclined to listen to music at the same time, said Gosselin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, not only do young adults with ADHD like to have music in the background while studying, they prefer music that is stimulating rather than relaxing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Why stimulating music? The literature shows that people with ADHD need more activation to perform at the same optimal level as neurotypicals. Music could help with this, regardless of the type of activity,” explained Lachance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“However, this is a hypothesis that requires future testing,” Gosselin pointed out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A beneficial habit?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is music in fact beneficial for young adults with ADHD? How does it affect their concentration and motivation? Gosselin has been wondering about this for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My first neuropsychology internship was in child psychiatry,” she recalled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In one of my first cases, a father asked me if it was a good idea for his teen with attention difficulties to listen to music while studying. I didn’t know what to say because there were no conclusive data in the literature. But the question stayed with me.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since music is ubiquitous and readily available, it could be valuable in helping people manage ADHD symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m not suggesting it could replace medication, but it could complement it,” said Lachance. “The question is how we can use the full potential of music to promote optimal performance.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this music and ADHD research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://nouvelles.umontreal.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Catherine Couturier&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://nouvelles.umontreal.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Montreal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Catherine Couturier – University of Montreal&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2024.1508181" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Listening habits and subjective effects of background music in young adults with and without ADHD&lt;/a&gt;” by Nathalie Gosselin et al. &lt;em&gt;Frontiers in Psychology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Listening habits and subjective effects of background music in young adults with and without ADHD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adults listen to an average of 20.7 hours of music per week, according to a study conducted across 26 countries. Numerous studies indicate that listening to music can have beneficial effects on cognitive performance and emotional well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Music listening habits may vary depending on individual needs and listening contexts. However, a limited number of studies have specifically examined the patterns of background music usage during various more or less cognitive activities, especially among individuals with attentional difficulties related to ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study primarily aimed to compare music listening habits during daily activities that are more and less cognitive (e.g., studying, problem-solving versus cleaning, engaging in sports) between neurotypical young adults and those screened for ADHD (respondents who were identified as likely having ADHD based on the number of self-reported symptoms). To achieve this, 434 young adults aged 17 to 30 responded to an online survey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results indicate that certain listening habits differ significantly between the neurotypical and ADHD-screened groups. The ADHD-screened group reports significantly more background music listening during less cognitive activities and while studying, compared to the neurotypical group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results also reveal a difference in the proportion of individuals preferring stimulating music between the groups: ADHD-screened individuals report significantly more frequent listening to stimulating music, regardless of the activity type (more or less cognitive). Other aspects of music listening are common to both groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regardless of the group, more respondents reported preferring to listen to relaxing, instrumental, familiar and self-chosen music during more cognitive activities, whereas for less cognitive activities, more individuals mentioned preferring to listen to music that is stimulating, with lyrics, familiar and self-chosen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, the results confirm that most young adults listen to music during their daily activities and perceive positive effects from this listening.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Mon, 07 Apr 2025 14:40:13 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiYkFVX3lxTE9kaXh2eHZjaUdYRV9QcEI5T0pQV0lCSDVSaTE4UVphTHVaTV9NLUJkWVBrS1lUNFh4WUxIRzBXODNVX2JDYVVRTnVwaEZNOWwtOE9yVW1rMHNYcUtILVVmUVBB</guid></item><item><title>Tuberculosis At Joliet West High School: What School Officials Know - Patch</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMingFBVV95cUxOREMyQ19mU1QzY1RwVkJqeWlyV2dsUXhKT1dYUTZMYlRIY0hzeHBhaE5zNXZ2QmxrT1B4V2ozRmtoU1k1dWNwODhKYUh5eG5qcFFvWFpqTHp5Y2laZ1hFQUNhNDF3NEQtWm43THBzOFlwYjNWTXdYVE9Tel9QazR3VWFPdnBkeUxvVVlFRXEzMG9DWlRwLWZtdTNSVElBQdIBswFBVV95cUxOLWZ5TE0tcDdLMnZVY3BRWG1rT0IyOHlraWRiT3ZJZ1J5NW12eWNnclBHdzRJdWVFbC05LXhVTFNvdF9xRkFKc2NfX01FUEZHdWNXYWZXN1JMMXhMa2xjT3VrSWg1QnhwUkhZQkRUQTc1YkRrenlkVi02dXdFOWM4aTFIckNnUk9iZExCU1FMNDdVdDBSc3FCWXV3N1V4SXNrajdHendzbnVQYmYxMnZ6T2pQaw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__LDG2k"&gt;&lt;p&gt;JOLIET — A recent &lt;a href="https://www.nbcchicago.com/news/health/tuberculosis-case-confirmed-at-suburban-high-school-what-we-know-so-far/3711165/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;Waukegan High School case involving a student testing positive for tuberculosis&lt;/a&gt; made the Chicago television stations, but last week's announcement involving a tuberculosis case at Joliet West High School was only shared in-house.

Researchers found that mice developed strong aversions to a flavored drink after getting sick, even with a 30-minute delay between consumption and illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The central amygdala, a brain region tied to fear and emotion, was active during tasting, illness, and memory recall—highlighting its role in “one-shot” learning. This discovery offers insight into how the brain links distant events, with potential relevance for understanding PTSD and other trauma-based memory formation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Memory Hub Identified:&lt;/strong&gt; The central amygdala encodes and retrieves aversive food memories.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gut-Brain Link:&lt;/strong&gt; Hindbrain cells with CGRP connect illness signals to memory centers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time-Delayed Learning:&lt;/strong&gt; The brain tags novel flavors to form associations hours later.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Princeton&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We’ve all been there: one bad oyster ruins seafood forever. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, Princeton neuroscientists have pinpointed the exact “memory hub” in the brain responsible for these powerful food aversions in mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new results reveal how “one-shot learning”, where a single experience creates lasting memories, unfolds in rodents, which might shed light on how similar memories form in people, such as when a single traumatic event leads to PTSD. As such, work on food poisoning in mice may help potentially inform future clinical treatments in humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings were published on April 2 in the journal &lt;em&gt;Nature.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people can recall a vivid food poisoning experience that’s led them to avoid certain foods that made them ill. Christopher Zimmerman, Ph.D. has heard many such stories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I haven’t had food poisoning in a while, but now whenever I talk to people at meetings, I hear all about their food poisoning experiences,” said Zimmerman, lead author of the new paper, and postdoctoral fellow at the Princeton Neuroscience Institute (PNI).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though the experience is common enough, the mystery that has long puzzled researchers was the time gap. Unlike touching a hot stove and feeling immediate pain, food poisoning involves a significant delay between eating contaminated food and getting sick – what Zimmerman calls the “meal-to-malaise” delay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Working in the lab of Ilana Witten, Ph.D., professor of neuroscience at PNI, Zimmerman first started to tease out the brain mechanisms behind learning to avoid sickening food by asking mice to try a new flavor they had never encountered before: grape Kool-Aid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s a better model for how we actually learn,” Zimmerman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Normally, scientists in the field will use sugar alone, but that’s not a normal flavor that you would encounter in a meal. Kool-Aid, while it’s still not typical, is a little bit closer since it has more dimensions to its flavor profile.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mice learned that poking their nose in a special area of their cage would deliver a drop of Kool-Aid. Thirty minutes later after enjoying their first taste of the purple beverage, the mice received a one-time injection causing temporary food poisoning-like illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly, when offered a choice two days later, the mice strongly avoided the once-appealing Kool-Aid and preferred to just drink water. What did stick out to Zimmerman and Witten, however, was where in the brain this juice/illness association was found: the central amygdala.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you look across the entire brain, at where novel versus familiar flavors are represented, the amygdala turns out to be a really interesting place because it’s preferentially activated by novel flavors at every stage in learning,” Zimmerman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s active when the mouse is drinking, when the mouse is feeling sick later, and then when the mouse retrieves that negative memory days later.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The central amygdala, a small group of cells towards the bottom of the brain involved in emotion and fear learning, also processes a lot of information from the environment, including smells and tastes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zimmerman’s results are the first to show how critical the central amygdala is at every step along the way of learning and were striking even with the very first experiment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I remember making the plot from the first animal and sharing it on Slack with Ilana,” Zimmerman said. “She was at my desk a minute later to talk about how exciting this is.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that they knew where aversive flavor memories are formed, the team then traced how illness signals from the gut reach the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on hints from previous research, they identified specialized hindbrain cells containing a specific protein (CGRP) that directly connect to the central amygdala. Stimulating these cells 30 minutes after a mouse’s Kool-Aid experience created the same aversion as actual food poisoning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also found that feeling sick caused the Kool-Aid-activated neurons to reactivate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was as if the mice were thinking back and remembering the prior experience that caused them to later feel sick,” Witten said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was very cool to see this unfolding at the level of individual neurons.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team believes novel flavors may “tag” certain brain cells to remain sensitive to illness signals for hours after eating, allowing those cells to be specifically reactivated by sickness, and therefore connect cause and effect despite the time delay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research opens new pathways for understanding how the brain forms connections between distant events – with implications beyond understanding how bad shellfish memories are cemented.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Often when we learn in the real world, there’s a long delay between whatever choice we’ve made and the outcome. But that’s not typically studied in the lab, so we don’t really understand the neural mechanisms that support this kind of long delay learning,” Zimmerman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our hope is that these findings will provide a framework for thinking about how the brain might leverage memory recall to solve this learning problem in other situations.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;Funding for the study was provided by the National Institutes of Health (K99-DA059957, U19-NS104648, U19-NS123716, DP1-MH136573, RF1-MH128776, P50-MH136296), the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, the Simons Collaboration on the Global Brain, the Helen Hay Whitney Foundation, and the Brain Research Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this food aversion and neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://pni.princeton.edu/people/dan-vahaba" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Dan Vahaba&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://pni.princeton.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Princeton&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Dan Vahaba – Princeton&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08828-z" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;A neural mechanism for learning from delayed postingestive feedback&lt;/a&gt;” by Christopher A.

However, it remains unclear how the brain is able to assign credit to flavours experienced during a meal with postingestive feedback signals that can arise after a substantial delay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here we reveal an unexpected role for the postingestive reactivation of neural flavour representations in this temporal credit-assignment process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To begin, we leverage the fact that mice learn to associate novel, but not familiar, flavours with delayed gastrointestinal malaise signals to investigate how the brain represents flavours that support aversive postingestive learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analyses of brain-wide activation patterns reveal that a network of amygdala regions is unique in being preferentially activated by novel flavours across every stage of learning (consumption, delayed malaise and memory retrieval).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By combining high-density recordings in the amygdala with optogenetic stimulation of malaise-coding hindbrain neurons, we show that delayed malaise signals selectively reactivate flavour representations in the amygdala from a recent meal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The degree of malaise-driven reactivation of individual neurons predicts the strengthening of flavour responses upon memory retrieval, which in turn leads to stabilization of the population-level representation of the recently consumed flavour. By contrast, flavour representations in the amygdala degrade in the absence of unexpected postingestive consequences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thus, we demonstrate that postingestive reactivation and plasticity of neural flavour representations may support learning from delayed feedback.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Mon, 07 Apr 2025 13:59:14 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiakFVX3lxTE95WVg4TkphcDQ5dzNadnR6THl6Z2hpb3NIUWNqeDczQXJtMVd1T0FSVXJDaVlLd28zNkFIT0dQdkNyM0U2aENfWEhKYXZvRkRhdkxmaUFnei16NFk2WTI4dlhOelJIazd1ZkE</guid></item><item><title>I want to lose 30 pounds and improve my heart health.

              &lt;p&gt;Amanda Bonesteel, a full-time student who has a sedentary lifestyle, told Business Insider that she wants to &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/calories-macros-protein-fat-weight-loss-expert-advice-2023-11" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;lose weight&lt;/a&gt; and improve her &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/test-heart-health-simple-exercises-to-live-longer-cardiologist" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;cardiovascular health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 44-year-old, who is based in Michigan, said her goal is to &lt;a target="_blank" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/simple-lessons-to-lose-weight-build-muscle-2023-8" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;lose 30 pounds&lt;/a&gt;. She occasionally goes to the gym but spends most of her time sitting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She submitted an average day of eating to BI's Nutrition Clinic, where registered nutritionists and dietitians look over readers' diets and offer suggestions based on their goals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nichola Ludlam-Raine, a dietitian and the author of "&lt;a target="_blank" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/dietitian-wrote-book-ultra-processed-foods-eats-in-a-day-2024-7" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;How Not to Eat Ultra-Processed&lt;/a&gt;," told BI that Bonesteel is doing some things well, but she could improve her diet in certain areas, such as eating breakfast for more energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="4a30e45c-47aa-422f-9041-3b35ea862600" data-toc-id="4a30e45c-47aa-422f-9041-3b35ea862600"&gt;Eating a balanced dinner&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bonesteel starts the day with a coffee with cream and sugar at about 10 a.m. or 11 a.m. For lunch, she has something small like a turkey sandwich, banana, or a bowl of soup.&lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/figure&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Her dinners vary but usually consist of a vegetable (such as green beans, cauliflower, or carrots), protein (chicken or lean beef), and carb (whole grains or potatoes).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ludlam-Raine said that Bonesteel's dinner sounds balanced and nutrient-dense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Including a protein source alongside a starchy carbohydrate and a generous portion of vegetables is a great foundation for supporting both cardiovascular health and weight loss," she said. "This kind of plate structure offers &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/high-fiber-foods-blue-zones-longevity-diet-includes-nut-bread-2022-1" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;fiber&lt;/a&gt;, vitamins, minerals, and &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/4-5-rule-hit-protein-target-without-tracking-weight-loss-2024-10" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;protein&lt;/a&gt; — all of which contribute to satiety, blood sugar regulation, and overall health."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="0a1585aa-23ee-471c-a8e6-7f76f831e117" data-toc-id="0a1585aa-23ee-471c-a8e6-7f76f831e117"&gt;Eating less can be counterproductive for weight loss&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ludlam-Raine said Bonesteel doesn't appear to eat enough overall, which could be counterproductive by reducing her energy levels and metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Starting the day with only coffee that includes cream and sugar means she's going for several hours after waking without any real nourishment," Ludlam-Raine said. "This can contribute to low energy and poor concentration, and can sometimes lead to overeating later in the day due to increased hunger or cravings."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bonesteel's lunch is also very light and may not sustain her for long, especially with her mentally demanding studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If she's not getting enough protein, fiber, or healthy fats earlier in the day, her body may compensate later, potentially leading to larger portion sizes at dinner or snacking in the evening — something that's very common and often overlooked," Ludlam-Raine said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She added: "Importantly, under-eating can &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/health/what-is-metabolism" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;slow down metabolic rate&lt;/a&gt; over time, making weight loss harder, not easier. So, ironically, Amanda might not be losing weight at her desired rate because she's not eating enough during the day."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Bonesteel struggles to fit in formal exercise, squeezing in short but regular walk breaks or quick home workouts could be an easier way to boost her movement levels, Ludlam-Raine said.&lt;/p&gt;

"A few simple tweaks could make a big difference to both how she feels and how her body responds."&lt;/p&gt;

These cardiovascular effects—mostly modest increases—were consistent across stimulants and non-stimulants, with guanfacine being the exception, lowering these parameters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While concerns have been raised about side effects, the benefits of ADHD medications—such as improved academic function and reduced mortality—generally outweigh the risks. The researchers emphasize that regular cardiovascular monitoring should be part of ADHD care, especially in patients with preexisting heart conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Small Cardiovascular Effects:&lt;/strong&gt; ADHD meds cause minor increases in heart rate and blood pressure, except for guanfacine, which lowers them.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stimulants vs. Non-Stimulants:&lt;/strong&gt; Both types of medications showed similar cardiovascular effects, countering assumptions that only stimulants pose risks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monitoring Urged:&lt;/strong&gt; Authors recommend routine blood pressure and heart rate checks for all patients, regardless of medication type.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Southampton&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new study led by the University of Southampton has found that medications for ADHD have overall small effects on blood pressure and heart rate after weeks or a few months of use.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There have been concerns about the side effects of ADHD medications but the new findings, coupled with other studies, suggest that the benefits of taking these medications outweigh the risks, while highlighting the need for careful monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108418"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/heart-ADHD-pharma-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/heart-ADHD-pharma-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/heart-ADHD-pharma-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/heart-ADHD-pharma-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/heart-ADHD-pharma-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/heart-ADHD-pharma-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/heart-ADHD-pharma-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/heart-ADHD-pharma-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a heart and pills." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/heart-ADHD-pharma-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/heart-ADHD-pharma-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/heart-ADHD-pharma-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/heart-ADHD-pharma-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/heart-ADHD-pharma-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/heart-ADHD-pharma-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/heart-ADHD-pharma-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;It is estimated that attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) affects around 4 per cent of children in the UK. Of these, around 45 per cent are treated with medication.Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, published in &lt;em&gt;The Lancet Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;, conducted the largest and most comprehensive analysis of the cardiovascular effects of ADHD medications based on the results of randomised controlled trials – the most rigorous type of clinical study to assess medication effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Samuele Cortese, senior lead author of the study from the University of Southampton said: “When it comes to taking any medication, risks and benefits should always be assessed together. We found an overall small increase in blood pressure and pulse for the majority of children taking ADHD medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Other studies show clear benefits in terms of reductions in mortality risk and improvement in academic functions, as well as a small increased risk of hypertension, but not other cardiovascular diseases. Overall, the risk-benefit ratio is reassuring for people taking ADHD medications.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was funded by the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR), within the framework of the NIHR Research Professorships scheme to Professor Samuele Cortese, with Dr Luis Farhat (University of São Paulo, Brazil) as first author and Professor Alexis Revet (University of Toulouse, France) as co-senior author.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is estimated that attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder&lt;strong&gt; (&lt;/strong&gt;ADHD) affects around 4 per cent of children in the UK. Of these, around 45 per cent are treated with medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The international team of investigators analysed data from 102 randomized controlled trials, including a total of 22,702 participants with ADHD. They used an advanced statistical approach – network meta-analysis – that allowed them to compare the effects of several medications, even when the medications were not directly compared in the trials included in the analysis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found that all ADHD medications were generally associated with overall small effects on blood pressure, heart rate, and ECG parameters. With the exception of guanfacine (which leads to decreased blood pressure and heart rate), other medications led to increases in the values of these parameters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No significant differences were found between stimulants (including methylphenidate and amphetamine) and non-stimulants (atomoxetine and viloxazine) with regard to their effects on blood pressure and heart rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings should inform future clinical guidelines, stressing the need to systematically monitor blood pressure and heart rate, both for stimulants and non-stimulants. This should be particularly relevant for practitioners who might assume that only stimulants have a negative effect on the cardiovascular system,” said Dr Farhat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers say that those with existing heart conditions should discuss the side effects of ADHD medications with a specialist cardiologist before starting treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Revet added: “Our findings, based on randomised controlled trials that tend to be of short duration due to ethical issues, should be complemented by results from real-world, longer-term studies.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team will now look to see if some groups might be more vulnerable to cardiovascular side effects than others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NIHR Research Professor Cortese concluded: “While our findings are informative at the group level, that is, on average, we cannot exclude that a subgroup of individuals may have a higher risk of more substantial cardiovascular alterations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While it is currently not possible to identify those individuals at higher risk, efforts based on precision medicine approaches will hopefully provide important insights in the future.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this psychopharmacology and cardiovascular health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#c0b3b4a5b6a5eeb7a9acaca9a1adb380b3afb4afaeeea1a3eeb5ab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Steven Williams&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://soton.ac.uk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Southampton&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Steven Williams – University of Southampton&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S2215-0366(25)00062-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Comparative cardiovascular safety of medications for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder in children, adolescents, and adults: a systematic review and network meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt;” by Samuele Cortese et al. &lt;em&gt;Lancet Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Comparative cardiovascular safety of medications for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder in children, adolescents, and adults: a systematic review and network meta-analysis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Concerns about the cardiovascular safety of medications used for the treatment of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) remain. We aimed to compare the effects of pharmacological treatments for ADHD on haemodynamic values and electrocardiogram (ECG) parameters in children, adolescents, and adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For this systematic review and network meta-analysis, we searched 12 electronic databases, including Cochrane CENTRAL, Embase, PubMed, and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, from database inception to Jan 18, 2024, for published and unpublished randomised controlled trials comparing amphetamines, atomoxetine, bupropion, clonidine, guanfacine, lisdexamfetamine, methylphenidate, modafinil, or viloxazine against each other or placebo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Primary outcomes were change in systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP), measured in mm Hg, and pulse, measured in beats per minute, at timepoints closest to 12 weeks, 26 weeks, and 52 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Summary data were extracted and pooled in random-effects network meta-analyses. Certainty of evidence was assessed with the Confidence in Network Meta-Analysis (CINeMA) framework.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study was registered with PROSPERO, CRD42021295352. Before study initiation, we contacted representatives of a UK-based charity of people with lived experience of ADHD—the ADHD Foundation—regarding the relevance of the topic and the appropriateness of the outcomes chosen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Findings&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;102 randomised controlled trials with short-term follow-up (median 7 weeks [IQR 5–9]) were included, encompassing 13 315 children and adolescents (aged ≥5 years and &amp;lt;18 years; mean age 11 years [SD 3]; of available data, 9635 [73%] were male and 3646 [27%] were female; of available data, 289 [2%] were Asian, 1719 [15%] were Black, and 8303 [71%] were White) and 9387 adults (≥18 years, mean age 35 years [11]; of available data, 5064 [57%] were male and 3809 [43%] were female; of available data, 488 [6%] were Asian, 457 [6%] were Black, and 6372 [79%] were White).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amphetamines, atomoxetine, lisdexamfetamine, methylphenidate, and viloxazine led to increments in haemodynamic values in children and adolescents, adults, or both.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In children and adolescents, mean increase against placebo ranged from 1·07 (95% CI 0·36–1·79; moderate CINeMA confidence) with atomoxetine to 1·81 (1·05–2·57; moderate) with methylphenidate for SBP; from 1·93 (0·74–3·11; high) with amphetamines to 2·42 (1·69–3·15; low) with methylphenidate for DBP; and from 2·79 (1·05–4·53; moderate) with viloxazine to 5·58 (4·67–6·49; high) with atomoxetine for pulse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In adults, mean increase against placebo ranged from 1·66 (95% CI 0·38–2·93; very low) with methylphenidate to 2·3 (0·66–3·94; very low) with amphetamines for SBP; from 1·60 (0·29–2·91; very low) with methylphenidate to 3·07 (0·69–5·45; very low) with lisdexamfetamine for DBP; and from 4·37 (3·16–5·59; very low) with methylphenidate to 5·8 (2·3–9·3; very low) with viloxazine for pulse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amphetamines, lisdexamfetamine, or methylphenidate were not associated with larger increments in haemodynamic values compared with atomoxetine or viloxazine in either children and adolescents or adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guanfacine was associated with decrements in haemodynamic values in children and adolescents (mean decrease against placebo of –2·83 [95% CI –3·8 to –1·85; low CINeMA confidence] in SBP, –2·08 [–3 to –1·17; low] in DBP, and –4·06 [–5·45 –2·68; moderate] in pulse) and adults (mean decrease against placebo of –10·1 [–13·76 to –6·44; very low] in SBP, –7·73 [–11·88 to –3·58; very low] in DBP, and –6·83 [–10·85 to –2·81; very low] in pulse). Only four RCTs informed on effects in the medium term and none on the long term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Practitioners should monitor blood pressure and pulse in patients with ADHD treated with any pharmacological intervention, and not stimulants only. Given the short duration of available randomised controlled trials, new research providing insights on the causal effects of ADHD medications on cardiovascular parameters in the longer term should be funded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Funding&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;National Institute for Health and Care Research.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Mon, 07 Apr 2025 13:34:58 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMic0FVX3lxTE5LVHd6TzljNldBaDRWWXN0M0ZQY1hLdk5YY3V0aWxtU21hcW1wOWR3SkZwTzFxeE1CZGFaVUN6Q2R2T2ZPWE5icW5aUDBqeUdIUUZJR2MzTFpLT21UM1U1MmM3SjJVVmRaREdsNEUwNE5saWc</guid></item><item><title>The Best and the Worst - The Dispatch</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinwFBVV95cUxPVHRBUG1NcGtCX2wzalJuVHJKd05jWHkwS2VUaEZ1U2tGdDhhXzJ3S0VNUDJmMUx1ODRhMGt1RFg2WklqOHRUVzA4Ni1LZmh0UG14WTN6ZVhiNlgwQzc3c2U1VEhIX3pFaUlyS19QQ3NsRnl5ME1lNW1MX3ZRWFk5MEVsY3A5YmVRQWE0U3NLczg4Q1VhSTZUMlhvcW9fWWc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="tight-template drop-cap"&gt;
                &lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“None of us is as dumb as all of us,” as the satirical motivational poster puts it. Americans are getting a little taste of that right now, with the American &lt;em&gt;demos&lt;/em&gt; collectively choosing policies that few if any of us (the non-psychopaths, anyway) would have chosen individually. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;As it goes in economics, so it goes elsewhere. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nobody would choose to have polio. No father would choose to have his child or children killed or crippled by the horrifying disease. And yet it is the case that the only places in the world where polio is endemic are places that choose to have polio: Afghanistan and Pakistan. Those places have polio because they refuse to allow international medical workers and Rotary Club volunteers (who have been working successfully against polio for nearly a half century) to operate freely and in safety. Perhaps they do not want their children to be maimed by polio. Perhaps they do not want their countries to be poor, ignorant, backward, and weak. But their leaders, such as they are, choose policies that make these outcomes inevitable, and the people give their implicit consent: &lt;em&gt;Q&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;ui tacet consentire videtur&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;        


&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Afghanistan and Pakistan could be decently governed countries tomorrow if their peoples chose it; they could be as economically prosperous as Poland or Greece in a few decades and as well-off as the median EU country or Canada in a few more years, if they chose the right kind of policies. Hong Kong went from being one of the poorest places in the world—with basically nothing in the way of infrastructure or natural resources—to one of the wealthiest in only a few years thanks to the entrepreneurship of the people and the benign neglect of their British colonial overlords. But, instead, Afghanistan and Pakistan are distinguished from the rest of the world by the fact that their children suffer death and disability because of their refusal to allow their people access to a vaccine that has been available in the rest of the world since Dwight Eisenhower was in the White House. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first polio vaccine was developed by Jonas Salk, the son of one of those terrible uneducated immigrants from backwards countries with values alien to our own (his mother was a Jew who had the good luck to get out of Minsk) and a product of that hated “meritocracy” our anti-elitism warriors are always putting sneer quotes around: Being a Jew and coming from a family without money, Salk was effectively excluded from the prep-school-to-Ivy League pipeline but had access to the merit-based—and very competitive—institutions of New York City that were open to people like him: Townsend Harris High School and the City College of New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;CCNY was free except for the required library card, which went for 50 cents a semester. In one particularly amazing run, the college produced future Nobel laureates in the classes of 1933, 1935, 1937, 1940, 1943, and 1950—and the class of ’37 boasted three of them: Arthur Kornberg, who discovered how DNA is synthesized, along with Jerome Karle and Herbert Hauptman, collaborators who developed methods for determining the structure of molecules that revolutionized fields from pharmaceutical development to materials design. Kornberg was the son of Jewish immigrants from Galicia; Karle, born Jerome Karfunkle, was the son of Jewish immigrants from Poland; Hauptman was the son of a Jewish immigrant from Austria. Hauptman’s father, Israel, had enrolled at CCNY as a young man, too, but had been obliged to leave school to get a job to support his family, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1985/10/18/nyregion/one-class-three-nobel-winners-at-city-college.html"&gt;working as a printer&lt;/a&gt;—he carried the torch as far as he could and then passed it to his son. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Millions and millions of Americans did not want to see that torch carried forward, and hated and despised these foreign-born Jewish printers, shopkeepers, and working men from &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leon_M._Lederman"&gt;Odessa and Kyiv&lt;/a&gt;, these penniless Polish Jews on the Lower East Side with their &lt;a href="https://www.encyclopedia.com/people/medicine/biochemistry-biographies/julius-axelrod"&gt;basket-weaving businesses and barely a word of English&lt;/a&gt;. With just a slight change in the political trajectory of those times, we might have denied ourselves—and our children, and our country—the benefits of the achievements of these men and women, and those of the many millions of the less famous and more ordinary sort of good people, good citizens, good Americans. It didn’t have to be Americans that saved the world from polio and who built so much of the modern world. We could have listened to the Fords and the Lindberghs and the Trumps of the time, who were the Drumpfs of Bad (Very) Dürkheim not that long ago. And, of course, we never really learn: It is of interest to me that so many of our modern Know-Nothings are the Irish American descendants of the very people the original Know-Nothings loathed and feared. And the Know-Nothings weren’t entirely wrong on every point: All those Irish Catholics really did change the political and social character of places such as Boston, whose politics even in our more secular time would puzzle John Adams, who grew up in a Massachusetts where Catholic worship was legally suppressed. I once attended an &lt;a href="https://www.wbur.org/news/2025/03/14/evacuation-day-history-boston-massachusetts-revolutionary-war-newsletter"&gt;Evacuation Day&lt;/a&gt; political event in Boston that included an open bar at 7 a.m. and Elizabeth Warren clapping out of time as the crowd sang “Charlie on the MTA,” which I suppose might have played out differently if all those immigrants to Boston had been from Buckinghamshire (or Riyadh) instead of the Emerald Isle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Choices are a package deal. They are a bundle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nobody wants to have measles. No father wants his daughter to get sick and die of an entirely preventable disease, &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2025/03/20/texas-measles-family-gaines-county-death/"&gt;but&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We would absolutely not take the MMR,” the mother said in English, referring to the measles-mumps-rubella vaccination children typically receive before attending school. She said her stance on vaccination has not changed after her daughter’s death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The measles wasn’t that bad. They got over it pretty quickly,” the mother said of her other four surviving children who were treated with castor oil and inhaled steroids and recovered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The couple told [Children’s Health Defense] that their daughter had measles for days when she became tired and the girl’s labored breathing prompted the couple to take her to Covenant Children’s Hospital in Lubbock. There, the girl was intubated and died a few days later. The other children came down with measles after their sister died. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you see “Texas” and “said in English,” you may think the implied alternative is Spanish. In this case, it is Low German, the community in question being Mennonite. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Character is destiny,” the wise men say. And I get that, and what it implies, but I do hope it isn’t true. I don’t have a great character, myself, having instead a natural instinct for low things, excess, indolence, and worse. The only hope for people like me is to try to be a better sort of man than we are inclined to be, to be better than our characters, that it should be the case that you are what you do and what you choose. That’s no route to sainthood, either! Not for me, anyway. But it is preferable to the alternative. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I recently spent an afternoon with the best kind of Americans: I was invited to speak about work at the annual conference of Rotary District 7570, a group of Rotary clubs extending from Winchester, Virginia, to Greeneville, Tennessee, across the Blue Ridge Mountains and the Shenandoah Valley, some of the most beautiful country east of the Mississippi. I have nothing but good things to say about Rotarians, and not only because they gave me a scholarship when I was a senior in high school and was desperate for money for college. (The University of Texas was not very expensive, but it wasn’t CCNY’s 50 cents a semester, either.) The Rotary clubs include my favorite kind of slightly dopey, well-meaning, public-spirited Americans—who are, of course, precisely the sort of people who can change the world when they get a mind to do so. For the Rotarians, that has most famously taken the form of working to eradicate polio, which they have come very close to doing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Rotary anti-polio project is a quintessentially American undertaking of the best kind. In the 1970s, polio vaccines had been around for a while, they had long been established to be safe and effective, they were not very expensive, and, thanks to the work of Albert Sabin (formerly Abram Saperstejn of Bialystok, Russia, who arrived in America with his parents on the SS &lt;em&gt;Lapland&lt;/em&gt; in 1921 but attended New York University rather than City College), they were easy to administer in the form of oral drops. But there was still a lot of polio in the world. All that was needed was to raise billions of dollars from pancake breakfasts and the like and to organize millions of volunteer man-hours to deliver and administer polio vaccines around the world to people who needed them, working with local governments and non-government partners—easy! There wasn’t any mystery about how to do it—it just needed doing. Sometimes, you need a genius like Jonas Salk or Albert Sabin to do the complicated thing that nobody knows how to do. And that’s a problem, because you never know where to &lt;em&gt;find&lt;/em&gt; a genius like that, even among those unglamorous families of blue-collar New York Jewish immigrants that seemed to be absolutely teeming with them in the 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century. You can’t plan on a genius just showing up—genius works on its own schedule. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, sometimes, you don’t need a genius—you just need somebody to volunteer to organize that pancake breakfast. And when you just need somebody to do the thing, that’s when you want the Rotarians and millions of other Americans in similar organizations. My friend Tim Carney, who gave a much better and more extensive talk at the same Rotary meeting, talked about the importance of institutions in both big projects such as polio eradication and in private matters, such as adult friendships, which tend to overlap with our participation in institutions of various kinds, from churches to book clubs to business associations. As Carney wrote in &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Alienated-America-Places-Thrive-Collapse/dp/0062797107"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alienated America, &lt;/em&gt;these institutions are profoundly important for healthy private and public lives&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Rotarians organized their first polio vaccination project, in the Philippines, in 1979. Since then, they have raised &lt;em&gt;billions&lt;/em&gt; of dollars to vaccinate nearly 3 billion children in 122 countries. Their efforts have attracted support from governments who understand what a force multiplier American pancake-breakfast organizers can be and from figures such as Bill Gates, whose foundation has for years been providing $2-to-$1 matching funds for the polio project, meaning that the Rotarians’ $50 million in annual fundraising produces $150 million in working funds every year. The thing about this kind of work is that work works: Polio cases worldwide have been reduced by 99.9 percent since the Rotarians took on the disease. These are good people doing good things—no mystery, no radical scientific breakthrough, just consistent hard work by people who have nothing personally to gain by saving children from paralysis in Nigeria. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I would like to emphasize the contrast here: On one hand, we have those Americans in the Rotary clubs and others like them, who do hard things competently and with humility, dedicating years of selfless effort toward getting it right on one big thing; on the other hand, we have a class of American gadflies who are endlessly self-aggrandizing, who live only for their own status and wealth, whose only credo is “What’s in it for me?” and who are, in spite of their posturing as hard-headed realists, the most absurd gang of chiseling incompetents ever to bring such an abbreviated attention span to bear on the nation’s problems, who wreck institutions and alliances and Ebola-control programs simply because they refuse to do their homework, and who have managed to destroy more than $7 trillion in wealth in only a few days while setting fire to a system of international economic and security cooperation that was built over the course of decades by better and more capable men than these misfits could ever hope to be. The Rotarians don’t talk about politics at their meetings, but there is a politically meaningful contrast to be seen there: between the best kind of Americans and the worst kind. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-economics-for-english-majors"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Economics for English Majors&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the subject of those trade relationships, I have a slight disagreement with Jonah Goldberg, who argued on a &lt;a href="https://thedispatch.com/podcast/remnant/the-guinness-world-record-of-self-sabotage/"&gt;recent podcast&lt;/a&gt; that there is a reasonable case, if not necessarily a convincing one, for enacting anti-Chinese tariffs on national security grounds. I think Jonah is wrong about that: There isn’t any national security case for tariffs at all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;If trade with China is a national security problem—or if trading with China in some particular product or commodity is a national security problem—then the answer still isn’t a national sales tax on U.S.-based companies that import Chinese goods. If you want to prohibit trade with China in &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;y&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;z&lt;/em&gt;, then the thing to do is to prohibit trade with China in &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;y&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;z. &lt;/em&gt;You give them the Huawei treatment, which is a good way of discovering how important your market actually is. (&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/02/opinion/trump-tariffs-china.html"&gt;How’s that working out?&lt;/a&gt;) One could imagine a serious project to bring China to heel when it comes to the theft of intellectual property (which is a real problem) and the like: trade prohibitions, economic sanctions, an effort to expel China from the World Trade Organization, etc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tariffs are no part of that, because tariffs do not have that effect and, in many cases, will have no effect at all on Chinese producers, who mainly sell to U.S.-based distributors rather than to U.S.-based consumers. A big tariff on Chinese-made flip-flops might be a problem for the company that supplies them to Walmart, and it might be a problem for Walmart, but it isn’t necessarily a problem for the guys at the Chinese flip-flop factory. Buyers don’t have to buy your stuff, but sellers don’t have to sell you their stuff, either. There’s a big, wide world out there, with billions of feet all but crying out for cheap flip-flops. You think some Chinese firm is going to just pony up to cover an American firm’s new taxes … because? What’s the U.S. firm going to do? It’s not going to buy its flip-flops from a nonexistent U.S. flip-flop factory, and with tariffs on every overseas source, it doesn’t necessarily improve its tax position by switching from Chinese sandal suppliers to Vietnamese or Bangladeshi or &lt;a href="https://www.ralphlauren.com/men-footwear-shoes/handwoven-leather-sandal/0045227113.html"&gt;Italian&lt;/a&gt; ones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tariffs do one thing—and are intended to do that one thing and nothing else: They give politically connected domestic firms an opportunity to raise their prices by removing lower-priced substitutes from the marketplace entirely or by putting upward pressure on the prices of those substitutes. What’s dumb—I mean, there’s a lot that’s dumb in this, but here’s one big dumb thing—is that most of the Trump administration’s tariffs will land on products that do not compete with U.S.-made goods, so they simply will put upward pressure on the prices of products that have no domestic substitutes in the market—with any pricing advantage going to other overseas firms. If there aren’t any flip-flop factories in the United States, then a tariff on Chinese flip-flops is just a subsidy to flip-flop producers in countries subjected to a tariff rate lower than the one applied to their Chinese competitors. And that may be good news for flip-flop entrepreneurs in Cambodia or Bangladesh or wherever (and who knows where the rates will be in 24 hours?) but all it means for Americans is higher prices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is more obvious if you consider an extreme case. We aren’t going to let Chinese firms design the guidance chips for American nuclear ICBMs. That’s a real, obvious national security risk. So, how do we go about keeping that from happening? With a 5 million percent tariff on Chinese-made ICBM guidance systems? No. We just forbid the use of them in U.S. military goods. Tariffs are simply the wrong tool for the national security job. You can sharpen a pencil and tape it to the barrel of a rifle, but you’d be better off with an ordinary bayonet, if that’s what you need. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-words-about-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Words About Words&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Item A: In a recent &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/03/28/putin-trump-imperial-ambitions-ukraine/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; column&lt;/a&gt;, Fareed Zakaria wrote that Russian forces had “leveled the Chechen capital of &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/03/12/1085861999/russias-wars-in-chechnya-offer-a-grim-warning-of-what-could-be-in-ukraine"&gt;Grozny&lt;/a&gt; to the ground.” I asked what I thought was an obvious question: What else would Grozny have been leveled to if not the ground? Putin’s desk? The height of the average elderberry bush? The column has since been amended. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Item B: &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; headline: “&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/26/business/dollar-tree-family-dollar-sale.html"&gt;Dollar Tree Is Selling Family Dollar for $1 Billion&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Call me old fashioned, but isn’t that like $999,999,999 too much? Either everything’s a dollar or it isn’t. Oh, I know, I know. But you thought the same thing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Item C: Michelle Cottle, writing in the &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/19/opinion/jason-crow-democrats.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, has discovered a Democratic congressman who supports gun control, Jason Crow of Colorado. Which doesn’t seem like much of a discovery to me, but, she adds: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Crow also grew up hunting “everything that flies or walks or runs through the woods,” and he recognizes the importance of hunting in many people’s lives. “For us to ignore that and to write that off or to malign it — and for some Democrats literally not to know what the hell they’re talking about,” he said, “is unforgivable.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The thing about the Second Amendment is: It has &lt;em&gt;not one expletive deleted thing to do with hunting, you rather more florid expletive deleted nincompoops&lt;/em&gt;. Do you really think our Founding Fathers wrote a frickin’ &lt;em&gt;hobby&lt;/em&gt; into the Bill of Rights? Like it or not, the Second Amendment is paramilitary in character—it references the militia, not Elmer Fudd. Americans are not going to abandon their civil rights because some Democrat in the Denver suburbs once shot a whitetail. “For some Democrats literally not to know what the hell they’re talking about is unforgivable.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Matt Taibbi deserves to win his &lt;a href="https://www.racket.news/p/a-response-to-a-member-of-congress"&gt;libel lawsuit against Rep. Sydney Kamlager-Dove&lt;/a&gt;, a California Democrat who baselessly smeared him as a “serial sexual harasser.” The claim is simply fabricated. I disagree with Taibbi about a great many things and kind of suspect I wouldn’t like him if I knew him, but the habit—still more pronounced among Democrats—of inventing sexual misconduct allegations as a way of smearing critics and those with differing political opinions is dishonorable, unseemly, and profoundly corrosive to democratic discourse. It is poison when the abuse is directed at our friends, and it is poison when it is directed at those who are not our friends. A member of Congress should not be permitted to defame critics in this way. As a legal matter, Taibbi’s case is on solid ground; as an ethical matter, Sydney Kamlager-Dove owes him—and her congressional colleagues—an apology. Taibbi is right to defend himself in this way, and more people should follow his example. It is the only way to draw a line that has a chance of being respected. &lt;/p&gt;

After enrolling, more than 106,000 adults were invited to participate in the sub-study on physical activity. The final sample, stratified into five groups, or quintiles, of physical activity levels, included about 85,000 participants with a median age of 63 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="XLFYPEMYH5AWNGSRPSI6RVM7G4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The study had participants use an accelerometer &lt;b&gt;— &lt;/b&gt;a device that measures movement&lt;b&gt; — &lt;/b&gt;for seven days to measure sedentary time, step count and activity intensity, and to quantify daily levels of activity and energy expenditure. The measures were compared with&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;the initial diagnosis of 13 cancers associated with low physical activity: bladder, breast, colon, endometrial, esophageal, upper stomach, head and neck, kidney, liver, lung, myeloid leukemia, myeloma and rectal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="T7WSEV6RRBGHTJKHTY7CT7Y26E" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The research identified an inverse relationship between overall daily physical activity and cancer risk, indicating that even modest increases in activity levels were sufficient to significantly reduce the risk of the 13 cancers.

Higher levels of activity had a more protective effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="VAMOZNS3IVBUJO552IGCEAB6GM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Other measures of physical activity were also correlated with lower rates of cancer.

In a new study of individuals aged 65 and over, those living in England’s most polluted areas consistently scored lower on cognitive assessments, especially in language-based tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings suggest air pollution may impair specific brain regions, such as the temporal lobe, which governs language processing. Researchers call for stronger air quality regulations to protect aging populations from cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Language Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; Older adults exposed to high levels of NO₂ and PM2.5 showed the most significant declines in language-related cognitive tasks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pollution Sources Matter:&lt;/strong&gt; Emissions from industry, home heating, and fuel combustion were strongly linked to poorer language performance.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brain Region Link:&lt;/strong&gt; Findings suggest air pollution may affect the temporal lobe, essential for semantic fluency and language.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;UCL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Long-term exposure to high levels of air pollution may harm the brain health of older adults in England, finds a new study led by UCL researchers.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research, published in &lt;em&gt;The Journals of Gerontology: Series A&lt;/em&gt;, found that exposure to nitrogen dioxide (NO₂) and fine particulate matter (PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt;) is linked to lower scores in key cognitive abilities, particularly language skills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108414"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/air-pollution-language-brain-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/air-pollution-language-brain-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/air-pollution-language-brain-neuroscience-770x514.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/air-pollution-language-brain-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/air-pollution-language-brain-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/air-pollution-language-brain-neuroscience-293x196.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/air-pollution-language-brain-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/air-pollution-language-brain-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows the outline of a person, a brain and smoke stacks." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/air-pollution-language-brain-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/air-pollution-language-brain-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/air-pollution-language-brain-neuroscience-770x514.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/air-pollution-language-brain-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/air-pollution-language-brain-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/air-pollution-language-brain-neuroscience-293x196.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/air-pollution-language-brain-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The authors did not examine the reasons behind their findings but suggest that this may be because increased air pollution exposure is most strongly associated with impairment in the temporal lobe (the part of the brain which is essential for language and semantic fluency). Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;NO₂ mainly enters the atmosphere through fuel combustion, originating from emissions of vehicles like cars, trucks, and buses, as well as power plants and off-road machinery. PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5 &lt;/sub&gt;pollution in outdoor air often originates from the combustion of gasoline, oil, diesel fuel, or wood, and consists of tiny particles that can be inhaled deeply into the lungs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers analysed data from 1,127 adults aged 65 and over who took part in the ELSA Harmonised Cognitive Assessment Protocol (ELSA-HCAP) in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team examined exposure to air pollution over an eight to 10 year period (2008-2017) and assessed participants’ memory, executive function (i.e. making plans, solving problems and adapting to new situations), language, and overall cognitive function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants completed a range of well-established neurocognitive memory assessments such as the “East Boston Memory Test” and the “Wechsler Memory Scale”, alongside immediate and delayed recall, backwards counting tasks, and shape drawing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings showed that individuals residing in areas with the highest levels of NO₂ and PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; performed worse on cognitive tests compared to those living in areas with average pollution levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most compelling evidence of association was observed in language skills, with individuals in the most polluted areas scoring in the bottom third of the cognitive tests performed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also found that different sources of air pollution have varying effects on cognitive health. For example, pollution from industries, home heating, and combustion of fuels (like coal and oil) were strongly linked to poorer language performance (i.e. the ability to access and produce words quickly).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors did not examine the reasons behind their findings but suggest that this may be because increased air pollution exposure is most strongly associated with impairment in the temporal lobe (the part of the brain which is essential for language and semantic fluency). Further research is needed to understand these links.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lead author Dr Giorgio Di Gessa (UCL Epidemiology &amp;amp; Health) said: “Our study shows that air pollution is not just harmful to the lungs and heart but also to brain health, especially when people are exposed to high levels for long periods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The most consistent links we found were with language ability, which may indicate that certain pollutants have a specific effect on particular cognitive processes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consequently, the researchers urge policymakers to strengthen air quality regulations, particularly in areas where pollution levels remain high, to help protect brain health as the population ages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deputy director of the ELSA study, Professor Paola Zaninotto (UCL Epidemiology &amp;amp; Health), said: “By tracking pollution levels over a decade using high-quality data, our research provides robust evidence that sustained exposure to pollutants is damaging people’s brains.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ELSA is funded by the National Institute on Aging and by UK Government Departments coordinated by the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Study limitations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The air pollution data used in the study only covers 10 years, which may not accurately represent lifetime exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, yearly averages of pollution levels were used, missing short-term high exposure impacts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the study sample is small and limited to England, which may not reflect broader trends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this pollution and cognition research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#24540a504b494657645147480a45470a514f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Poppy Tombs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://ucl.ac.uk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;UCL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Poppy Tombs – UCL&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1093/gerona/glaf060" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Cognitive performance and long-term exposure to outdoor air pollution: Findings from the Harmonised Cognitive Assessment Protocol sub-study of the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA-HCAP)&lt;/a&gt;” by Giorgio Di Gessa et al. &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Journals of Gerontology Series A&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cognitive performance and long-term exposure to outdoor air pollution: Findings from the Harmonised Cognitive Assessment Protocol sub-study of the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA-HCAP)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Background&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although air pollution is associated with worse cognitive performance, whether these relationships differ by cognitive domain and which sources of air pollution are particularly detrimental to cognition remains understudied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study examined associations between cognitive scores across three domains in older adults and 8-10 years of exposure to air pollutants (NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, total PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt;, and PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; from different emission sources).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We used data from the 2018 Harmonized Cognitive Assessment Protocol sub-study of the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (N=1,127). Outdoor concentrations of each pollutant were estimated for 2008/10-2017 and summarised using means and group-based trajectories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Linear regression models were used to assess long-term air pollution exposure relationships with memory, executive function, language, and global cognitive function after adjustment for key individual and neighbourhood-level confounders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Associations between air pollution trajectories and cognition are mostly inverted j-shaped, with respondents exposed to the highest residential levels of NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and total PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; having worse performance for global cognition [β=-0.241; 95%CI=(-0.46,-0.02) and β=-0.334; 95%CI=(-0.55,-0.12) respectively] than those exposed to average levels of pollution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similar associations were also found for executive function and memory (PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; only), whereas more compelling dose-response evidence was found for language. Higher emissions from industry and residential combustion, as well as biofuel, coal, oil and natural gas combustion, were associated with worse language scores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Air pollution and its sources have domain-specific associations with cognitive performance, with most consistent evidence observed for language. Continued efforts to reduce air pollution, particularly where levels are the highest, might benefit cognitive performance.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Mon, 07 Apr 2025 12:52:44 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiakFVX3lxTFAwMkg5SzRFeUV1SDAxeDFmY2hZaVp4YkNZVjY5ZXJFOTlyeWxCMzloNFJrZGpWWmtJWWV5MWpTVGIxa3lGMU9GZjQxTGVvc0l4dGkzNUE5OGdBYjJ3dWZFaEZrOUgyNVRKQkE</guid></item><item><title>AI is coming to skin cancer detection - The Washington Post</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijwFBVV95cUxObGJ6UFVjc2ZIRmRZQlQ5MmVUY2hwTVFpdGlQRF9HOHEtZEJRZThsbU5BNkNjbXpzUTVLcWJKXzVpcFJRNWUzeVg3elhnQTEtWGhNRTA1RlVfUjBsYVNLSE94bThJa01UN2dpODBtaDhZZXJnVlhQY08tVkNDb1NUdS1GSHB4OVR1RkFUS2g4QQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="meteredContent grid-center"&gt;&lt;div class="teaser-content"&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="JP5CA6QOZVBK7JYJE3VU5CM6ZU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;A future where artificial intelligence will guide skin cancer detection is in sight, experts say, even as human care remains essential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="AMTTQWR32JFK5ELAGJQTNFOO3M" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“The whole ecosystem has really matured and we are now past the hype and the big media headlines,” says Ivy Lee, a Los Angeles-based dermatologist who chairs the Augmented Intelligence Committee at the American Academy of Dermatology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-subscribe-cta" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="Z7WZTAMB6VGPLN3T6FNS5WIFPI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;A 2017 &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28117445/" target="_blank"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt;

This may help cut back on unnecessary dermatologist referrals and biopsies in underserved areas, says Mitchell A.

But her biggest concern, one echoed by other experts, is whether such models have been tested or trained on diverse skin tones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="MKA7AKY7GJDXNMNTDAXJDSWB3U" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Other companies in the marketplace include Skin Analytics, approved in the European Union as a medical device, and Nevisense, another U.S.-based company whose device gained &lt;a href="https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfpma/pma.cfm?id=P150046" target="_blank"&gt;Food and Drug Administration premarket approval&lt;/a&gt; for detecting melanoma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h3 class="wpds-c-iLVUUd wpds-c-iLVUUd-bALvEi-isCenteredLayout-false" data-qa="article-header" data-contentid="NFED2CLFPBBBDOKNW7M2BFGS74" data-apitype="header" level="2" id="NFED2CLFPBBBDOKNW7M2BFGS74"&gt;A next-level skin check&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="E6HR22BL3ZBTJACD652DEGEF7Q" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Sloan Kettering and other institutions use 3D scanners to photograph and monitor patients with complex melanoma risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="5QGT5Q2SCFG4XPS2GBL7SYPKBU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“The next time they come in, you’re monitoring all those lesions for change,” Rotemberg says. “Patients have access to the images when they’re performing their self-examinations, so they can also either reassure themselves or flag suspicious lesions for their doctor to take a closer look at.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="J6AA73AFNJB3TI64QAMTN457NM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Today, AI is used as part of the 3D body scan for rendering the images and image reconstruction, Rotemberg says. The 2.0 version of this would entail bringing in AI to automatically detect skin cancer, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="KZLLSHVPUZDZBFK6BU5ABTWKKE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“We need a lot more research, but we’re actively working on it,” Rotemberg says. “We recently &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-024-03743-w" target="_blank"&gt;published a dataset&lt;/a&gt; of over 400,000 tiles cropped from total-body photography so that people can try to develop algorithms,” she says. Because of the volume and quality of the photographs, they’re “super challenging” for a dermatologist to interpret, she explains. “So this is a huge opportunity for AI.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="FV7XJGEL75ADPHR6OQBD66VWKM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Some companies offer services like this already, but the experts note that they have not seen any publicly available data that proves their efficacy or regulatory status in the United States or abroad. Daneshjou adds that there may be companies doing trials that would then apply for FDA clearance. “I do think it is coming down the pipe.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="OZALPMMK5RDGDEWENEPRTS4SHM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Lee also says there could be a future where these full-body scans are made widely accessible — and that would be a positive. “Anything to improve access to screening and to high-quality care is something we need to do better at,” she says. That would require solid scientific evidence that shows it’s safe, cost-effective and equitable, as well as regulatory work to ensure it’s sustainable and scalable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h3 class="wpds-c-iLVUUd wpds-c-iLVUUd-bALvEi-isCenteredLayout-false" data-qa="article-header" data-contentid="CN2T3AY5PVC7PE36ZSKPZQRS3M" data-apitype="header" level="2" id="CN2T3AY5PVC7PE36ZSKPZQRS3M"&gt;Not ready for prime time&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="UC6L2IYQUZCRZMYR5YVP5D6N6M" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But experts advise against using apps and chat bots to diagnose skin cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="INZI4KRAMNALLJD3DBGIIUOCDI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“It’s actually quite problematic because [these apps] have not cleared any regulatory hurdles, and some of them are making claims around being able to diagnose skin cancer and there’s no actual available data to back up their claims,” says Daneshjou, who co-wrote a &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamadermatology/fullarticle/2815800" target="_blank"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; on the topic in JAMA Dermatology&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;in 2024 with Rotemberg and others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="QBV4ZYNEFJD6JFEHF4P3Q7OIFE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Mobile apps and chatbots may be “dangerous because oftentimes we turn to these tools as patients because we can’t get access to health care,” Lee says, adding that data privacy and security should also be a concern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="BO7NJWQZFVH3LFJGEQWNHHV4FE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Experts also do not recommend using ChatGPT and other large language models to analyze your skin lesions. “What we have found from prior work is that these models don't do that great on skin cancer diagnosis,” Daneshjou says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="MOQ2NN7YZRGVBJEIZZDEVQYLH4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Rotemberg says direct-to-consumer products remain the “furthest away” from being useful for patients, although it’s “a very promising area.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="XRGENJQJOBDQXEXC33M4FFWPTM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;As of now the gold standard is to get an annual skin check with a dermatologist, Lee says.

   &lt;p&gt;New research suggests that given the right kind of training, AI bots can deliver mental health therapy with as much efficacy as — or more than — human clinicians.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The recent&lt;a href="https://ai.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/AIoa2400802" target="_blank"&gt; study&lt;/a&gt;, published in the &lt;em&gt;New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/em&gt;, shows results from the first randomized clinical trial for AI therapy.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Researchers from Dartmouth College built the bot as a way of taking a new approach to a longstanding problem: The U.S. continues to grapple with an &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2023/12/06/1217487323/psychologists-waitlist-demand-mental-health-care" target="_blank"&gt;acute shortage&lt;/a&gt; of mental health providers. "I think one of the things that doesn't scale well is humans," says Nick Jacobson, a clinical psychologist who was part of this research team. For every 340 people in the U.S., there is just one mental health clinician, according to &lt;a href="https://mhanational.org/news/mha-releases-2024-state-of-mental-health-in-america-report/" target="_blank"&gt;some estimates.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;While many AI bots already on the market claim to offer mental health care, some have &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/12/10/nx-s1-5222574/kids-character-ai-lawsuit" target="_blank"&gt;dubious results&lt;/a&gt; or have even &lt;a href="https://www.apaservices.org/practice/business/technology/artificial-intelligence-chatbots-therapists#:~:text=APA%20met%20with%20federal%20regulators,director%20of%20health%20care%20innovation." target="_blank"&gt;led people to self-harm&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;More than five years ago, Jacobson and his colleagues began training their AI bot in clinical best practices. The project, says Jacobson, involved much &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2023/01/19/1147081115/therapy-by-chatbot-the-promise-and-challenges-in-using-ai-for-mental-health" target="_blank"&gt;trial and error&lt;/a&gt; before it led to quality outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The effects that we see strongly mirror what you would see in the best evidence-based trials of psychotherapy," says Jacobson. He says these results were comparable to "studies with folks given a gold standard dose of the best treatment we have available."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The researchers gathered a group of roughly 200 people who had diagnosable conditions like depression and anxiety, or were at risk of developing eating disorders. Half of them worked with AI therapy bots. Compared to those that did not receive treatment, those who did showed significant improvement.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;One of the more surprising results, says Jacobson, was the quality of the bond people formed with their bots. "People were really developing this strong relationship with an ability to trust it," says Jacobson, "and feel like they can work together on, on their mental health symptoms."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Strength of bonds and trust with therapists is one of the overall predictors of efficacy in talk and cognitive behavioral therapy.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Another advantage of AI therapy is the lack of time constraints. Jacobson said he and his team were surprised by how frequently patients accessed their AI therapists. " We had folks that were messaging it about their insomnia symptoms in the middle of the night," he says, "and getting their needs met in these moments."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The American Psychological Association has raised the alarm recently about the &lt;a href="https://www.apaservices.org/practice/business/technology/artificial-intelligence-chatbots-therapists#:~:text=APA%20met%20with%20federal%20regulators,director%20of%20health%20care%20innovation." target="_blank"&gt;dangers of using unregulated AI therapy bots&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But the organization says it's pleased with the rigorous clinical training that researchers invested in this model.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The therabot in this study checks a bunch of the boxes that we have been hoping technologists would start to engage in," says Vaile Wright, director for the Office of Health Care Innovation at the APA. "It is rooted in psychological science. It is demonstrating some efficacy and safety, and it's been co-created by subject matter experts for the purposes of addressing mental health issues."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Dartmouth researchers stress that the technology is still a long way from market and say they need to run additional trials on the therabot before it will be widely available.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And, Wright says, human therapists should not be intimidated by their AI counterparts. Given the tremendous shortage of mental health providers, " I don't think humans need to be concerned that they're going to be put out of business," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;She says the country needs all the quality therapists we can get — be they human or bot.&lt;/p&gt;

In fact, experts say it can even &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/stress-anxiety-positive-psychology-happiness-health" target="_blank"&gt;be healthy&lt;/a&gt; to some degree. However, you don’t need a medical degree to know that experiencing chronic stress can wreak havoc on your health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This, of course, is mostly due to the &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/balancing-cortisol-tips"&gt;stress hormone&lt;/a&gt; cortisol: “Cortisol rises in response to demanding situations or perceived threats,” notes psychologist &lt;a data-offer-url="https://pilarguerra.es/" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://pilarguerra.es/"}' href="https://pilarguerra.es/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Pilar Guerra Escudero&lt;/a&gt;. “Our body is designed to release cortisol in a timely manner, but the problem arises when cortisol levels remain chronically elevated. This can impact the &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/simple-ways-to-support-your-immune-system" target="_blank"&gt;immune system&lt;/a&gt;, sleep, and mood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To get an idea of just how detrimental this excess of cortisol can be, consider the explanation given by aging expert &lt;a data-offer-url="https://shawellness.com/en/noticias/europes-top-doctor-in-healthy-ageing-is-at-sha-according-to-the-european-awards-in-medicine/" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://shawellness.com/en/noticias/europes-top-doctor-in-healthy-ageing-is-at-sha-according-to-the-european-awards-in-medicine/"}' href="https://shawellness.com/en/noticias/europes-top-doctor-in-healthy-ageing-is-at-sha-according-to-the-european-awards-in-medicine/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Vicente Mera&lt;/a&gt;. “Cortisol decreases immunity as severely as the treatments we use in transplant patients or patients with autoimmune diseases,” he writes in his book &lt;em&gt;Young At Any Age&lt;/em&gt;, noting that it can even bring out latent infections or other illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-bkChBi byNLHx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And it’s not just the stress hormone cortisol that can impact our wellbeing—low levels of feel-good hormones like endorphins and serotonin can also drastically affect our emotions and mood. After all, these substances increase feelings of euphoria and, in turn, help mitigate stress and naturally relieve pain. To truly improve the way we feel, we must therefore lower cortisol while increasing serotonin and endorphins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to lower cortisol, easily&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Luckily, experts say that engaging in just a handful of specific activities and habits each day can do both. And, no, it’s not just about meditation—though, of course, meditation has &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/easy-tips-to-feel-energized-through-meditation" target="_blank"&gt;tons of benefits&lt;/a&gt;. However, “physical activities such as swimming can be highly effective in reducing cortisol, sometimes even more so than meditation—especially if the latter generates frustration or is difficult to maintain over time,” explains Guerra Escudero. “It all depends on the person— meditation has been shown to be effective in lowering cortisol levels, but if someone finds it difficult or stressful, the attempt to meditate may be counterproductive.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is why movement can be just as effective. “Exercise offers a more accessible way to reduce stress without the person having to force themselves to quiet the mind,” she notes. “It allows for a more natural distraction and release of tension because, unlike meditation—which requires a conscious effort to focus the mind—physical activity encourages spontaneous disconnection from stressful thoughts.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Vogue</author><pubDate>Mon, 07 Apr 2025 11:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiV0FVX3lxTE1FbVRPQ0F2Tk9nUUQxdFdJRzFrVGtOY19RQm91ejhJUENyNFhBRGJ6cm1EczM4Zk16V1I3dTd4Qy15Y1lxUGFYODRUcGdGTjhOQ3dDSVRGbw</guid></item><item><title>How Many Miles Should You Walk Per Day For Weight Loss? - Women's Health</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipwFBVV95cUxOdWNqNUtma0kxcVpPdmQ2bUhqNHBERnd4MDhPQVpBQmdnZWdNandIMGpYdENaNUpGaDNfUW83VHl1UlU2bl9XeDA4TUdzSURkSXo4dlQ4cDJjWmJ4d0FkX1dpb25oaGRNZzJ1SHprMlM4aWRrcldFOUx5RjFnVElWYkdPTjR1T01xWFJLRDRpelNnS0dVb3pEaDg0QWR4VEEzYXBHNXNCdw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-journey-body="standard-article" class="article-body-content article-body standard-body-content css-j4k1z9 et2g3wt6"&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="0" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a62950868/yes-walking-is-a-cardio-workout/" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a62950868/yes-walking-is-a-cardio-workout/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Walking" data-node-id="0.0" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Walking&lt;/a&gt; has a whole bunch of &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a62638370/health-benefits-of-walking/" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a62638370/health-benefits-of-walking/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="benefits" data-node-id="0.2" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;benefits&lt;/a&gt; like &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a62007446/can-walking-keep-you-fit/" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a62007446/can-walking-keep-you-fit/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="improving cardiovascular health, mood, and sleep" data-node-id="0.4" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;improving cardiovascular health, mood, and sleep&lt;/a&gt;—but exactly how many miles do you need to walk per day to get these perks? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="1" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;You might have heard that 10,000 steps—which ends up being about five miles—is the daily goal you should shoot for. But this number might be more arbitrary than you think. In fact, though this rule of thumb has been around since the 1960s, there’s little *scientific* evidence that walking 10,000 steps should be your target, according to a 2022 review in &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpub/article/PIIS2468-2667(21)00302-9/fulltext" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpub/article/PIIS2468-2667(21)00302-9/fulltext" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The Lancet" data-node-id="1.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;em data-node-id="1.1.0"&gt;The Lancet&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. (We aren’t exactly sure what the origin of this popular step goal is, but it could be partly due to the fact that the Japanese character for 10,000 looks like a man walking, as &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a62598280/accidental-step-count-scam/" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a62598280/accidental-step-count-scam/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Women's Health reported previously" data-node-id="1.3" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;em data-node-id="1.3.0"&gt;Women's Health&lt;/em&gt; reported previously&lt;/a&gt;.) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="2" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Luckily, there is some science that helps clarify what a good step goal is, and, the good news: it’s lower than 10,000 per day.

But, when it comes to getting the most out of the activity, walking anywhere from 6,000 to 7,500 steps was found to reduce all-cause mortality for women over 60, according to the 2022 &lt;em data-node-id="6.3"&gt;Lancet&lt;/em&gt; review. Meanwhile, for those younger than 60, step-count benefits didn’t plateau until 8,000 to 10,000 steps. Beyond all-cause mortality, a higher step count—this time just under 10,000 steps—was found to be associated with a lower risk of dementia, though benefits were observed with as few as 3,800 steps per day, according to a 2022 study in &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaneurology/fullarticle/2795819" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaneurology/fullarticle/2795819" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="JAMA Neurology" data-node-id="6.5" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;em data-node-id="6.5.0"&gt;JAMA Neurology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="7" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="7.0"&gt;Read more:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a64404557/how-many-miles-should-you-walk-for-weight-loss-health/" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a64404557/how-many-miles-should-you-walk-for-weight-loss-health/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action=" Best Walking Shoes" data-node-id="7.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt; &lt;em data-node-id="7.1.1"&gt;Best Walking Shoes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="8" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Basically, there’s a range of how many steps you should shoot for, and you could see benefits even &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a62706109/walking-lifespan-study/" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a62706109/walking-lifespan-study/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="walking short distances" data-node-id="8.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;walking short distances&lt;/a&gt;, depending on your experience level. One thing to keep in mind is that the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/physical-activity-basics/guidelines/adults.html#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20current%20Physical,See%20steps%20for%20getting%20started." data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.cdc.gov/physical-activity-basics/guidelines/adults.html#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20current%20Physical,See%20steps%20for%20getting%20started." data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="CDC recommends" data-node-id="8.3" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;CDC recommends&lt;/a&gt; that adults get 150 minutes of moderate to vigorous-intensity exercise per week, so if walking is your main form of exercise, you want to make sure that you’re hitting this number of minutes—no matter what the mileage is, says Alexander Rothstein, CSCS, an exercise physiologist and instructor for the exercise science program at New York Institute of Technology.  This might mean walking for about 22 minutes every single day or for 30 minutes, three days a week. Since time is what matters here and everyone walks at a different pace, there’s a range of how many steps and miles this would shake out to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="9" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Something else experts want you to consider is that when it comes to walking for better health, &lt;em data-node-id="9.1"&gt;frequency&lt;/em&gt; is also super important. “With walking, you’re looking for this to be as many days of the week as you can,” says Laura A. Richardson, PhD, a professor of applied exercise science at the University of Michigan. It’s all about finding a step count that’s sustainable—as in, it won’t leave you too sore and tired the next day—which will be different for everybody based on their fitness level. Start with fewer miles and then increase over time to create a more sustainable routine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="10" class="body-tip css-13fzjfi emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="10.0"&gt;Aim for: &lt;/strong&gt;anywhere between 2,000 and 8,000 steps per day—which is between one and four miles. Keep in mind that the frequency of your walks and the total time you spend walking per week is also important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="11" class="body-h3 css-s6zph9 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="11.0"&gt;How Many Miles You Should Walk Per Day For Weight Loss&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="12" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;If &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/weight-loss/a62749835/how-you-can-lose-weight-by-walking/" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/weight-loss/a62749835/how-you-can-lose-weight-by-walking/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="weight loss" data-node-id="12.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;weight loss&lt;/a&gt; is your goal, answering this question really shifts to focusing on energy expenditure, both experts agree. Increasing distance or intensity are both ways to turn up the amount of energy you’re using on a walk, but if you’re looking to lose weight, just walking might not be the most efficient and effective way to go. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="13" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Strength training, as well as more varied exercise than just daily walking, would be most effective. Not to mention, so many other factors like genetics, nutrition, and environment contribute to weight loss.

By studying the data of &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/virus-likely-triggers-almost-all-multiple-sclerosis-massive-study-concludes-62236" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;10 million former military personnel&lt;/a&gt; in the US, Ascherio’s work showed that MS is almost always a delayed response to infection with the EBV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div class="blockquote--content"&gt;&lt;p&gt;[T]he epidemiology of multiple sclerosis is quite unique because there is a very striking geographical distribution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="reference"&gt;Professor Alberto Ascherio&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers had known that there was something odd about the development of MS, and attributed it to the so-called hygiene hypothesis. This is the idea that in our modern world, children are not getting enough early exposure to microorganisms in order to develop a healthy immune system. However, finding the connection was not easy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It started with the observation that the epidemiology of multiple sclerosis is quite unique because there is a very striking geographical distribution,” &lt;a href="https://hsph.harvard.edu/profile/alberto-ascherio/" target="_blank"&gt;Professor Ascherio&lt;/a&gt; told IFLScience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="trendmd-suggestions" data-pid-resource="RRUGNY3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is very uncommon in tropical areas, and then the incidence tends to increase in temperate zones. For people who migrate from areas of high incidence to low incidence, the risk goes down, and for people who migrate from the tropics to Europe or Canada, the risk goes up.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="piano-inline"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This prompted Ascherio to look at something in the environment or lifestyle that could explain this distribution. Untangling the issue with the hygiene hypothesis, Ascherio noticed the connection between infectious mononucleosis, primarily caused by EBV, and the risk of developing MS. Over time, overwhelming evidence linking the two has been brought forward, although the exact mechanism is not fully clear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One popular theory is that it's a cross-reactivity between the immune response against the EBV and some human proteins that are expressed in the brain,” Professor Ascherio explained. “The hypothesis is attractive because it would provide sort of a straightforward explanation, but I'm rather skeptical about this explanation. An alternative explanation is that the disease is caused by viral reactivation in the central nervous system in the brain or spinal cord.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The link between the virus and disease has opened new ways to consider how MS might be treated. Antiviral drugs are being investigated in clinical trials as possible add-ons to the standard MS treatment. There’s also the possibility that a vaccine might be useful, in particular, one that modifies the immune response, and so maybe stops MS completely. Ascherio is upfront that this development won’t be a matter of months, but of many years, though he’s optimistic that there is “a lot of research that hopefully will bring us somewhere.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div class="blockquote--content"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's like we've built the equivalent of JWST to study the universe, but now we don't have the funding to launch it!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="reference"&gt;Professor Alberto Ascherio&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a bit of hesitation there, but it has nothing to do with the scientific challenges. Instead, it is because of the &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/the-us-government-just-cut-10000-jobs-dismantling-its-safety-net-for-americans-health-78656" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;devastating cuts to research&lt;/a&gt; into cures for diseases by the Trump administration, through Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, and Health Secretary Robert F.

Unfortunately, we are struggling to get funding to move forward with this research. It's like we've built the equivalent of JWST to study the universe, but now we don't have the funding to launch it!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Breakthrough Prize, worth $3 million, will be split equally between Ascherio and Hauser, and hopefully, more contributions will continue to push this vital area of medical research forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>IFLScience</author><pubDate>Mon, 07 Apr 2025 09:58:39 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitwFBVV95cUxQOVJmRVJUYmpkODcwcVQ4dWRXNXAzUXN3Z3RmMllfYkYwQzM4U1BnUXBOMFZYWnh5aERIMHJhYlRTdExFRmVZUkxLMXZoTEZnSEpZcjFlNHJMU2kzTHcyRFNxcC02U2FwSTJ4dk5URkx3bXNxNWlOWjF5UF91WEJJMmt5V0NrdE94S1pBNkNnU3EwMWw2VFBmRl9NZXl4YkRZdDFzblJzc2pudkhEbTdTU2gyMjhzaUU</guid></item><item><title>Rare virus that killed Gene Hackman’s wife kills three in small California town - The Independent</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipAFBVV95cUxPbmpSOVFWUUd0WkJfdk1WTDc3UnM3QUNFRHlldXRYcVJONGt2NDJ3TmhsTTZFWUFXd21kMUhLZUFUVThFZ1RzV0JiZHZCX1F2T0EwTjJQSU5yY1RtODloanJJMEhTazh2Zml4dkxtN0tpdVhUZEh5VHlwdXZrcTlwY1dqVTluZzNmQzBHeXI0YlpCQzQ5Z1kzbXlhOUYtanFkWWE3cg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-jbiisr-0 fsDBBo sc-jbiisr-1 gfSVvz" id="main"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 cwDkqf" data-component="SupportNSCNative" data-loading="lazy" data-theme-name="base-light"&gt;&lt;aside class="sc-hez36s-0 guIZJM"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-hez36s-1 ghpvHl"&gt;&lt;h3 data-testid="support-nsc-title" class="sc-hez36s-2 dyeFNc"&gt;Your support helps us to tell the story&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="sc-hez36s-8 QyvDf"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-hez36s-13 hjfIlW"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-aja53j-0 bXNazX sc-hez36s-16 eFHwkn"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-aja53j-6 lpmrWp"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="dropdown-with-gradient-collapsed-content-container" class="sc-aja53j-5 kHOfxf"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="dropdown-with-gradient-collapsed-content" class="sc-aja53j-4 llSPWP"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="support-nsc-collapsed-content-tablet" class="sc-hez36s-7 ctaaNX"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-1uza6dc-0 zTiwj"&gt;From reproductive rights to climate change to Big Tech, The Independent is on the ground when the story is developing.

We should pay attention to the presence of mice and be careful around their waste.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hantavirus, which is rare, shot to public attention after a New Mexico medical examiner announced that Gene Hackman’s wife &lt;a href="/news/health/betsy-arakawa-hantavirus-pulmonary-syndrome-b2715984.html"&gt;Betsy Arakawa had died after contracting the virus&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bodies of Arakawa, 65, and actor Hackman, 95, were&lt;a href="/arts-entertainment/films/news/gene-hackman-cause-death-betsy-arakawa-investigation-b2711170.html"&gt; found in their Santa Fe home in February,&lt;/a&gt; sometime after they died. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 IoAJj sc-482ou5-3 dzDedB image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 bZqoQk"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="3" class="sc-482ou5-0 dgbiJn"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/03/07/21/58/AP25058352785882.jpeg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/03/07/21/58/AP25058352785882.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/03/07/21/58/AP25058352785882.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="A medical examiner announced that Gene Hackman’s wife Betsy Arakawa died after contracting hantavirus pulmonary syndrome" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 cpasWE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-482ou5-1 cwDkqf edasoI" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base-light"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 iwFOdi inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-11295"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 vXhNB"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 bWFKX dpkjCF"&gt;A medical examiner announced that Gene Hackman’s wife Betsy Arakawa died after contracting hantavirus pulmonary syndrome&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 Rqdgl"&gt; (AP)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evidence suggested Arakawa died about two weeks before their bodies were found, while Hackman died about a week later from heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Mono County health office said that about one in three people infected with Hantavirus die, adding that prompt diagnosis and treatment can improve outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The US began recording cases of the virus in 1993, and according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 864 laboratory-confirmed cases had been recorded across the country by the end of 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-iii" class="sc-looa6c-0 WWPRF"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC reports that states in the southwest, in particular, have recorded the highest number of cases.

Scores which are below the average could indicate a risk for poor health outcomes, such as falls. For example, for a person aged between 60-64, the average is 14 for a man, and 12 for a woman. If you are aged 85-89, however, the average score is eight. However, these average scores do not take into account a person's medical history – for example if they have recently undergone surgery or have an injury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The test can also be beneficial for younger people or those with no health conditions, as it is a good measure of fitness, particularly lower body muscular strength and endurance. Researchers in Switzerland asked almost &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00038-013-0504-z" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;7,000 adults&lt;/a&gt; to do the STS test and then compared the results. They found that the average score for 20–24-year-olds was 50/minute for men and 47/minute for women. Some of those taking part, however, were able to perform as many as 72 repetitions in a minute. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;In another study &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://journals.lww.com/md-journal/fulltext/2018/01050/the_relationship_of_sit_to_stand_tests_with.18.aspx" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;of healthy volunteers&lt;/a&gt;, who had an average age of 21, researchers found a strong association between the results of the sit-to-stand test and a different – but more time-consuming – measure of their aerobic capacity and endurance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Research shows that how well you perform on the test can also tell healthcare providers a great deal about your underlying health. For example a low score on the test can be used to identify people who might be at risk of worse outcomes after &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33356620" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;surgery&lt;/a&gt; or after &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11215763/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;cancer treatment.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;According to the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), if a person scores less on the test than the "average" for their age group then they are also at &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.cdc.gov/steadi/media/pdfs/STEADI-Assessment-30Sec-508.pdf" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;greater risk of falls.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"What we're really worried about is that if people don't maintain their strength, their balance, their flexibility and their cardiovascular health, then they're more likely to fall," says Dhesi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;About 30% of people aged over 65 have a &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nhs.uk/scorecard/8135" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;fall every year,&lt;/a&gt; and that rises to about 50% in people aged over 80 years. Once people have had one fall, they often become scared of falling again, making them less likely to go out, sometimes leading to social isolation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"If you're worried about falling, you're not [necessarily] going to go out and meet people and do other things.

Individuals who scored low on the test were between five to six times more likely to die over a six-year period than those who scored highest. However, Dhesi points out that while tests like STS are a good indicator of health, they cannot predict how long a person can live.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"What you can use them [the sit-to-stand test results] to say is – this is something we need to think about, and there are treatments or interventions that we should be doing to try to improve a person's health outcomes, their quality of life, their independence and to help them to live well for longer, which is the really key bit," says Dhesi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"Doing these kinds of tests at home helps you to see where you are in relation to other people of your age and so it can be a really useful prompt to remind you to do all the things that you can do to get better and stay better.

Many gyms run exercise programs for seniors at low cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"The added benefit there is the social contact on top of the physical contact.

   &lt;p&gt;Colon cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related death worldwide, and &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2023/03/20/1163697875/colon-cancer-signs-screening-young-adult" target="_blank"&gt;it's on the rise among younger adults &lt;/a&gt;in the U.S. But&lt;a href="https://acsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/cncr.35727" target="_blank"&gt; research recently published in the journal Cancer,&lt;/a&gt; finds regular exercise can help survivors live longer — in some cases, even longer than people who've never had colon cancer. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I think the important message is, some level of activity is better than staying inactive," says &lt;a href="https://www.dana-farber.org/find-a-doctor/jeffrey-a-meyerhardt" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Jeff Meyerhardt,&lt;/a&gt; co-director of the Colon and Rectal Cancer Center at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and the study's senior author. He says the results suggest exercise can have a "meaningful impact" on a patient's long-term prognosis.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;When it comes to colon cancer, the good news is that overall, death rates have been falling thanks to improvements in screening and treatment. But survivors still tend to have a shorter life expectancy than people of the same age and sex in the general population, in large part because of the risk that the cancer will come back.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Meyerhardt says researchers have long known that exercise can improve survival rates in colon cancer patients. But he and his colleagues wanted to know if regular physical activity could actually help patients improve their survival rates compared to people who'd never had cancer.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;So they surveyed nearly 3,000 colon cancer patients about their exercise habits before and after treatment. What they found was that, for patients who were three years out from treatment and cancer free, regular exercise made a big difference.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Those patients not only had a better overall survival if they were more physically active, they actually looked like they had a slightly better overall survival compared to the general population," Meyerhardt says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Even patients whose cancer recurred had improvements in survival if they had more regular exercise compared to patients who were the least physically active.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Patients who saw benefits were exercising the equivalent of walking about an hour a day at a 2-to-3 mile per hour pace about six days a week, he says.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://profiles.dom.pitt.edu/faculty_info.aspx/Schmitz7385" target="_blank"&gt;Kathryn Schmitz&lt;/a&gt; is an exercise oncology researcher at the University of Pittsburgh and the director of the Moving Through Cancer Program at UPMC Hillman Cancer Center. She's a firm believer in the power of exercise both to reduce the risk of dying from colon cancer and to prevent it in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I know of nothing else that is within the patient's control that is more powerful for reducing cancer mortality, particularly colon cancer mortality, than physical activity," Schmitz says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Researchers are still trying to figure out the mechanisms at play. But Schmitz says evidence from animal models suggests that physical activity triggers a series of chemical reactions in cells that promote health in multiple ways.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"What you might think of is that all of our cells are bathed in a soup of sorts, and the constituents of that soup change as a result of being more physically active," Schmitz says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;When you're sedentary, your immune system doesn't work as well, and your cells are more prone to inflammation, which can cause cells to mutate, she says. But when you exercise on a regular basis, your inflammation goes down and your immune function is better.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The soup in which your cells are bathed is healthier in a way that will tamp down any cancer development or cancer progression," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Exercise &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/09/14/nx-s1-5108843/exercise-fat-healthy-weight-obesity" target="_blank"&gt;can also improve insulin sensitivity&lt;/a&gt;, and insulin plays a role in spurring the growth of colorectal cancer cells, says &lt;a href="https://www.dana-farber.org/find-a-doctor/kimmie-ng" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Kimmie Ng&lt;/a&gt;, founding director of the Young Onset Colorectal Cancer Center at Dana-Farber.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;And at a time when colon and rectal cancer &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2023/03/20/1163697875/colon-cancer-signs-screening-young-adult" target="_blank"&gt;rates are rising among people under 50&lt;/a&gt;, it's more important than ever to get the word out about exercise.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Ng says researchers don't know exactly what's driving the "alarming" rise in cancers of the colon and rectum in adults under 50, but research suggests colorectal cancer is strongly linked to several modifiable lifestyle factors like diet and physical activity.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Out of all these factors, Ng says, "exercise probably has some of the strongest data supporting the benefits of it being protective" — both in terms of developing colorectal cancer and surviving it. And while exercise is beneficial at any age, the younger you start the better.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"We do think that exercise, starting in childhood and adolescence, also seems to be very important for protecting against a future risk of developing colorectal cancer as an adult," Ng says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Guidelines from the&lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/risk-prevention/diet-physical-activity/acs-guidelines-nutrition-physical-activity-cancer-prevention/guidelines.html#:~:text=Most%20children%20and%20young%20adults,should%20be%20limited%20at%20home." target="_blank"&gt; American Cancer Society recommend&lt;/a&gt; people get 150 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity each week to reduce the risk of cancer. But if that seems like more exercise than you have the time or energy for, something is always better than nothing, Schmitz says.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"If you are able to do 90 minutes more than you're currently doing, then that is a win," Schmitz says. "If you're able to do 60 minutes more than what you're currently doing, that is a win. Do not let the perfect be the enemy of the good. Getting off the couch to begin with is a win."&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Edited by Jane Greenhalgh&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Trump administration’s cuts to staff at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and to clinical trials now threaten to unwind that progress, affected CDC researchers and outside HIV experts warn.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/04/01/cdc-rif-2400-layoffs-rfk-jr-hhs-reorganization-rapid-response-capability-weakened/"&gt;“reductions in force” last week at the CDC&lt;/a&gt; gutted branches responsible for a slew of prevention services: Expert guidance on preventing infant infections, a national &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchhstp/director-letters/launch-of-together-takemehome.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;at-home testing program&lt;/a&gt;, long-running &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hiv-data/mmp/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;surveys&lt;/a&gt; to follow people &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchhstp/director-letters/launch-of-together-takemehome.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;living with and at risk&lt;/a&gt; for HIV, statistical analysis to estimate national HIV incidence, and guidelines on how to use HIV prevention drugs or PrEP, including a &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/pharmalot/2025/04/01/trump-cuts-pepfar-threatens-rollout-gilead-hiv-prevention-drug-lenacapavir/"&gt;powerful new medicine&lt;/a&gt; likely to be approved this summer.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;STAT has also learned that funds have been suspended for the HIV Prevention Trials Network and the HIV Vaccine Trials Network, the two most prominent networks for testing prevention drugs and vaccines. Funds have also been suspended for the AIDS Clinical Trial Group, a nearly 40-year-old system that has been responsible for key breakthroughs dating back to the first effective AIDS drug, AZT. All three have been waiting on money that were supposed to be sent out in February. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The HPTN paused a study testing four interventions to prevent HIV in Black men who have sex with men in the South, a particularly vulnerable group. The ACTG paused enrollment for all of its studies except one for lack of funds, said Joe Eron, the group’s chair. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The one spared study has now also been paused for other reasons, Eron said, meaning the network is now essentially in a holding pattern. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Previous reports also noted that funding was canceled last month for an adolescent trial system that has been active since 2001. Smaller grants for perhaps &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00969-5" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;hundreds&lt;/a&gt; of other smaller HIV studies were also cut, seemingly because many focused on people of color, men who have sex with men, or transgender individuals. Cancellation letters reportedly argued such studies were examples of “DEI,” or diversity, equity, and inclusion, and “often used to support unlawful discrimination on the basis of race.” Researchers counter that such groups are the most at risk for HIV or the most medically underserved.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The HHS Office of Infectious Diseases and HIV/AIDS Policy has also &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00969-5" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;reportedly&lt;/a&gt; been slashed. The cuts of people and funds are collectively stoking deep alarm among HIV researchers and doctors across the country.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“What we’re seeing can only be summarized by the words chaos and terror,” said Colleen Kelley, chair of the HIV Medicine Association. “Our terror is that we’re going to see increases in HIV infections, increases in deaths from AIDS, increases in babies being born with HIV.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The exact toll to date is difficult to quantify. So far, core federal programs to provide HIV treatment, including through the 1990 Ryan White CARE Act, appear intact. So does Ending the HIV Epidemic in the U.S., or EHE, the ambitious program Trump launched during his first administration. But the cuts, along with &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/03/03/medicaid-cuts-republicans-paragon-say-to-focus-on-waste-fraud-and-abuse/"&gt;Republican-floated plans to slash Medicaid&lt;/a&gt;, have physicians and advocates concerned more is to come.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They also come alongside an &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/04/01/trump-administration-sued-decision-rescind-billions-covid-19-public-health-funding/"&gt;attempt to claw back Covid recovery funds&lt;/a&gt;, a move that — while &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/04/03/federal-judge-temporarily-block-billions-health-funding-cuts-states/"&gt;currently blocked by a court order&lt;/a&gt; — has &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/04/02/cdc-hhs-cuts-nyc-infectious-disease/"&gt;imperiled&lt;/a&gt; jobs at local public health departments, potentially impeding services to those living with or at risk of HIV. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I don’t think we can keep our heads in the sand any longer,” said Anu Hazra, director of STI services for the Chicago Center of HIV Elimination. “Nothing is safe in this administration, whether treatment or care.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Department of Health and Human Services did not directly respond to a list of detailed questions.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“HHS is following the Administration’s guidance and taking a careful look at all divisions to see where there is overlap that could be streamlined to support the President’s broader efforts to restructure the federal government,” spokesperson Vianca N. Rodriguez Feliciano wrote. “This is to ensure that HHS better serves the American people at the highest and most efficient standard.”&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The cuts to HIV work struck many researchers as darkly ironic, given the first Trump administration’s &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2019/02/05/can-the-us-end-the-hiv-epidemic-in-a-decade-as-trump-pledged/"&gt;goal of ending the epidemic by 2030&lt;/a&gt;. Although not on track for that lofty ambition, EHE helped reduce infections by 12% as of 2021, by flooding resources into high-risk counties. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This was working,” said John Brooks, who served as chief medical officer for the CDC’s division of HIV prevention until last year. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The exact toll of last Tuesday’s cuts was never announced, but&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;five&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;branches of the CDC’s HIV prevention division appear to have been effectively eliminated, according to more than a half dozen affected employees.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These cuts actually leave intact “the division’s core functions,” said Brooks. That includes the surveillance team that counts new cases, an outbreak response team, and a team responsible for administering funds to states.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Lost, though, were a long list of critical support and research, former employees and outside experts said. That includes a prevention communication branch that conducts public awareness campaigns and outreach to providers, as well as a quantitative science branch that employed mathematical modelers, statisticians, and economists to estimate national HIV incidence, determine where best to deploy limited resources, and assist in laboratory studies. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s not clear now whether the CDC has the expertise required to even estimate the size of the epidemic. “No more statisticians are there to support the national HIV incidence,” said one affected employee.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Gone, too, is a behavioral and clinical surveillance branch that has long conducted two surveys on people living with and people at risk of HIV. It provided key data on what people need to access and stay on treatment or prevention services. “Without this data, we will provide worse care,” said Gretchen Newman, director of the HIV clinic at Wayne State University in Detroit.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Since January, one affected employee told STAT, the staff had spent much of their time trying to comply with an executive order demanding they scrub references to transgender individuals from the data in order to assure the overall project could continue. “We were doing all this meticulous fine-tuning,” they said, “and now it’s for nothing.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The employee pointed out, with exasperation, that such efforts aligned with health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s focus on chronic disease. Much of the group’s recent work focused on preventing cancer and heart disease in adults growing older with HIV.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A roughly 40-to-50-person research branch that ran studies and mined health records to examine the best way to deploy new prevention tools, such as PrEP, was also cut. It included a decades-long &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7235508/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; that was abruptly terminated in February, without a clear plan for informing subjects, according to a source, as well as work on how to get new long-acting injectable drugs to Black women in the South, who are most at risk of HIV. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“What’s being lost … is the expert staff to make sure we know what’s working best to prevent HIV,” said Brooks. “Whether federal dollars are reaching the right people and are working, if there are gaps where prevention services are needed and how to most strategically spend that money.”&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;An affected research branch employee put it in starker terms. The agency “will no longer be able to track HIV prevention progress,” the employee said, noting their extensive efforts to understand how key tools are being deployed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Secretary Kennedy had said the cuts would be strategic and that scientists would not be fired,” they added. This “is the opposite of what the administration claimed it aimed to do.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research branch also ran a pilot program to ship out a million at-home HIV tests, giving many access to cheap, discreet, and fast diagnostics. And it included central efforts to reduce mother-to-child transmission, an effort that has &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10387171/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;appeared&lt;/a&gt; spectacularly effective but not complete. Between 30 and 40 &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/151/5/e2022059604/191071/Achieving-Elimination-of-Perinatal-HIV-in-the?autologincheck=redirected" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;babies&lt;/a&gt; still contract HIV every year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The fact that we still have perinatal transmission is a travesty,” said Carlos Del Rio, co-director of the Emory Center for AIDS Research. The CDC experts “were following every case, figuring out why and what we can do to [prevent] future cases.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The status of all of these programs remains unclear. They have not, seemingly, been formally defunded. But it’s not clear who would now administer them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;NBC News reported on a plan &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/trump-administration-considers-plan-eliminate-cdcs-hiv-prevention-divi-rcna196946" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;floated&lt;/a&gt; to move some prevention work into the Health Resources and Services Administration, which has long administered the Ryan White program for treatment. And a spokesperson &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/04/04/hiv-trump-cuts-prep/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; the Washington Post that some efforts would be moved into a proposed new agency, Administration for a Healthy America. But no specifics have been offered. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If the government wants to try to be more efficient, that’s fine, said Mitch Warren, head of the AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition, “but how are you making sure the programs continue? They haven’t said a word about that.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead, doctors and advocates are most concerned about prevention. Although the epidemic is far less deadly than it once was, its impact has remained remarkably unequal. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It continues to have a disproportionate impact on young Black and Latino gay men, as well as transgender women, among other groups. That’s in part been driven by disparate access to tools such as PrEP. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“In the underserved community … we are experiencing an epidemic of HIV that has never really stopped,” said Dial Hewlett, a medical director at the Westchester County Department of Health. “Less than 40% of eligible adults are receiving PrEP. In underserved communities, less than 10% are receiving PrEP.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The EHE program had provided resources to 57 of the nation’s highest-risk jurisdictions, in part to fund such efforts. And in June, regulators are also expected to approve &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/pharmalot/2025/04/01/trump-cuts-pepfar-threatens-rollout-gilead-hiv-prevention-drug-lenacapavir/"&gt;lenacapavir&lt;/a&gt;, a new form of PrEP that has been shown to offer virtually complete protection from HIV with just a single administration every six months. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CDC researchers had been preparing guidance for how clinicians should deploy the drug. That team is now essentially gone. Their departures and the cuts elsewhere have researchers concerned the new drug could be deployed as unevenly as the last.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I don’t know,” said &lt;a href="https://med.emory.edu/departments/medicine/divisions/infectious-diseases/profile/?u=JCOLASA" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Jonathan Colasanti,&lt;/a&gt; an infectious disease researcher at Emory. “It has the potential to end the epidemic if we do it right, if the resources are there. Only if it reaches the people who need it the most.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A pending Supreme Court decision could also unwind rules, imposed by the Biden administration, requiring insurers to cover PrEP. Even if coverage continues, uptake could be restricted if the CDC or government-funded entities aren’t allowed to direct efforts toward specific groups, such as transgender people. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These moves have disappointed and angered researchers, who saw the focus on HIV as a rare medical bright spot from Trump’s first term. Some wonder if the decisions could be driven in part by Kennedy’s past &lt;a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/robert-f-kennedy-jr-2024-presidential-campaign-democratic-primary.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;comments&lt;/a&gt; denying that HIV causes AIDS.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They also say that it is, from a financial standpoint, remarkably inefficient. Treatment is far more expensive. The CDC estimated it saved $5 billion by averting 9,000 infections between 2017 and 2021. Researchers had hoped tools like lenacapavir and continued funding could avert thousands more. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It baffles me and disappoints and upsets me,” Del Rio said of the blows to the HIV prevention infrastructure, “because we could end the HIV epidemic in our country if we do the right things.”   &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

For over a century, scientists have hypothesized that neurons are the only cells involved in storing and recalling memories. Now, researchers from Baylor College of Medicine have discovered that another cell in the brain may play a crucial role in memory as well. Their study showing that star-shaped brain cells called astrocytes are also involved in forming and recalling memories won the 2025 STAT Madness popular vote. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In 1904, a German zoologist and memory researcher named Richard Semon made a prediction about how memories were stored in the brain. Semon hypothesized that memories were kept in ensembles of neurons he called engrams, which became reactivated when memories were recalled.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s only been in the last several decades that scientists have been able to prove that Semon’s theory is correct — partially. Baylor’s team found that astrocytes, cells that are in close physical proximity to neurons and help with neurotransmission, are also an essential part of the engram.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“An engram is now comprised of multiple ensembles, you have an ensemble of neurons and an ensemble of astrocytes,” said senior author Benjamin Deneen, the Dr. Russell J. and Marian K. Blattner Chair at the Center for Cancer Neuroscience at Baylor. “They work hand in hand.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The 2025 STAT Madness competition, a bracket-style celebration of biomedical research, stacked 64 entries against each other in a month-long competition. The contest garnered 374,302 votes for topics that included a new &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.ado7082" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;gene-editing technique that can turn off prions&lt;/a&gt; that cause diseases like mad cow, and a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07016-9" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;light-powered pacemaker&lt;/a&gt; thinner than a strand of hair. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the Baylor team, which included co-first authors and postdoctoral associates Michael Williamson and Wookbong Kwon, won with 63.6% of the 92,001 votes in the final round, making this the medical school’s &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2024/04/05/stat-madness-2024-baylor-wastewater-monitoring/"&gt;second successive Madness championship&lt;/a&gt;. Baylor beat a team from Florida International University that studied the feasibility of functional precision medicine in treating pediatric cancers.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A team from NYU’s School of Global Public Health won the &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/03/21/stat-madness-stat-summit-award-won-by-nyu-school-of-global-public-health/"&gt;STAT Madness All-Star Award last month&lt;/a&gt;, voted on by attendees at the Breakthrough Summit East, for research finding higher rates of deep sedation in Hispanic patients hospitalized with respiratory failure, which may help explain why Hispanic people are twice as likely to die from respiratory failure than other similar patients. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;To showcase astrocytes’ role in memory, the Baylor team honed in on a gene called c-Fos, which plays an important role in neuron plasticity. The researchers found that about 4% to 5% of astrocytes express the same c-Fos gene. The researchers dubbed these astrocytes learning-associated astrocytes, or LAAs, and tagged the cells to study them using a viral vector. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Next, the researchers used genetically modified mice and conditioned them to feel fear. When the mice were put in new situations, they didn’t freeze up in fear like they normally did — until the LAAs were activated. “Our interpretation of that was that the mice were having sort of an artificial memory,” Deneen said, that “is stored in part in the astrocytes.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08170-w" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; was published in the journal Nature last November, and was supported by funding from the National Institutes of Health, the National Research Foundation of Korea, and the David and Eula Wintermann Foundation. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study does have limitations, the authors acknowledge. While the gene has been well studied in neurons, there is very limited research on the gene in astrocytes, and the scientists aren’t sure why some astrocytes express the gene, while others don’t. “God only knows what c-Fos means in an astrocyte,” Deneen said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Since the study’s publication, the authors have continued to research astrocytes’ roles in memory, including trying to understand the changes that occur in astrocytes that exhibit the c-Fos gene. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Can all astrocytes become engrams?” Deneen said, “Or are there preordained or specialized astrocytes that are more prone or more likely to become an engram? We don’t know the answer to that.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team from Florida International University took second place with research showing that functional precision medicine (FPM) can be done quickly and improves outcomes for pediatric cancer patients. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Normally, cancer patients need to rely on a doctor’s expertise to decide what treatment to try. FPM, which combines cancer genomic profiling with drug sensitivity testing, takes some of the guesswork out of finding the best drug to fight each patient’s individual cancer. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The method had already been shown to work in adults, but Diana Azzam, the scientific director of the Center for Advancing Personalized Cancer Treatments at FIU’s Robert Stempel College of Public Health &amp;amp; Social Work, wanted to see if it could be helpful for pediatric patients with relapsed and hard-to-treat cancers for which few treatment options exist. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We demonstrated that we could generate functional precision medicine data and return results to a tumor board quickly enough to make a decision for the next line of treatment,” Azzam said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Azzam’s study had two objectives: to see if the FPM approach could be done quickly enough to be useful, and to see if patients who took drugs recommended by the FPM testing would have better clinical outcomes than they did before participating in the study.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research team found that it could quickly conduct all the testing required for the FPM method, completing drug sensitivity testing and genomic profiling within 10 days and 27 days, respectively. This was fast enough for the team to come up with actionable treatment recommendations before too many of the children’s cancers progressed. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;During the drug sensitivity testing, Azzam and her team exposed the children’s cancer cells to 125 FDA-approved drugs, including cancer drugs, allergy medications, and statins. Azzam said that one of the important results of the paper is showing that some of these drugs had anticancer properties and were indicated as treatments against relapsing and hard-to-treat cancers. “Repurposing of these drugs is key,” Azzam said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After the drug sensitivity and genomic tests, the team was able to make individualized treatment recommendations for 19 of the 25 patients enrolled in the study. Only six patients took the FPM-recommended drug, but those that did had a much higher likelihood of progression-free survival compared to patients that went back to their doctor’s treatment plan. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One of those six patients was &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2024/04/11/pediatric-cancer-functional-precision-medicine/"&gt;Logan Jenner&lt;/a&gt;, a young boy with relapsed acute myeloid leukemia. Testing revealed a specific mutation that could be targeted with medication, and he has been cancer-free for more than two years.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-02848-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;study &lt;/a&gt;was published in Nature Medicine last April and was  funded by the Florida Department of Health. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There are limitations to the study, Azzam said. The sample size was small, at only 25 patients, and did not include a randomized control group. In order to limit bias, the researchers used each patient as their own control, comparing their cancer progression after their choice to pursue FPM to their progression before the trial. Those that used the FPM-guided treatment substantially improved. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This is a proof of principle study,” Azzam said, “to really show that this is feasible and we can scale it up.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Azzam’s ultimate goal is to use FPM testing for rare cancers before they progress and relapse. She imagines a world where children — and adults — diagnosed with cancers such as osteosarcoma or glioblastoma can get quick FPM testing to determine the best treatment option immediately. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She’s kickstarting the process by working to open a CLIA-certified lab in Florida that will take samples from patients nationwide and perform FPM testing. “It’s going to be the first commercial lab to provide functional precision medicine, along with artificial intelligence, to guide treatments for relapsed, refractory patients,” Azzam said, “not only children, but also adults.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's normal to experience changes in our mobility as we get older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people find movements like touching their toes or getting up from the sofa start to feel more challenging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the best ways to offset this is through regular movement. But which exercises are the most effective for maintaining strength and mobility as you age?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Rachel Lennon, Pilates instructor and founder of &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.instagram.com/wellnesstribe_retreat/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.instagram.com/wellnesstribe_retreat/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;The Wellness Tribe&lt;/a&gt;, there's one simple move that everyone should do for longevity: the glute bridge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The bridge is such a good exercise for spinal mobility and core activation and strength and it also works the glutes," Lennon says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best part? It doesn't require any equipment, making it easy to do at home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-to-do-the-glute-bridge"&gt;&lt;span&gt;How to do the glute bridge&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lie on your back with your feet flat on the floor and your heels close to your glutes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Press your lower back into the mat to find a neutral position in your spine.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Inhale then press through your heels to lift your hips until your body forms a straight line from your shoulders to your knees.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Squeeze your glutes at the top of the movement.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Exhale, slowly lower your hips back to the floor.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Repeat for 10-12 repetitions, finishing with a 30-second hold at the top.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-the-benefits-of-glute-bridge-for-longevity"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The benefits of glute bridge for longevity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The glute bridge offers several benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-hBBVcjyXwfmFQzb97MzphZ" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-hBBVcjyXwfmFQzb97MzphZ slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Start your week with achievable workout ideas, health tips and wellbeing advice in your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improves spinal mobility &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you want to stay feeling healthy and young, you want to keep the spine mobile," Lennon advises. "Moving up and down through this movement will mobilize the spine."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strengthens the glutes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The glutes are the biggest muscle in the body so we want to be working them regularly," Lennon explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Builds core strength&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The 30-second hold will really engage your muscles, particularly your core," Lennon adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A strong core is essential for supporting your entire body and providing strength for everyday movements like putting shopping away overhead and carrying heavy bags.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having a stronger core can also help you maintain an upright posture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make it fun&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's easy to make this movement feel like fun. "Put some music on and do your reps to the beat," suggests Lennon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Making movement uplifting and lighthearted is important to ensure you develop a healthy relationship with exercise, she adds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We are deeply saddened to report that a school-aged child who was recently diagnosed with measles has passed away," Aaron Davis, vice president of UMC Health System, a medical center in Texas, told AFP news agency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Davis added that the child, who had been receiving treatment for "complications of measles," did not have any underlying conditions and was not vaccinated against the highly &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/infectious-diseases/t-71255642"&gt;infectious disease.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In February, a child died of measles in the first death from the illness in the US in over a decade. The outbreak began in late January in Gaines County, a remote area in western Texas where the vaccination rate is lower than the protective rate of 95%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In March, an adult's death in the neighboring state of New Mexico was also classified as a measles-related death. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="vjs-wrapper embed big"&gt;&lt;h2 aria-label="Embedded video — Trump wields budget ax against US science, medical research" class="headline"&gt;&lt;svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewbox="0 0 20 20"&gt;&lt;g fill-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;path d="M14.114 7.599H13.5l.002 4.706h.601l4.582 3.25-.005-11.11zM11.084 4.444l-9.007.002-1.336.797.002 9.514 1.334.793 9.007.006 1.509-.799-.004-9.516z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/g&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;Trump wields budget ax against US science, medical research&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;video id="video-71924042" controls playsinline="" preload="none" poster="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mNkYAAAAAYAAjCB0C8AAAAASUVORK5CYII=" data-id="71924042" data-posterurl="https://static.dw.com/image/71865331_605.webp" data-duration="02:55"&gt;&lt;source src="https://hlsvod.dw.com/i/dwtv_video/flv/je/je20250314_QScience12E_,AVC_480x270,AVC_512x288,AVC_640x360,AVC_960x540,AVC_1280x720,AVC_1920x1080,.mp4.csmil/master.m3u8" type="application/x-mpegURL"&gt;&lt;source src="https://tvdownloaddw-a.akamaihd.net/dwtv_video/flv/je/je20250314_QScience12E_AVC_1920x1080.mp4" type="video/mp4"&gt;&lt;p class="vjs-no-js"&gt;To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that &lt;a href="https://videojs.com/html5-video-support/" target="_blank"&gt;supports HTML5 video&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/video&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Kennedy calls for vaccinations &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/rfk-jrs-measles-cure-sickens-texas-kids-amid-outbreak/a-72149122"&gt;Robert F. Kennedy&lt;/a&gt; Jr , US President &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/donald-trump/t-19434433"&gt;Donald Trump&lt;/a&gt;'s health secretary, took to social media platform X on Sunday, saying "the most effective way to prevent the spread of measles is the MMR vaccine."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kennedy is known for downplaying the importance of vaccines, which has alarmed healthcare experts across the nation. He has also described taking vaccines as a personal choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Davis from the Texas medical center said that the second measles death "underscores the importance of vaccination." &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kennedy said that 642 cases of measles have been confirmed in 22 states, with &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/measles-in-texas-a-deadly-disease-that-can-be-prevented/a-68121991"&gt;499 of them in Texas&lt;/a&gt; alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He made the comments during a trip to Texas to meet the families of the two children who died of the illness.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trump, however, downplayed the outbreak when questioned by reporters onboard the Air Force One, saying it was "so far a fairly small number of people relative to what we're talking about." He promised "very strong action" would be taken if things worsened.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;For some patients, the amount of blackened tissue that needs removing is so extreme it’s impossible and they die within days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet Mucorales, the fungal family which causes Mucormycosis, is not one considered ‘critical’ by WHO ranking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are four invasive fungal pathogens deemed ‘critical’ on the list, and their insidious spores can even be found in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of them, “Candida albicans”, can be found “in about half the population inside our guts,” says Dr Rebecca Drummond, Associate Professor in antifungal immunity, University of Birmingham.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aspergillus, another critical priority pathogen, is in fact so widespread that most people inhale between 100 to 1000 spores every day from the air we breathe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even the mould on bread can contain Mucor, a fungus that causes Mucormycosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;The invasive fungal infection making lungs bleed&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;So if these threats are so prevalent, why don’t we hear about them?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists say it’s because those most at risk to fungal pathogens are people with weak immune systems, like patients living with HIV or on chemotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Most fungal infections attack people who’ve already got existing illnesses, so they’ve either got weakened immune systems or they’ve got problems with their lungs” Prof Armstrong-James says. “Because they don’t strike down the man or woman in the street, so to speak, they don’t enter into the public folklore in the same way that viruses and bacteria do.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As medical interventions have improved – think of advances in chemotherapy that have enabled a much greater number of cancers to be treated – there are now more people living with compromised immune systems who are vulnerable to deadly spores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grace*, 66, has long suffered from severe asthma. Just over 10 years ago, she was diagnosed with Chronic Pulmonary Aspergillosis (CPA) and Allergic Bronchopulmonary Aspergillosis, a lung-damaging, life-threatening, condition caused by the fungus Aspergillus fumigatus – another of the WHO’s priority pathogens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘I’d get my children to do back patting exercises to try and loosen [the mucus], I’d be on the floor over the cushions trying to be a bit upside down.’ Scans finally revealed the extent of the infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One of [the doctors] said: ‘We know it’s not cancer, because [with] the amount of patches you’ve got, you wouldn’t be here,” she said, referring to the dark blotches of lung damage visible by x-ray.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cocktails of antifungal drugs made her hair fall out and damaged her liver function.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Daniel Atkinson, Treated's clinical lead, said: 'It's possible we've seen obesity hit its peak, and the number of people falling out of obesity will begin to overtake the number of people entering this BMI bracket.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This could have a profound effect on preventing type 2 &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/diabetes/index.html" id="mol-29345340-0e46-11f0-bb58-eb1eceea7ca2"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;. It could also help prevent hundreds of thousands of &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-2933de10-0e46-11f0-bb58-eb1eceea7ca2" class=""&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; and cardiovascular disease cases annually.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Obesity is a chronic condition characterized by an excessive accumulation of body fat that raises the risk of a multitude of health problems, such as heart disease, stroke, diabetes and even cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Studies have warned that it can negatively impact someone's mental health, with people with the condition more likely to be depressed, suffer from poor body image or from stigma and discrimination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For the report, researchers analyzed data from Treated — which prescribes weight loss drugs like Ozempic in the US and in 10 European countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The countries include Denmark, Estonia, &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/finland/index.html" id="mol-b1ab9960-0e49-11f0-bb58-eb1eceea7ca2"&gt;Finland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/germany/index.html" id="mol-b1abe780-0e49-11f0-bb58-eb1eceea7ca2"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/the-netherlands/index.html" id="mol-b1acd1e0-0e49-11f0-bb58-eb1eceea7ca2"&gt;Netherlands&lt;/a&gt;, Norway, Portugal, &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/romania/index.html" id="mol-b1ad6e20-0e49-11f0-bb58-eb1eceea7ca2"&gt;Romania&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/sweden/index.html" id="mol-b1adbc40-0e49-11f0-bb58-eb1eceea7ca2"&gt;Sweden&lt;/a&gt; and the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Data from national public databases on prescription rates for the drugs was also used in the analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Overall, researchers estimated that by the start of 2026 at least 2.86million Americans will be actively using a weight loss drug (either Wegovy, Ozempic, Zepbound or Mounjaro). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If this rate stays consistent, then they estimated the US could see 2.17million people fall out of the obese population each year between 2026 and 2030. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If the trend persists, by 2030, researchers estimated 10million people could reverse their obesity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In Europe, for comparison, they estimated that by 2026 some 994,000 people on the continent would be using a weight loss drug — less than half the number in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;People in southern states were more likely to be obese due to high prevalence of chronic disease and lack of access to healthy foods and recreational centers, researchers said&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If this stays consistent, this would lead to 786,000 people reversing their obesity every year — or 1.3 percent of the obese population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;By the end of 2030, they estimated this could lead to 3.93million Europeans exiting obesity, or a drop of 6.6 percent in the continent's rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study did not account for other factors, however, such as the fact that studies suggest almost two thirds of patients regain the weight they lost after coming off Ozempic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Joseph Palumbo, senior medical adviser for Treated, said: 'Knowing that obesity is a foundation of so many diseases, acute and chronic, I have been very excited and encouraged with these medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We truly have a tool along with dietary modifications and exercise to combat obesity without drastic life-altering surgical options.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People on Ozempic or similar weight loss drugs inject themselves once a week, with the medication curbing appetite, leading to people eating less and shedding weight.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Uptake of weight loss drugs is already high in the US, with about 13 percent of adults — or 33million people — estimated to have ever tried at least one by 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There are no clear public figures for how many people in the US are currently taking a weight loss drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For comparison, in Denmark — the European country where the drugs were invented — just 1.5 percent of adults are estimated to have used the drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite the breakthrough in obesity medications, however, these drugs have been associated with undesirable side-effects — with many patients complaining of nausea, vomiting and constipation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In more serious cases, patients have said they've suffered from pancreatitis — inflammation of the pancreas — stomach paralysis, and even blindness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Several deaths have also been reported in people taking the drug, although it was not clear whether the drug directly led to the fatality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 07 Apr 2025 02:37:34 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimgFBVV95cUxPMF8zNmJZeDdwNFlBazhsd0RMYTREQW4tbzNfdV94aUJGSGg5a3pKdXNfSWZYeUZfZHdrYkNldVlMRTNRRFB2a1djNlItR2NBMmEyc29UcVRtb1RQYlM0SEFtYnhzampDVHFBSVpNeElab0NfZXFGb2FjbXVvWVFCTi1wZHNPQXY2REJLdmZrLTJXVjQzU3BMZkJB0gGfAUFVX3lxTE1XRHhrQXJfcmd5WWlDQkxzLXJrMTVlcTRCUmNGVXR0UHZXMGxmeG5mM094VHAxMWd3YVptVXVVRUt6VnViSjdtS1FQS3FSZFd5bzBta1hnUW9Gb09VT0pPV0M5Yy12TXdjb3cteU5nVWNTTU11STNDRmRQaXVjYVV4bTVzaWp4SHh5anR5aUwyOFhMdEMxZEtvY2o3U242cw</guid></item><item><title>I fix botched plastic surgeries for a living... here are the common procedures you should never get - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimgFBVV95cUxPQ05OSWNlSDFZTUx1TGhqS1JVNEpzM0pQd19oa3JEN25nUXFka0JXRi04ZmFZdVlkZ1Q4MVJuOWotRmlYbTdmMHRYeC1xSkQ5NWd2a3NzNGl1SlJrSy1yWkdQZTZGVjQzUXdOYzBBM2dYcGhybU41RTBndE5YS25IXzB0dzFJQnYyVTdrMTdYZmFvTmctQ0xUMl9B0gGfAUFVX3lxTE5rRFRQd3VFcHJ0UUhVY3FDZzVRTE1GeHc3SEZOb2RZeE9xX2M2NGdkNndHNThrczd0aTJoaTM2cEstQTUxVXpXa0puNHdlemNDWlF6R2ZZMGhMUTJYTEpQN0FkUlJtOHpLVGNEVVBYMnROZU9MSC1jRV8tVTRUU1l2cHJVUmZfUVctVUIwY0ZvLWF4NFRKeFcwc3dCNy1OVQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A doctor who specializes in fixing botched plastic surgery procedures has revealed how to avoid being maimed under the knife. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Timothy Katzen has handled hundreds of patients over his more than 25 years of practice, including a number who were victims of 'botched' operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some of these were seeking a revision after a procedure, like a nose job that resulted in proportions they didn't like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But in other cases, patients were left with gaping wounds that reopened and became infected, sagging skin that rippled and — in rare cases — holes in their buttocks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Plastic surgery is&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14448157/plastic-surgeon-daddy-transformations-surgery-craze.html"&gt; surging in popularity&lt;/a&gt; in the US as more people seek cosmetic enhancements amid the rise of Instagram filters and celebrity 'tweakments.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Last year, an estimated 1.5million cosmetic procedures were carried out in the US — among the highest ever recorded and up five percent from the previous year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Of these, &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/liposuction/index.html" id="mol-ef740940-0c0e-11f0-b768-6d91f69217a5" class=""&gt;liposuction&lt;/a&gt; was the most popular — with 347,000 patients — followed by breast augmentation — at 304,000 — and tummy tuck — at 170,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Timothy Katzen, a plastic surgeon in Beverly Hills, has increasingly helped patients whose plastic surgeries have been botched&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The vast majority of surgeries are carried out by well-trained surgeons and are completed without issue, with excellent natural-looking results for patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But in uncommon cases, patients can end up with complications — although this accounts for less than one percent of all US patients, estimates suggest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Katzen said: 'Although it is very, very rare, you can have a complication with any procedure you do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It may not be the fault of the patient, and it may not be the fault of the surgeon — but complications do happen even when we try our best. Sometimes, things just don't heal right.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now, in an exclusive interview with DailyMail.com, the Beverly-Hills based doctor revealed the most common botched procedures that he fixes, as well as his top tips for avoiding becoming a botched patient. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="health-ccox mol-style-bold mol-style-large"&gt;Be aware of the most commonly botched surgeries&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Overall, Dr Katzen said he sees the most complications from silicone injections, with an average 10 to 15 people per week seeking his help to reverse lumps, bumps and infections caused by the substance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People can get the injections to enhance or reshape certain body parts by adding volume, smoothing wrinkles or contouring areas like the lips, buttocks, hips or face. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But these are illegal in the US, with the FDA saying they come with a risk of 'serious injury and disfigurement' that can happen weeks to months to even years after the injection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Karzen helps people with silicone injections by removing the silicone from their bodies, and also clearing up any scar tissue surrounding it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Patients who had America's most common surgery liposuction were the next most common at his practice, with Dr Katzen saying he sees about five patients with complications from this procedure in a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In many cases, they were struggling with loose or rippling skin, which was caused by too much fat being removed during the procedure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Katzen said they fix this by either injecting more fat into the area or by performing skin-tightening surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Thigh lift, a procedure used to tighten skin around the legs, was the third most botched procedure the surgeon said, also with about five patients a week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In many cases, he said, the incisions from the surgery — running from the groin to the knee — had opened, sometimes completely, and caused an infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He also mentioned a Brazilian Butt Lift (BBL), a notoriously dangerous procedure because it involves injecting fat into the buttocks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In some cases, some of these fat cells may get into a blood vessel, in what is called a fat embolism, from which they can come to organs like the lungs and cause a blood clot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Plastic surgeries normally have no complications if they are carried out by a trained and experienced surgeon. Statistics suggest less than one percent have complications&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-large health-ccox mol-style-bold"&gt;Look for before and after photos&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When choosing a surgeon for your procedure, Dr Katzen said one of the most important factors to consider is their online before and after photos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The best way for a surgeon to prove to the public that we do lots of these procedures, is to post lots of before and after pictures,' he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="art-ins mol-factbox floatRHS health" data-version="2" id="mol-dcaf6490-0f14-11f0-84e3-55cc4f15a517" data-permabox-url="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-14548089/botched-surgery-advice-timothy-katzen.html"&gt; &lt;h3 class="mol-factbox-title"&gt;The most common botched procedures seen at Dr Katzen's office &lt;/h3&gt; &lt;div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"&gt; &lt;ol class="mol-bullets-with-font"&gt;&lt;li class=""&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;Silicone injections&lt;/span&gt;  — 10 to 15 patients a week&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=""&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;Liposuction &lt;/span&gt;— five patients a week&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=""&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;Thigh lifts&lt;/span&gt; — four or five patients a week&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=""&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;Facelift revisions&lt;/span&gt; — one or two a week&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=""&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;Rhinoplasty revisions &lt;/span&gt;— one or two a week&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Surgeons can mention they did college and residency and are triple-board certified, have a fancy office, and tons of reviews online.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'But, at the end of the day, they may have actually only carried out the procedure you're looking for on one patient.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Before and after photos, however, allow prospective patients to see real results on a variety of body types.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Let your surgeon decide what you need&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Many patients go to plastic surgeons demanding a particular surgery, and search for a new surgeon if their request is denied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But Dr Katzen said it was important for patients to listen to a surgeon's professional opinion, which is based on years of training and hundreds to thousands of operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I think patients need to be cautious and trusting of their surgeons,' he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I don't think patients should go to surgeons and say, "I want this!" Show the surgeon what's wrong and let them help decide the best thing for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'For example, I have had people come in who say they want this area of skin [on their face under the eye] three millimeters higher, but in some cases that may not be possible or could actually give someone an unnatural appearance.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He warned that refusing to listen to surgeons, even when they say you don't need or qualify for the procedure you're requesting, raises the risk of suffering from complications. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-large health-ccox mol-style-bold"&gt;Don't go by price or recommendations from friends &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Katzen advised people to try not to consider cost when searching for a surgeon&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Many patients consider cost and friends' recommendations when choosing a surgeon, but Dr Katzen cautioned not to prioritize these.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'If you are considering a plastic surgery procedure, then do your research, but do not shop around based on prices,' he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Just go for the surgery you can afford, but don't go for the lowest bidder. Go for the surgeon you feel is the most experienced in your procedure.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He also advised not following the recommendations of friends, saying they may have had a different type of procedure or have a different body type.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-large health-ccox mol-style-bold"&gt;Avoid illegal procedures&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Many patients have turned to illegal silicone injections from illicit surgeons and are now having to have it removed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Silicone is a synthetic substance that is used in implants for its soft texture that mimics the feel of human flesh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But the FDA has banned it being injected into patients except in very rare procedures because of the high risk of complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Katzen said he has seen many patients suffering from silicone complications, including many referred to him by other surgeons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In past cases, he has had people who had swollen penises due to the injections or buttocks where holes had opened up in them due to the injections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Know what surgeries to skip&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Katzen said&lt;span&gt; nearly all surgeries can provide excellent results, as long as they are carried out by a well-trained and experienced surgeon.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But he did say there was one procedure, which he has only seen online, he would avoid. The operation is a facelift-like surgery in which a patient's skin is sewn together on the cheeks to give them a face-lift-like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This differs from a normal facelift, where incisions are made in front of the ears or a brow lift, where they are made along the hairline.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It's making people look like pincushions,' he said, 'I wouldn't recommend that one'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He wasn't clear on the name of the procedure, but said it differed from a thread lift — which has been approved by the FDA for skin lifting and tightening. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Katzen added: 'But the rest are legitimate, and are good in experienced hands. Most of the time the ones who get botched procedures have not been with surgeons who have proper training or who haven't done it before and are inexperienced.'&lt;/p&gt;

Sometimes, things just don't heal right.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now, in an exclusive interview with DailyMail.com, the Beverly-Hills based doctor revealed the most common botched procedures that he fixes, as well as his top tips for avoiding becoming a botched patient. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="health-ccox mol-style-bold mol-style-large"&gt;Be aware of the most commonly botched surgeries&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Overall, Dr Katzen said he sees the most complications from silicone injections, with an average 10 to 15 people per week seeking his help to reverse lumps, bumps and infections caused by the substance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People can get the injections to enhance or reshape certain body parts by adding volume, smoothing wrinkles or contouring areas like the lips, buttocks, hips or face. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But these are illegal in the US, with the FDA saying they come with a risk of 'serious injury and disfigurement' that can happen weeks to months to even years after the injection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Karzen helps people with silicone injections by removing the silicone from their bodies, and also clearing up any scar tissue surrounding it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Patients who had America's most common surgery liposuction were the next most common at his practice, with Dr Katzen saying he sees about five patients with complications from this procedure in a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In many cases, they were struggling with loose or rippling skin, which was caused by too much fat being removed during the procedure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Katzen said they fix this by either injecting more fat into the area or by performing skin-tightening surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Thigh lift, a procedure used to tighten skin around the legs, was the third most botched procedure the surgeon said, also with about five patients a week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In many cases, he said, the incisions from the surgery — running from the groin to the knee — had opened, sometimes completely, and caused an infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He also mentioned a Brazilian Butt Lift (BBL), a notoriously dangerous procedure because it involves injecting fat into the buttocks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In some cases, some of these fat cells may get into a blood vessel, in what is called a fat embolism, from which they can come to organs like the lungs and cause a blood clot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Plastic surgeries normally have no complications if they are carried out by a trained and experienced surgeon. Statistics suggest less than one percent have complications&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-large health-ccox mol-style-bold"&gt;Look for before and after photos&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When choosing a surgeon for your procedure, Dr Katzen said one of the most important factors to consider is their online before and after photos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The best way for a surgeon to prove to the public that we do lots of these procedures, is to post lots of before and after pictures,' he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="art-ins mol-factbox floatRHS health" data-version="2" id="mol-dcaf6490-0f14-11f0-84e3-55cc4f15a517" data-permabox-url="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-14548089/botched-surgery-advice-timothy-katzen.html"&gt; &lt;h3 class="mol-factbox-title"&gt;The most common botched procedures seen at Dr Katzen's office &lt;/h3&gt; &lt;div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"&gt; &lt;ol class="mol-bullets-with-font"&gt;&lt;li class=""&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;Silicone injections&lt;/span&gt;  — 10 to 15 patients a week&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=""&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;Liposuction &lt;/span&gt;— five patients a week&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=""&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;Thigh lifts&lt;/span&gt; — four or five patients a week&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=""&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;Facelift revisions&lt;/span&gt; — one or two a week&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=""&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;Rhinoplasty revisions &lt;/span&gt;— one or two a week&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Surgeons can mention they did college and residency and are triple-board certified, have a fancy office, and tons of reviews online.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'But, at the end of the day, they may have actually only carried out the procedure you're looking for on one patient.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Before and after photos, however, allow prospective patients to see real results on a variety of body types.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Let your surgeon decide what you need&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Many patients go to plastic surgeons demanding a particular surgery, and search for a new surgeon if their request is denied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But Dr Katzen said it was important for patients to listen to a surgeon's professional opinion, which is based on years of training and hundreds to thousands of operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I think patients need to be cautious and trusting of their surgeons,' he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I don't think patients should go to surgeons and say, "I want this!" Show the surgeon what's wrong and let them help decide the best thing for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'For example, I have had people come in who say they want this area of skin [on their face under the eye] three millimeters higher, but in some cases that may not be possible or could actually give someone an unnatural appearance.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He warned that refusing to listen to surgeons, even when they say you don't need or qualify for the procedure you're requesting, raises the risk of suffering from complications. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-large health-ccox mol-style-bold"&gt;Don't go by price or recommendations from friends &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Katzen advised people to try not to consider cost when searching for a surgeon&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Many patients consider cost and friends' recommendations when choosing a surgeon, but Dr Katzen cautioned not to prioritize these.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'If you are considering a plastic surgery procedure, then do your research, but do not shop around based on prices,' he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Just go for the surgery you can afford, but don't go for the lowest bidder. Go for the surgeon you feel is the most experienced in your procedure.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He also advised not following the recommendations of friends, saying they may have had a different type of procedure or have a different body type.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-large health-ccox mol-style-bold"&gt;Avoid illegal procedures&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Many patients have turned to illegal silicone injections from illicit surgeons and are now having to have it removed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Silicone is a synthetic substance that is used in implants for its soft texture that mimics the feel of human flesh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But the FDA has banned it being injected into patients except in very rare procedures because of the high risk of complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Katzen said he has seen many patients suffering from silicone complications, including many referred to him by other surgeons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In past cases, he has had people who had swollen penises due to the injections or buttocks where holes had opened up in them due to the injections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Know what surgeries to skip&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Katzen said&lt;span&gt; nearly all surgeries can provide excellent results, as long as they are carried out by a well-trained and experienced surgeon.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But he did say there was one procedure, which he has only seen online, he would avoid. The operation is a facelift-like surgery in which a patient's skin is sewn together on the cheeks to give them a face-lift-like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This differs from a normal facelift, where incisions are made in front of the ears or a brow lift, where they are made along the hairline.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It's making people look like pincushions,' he said, 'I wouldn't recommend that one'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He wasn't clear on the name of the procedure, but said it differed from a thread lift — which has been approved by the FDA for skin lifting and tightening. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Katzen added: 'But the rest are legitimate, and are good in experienced hands. Most of the time the ones who get botched procedures have not been with surgeons who have proper training or who haven't done it before and are inexperienced.'&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Takeaways&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A healthy diet and hydration should be your first defense against constipation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When these aren’t enough, certain supplements can provide safe, effective relief.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A gastroenterologist recommends psyllium, probiotics, magnesium and polyethylene glycol.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="theme-blockquote__author_1-0" class="comp theme-blockquote__author mntl-text-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Constipation isn’t anyone’s ideal state of digestive affairs. The bloating, distension and overall discomfort of a gastrointestinal slow-down are a combo you’d probably prefer to skip. But for most of us, being backed up is an occasional fact of life (sometimes even a chronic one). Constipation is so common, in fact, that about 16% of U.S. adults say it’s a problem.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Fortunately, certain dietary supplements can help get things moving again. Though they may not work immediately, with a little patience, the right choices may make you feel lighter and brighter sooner than later. We tapped&lt;a href="https://atlanticcoastgastro.com/physicians/sandhya-shukla-md/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt; Sandhya Shukla, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, a board-certified gastroenterologist with Atlantic Coast Gastroenterology, a division of Allied Digestive Health, for her top supplement recommendations for constipation. She says the following five are worth a try.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-1-psyllium-husk"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 1. Psyllium Husk &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; With its surging popularity on social media, psyllium husk may seem like a buzzy modern supplement. But it’s been used in Ayurvedic medicine as a natural remedy for constipation for thousands of years. What makes it so effective? Psyllium husk is rich in soluble fiber, which creates a slick, gel-like substance in the digestive tract that retains water. This, in turn, makes your poops easier to pass, Shukla says.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Besides psyllium’s ability to hold water, research reveals that it may also get things going by positively impacting &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/how-your-gut-health-impacts-your-body-8695122" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;gut microbiota&lt;/a&gt;. Those are the trillions of bacteria that regulate a healthy digestive tract. For instance, one small study found that supplementing with psyllium husk for four weeks led to beneficial changes in the gut microbiota of people with constipation.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; And another older study reported similar improvements in as little as one week.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Just note that psyllium husk can cause side effects in some people. (Shukla says a feeling of bloating is especially common.) You may want to start with a small dose to test your tolerance gradually. Also good to know: while supplements containing insoluble fiber may claim to ease constipation, they can actually make things worse. So, stick with soluble fiber-containing psyllium instead.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-2-probiotics"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 2. Probiotics &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; By now, you’ve probably heard of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8037462/benefits-of-taking-probiotics/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;probiotics&lt;/a&gt;. These beneficial, live bacteria may be an inexpensive, over-the-counter means of maintaining a happy gut. Here’s a tip, though: don’t just choose any old strain you see. Current research shows that certain probiotic strains may be more helpful than others for specific health issues, including constipation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; One that has a solid track record is&lt;em&gt; Lactobacillus reuteri.&lt;/em&gt; It works by getting your gut moving, helping you go more often.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; So, look for this strain specifically, or ask your doctor if another strain might be right for you.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-3-magnesium-oxide"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 3. Magnesium Oxide &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/magnesium-benefits-8656021" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Magnesium&lt;/a&gt; is often touted as a constipation preventer. However, with so many forms of this mineral on supplement shelves, it can be hard to distinguish which one is best. Shukla recommends magnesium oxide. Like psyllium husk, she says magnesium oxide draws more water into the stool, keeping things nice and soft to help with easier evacuation.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This form of magnesium may be particularly useful for treating chronic constipation that doesn’t have a known cause (also known as idiopathic constipation). In fact, the American Gastroenterological Association and American College of Gastroenterology recently released new guidelines recommending magnesium oxide as a pharmacological treatment for idiopathic constipation.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; But don’t be put off by the “pharmacological” terminology—magnesium oxide is available over the counter.  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Shukla says you can find magnesium oxide in different strengths. “I usually recommend starting at 200 or 250 milligrams [per day] and increasing to a maximum of 1,000 milligrams per day.” She also notes that people with decreased kidney function should avoid taking magnesium, as it can build to dangerous levels if the kidneys are unable to filter it properly.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-4-polyethylene-glycol"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 4. Polyethylene Glycol &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Never heard of polyethylene glycol? You may have seen it in dietary supplements without realizing it’s there. This compound is the active ingredient in powdered supplements like MiraLax and its generic equivalents.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Shukla recommends polyethylene glycol for its ease of use and effectiveness in alleviating constipation. “It is tasteless and odorless and therefore well tolerated,” she says. “Its absorption from the gut is negligible, making it a safe and effective option for treating constipation.” And unlike over-the-counter laxatives that should only be used occasionally, it’s safe for longer-term use. For instance, one study found that polyethylene glycol was safe and effective in reducing the frequency of hard or lumpy stools in people with chronic idiopathic constipation over the course of 24 weeks.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-5-prunes-and-prune-juice"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 5. Prunes and Prune Juice &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Turns out, Grandma was onto something. While not a supplement per se, the old &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/the-best-late-night-drink-to-help-you-poop-8649695" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;prune juice remedy&lt;/a&gt; really is a smart move for getting regular again. And there’s research to prove it. For instance, one study found that people with chronic constipation who drank slightly less than 2 ounces of prune juice daily for eight weeks experienced significantly fewer hard or lumpy stools.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; That makes it food as medicine for the win!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Prunes have high dietary fiber and sorbitol, both helpful for treating constipation,” explains Shukla. “This contributes to increased stool bulk and improved bowel movements.” Just one-quarter cup of prunes (about 5 prunes) provides 3 grams of fiber.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  Sorbitol, on the other hand, is a naturally occurring sugar alcohol that offers some surprising benefits for digestive health. “Sorbitol has osmotic properties that draw water into the intestines, keeping stool soft and easy to expel,” says Shukla. In fact, some people with quick intestinal transit actually &lt;em&gt;avoid&lt;/em&gt; sorbitol for this reason. So, if you want to give prunes or prune juice a try, start slowly.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When your digestive tract gets a bit sluggish, a healthy diet, proper hydration and exercise should be your first lines of defense. When they aren’t enough, the supplement aisle has safe, effective options for constipation relief. Psyllium husk, probiotics, magnesium oxidize and polyethylene glycol are all gastroenterologist-approved supplements for constipation relief. And if you’d prefer a more natural remedy, give prunes or prune juice a try. They may not be trendy, but they work!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Kennedy Jr. said Sunday that “the most effective way to prevent the spread of measles is the MMR vaccine,” his &lt;a href="https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1908967854394982414" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;most direct statement yet&lt;/a&gt; on the issue, following the death of a second child of the condition in the outbreak in West Texas. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kennedy, who has long described the vaccine as dangerous, has largely avoided endorsing its use since the start of the outbreak, and he stopped short of explicitly saying he “recommended” it in his latest remarks, as public health officials have called on him to do.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Hours later, Kennedy promoted unorthodox, unproven treatments for the disease in &lt;a href="https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1909049021211263268" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;another post&lt;/a&gt;. He spent time with “extraordinary healers,” he said — doctors Richard Bartlett and Ben Edwards — who had treated children with measles with aerosolized budesonide and clarithromycin.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Those drugs, a steroid and antibiotic, respectively, are &lt;a href="https://news.northwestern.edu/stories/2025/03/the-measles-vaccine-is-our-best-tool-to-protect-individuals-against-the-virus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;not proven&lt;/a&gt; measles treatments, physicians and health experts have said after Kennedy &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/06/health/kennedy-measles-texas-doctor-treatment/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;previously promoted them&lt;/a&gt;. Budesonide may even weaken the immune system, according to the Mayo Clinic.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Less than a month ago, Kennedy said — &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/03/14/rfk-jr-measles-vaccine-death-claims-scientists-disagree/"&gt;against current evidence&lt;/a&gt; — that the measles shot caused deaths every year. At the time, he pointed to the importance of nutrition and personal choice in getting the shot, even as he &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/robert-f-kennedy-jr-measles-outbreak-call-action-all-us.amp" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;acknowledged&lt;/a&gt; that vaccines “not only protect individual children from measles, but also contribute to community immunity.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The outbreak in West Texas has continued to grow and has also spread to Kansas and Oklahoma. The second fatality in West Texas — after an &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/03/06/new-mexico-adult-with-measles-dies/"&gt;adult with measles died in New Mexico&lt;/a&gt; — came Thursday, prompting Kennedy to travel there in a show of support and to attend the girl’s funeral. He said while there he met with the family of the 8-year-old, Daisy, as well as the family of the first child to die in the outbreak, Kayley, 6. Neither girl had been vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“My intention was to come down here quietly to console the families and to be with the community in their moment of grief,” he said &lt;a href="https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1908967854394982414" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;in his initial post on X&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Kennedy’s post did not mention nutrition, vitamin A as a treatment, or the importance of personal choice in getting the shot, as some of his earlier statements did.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He instead said he would be redeploying a team from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to Texas at the request of the state’s governor, Greg Abbott. Kennedy came to the state to learn how the Department of Health and Human Services can support the state’s efforts to contain the virus, he said, adding HHS would “follow Texas’ lead” in addressing the outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kennedy’s comments come after years of sowing doubt about the safety and effectiveness of vaccines, despite overwhelming evidence that contradicted his claims. Concerns that he would damage Americans’ health because of that history threatened to tank his Senate confirmation to the role.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In making his case before the Senate, Kennedy promised to renew trust in health agencies before becoming the top health official in the country. But he’s now facing a growing outbreak of a disease that is being fueled in part by low vaccination rates as well as the persistence of misinformation, public health experts say.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the days leading up to Kennedy’s latest post, the anti-vaccine nonprofit he led before taking charge of HHS, Children’s Health Defense, was characterizing the measles vaccine as dangerous on its website. Responses to Kennedy’s post on X included some users suggesting people shouldn’t get the shot and others arguing Kennedy’s post didn’t represent the movement he had long represented. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some health experts&lt;a href="https://x.com/JReinerMD/status/1908976909771211142" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt; praised Kennedy’s initial weekend statement&lt;/a&gt; that the measles vaccine is the most effective tool to stop the outbreak. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Others said he needed to do more as the virus continues to spread. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“He needs to state plainly … that the MMR is safe, and that unvaccinated patients should receive it,” Michelle Au, a physician and Georgia politician, &lt;a href="https://x.com/AuforGA/status/1908982130694303811" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;said in a response&lt;/a&gt; on X. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At least one Senate Republican also wants stronger messaging for everyone getting the shot.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Everyone should be vaccinated! There is no treatment for measles. No benefit to getting measles,” Sen.

are being put in potentially life-threatening situations due to missed doses of prescription &lt;a href="/topic/medicines"&gt;medicines&lt;/a&gt;, according to a new report. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Royal College of Emergency Medicine (RCEM) found &lt;a href="/business/patients-not-receiving-timely-care-in-hospital-ambulance-workers-say-b2728232.html"&gt;people in A&amp;amp;E&lt;/a&gt; were not getting their medications on time and were &lt;a href="/news/health/corridor-care-job-ad-norovirus-b2705736.html"&gt;missing doses &lt;/a&gt;needed to manage their illnesses – putting them at risk of getting worse. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="article-im-prompt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/topic/insulin"&gt;Insulin&lt;/a&gt; for diabetes, &lt;a href="/topic/parkinsons"&gt;Parkinson's&lt;/a&gt; drugs, epilepsy &lt;a href="/news/health/asthma-breathing-difficulty-hospital-b2716631.html"&gt;medicines and tablets&lt;/a&gt; for preventing blood clots are all time critical medicines (TCM). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If these drugs are delayed or missed, the patient can deteriorate and is at greater risk of complications or death. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While patients are advised to remember to bring their medications to A&amp;amp;E and to take them, there is also a responsibility on &lt;a href="/topic/nhs"&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt; staff to make sure this happens. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-ii" class="sc-looa6c-0 WWPRF"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 IoAJj sc-482ou5-3 dzDedB image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 bZqoQk"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="2" class="sc-482ou5-0 iKgUrB"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2022/02/09/13/iStock-645403776.jpg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2022/02/09/13/iStock-645403776.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2022/02/09/13/iStock-645403776.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Diabetes UK s aid delayed or missed insulin doses can be a potentially life-threatening emergency" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 cpasWE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-482ou5-1 cwDkqf edasoI" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base-light"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 iwFOdi inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-211378"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 vXhNB"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 bWFKX dpkjCF"&gt;Diabetes UK s aid delayed or missed insulin doses can be a potentially life-threatening emergency&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 Rqdgl"&gt; (Getty Images/iStockphoto)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the recognised risk of harm, the delivery of TCM is not consistent across &lt;a href="/topic/emergency-departments"&gt;emergency departments&lt;/a&gt; with long waiting times often contributing to this. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study focused on oral levodopa for Parkinson's and insulin for diabetes, as these are common in patients in A&amp;amp;E and must be given on time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers used data from 136 emergency departments in the UK which submitted data for more than 13,000 people in A&amp;amp;E who were on insulin injections or levodopa. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, which was part of the College's clinical Quality Improvement Programme (QIP) which aims to improve the care of A&amp;amp;E patients, found more than half of these patients were not identified as being on TCM within 30 minutes of their arrival in an emergency department. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, 68 per cent of doses were not administered within 30 minutes of the expected time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The findings contained in this report should serve as a call to action for both emergency medicine staff, as well as patients reliant on time critical medications, to ensure no dose is ever missed in A&amp;amp;E," said Dr Jonny Acheson, an emergency medicine consultant in Leicester who has Parkinson's, led the study. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He stressed that paramedics and emergency medicine staff need to ask patients what medications they take. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus, those with Parkinson's and insulin treated diabetes need to tell staff and take their medications with them if they visit an A&amp;amp;E. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"However, the NHS must think about how they identify people taking these types of medication and how they are able to ensure they receive their doses on time, every time while they are in the emergency department,” he added. "These medicines are critical to the quality of these patients lives and we have a duty of care to ensure that they receive them when they should." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recommendations made by the QIP team include that patients on vital medications should be identified early when they attend A&amp;amp;E, to prevent any missed doses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It added that systems need to be in place to ensure medication is given on time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Ian Higginson, RCEM president-elect, said that this a problem “we should not be having to fix” and suggested long waiting times are partly to blame. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It has risen to prominence because of the increasing number of our patients who are having to endure ridiculously long waits in our emergency departments - 12, 24, 48 hours and even longer,” he added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He stressed that missing doses of medication for Parkinson's or diabetes is not just “inconvenient” it can be “dangerous” and have “serious consequences”. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parkinson's UK praised the RCEM's work while &lt;a href="/topic/diabetes-uk"&gt;Diabetes UK&lt;/a&gt; said delayed or missed insulin doses can be a potentially life-threatening emergency. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-iii" class="sc-looa6c-0 WWPRF"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An NHS spokesperson said: "We welcome this report and will look closely at the findings, to ensure any patient in need of time critical medicine does not lose out when in A&amp;amp;E and receives the medication they need or support to self-administer as they would at home. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As the report makes clear, it is welcome to see improvements thanks to the hard work of frontline staff but more generally we know A&amp;amp;E waiting times are far too long and our upcoming urgent and emergency care plan will set out how we aim to bring these down ahead of next winter." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 23:06:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirgFBVV95cUxQUHByTXNaelFuTDFvb1d6SXhXTjlneTRtQzdXWmJzVTk5dnp2SFlObHlfbFdpb0l5SC0yVmJsaE9jOFRYS1YtRVM0TVRUanczQUh2WXhoRUM0anBDaXJkNVpfZE9JcmtlbGV2dEV2VVNhaFlKbGdMUXJ3VE1MYnRHV0poQ1NYNDg2cEZRSkhyT05mWEhFU0l2ZnctbjBaam1uQ2c4dW5OZncxRWt0R1E</guid></item><item><title>RFK Jr. visits epicenter of Texas measles outbreak after second child who was infected dies - PBS</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMixwFBVV95cUxPbUN1T20tWVF0cVFzY1hKbEdHbG9nQWVRNC1qLTBvR0dUMHhpUGg3VWNTTW9nbHFUTmhid19HdUZWTVJNNUl6MUJQcHhiSTNOLXoxdGtEZ0xxdDk1S3BQMlVNb3dBbWlRZHRCT2dLamdSN0lvUkU0aHdwbjZhTVdpTktuOHhlVHF6UzQwQy1HbEIzdkl1U2NXX0xIZHItVEpNeWhUNVF6bFZFY2l1UDdtSFJrNE0xaUlqTDJpQVhCR2xpbnlmMk00?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="body-text"&gt;
                    &lt;p&gt;U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. visited the epicenter of Texas’ still-growing measles outbreak on Sunday, the same day a funeral was held for a second young child who was not vaccinated and died from a measles-related illness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/second-child-dies-from-measles-related-causes-in-west-texas-where-cases-approach-500"&gt;READ MORE: Second child dies from measles-related causes in West Texas, where cases approach 500&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kennedy said in a social media post that he was working to “control the outbreak” and went to Gaines County to comfort the families who have buried two young children. He was seen late Sunday afternoon outside of a Mennonite church where the funeral services were held, but he did not attend a nearby news conference held by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention about the outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seminole is the &lt;a href="https://www.datawrapper.de/_/sxSwi/"&gt;epicenter of the outbreak,&lt;/a&gt; which started in late January and continues to swell — with nearly 500 cases in Texas alone, plus cases from the outbreak believed to have spread to New Mexico, Oklahoma, Kansas and Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second young child died Thursday from “what the child’s doctor described as measles pulmonary failure,” and did not have underlying health conditions, the Texas State Department of State Health Services said Sunday &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/texas-announces-second-death-measles-outbreak"&gt;in a news release&lt;/a&gt;. Aaron Davis, a spokesperson for UMC Health System in Lubbock, said that the child was “receiving treatment for complications of measles while hospitalized.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the third known measles-related death tied to this outbreak. One was another elementary school-aged child in Texas and the other was an adult in New Mexico; neither were vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s Kennedy’s first visit to the area as health secretary, where he said he met with families of both the 6- and 8-year-old children who died. He said he “developed bonds” with the &lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/mennonites-west-texans-at-center-of-measles-outbreak-choose-medical-freedom-over-vaccine-mandates"&gt;Mennonite community in West Texas&lt;/a&gt; in which the virus is mostly spreading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kennedy, an anti-vaccine advocate before ascending to the role of nation’s top health secretary earlier this year, has resisted urging widespread vaccinations as the measles outbreak has worsened under his watch. On Sunday, however, he said in a lengthy statement posted on X that it was “the most effective way to prevent the spread of measles.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The measles, mumps and rubella vaccine has been used safely for more than 60 years and is 97% effective against measles after two doses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Manisha Patel, CDC incident manager, said in a Sunday news conference that the MMR vaccine is the best way to protect against measles. She also told parents in Gaines County that it was important not to “delay care” for a child who is sick with measles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Call your doctor and make sure you’re talking to a health care professional who can guide you on those next steps,” Patel said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CDC teams arrived in early March, Patel said. But Kennedy’s social media post noted that CDC employees have been “redeployed,” and the nation’s public health agency never relayed it had pulled back. Neither the CDC nor the state health department included the death in their measles reports issued Friday, but the CDC acknowledged it when asked Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of cases in Texas shot up by 81 between March 28 and April 4, and 16 more people were hospitalized. Nationwide, the U.S. has more than double the number of measles cases it saw in all of 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Republican U.S. Sen. Bill Cassidy from Louisiana, a liver doctor whose vote helped cinch Kennedy’s confirmation, called Sunday for stronger messaging from health officials &lt;a href="https://x.com/SenBillCassidy/status/1908903799701303633"&gt;in a post on X&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Everyone should be vaccinated! There is no treatment for measles. No benefit to getting measles,” he wrote. “Top health officials should say so unequivocally b/4 another child dies.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cassidy has requested Kennedy to appear before his health committee Thursday, although Kennedy has not publicly confirmed whether he will attend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A CDC spokesperson noted the efficacy of the measles vaccine Sunday but stopped short of calling on people to get it. Departing from long-standing public health messaging around vaccination, the spokesperson called the decision a “personal one” and encouraged people to talk with their doctor. People “should be informed about the potential risks and benefits associated with vaccines,” the spokesperson added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Misinformation about how to prevent and treat measles is hindering a robust public health response, including claims about vitamin A supplements that have been pushed by Kennedy and holistic medicine supporters despite doctors’ warnings that it should be given under a physician’s orders and that too much can be dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doctors at Covenant Children’s Hospital in Lubbock, where the first measles death occurred, say they’ve treated fewer than 10 children for liver issues from vitamin A toxicity, which they found when running routine lab tests on children who are not fully vaccinated and have measles. Dr. Lara Johnson, chief medical officer, said the patients reported using vitamin A to treat and prevent the virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Peter Marks, the Food and Drug Administration’s former vaccine chief, said responsibility for the death rests with Kennedy and his staff. Marks was forced out of the FDA after disagreements with Kennedy over vaccine safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is the epitome of an absolute needless death,” Marks told The Associated Press in an interview Sunday. “These kids should get vaccinated — that’s how you prevent people from dying of measles.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marks also said he recently warned U.S. senators that more deaths would occur if the administration didn’t mount a more aggressive response to the outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experts and local health officials expect the outbreak to go on for several more months if not a year. In West Texas, the vast majority of cases are in unvaccinated people and children younger than 17.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With several states facing outbreaks of the vaccine-preventable disease — and declining childhood vaccination rates nationwide — some worry that measles may cost the U.S. its status as having eliminated the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measles is a respiratory virus that can survive in the air for up to two hours. Up to 9 out of 10 people who are susceptible will get the virus if exposed, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/hcp/index.html"&gt;according to the CDC&lt;/a&gt;. The first shot is recommended for children ages 12 to 15 months, and the second for ages 4 to 6 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Seitz reported from Washington. Photojournalist Annie Rice in Seminole, Texas, and AP reporter Matthew Perrone in Washington contributed to this report.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;There have been concerns about the side effects of ADHD medications but the new findings, coupled with other studies, suggest that the benefits of taking these medications outweigh the risks, while highlighting the need for careful monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study, &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpsy/article/PIIS2215-0366(25)00062-8/fulltext" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;The Lancet Psychiatry&lt;/i&gt;, conducted the largest and most comprehensive analysis of the cardiovascular effects of ADHD medications based on the results of randomized controlled trials—the most rigorous type of clinical study to assess medication effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professor Samuele Cortese, senior lead author of the study from the University of Southampton said, "When it comes to taking any medication, risks and benefits should always be assessed together. We found an overall small increase in blood pressure and pulse for the majority of children taking ADHD medications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Other studies show clear benefits in terms of reductions in mortality risk and improvement in academic functions, as well as a small increased risk of hypertension, but not other cardiovascular diseases. Overall, the risk-benefit ratio is reassuring for people taking ADHD medications."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is estimated that attention-deficit/&lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/hyperactivity+disorder/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;hyperactivity disorder&lt;/a&gt; (ADHD) affects around 4% of children in the UK. Of these, around 45% are treated with &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/medication/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;medication&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;The international team of investigators analyzed data from 102 randomized controlled trials, including a total of 22,702 participants with ADHD. They used an advanced statistical approach—network meta-analysis—that allowed them to compare the effects of several medications, even when the medications were not directly compared in the trials included in the analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They found that all ADHD medications were generally associated with overall small effects on blood pressure, heart rate, and ECG parameters. With the exception of guanfacine (which leads to decreased blood pressure and heart rate), other medications led to increases in the values of these parameters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No significant differences were found between stimulants (including methylphenidate and amphetamine) and non-stimulants (atomoxetine and viloxazine) with regard to their effects on blood pressure and heart rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our findings should inform future clinical guidelines, stressing the need to systematically monitor &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/blood+pressure/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;blood pressure&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/heart+rate/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;heart rate&lt;/a&gt;, both for stimulants and non-stimulants. This should be particularly relevant for practitioners who might assume that only stimulants have a negative effect on the cardiovascular system," said first author, Dr. Luis Farhat (University of São Paulo, Brazil).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers say that those with existing heart conditions should discuss the side effects of ADHD medications with a specialist cardiologist before starting treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;p&gt;Co-senior author, Professor Alexis Revet (University of Toulouse, France) added, "Our findings, based on randomized controlled trials that tend to be of short duration due to ethical issues, should be complemented by results from real-world, longer-term studies."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research team will now look to see if some groups might be more vulnerable to cardiovascular side effects than others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NIHR Research Professor Cortese concluded, "While our findings are informative at the group level, that is, on average, we cannot exclude that a subgroup of individuals may have a higher risk of more substantial cardiovascular alterations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"While it is currently not possible to identify those individuals at higher risk, efforts based on precision medicine approaches will hopefully provide important insights in the future."&lt;/p&gt;

Overall, the risk-benefit ratio is reassuring for people taking ADHD medications.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;About 3 to 4% of adults and 5% of children in the UK are believed to have ADHD, a neurodevelopmental disorder with symptoms including impulsiveness, disorganisation and difficulty focusing, according to the National Institute for &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/health" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt; and Care Excellence (Nice).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Doctors can prescribe stimulants, such as methylphenidate, of which the best-known brand is Ritalin. Other stimulant medications used to treat ADHD include lisdexamfetamine and dexamfetamine. Non-stimulant drugs include atomoxetine, an sNRI (selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor), and guanfacine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The study of children, adolescents and adults states: “There is uncertainty regarding whether medications that are used for the treatment of ADHD may lead to cardiovascular diseases, and concerns remain around their cardiovascular safety.” It found all &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/article/2024/jun/03/adhd-does-medication-work#:~:text=As%20with%20any%20drug%2C%20however,aggression%2C%20headaches%20and%20stomach%20problems." data-link-name="in body link"&gt;ADHD medications&lt;/a&gt; were associated with small increases of blood pressure and heart rate, except guanfacine, which led to decreased blood pressure and heart rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;There were no significant differences regarding the impact on blood pressure and heart rate between stimulants (including methylphenidate and amphetamine) and non-stimulants (atomoxetine and viloxazine). The researchers advised people with existing heart conditions to discuss the side effects of ADHD medications with a specialist cardiologist before starting treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Dr Ulrich Müller-Sedgwick, a consultant psychiatrist and expert on ADHD, said most clinicians prescribing ADHD medication understood the cardiovascular risks and followed Nice guidelines for monitoring blood pressure, pulse and weight. “We need more detailed guidelines for scenarios when ADHD medication needs to be adjusted or stopped,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Last year, a thinktank warned that the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/nhs" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt; was experiencing an &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/apr/04/nhs-faces-avalanche-of-demand-for-autism-and-adhd-services-thinktank-warns" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;“avalanche of need”&lt;/a&gt; over autism and ADHD, and said the system in place to cope with surging demand for assessments and treatments was “obsolete”.

The drug, known as suvorexant, targets the protein build-up that characterizes Alzheimer's, potentially slowing its progression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="4" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This discovery adds weight to the growing understanding that sleep is critical in &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/natural-dietary-supplement-proven-effective-against-alzheimers-disease/"&gt;Alzheimer's prevention&lt;/a&gt;. Poor sleep can contribute to the disease’s early development, causing harmful proteins to accumulate in the brain. Better sleep might help clear these proteins, offering hope for prevention or delay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Effect of suvorexant on unphosphorylated tau (i.e., total tau).

Trouble sleeping can serve as an early warning sign, showing up years before memory loss. Poor sleep quality raises levels of two critical proteins—amyloid-beta and tau—in the brain. These proteins build up into plaques and tangles, eventually causing neurons to die.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="6" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous research found a direct link between &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/scientists-connect-sleep-habits-to-mortality-rate-study-finds/"&gt;disrupted sleep&lt;/a&gt; and higher levels of amyloid-beta and tau. Even one night of poor sleep can cause amyloid-beta to spike, speeding its accumulation. Better sleep quality might flush out these harmful proteins, slowing Alzheimer's disease progression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="7" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet, treating sleep issues isn't as straightforward as taking any sleeping pill. Most sleep medications help people fall asleep quickly but may limit the deeper, restorative sleep phases. These phases are crucial to clearing harmful brain proteins. Thus, finding a medication that truly enhances sleep quality is essential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="suvorexant_more_than_just_a_sleep_aid_"&gt;Suvorexant: More Than Just a Sleep Aid?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="8" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a small but compelling study led by Dr. Brendan Lucey at &lt;a href="https://sleep.wustl.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Washington University School of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, scientists explored how suvorexant affects Alzheimer's-linked proteins. Suvorexant belongs to a new class of sleep medications called dual orexin receptor antagonists. Orexin is a molecule that promotes wakefulness; suvorexant blocks it, promoting deeper sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="9" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study involved 38 healthy adults, ages 45 to 65, without sleep problems or signs of cognitive impairment. Participants spent two nights at a sleep clinic, receiving either suvorexant or a placebo pill. Researchers collected cerebrospinal fluid—a clear liquid surrounding the brain—every two hours through a small tube placed in participants' lower backs. This fluid carries waste away from the brain, including amyloid-beta and tau.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="10" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remarkably, after just one dose of suvorexant, amyloid-beta levels dropped by 10% to 20%, compared to the placebo. A higher dose (20 mg, typically prescribed for insomnia) also lowered a particular form of &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/major-new-study-identifies-key-protein-driving-alzheimers-disease/"&gt;tau protein&lt;/a&gt;, phosphorylated tau, by about 10% to 15%. Phosphorylated tau is crucial because it directly forms harmful tangles that destroy brain cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Effect of suvorexant on phosphorylated tau/unphosphorylated tau ratio.

"If you can reduce tau phosphorylation, potentially there would be less tangle formation and less neuronal death."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="12" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet, the benefits were temporary. Tau protein levels returned to normal within 24 hours after taking suvorexant. However, repeated nightly doses might keep &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/groundbreaking-proteins-repair-heart-muscle-and-regenerate-organs/"&gt;harmful proteins&lt;/a&gt; at consistently lower levels. Dr. Lucey emphasized caution, though: "It would be premature for people who are worried about developing Alzheimer's to interpret it as a reason to start taking suvorexant every night."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="limitations_and_future_directions"&gt;Limitations and Future Directions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="13" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the encouraging results, researchers urge caution. This initial study was brief, involving only two nights and a small group. It did not assess the long-term impacts of taking suvorexant regularly, nor did it test older adults at higher risk for Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="14" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists still aren't certain whether lowering &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/health/new-study-finds-that-alzheimers-can-be-passed-from-one-person-to-another/"&gt;amyloid-beta&lt;/a&gt; and tau temporarily will prevent Alzheimer's altogether. Previous studies have questioned the idea that reducing these proteins is enough to stop or slow the disease. Many treatments that successfully reduce amyloid-beta have failed to improve memory or cognitive symptoms in patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="15" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, Dr. Lucey remains hopeful. He believes future studies, lasting months rather than days, might reveal more lasting effects. His team plans to test suvorexant in older adults already showing early amyloid buildup but not yet experiencing cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="16" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're not quite there yet," he admitted. "I'm hopeful that we will eventually develop drugs that take advantage of the link between sleep and Alzheimer's to prevent &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/eating-red-meat-increases-risk-of-dementia-and-cognitive-decline/"&gt;cognitive decline&lt;/a&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="4" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="should_you_consider_sleeping_pills_"&gt;Should You Consider Sleeping Pills?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="17" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;While promising, these findings don't mean everyone should reach for suvorexant to protect against Alzheimer's. Long-term use of sleeping pills can lead to dependence, reduced effectiveness, and other health risks. They might even negatively impact sleep quality over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Effect of suvorexant on amyloid-β (Aβ).

Dr. Lucey stresses the importance of improving sleep naturally, advising individuals concerned about Alzheimer’s to consult a sleep specialist rather than relying solely on medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="19" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, this research highlights the intriguing potential of sleep as a powerful preventive measure against Alzheimer's. If future studies confirm that deep, restful sleep can protect the brain from harmful proteins, sleep-based therapies could become a central approach to preventing cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="20" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Dr. Lucey puts it, better sleep "is a sensible approach to improving general brain health at any age."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="5" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="suvorexant_a_brief_history_in_time"&gt;Suvorexant: A Brief History in Time&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="21" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suvorexant, marketed as Belsomra, is the first dual orexin receptor antagonist (DORA) approved for the treatment of &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/magnetic-pulses-aimed-at-the-brain-could-treat-insomnia-study-finds/"&gt;insomnia&lt;/a&gt;. Developed by Merck &amp;amp; Co., Inc., the drug's journey began in the early 2000s, aiming to address the significant unmet need for effective insomnia treatments. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="22" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The high-throughput screening for orexin receptor antagonists commenced in 2005, leading to the discovery and subsequent approval of suvorexant by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2014. ​&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="23" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suvorexant functions by selectively inhibiting the orexin receptors OX₁ and OX₂, which play a crucial role in regulating wakefulness. By blocking these receptors, suvorexant diminishes the wake-promoting influence of orexin neuropeptides, thereby facilitating sleep. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="24" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This mechanism is distinct from traditional &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/new-research-reveals-the-surprising-global-impact-of-insomnia/"&gt;insomnia medications&lt;/a&gt; that typically enhance sleep-promoting signals via gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) pathways. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="25" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy of suvorexant in improving both sleep onset and maintenance. In pooled analyses of three-month studies, patients receiving 20/15 mg of suvorexant experienced significant enhancements in total sleep time and reductions in wake after sleep onset compared to placebo. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="26" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The treatment was generally well-tolerated, with the most common adverse effect being &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/symptoms/somnolence-drowsiness#:~:text=Somnolence%2C%20also%20known%20as%20drowsiness,of%20several%20types%20of%20medications." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;somnolence&lt;/a&gt;, which was typically mild to moderate and occurred early in the treatment course. ​&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="27" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond primary insomnia, suvorexant has shown promise in addressing sleep disturbances associated with various conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="28" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note: Always consult your doctor or other qualified healthcare provider with any questions you may have regarding a medical condition, procedure, or treatment, whether it is a prescription medication, over-the-counter drug, vitamin, supplement, or herbal alternative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr class="MuiDivider-root MuiDivider-fullWidth css-1pbb6nf" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/separator" id=""&gt;&lt;hr class="MuiDivider-root MuiDivider-fullWidth css-1pbb6nf" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/separator" id=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Brighter Side of News</author><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 22:07:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiwAFBVV95cUxOZ1FnbGx3TFZPSHlQR1VzdHcxYmpUTWpPUWQ2cmpNZ3UzcWdlTGNQWllhU1JFX1Q5QVFOcjc1TzBibEN6MjJGdUdvblFEY0JuODE4a25FcE56TE8zNGZkZGpDcHpwSlhFLUd6UXlGNjcxN3c0TFoySnNZT2cwaWtLRThqaklKOHdqNmxSMUFiTzFVbzBBU1A1SXNxMVg4U3lGb1EwNWsxd0RHRTlteS11YWFOS0dVV2VfNDVyRFZYOTA</guid></item><item><title>Rare virus that killed Gene Hackman's wife linked to three deaths in California - upi.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikwFBVV95cUxNNm1fUnFCQUFkanVkamxmbmRyYWwxYUNVQmtuRUpjQ0d1dEdYU1ItcWpaYmlKWjJpY3F4eS1IaUhyajdMSURRZVlNa2FoUFJLc2UzT1ZiaF92ZVZEdWRyazBVdEJ0ejhPUFVRTTc1VjhHNlcxZi1DV2Z1TzdvS0xIbzQ2NlFlR0lJVE5DNDQ1MTcyVVk?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article itemprop="articleBody"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="story_dl"&gt;April 6 (UPI) --&lt;/span&gt; A rare virus that killed actor &lt;a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Gene_Hackman/" target="_blank" title="Gene Hackman" class="tpstyle"&gt;Gene Hackman&lt;/a&gt;'s wife in February has been linked to the deaths of three people in California.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officials in Mono County, located between the crest of the &lt;a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Sierra_Nevada/" target="_blank" title="Sierra Nevada" class="tpstyle"&gt;Sierra Nevada&lt;/a&gt; mountains and the California-Nevada border, &lt;a href="https://monocounty.ca.gov/cao/page/third-hantavirus-related-death-confirmed-mono-county" target="_blank"&gt;announced in a news release&lt;/a&gt; Thursday that a third person had died from a hantavirus in the small town of Mammoth Lakes so far this year.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hantaviruses are a group of viruses primarily spread through rodent urine, droppings or saliva and cause fevers, muscle aches and shortness of breath, with a nearly 40% mortality rate, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hantavirus/about/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deer mice, which are common in Mono County, are common carriers of it and Mono County officials said they suspect their numbers are higher this year.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tom Boo, the public health officer for Mono County, said that it was "tragic and alarming" that three people have died from the Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome, the disease associated with the virus, in a short period of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We don't have a clear sense of where this young adult may have contracted the virus. The home had no evidence of mouse activity," Boo said.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We observed some mice in the workplace, which is not unusual for indoor spaces this time of year in Mammoth Lakes. We haven't identified any other activities in the weeks before illness that would have increased this person's exposure to mice or their droppings."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boo noted that, as far as officials know, none of the three victims had engaged in the types of activities that typically lead to exposure to a hantavirus, like cleaning out a poorly ventilated room with an abundance of mouse waste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"These folks may have been exposed during normal daily activities, either in the home or the workplace. Many of us encounter deer mice in our daily lives and there is some risk," he said. "We should pay attention to the presence of mice and be careful around their waste."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He encouraged local residents to be vigilant with preventative measures against rodent activity, including setting out snap traps and sealing any gaps in a home larger than the width of a pencil, among other measures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The news came weeks after it was revealed that Betsy Arakawa, Hackman's wife, had died at their home in New Mexico from the virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arakawa and Hackman were both found dead at their Santa Fe home in February, but Hackman tested negative for the hantavirus. His death was determined by an autopsy to have been caused by "hypertensive and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease with Alzheimer's disease as a significant contributory factor."
&lt;/p&gt;
