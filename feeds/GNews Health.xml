He had a cancer normally associated &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14703051/organs-failing-die-habit-americans-loyda-cordero-galiero.html"&gt;with heavy tobacco use.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Yet his last chest scan just two years earlier had been completely clear, leading his medical team to believe vaping may have played a role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Because the tumor had spread into the tissue surrounding his heart, surgery was ruled out. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He began chemotherapy, but the disease progressed rapidly and he died just three months after his diagnosis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;His case, published in the American Journal of Case Reports, is thought to be the first to suggest a possible link between vaping and cancer in people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Leonardo DiCaprio and Cara Delevingne are among the celebrities known to vape on occasion &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Earlier studies had only demonstrated such associations in lab animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors from AtlantiCare Regional Medical Center in Atlantic City, who treated him, wrote: 'While causality cannot be established, the case highlights a potential association between e-cigarette use and malignancy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Further research is needed to investigate the long-term effects of e-cigarettes and their possible role in lung cancer development and progression.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Although there have been a handful of prior cancer cases involving people who vape, many of those patients were older and had long histories of smoking tobacco, making it difficult to isolate the effects of vaping alone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr James Finigan, a pulmonologist who specializes in treating lung nodules and lung cancer, told the Daily Mail: 'Though the long term effects of vaping are still being studied, there is evidence that the risk of cancer is four fold higher in those who have vaped and smoked cigarettes compared to those who have only smoked cigarettes.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The New Jersey patient had quit traditional cigarettes more than a decade earlier before turning to e-cigarettes and was relatively young, with a faster-than-expected clinical decline and no response to chemotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team wrote: 'While definitive conclusions cannot be drawn, our patient's younger age, limited combustible tobacco smoking history, rapid tumor growth, lack of response to chemotherapy, and accelerated clinical decline raise the possibility of a distinct or more aggressive disease pattern. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'These differences prompt consideration of potential contributing factors, including the prolonged use of ENDS [electronic cigarettes].'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;E-cigarettes produce an aerosol by heating a liquid that usually contains nicotine, flavorings, and a mixture of toxic chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When inhaled, this vapor can deliver harmful substances deep into the lungs, including formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, and other volatile organic compounds known to cause cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These substances can damage lung tissue and over time, this damage can lead to DNA mutations and inflammation which increase the risk of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In this case, the patient's tumor occupied roughly two-thirds of his left lung by the time it was detected. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Tests revealed he had squamous cell carcinoma (SSC) — a form of cancer that accounts for roughly 20 to 30 percent of all lung cancer diagnoses in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There are around 226,000 new cases annually, the vast majority of whom are men and long-term smokers.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;SCC is often considered a 'silent killer' because it may not cause obvious symptoms in its early stages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When signs do appear, they are frequently mistaken for less serious conditions — such as allergies, bronchitis, or asthma. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If caught early, SCC has a five-year survival rate of around 50 percent. But once it spreads beyond the lungs, that figure drops to just seven percent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The New Jersey patient was initially discharged after diagnosis, with plans to begin treatment on an outpatient basis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But within two weeks, he returned to the hospital in severe pain. The tumor had grown so large it was compressing his airways and making it difficult to breathe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors inserted a stent to help open his lungs, and he was prescribed radiation and chemotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But the cancer continued to spread, and he died within two months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The authors of the report are now calling for more research into the cancer risks associated with e-cigarette use, particularly as more long-term users age into the window when cancer typically appears. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also suggest updating cancer screening criteria to include chronic vapers — especially those with more than 10 years of use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;As for adult vaping, a study in JAMA recently found Oklahoma topped the list &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Early detection in this instance might have facilitated timely intervention and improved the clinical outcome,' the doctors wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Future research should investigate whether e-cigarette use is an emerging risk factor worth considering in lung cancer screening programs.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Finigan added: 'Identifying lung cancer early, either through screening or through appropriately identifying and managing incidentally identified lung nodules, is the most effective way to reduce overall lung cancer mortality.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;An estimated 16 million American adults — about 6.5 percent of the U.S. population — currently use e-cigarettes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The highest rates are seen in young adults aged 18 to 24, with more than 15 percent in that group reporting regular use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Among children, about 1.6 million middle and high school students still vape, though usage has declined since its peak in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Tue, 17 Jun 2025 23:07:42 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiygFBVV95cUxNVUdyZW54emRHOEFZeWx6eGpfWFRMVUEzOEtfRzVvY2JZYlNESlB1eDFLajlVV1QxRlItTEdPS1o5Nng0RV9pZVJrbndlcG1YaUowaERvR1J3MmpLZVY3WlJHR2RaaU1KQUNaNjZYNXl5X2FleXoxcTN2c1hnVXdkc1UyZTk3UVluNi1BbGxlTVZZQnNQNzNrMUJnakM4Z05jcUtqWXhPRUpMZi1PZURrY1poWG1FZlE3M0NIR1FTclNOeGhaRFg4MHZR</guid></item><item><title>在青少年之前接受放疗，脑癌诊断后的化疗- Bring Me The News | Prior Lake teen to undergo radiation, chemo after brain cancer diagnosis - Bring Me The News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiswFBVV95cUxNejBmdjRBNTZYLUF6UGk5OGFXWkw4N3JUZEdVNS1SenduU0RSR194S0lnWTlDMnBTUFp5YzVUNWE3LWJ3Wk1nZnhad2szSnp3bFp4eV9KSWEtaVFMcUdCZWFuZ1hrWmtSbjBMYS1kU2dhenozekVERnRWTm95YVloRl9JTUF6dm1PY1pMWnRhM2pDdWxUd1pCMkpOeDNJMG1LQjhXX3NCZ1NnR2s3d1V1OFBTNA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Bring Me The News</author><pubDate>Tue, 17 Jun 2025 22:33:08 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiswFBVV95cUxNejBmdjRBNTZYLUF6UGk5OGFXWkw4N3JUZEdVNS1SenduU0RSR194S0lnWTlDMnBTUFp5YzVUNWE3LWJ3Wk1nZnhad2szSnp3bFp4eV9KSWEtaVFMcUdCZWFuZ1hrWmtSbjBMYS1kU2dhenozekVERnRWTm95YVloRl9JTUF6dm1PY1pMWnRhM2pDdWxUd1pCMkpOeDNJMG1LQjhXX3NCZ1NnR2s3d1V1OFBTNA</guid></item><item><title>另一项研究发现，杂草对您的心脏有害- Gizmodo | Yet Another Study Finds Weed Is Bad for Your Heart - Gizmodo</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiAFBVV95cUxNY3VTUmtrNm13aE9BOFo4dEdQYnNwTl9ROFdRc1pSUWNHNlgwMzJhVncxUGhvQ1BJdU5rTGtTRWdXOHdsNnd4bDI0dGhCWXgwb0FYMVp2Qk1WN3E4WXdEbFpGdzNPMGpIR3ZLZVJGM0dPV2NfdllMT09Lbk80SmFmQ0MzWmhLRThk?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content prose dark:prose-invert lg:prose-lg lg:leading-[29px] font-serif max-w-none"&gt;
              
              
              &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In recent years, weed use among U.S. adults has reached an all-time high. While many laud this drug as safe, natural, and even medicinal, a growing body of evidence suggests it contributes to adverse cardiovascular effects—including deadly heart disease. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A new study published in the journal &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://heart.bmj.com/lookup/doi/10.1136/heartjnl-2024-325429"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Heart&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; on Tuesday, June 17, presents new evidence showing that marijuana use doubles &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;the risk of dying from cardiovascular disease. The researchers found particularly heightened risks of stroke and acute coronary syndrome (ACS)—a sudden reduction in blood flow to the heart, such as a heart attack. While previous studies have linked cannabis to cardiovascular problems, this research underscores the severity of these risks. The authors note, however, that future studies will need to verify this link and investigate the mechanisms behind it. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The findings may come as a shock to those who consider weed a harmless high, but co-author Emilie Jouanjus, a clinical pharmacologist at the University of Toulouse in France, was not surprised. She’s been studying the adverse health effects of marijuana for more than a decade and hopes this study will promote better decision-making around marijuana use. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I think that it’s very important that people realize that there is risk, even if it’s a natural product,” Jouanjus told Gizmodo. Over the last decade, increased state legalization has &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://nida.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/2024/08/cannabis-and-hallucinogen-use-among-adults-remained-at-historic-highs-in-2023"&gt;&lt;span&gt;made&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; weed more accessible and less stigmatized, contributing to a rise in recreational and medicinal use. Jouanjus and her colleagues argue that public health messaging should treat cannabis like tobacco—not criminalizing it, but actively highlighting its risks and discouraging use.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The researchers analyzed 24 studies, conducted between January 2016 and December 2023, that investigated the link between marijuana use and serious cardiovascular outcomes. These studies involved roughly 200 million participants mostly between the ages of 19 and 59. They specifically looked at cardiovascular disease death and non-fatal outcomes including stroke and ACS.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The analysis found that cannabis use increases the risk of ACS by 29%, risk of stroke by 20%, and doubles the risk of dying from cardiovascular disease. While the researchers say their study provides an exhaustive analysis of the available data on marijuana use and cardiovascular disease, Jouanjus noted that the included studies were limited by a lack of data on when and how participants were exposed to cannabis.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This leaves several important questions unanswered, such as, at what dosage does cannabis become unsafe? Are the cardiovascular risks lower for occasional marijuana users? Is consuming edibles safer than smoking weed? Jouanjus hopes future studies will explore these questions. Some researchers have already begun, like Matt Springer, a cardiovascular researcher at the University of California San Francisco. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Springer co-authored a recent study, published in the journal &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamacardiology/article-abstract/2834540?utm_campaign=articlePDF&amp;amp;utm_medium=articlePDFlink&amp;amp;utm_source=articlePDF&amp;amp;utm_content=jamacardio.2025.1399"&gt;&lt;span&gt;JAMA Cardiology&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; in May, that found &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/smoking-weed-and-eating-edibles-share-this-surprising-health-risk-2000611136"&gt;&lt;span&gt;both smoking weed and eating edibles increase risk of cardiovascular disease&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. The finding challenges widespread assumptions that edibles are a less-harmful way to consume marijuana and underscores the drug’s alarming cardiovascular effects. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Like Jouanjus, Springer wasn’t surprised by the link between cannabis use and cardiovascular disease death. “This is &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;consistent with several reports in the last few years showing associations between cannabis use and various kinds of cardiovascular outcomes, as well as another recent meta-analysis &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.acc.org/About-ACC/Press-Releases/2025/03/17/15/35/Cannabis-Users-Face-Substantially-Higher-Risk"&gt;&lt;span&gt;reported&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; at the [American College of Cardiology] conference in March,” he told Gizmodo in an email. That study found that cannabis users face significantly higher risk of heart attack than non-users. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Springer’s latest study found that cannabis users showed reduced blood vessel dilation, which puts them at greater risk of heart attack and other poor cardiovascular outcomes. In theory, this could contribute to the increased risk of cardiovascular disease death that Jouanjus and her colleagues found, he said, but researchers need more evidence to support that claim.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;There are other potential mechanisms, too. Jouanjus pointed to previous research that &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6461323/"&gt;&lt;span&gt;found&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; that, like tobacco, cannabis contributes to buildup of plaque within artery walls. This increases the risk of heart attack, stroke, and peripheral artery disease. She also highlighted that the psychoactive compound in marijuana—tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)—is far more concentrated in cannabis products today than those from 20 years ago. This, too, may contribute to the increased risk of cardiovascular death she observed in her study.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;While all of these factors could plausibly influence weed’s cardiovascular effects, getting to the bottom of why this drug damages heart health will require more research. In the meantime, Jouanjus feels there is enough evidence to warrant caution and moderation when using marijuana. The public is well aware of the benefits of cannabis, but she hopes her study can draw attention to its risks, too.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Springer agrees, “These reports over the last few years, including ours and this paper, indicate that cannabis is not necessarily harmless,” he said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

And in those studies where sex was recorded, cannabis users tended to be mostly male and younger than non-users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The analysis revealed heightened risks for cannabis use: 29% higher for acute coronary syndrome; 20% higher for stroke; and a doubling in the risk of dying from cardiovascular disease.

There was a moderate to high risk of bias in most of the included studies, largely because of lack of information on missing data and imprecise measures of cannabis exposure.

Cannabis is now generally more potent and has diversified into a wide array of inhaled high potency cannabis concentrates, synthetic psychoactive cannabinoids, and edibles, they added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;They wrote: “How these changes affect cardiovascular risk requires clarification, as does the proportion of risk attributable to cannabinoids themselves versus particulate matter, terpenes or other components of the exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Cannabis needs to be incorporated into the framework for prevention of clinical cardiovascular disease. So too must cardiovascular disease prevention be incorporated into the regulation of cannabis markets. Effective product warnings and education on risks must be developed, required, and implemented.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Cardiovascular and other health risks must be considered in the regulation of allowable product and marketing design as the evidence base grows. Today that regulation is focused on establishing the legal market with woeful neglect of minimising health risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Specifically, cannabis should be treated like tobacco: not criminalised, but discouraged, with protection of bystanders from secondhand exposure.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Tue, 17 Jun 2025 22:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirgFBVV95cUxNekpyU2FySUYwS2kxX2k1MDV2ajU5YmRLc0ZjN0Z2b2tmdUl3M1hyN2Iwcm9VaTdHMlplbnRzc2RtT21XcHBXbW9MbmRHTW9CQllaeGJsWlpaZVRTcnFtR2Jrc1VGNnR5bS0wNHFWSjlFRzlNekw5SWgzQWV5dnRjLXhQSENfbUZ5VEJOVnN6TkljckNPVTdzQ2p6SUlNRXFGMW1yQV9vZjV5aTkxeHc</guid></item><item><title>事实证明，大麻提取物在杀死世界上最危险的动物方面非常有效- Earth.com | Cannabis extract proves to be highly effective at killing the most dangerous animals in the world - Earth.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimgFBVV95cUxNcUVKQTh4OTlQNG1VVWFqV3pZYkFDNnp6SE1uZmhMV2dGNUJBam9uOWpBYURJOFhrN3V6di0tSks1YUJvb2tJTU5vcVV0cktjUUgzd1B2RXhHSnFwa2lrbklXNjB3Nk5wSEZvYUprcVdqZzhCOVJWUE1YMVktMVRLYkg3eUpXeEhrdUtGNFcxTkNJTjlKN0RsSzR3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page_content__AwOj6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every year, mosquito-borne diseases cut short more than a million lives across the globe, outpacing every other animal threat to humanity. The rising toll has public-health teams scrambling for fresh combat tools, especially as traditional chemical sprays lose their edge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That loss stems from two hard truths. First, the very &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7692614/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;pyrethroid insecticides&lt;/a&gt; that once worked wonders now linger in soil and water, nudging delicate ecosystems off balance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, mosquitoes adapt fast. Larvae soaking in tainted puddles and adults drifting through treated neighborhoods increasingly shrug off doses that once killed them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/mosquito-repellents-that-actually-work-yes-thanks-to-ai-machine-learning/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Controlling the pests&lt;/a&gt; at their waterborne stage is vital, yet options that stay potent without harming everything else remain limited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-cannabis-cbd-and-mosquitoes"&gt;Cannabis, CBD, and mosquitoes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recent research published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Insects&lt;/em&gt; points to a solution hiding in plain sight: the hemp plant, &lt;em&gt;Cannabis sativa&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After air-drying and grinding ordinary hemp leaves, scientists at &lt;a href="https://www.osu.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;The Ohio State University&lt;/a&gt; led by Erick Martinez Rodriguez extracted &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/cbd-reduces-the-unwanted-side-effects-of-thc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;cannabidiol (CBD)&lt;/a&gt; and added the concentrate to cups of water teeming with yellow fever mosquito larvae. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within 48 hours, both a strain that laughs at &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/rising-temperatures-could-make-insect-repellents-less-effective/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;common insecticides&lt;/a&gt; and a non-resistant strain were wiped out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Mosquitoes are one of the deadliest animals in the world, mainly because as adults they serve as vectors of disease,” Rodriguez explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-from-resistance-to-vulnerability"&gt;From resistance to vulnerability&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two important findings jumped out. The first was total mortality: every mosquito larva exposed to sufficient CBD died by the two-day mark, regardless of &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/scientists-learn-how-mosquitoes-use-sound-to-outsmart-and-evade-human-defenses/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;its genetic armor&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second was efficiency. While industrial chemicals often push resistance higher with every generation, CBD’s effect cut straight through those defenses. Doses varied, but even modest concentrations proved lethal to all mosquito larvae.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you compare the amount of hemp extract needed to kill 50 % of the population to other synthetic conventional insecticides, it is on the high side, but when you compare it side by side to other natural extracts we have tested in our lab, only a relatively low amount is required to produce high mortality values in larvae,” said Martinez Rodriguez.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-cbd-kills-mosquitoes"&gt;How CBD kills mosquitoes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chemical sleuthing showed that CBD dominated the hemp extract, and terpene fractions did little damage on their own. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Larvae were judged dead once they stopped moving under a gentle nudge, confirming the cannabinoid’s direct impact on vital systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Insects lack the endocannabinoid receptors that give &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/cbd-can-help-ease-chronic-pain-anxiety-and-mood-disorders/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;CBD its wellness reputation&lt;/a&gt; among humans, so the compound must strike different molecular targets – possibly ion channels that govern nerve impulses or enzymes tied to muscle control. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whatever the route, CBD skirts the metabolic tricks that shield many larvae from pyrethroids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-hemp-economics-meet-public-health"&gt;Hemp economics meet public health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hemp is no niche crop. U.S. farmers planted about 27,680 acres in 2023, and the total value of &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/hemp-seeds-could-be-a-game-changer-as-an-alternative-protein-source/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;hemp products&lt;/a&gt; topped $291 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leaves, often left as low-value waste after flowers and seeds are harvested, could become raw material for larvicides. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turning those leaf cast-offs into mosquito-control pellets would give growers an extra revenue stream while trimming refuse piles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The crop’s adaptability sweetens the deal. Hemp thrives across a wide climate range, grows quickly, and rarely needs harsh pesticides of its own. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rural communities looking to diversify incomes and urban growers cultivating indoor micro-hemp could both feed a supply chain aimed at vector-control programs from Texas to Tanzania.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-strains-and-waterway-safety"&gt;Strains and waterway safety&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Field trials must still answer hard questions: How long does CBD linger in ponds? Does it bother tadpoles, fish fry, or helpful insects? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early lab work hints at selectivity, yet natural habitats are complex. Regulators will demand data showing that CBD pellets, briquettes, or slow-release films silence mosquito larvae without tipping aquatic ecosystems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A second layer of testing will match different hemp strains for efficacy. Plants bred for fiber deliver more stalk than cannabinoid, while floral varieties boast &lt;a href="https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Cannabidiol" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;richer CBD profiles&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Selecting cultivars that maximize larvicidal punch and minimize unwanted compounds will keep costs down and environmental margins wide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-next-steps-for-cbd-and-mosquito-control"&gt;Next steps for CBD and mosquito control&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists plan to refine dosage, explore formulations that stick to the water’s surface, and probe how CBD interacts with other biocontrol measures like &lt;em&gt;Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis&lt;/em&gt;. Combining modes of action could slow resistance even further. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teams will also map out manufacturing pipelines – picture hemp-leaf extract concentrated at regional facilities, then shipped as shelf-stable granules to &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/why-some-people-are-mosquito-magnets/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;mosquito-control districts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Policy makers, meanwhile, need clear guidelines. Approving a botanical larvicide means balancing urgent disease threats against conservation goals. Transparent monitoring and community engagement will help keep public trust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-another-weapon-in-the-mosquito-wars"&gt;Another weapon in the mosquito wars&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hemp-derived CBD will not single-handedly end malaria, dengue, or Zika. Yet the discovery that a familiar wellness compound doubles as a larval assassin widens the playbook. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By uniting agriculture, chemistry, and entomology, researchers have opened &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/mosquito-habitats-are-expanding-due-to-climate-change/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;a practical path&lt;/a&gt; toward safer mosquito control. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If larger-scale tests confirm the promise seen in the lab, those humble hemp leaves could soon guard countless backyard birdbaths, drainage ditches, and rice paddies – one cup of water at a time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full study was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4450/15/7/517" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Insects&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 17 Jun 2025 21:55:35 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimgFBVV95cUxNcUVKQTh4OTlQNG1VVWFqV3pZYkFDNnp6SE1uZmhMV2dGNUJBam9uOWpBYURJOFhrN3V6di0tSks1YUJvb2tJTU5vcVV0cktjUUgzd1B2RXhHSnFwa2lrbklXNjB3Nk5wSEZvYUprcVdqZzhCOVJWUE1YMVktMVRLYkg3eUpXeEhrdUtGNFcxTkNJTjlKN0RsSzR3</guid></item><item><title>小型研究表明，仅1剂神奇蘑菇化合物可缓解大多数患者的抑郁症至少5年- Live Science | Just 1 dose of magic mushroom compound eases depression for at least 5 years in most patients, small study suggests - Live Science</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirwFBVV95cUxPNWtrZ0pXdjZoam5TaHNJbkFEMUw1M1hZNER3bXhHUjdReE1UR1BBLWlBYTlfTmVld2ZPRDd4Szlfem5HQWg1dVFlUTBqc1VSSmhkLWpReGZ3WDFXMVhXUVVhVXJIanRkZzkteklMejhTalV1U2tMTHVsSG5kLWprekZpMGFScWt4NkhnamJjQ2dFNVJ4dzBlUm9VQUdiNm9pS2k2Q2VMSXR5Zk15NDEw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div x-show="$store.ViafouraAuthModal.open" x-transition:enter="ease-out duration-300" x-transition:enter-start="opacity-0 translate-y-4 sm:translate-y-0 sm:scale-95" x-transition:enter-end="opacity-100 translate-y-0 sm:scale-100" x-transition:leave="ease-in duration-200" x-transition:leave-start="opacity-100 translate-y-0 sm:scale-100" x-transition:leave-end="opacity-0 translate-y-4 sm:translate-y-0 sm:scale-95" class="relative transform overflow-hidden bg-white px-4 pb-4 pt-5 text-left shadow-xl transition-all sm:my-8 w-full sm:max-w-sm sm:p-6" x-on:click.away="$store.ViafouraAuthModal.closeModal()" x-on:transitionend="$store.ViafouraAuthModal.modalFullyClosed()"&gt;

The alarming projection is that by 2040, the number could skyrocket to 1.4 million, placing immense strain on families, the NHS, and care services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The financial toll of dementia on Britain was a colossal £42 billion in 2024, and forecasts suggest this cost could more than double to £90 billion in the next 15 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mantis-recommender-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text-description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In response to this growing crisis, campaigners are urgently calling for investments in early detection tools, which promise inexpensive and swift screening—providing physicians with a vital advantage in combating the onset of severe symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dementia claimed 74,261 lives last year, an increase from 69,178 in 2021, confirming its status as the UK's leading cause of death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With fatalities from Alzheimer's on the rise, there's a glimmer of hope among scientists that pinpointing the disease's silent phase might just be the game-changing discovery we've been waiting for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Express US</author><pubDate>Tue, 17 Jun 2025 20:14:42 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMif0FVX3lxTE81Y2xiakVjV3MxZ2NRdkFGSFMtTmd0dXlnQmpxdWxuV21iLWdlVGZwYm9EQ1IyQ2xuM0NiSUhHbnFGNDV1VUNseDNtcXVpNFBOZmM4OXhRendtejJIZlpVTnN3anRMQzh2OXBSR2VyV19UTDVmYlZmYTA5aWhrcEXSAYQBQVVfeXFMTzhXZUJpVDRNelVUWVZVMFF6aDRUUmppNHl2TE9KR0ZBOVdBZjlaNFh4RXlIc2J4bDg5STB4cmZTY0gwOFZncVNjV25HMldDT0NRWnJtVEg4VWYtV250TnVFVGtvOExSZ2VoUHVIQjVGOFhrNDdINXlRLUNkVGJfQWd0Z204</guid></item><item><title>最新的Covid变种现在超过三分之一的美国病例- Gizmodo | Latest Covid Variant Now Driving Over a Third of U.S. Cases - Gizmodo</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilwFBVV95cUxOS3p3dTFfaGRVSmxUeUpoT1BxZTJKS0hXV0VjNm9TNDJrZ1JWaEh2ZDJ5aldkaTVJT3JRWmNpVi1HOXVlRlUzbV9Ub1BUN0xVS2Y2bzBKTXdfMl9oaHVDNV9tVmZWUU0wY3o0anB0anl6X3Y1dVRZU2tHX3NtbElzQ0JYSi1EMFQtNkh6Ujc5bmg5S3AwWHpR?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content prose dark:prose-invert lg:prose-lg lg:leading-[29px] font-serif max-w-none"&gt;
              
              
              &lt;p&gt;The newest concerning variant of covid-19 is rapidly advancing across the U.S. Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows that NB.1.8.1 has started to supplant other circulating strains of the coronavirus.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the CDC’s latest &lt;a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#variant-proportions"&gt;Nowcast&lt;/a&gt;, covering the last two weeks through June 7, NB.1.8.1 is likely causing 37% of all covid-19 cases in the U.S., just barely behind the current dominant variant, LP.8.1 (38%). It’s an estimate, but the CDC’s numbers indicate a large surge in NB.1.8.1 cases since last month, when officials first detected it in the country. Though not certain, it’s possible that NB.1.8.1 could drive a renewed peak of covid-19 this summer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The World Health Organization first recognized NB.1.8.1 as a variant worth monitoring in mid-May, though it was initially detected in late January. Since then, it’s become an increasing threat. As of early June, about a quarter of all global cases are thought to be NB.1.8.1, according to &lt;a href="https://data.who.int/dashboards/covid19/circulation?n=c"&gt;WHO data&lt;/a&gt;. Covid-19 activity in general has also been &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2025-DON572"&gt;rising&lt;/a&gt; in some regions of the world, and NB.1.8.1 has been &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/us-reports-cases-new-covid-variant-nb-1-8-1-behind-surge-china/"&gt;linked&lt;/a&gt; to recent surges of cases and hospitalizations in parts of Asia, including China.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So far in the U.S., however, the situation doesn’t seem to be dramatically worsening. The covid-19 test positivity rate as of &lt;a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#maps_percent-covid-deaths"&gt;late week&lt;/a&gt; is 3%, just a tick above the previous week. Hospitalizations and deaths related to covid-19 have also &lt;a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#maps_positivity-week"&gt;remained&lt;/a&gt; steady and low. And NB.1.8.1 doesn’t seem to cause more severe illness on average than other circulating variants. Today’s variants still belong to the Omicron lineage of the virus, meaning they haven’t substantially changed on a genetic level and updated vaccine boosters are still expected to be effective against NB.1.8.1.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;At the same time, NB.1.8.1 may be just different enough from other strains that it can become the dominant variant moving forward; some early evidence suggests NB.1.8.1 possesses mutations that could increase its transmissibility. This past winter was also unusually quiet for covid-19, with low circulation in the U.S. and elsewhere, but that may set the stage for a larger peak this summer, experts have warned.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We do not anticipate the NB.1.8.1 variant to pose a greater public health risk than other Omicron-descendant variants, nor do we expect a significant impact on vaccine effectiveness against severe disease,” said Edoardo Colzani, head of the Respiratory Viruses unit at the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control, in a &lt;a href="https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/slow-increases-covid-19-observed-across-eueea-new-variant-emerges"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; released over the weekend. “However, following a winter with low SARS-CoV-2 circulation, population immunity against SARS-CoV-2 may have partly waned—particularly among older adults and other individuals who are at higher risk of severe disease—potentially increasing vulnerability as virus activity rises.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thanks to vaccination and population immunity, the danger of covid-19 has greatly lowered over time. But this summer could certainly provide an unwelcome reminder of the misery that it can cause.&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

The researchers found that college students who reported high levels of pornography use showed altered patterns of brain connectivity while viewing explicit material, heightened physiological and emotional responses, and performed worse on a cognitive control task compared to those who used pornography less frequently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was designed to investigate how repeated exposure to internet pornography might influence brain function and behavior in ways that resemble patterns observed in substance use. While many researchers have speculated that problematic pornography use shares similarities with addiction, the specific neural mechanisms have not been fully understood. This research aimed to bridge that gap using a non-invasive neuroimaging technique called functional near-infrared spectroscopy, or fNIRS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;fNIRS measures brain activity by tracking changes in blood oxygen levels. It works by shining near-infrared light into the scalp and detecting how much light is absorbed by oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin in the brain. These changes reflect neural activity, allowing researchers to monitor how different brain regions function during tasks or stimuli, such as watching videos or solving problems. Unlike MRI, fNIRS is portable, quiet, and allows for more natural behavior during testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sixteen healthy college students who reported low-frequency pornography use and five students who met criteria for problematic pornography use were recruited to participate. All participants were right-handed, heterosexual, and free of any substance use, color blindness, or medical illness. To minimize potential confounds, participants were also instructed to abstain from masturbation during the experimental period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The experiment involved a sequence of steps. First, participants completed the Stroop Color and Word Test—a common measure of cognitive control and reaction time. Then, they watched a 10-minute internet pornographic video selected for its high view count. During this time, researchers used fNIRS to monitor changes in brain blood flow and connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Physiological measures, including heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation, were recorded alongside facial expressions using automated software. After watching the video, participants completed the Stroop test again and filled out three psychological questionnaires measuring pornography use, anxiety, and depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results showed notable differences between the two groups. The low-frequency users showed stronger functional connectivity in brain areas related to language processing, movement coordination, and sensory processing, such as Broca’s area, the premotor cortex, and the somatosensory cortex. In contrast, the high-frequency users exhibited greater connectivity in regions tied to executive functions, including the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and frontopolar areas—regions often implicated in both addiction and emotional regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants in the high-frequency group also demonstrated stronger signs of physiological and emotional arousal. Their facial expressions indicated higher levels of pleasure and happiness, but also greater emotional fluctuation, including signs of anger and sadness. Their parasympathetic nervous system activity was elevated during the video, as reflected in measures like lower heart rate and increased heart rate variability. These changes are similar to patterns seen in individuals using opioid drugs, which are known to produce feelings of euphoria, calm, and blunted awareness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After watching the pornography, cognitive performance declined in both groups—but the drop was steeper in the high-frequency group. Their accuracy on the Stroop test dropped more sharply, and their reaction times were slower compared to both their own baseline and the low-frequency group. This suggests that pornography exposure may have disrupted their ability to regulate attention and manage conflicting information, at least in the short term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to these cognitive effects, the high-frequency group scored significantly higher on questionnaires measuring anxiety and depression. While the study cannot determine whether pornography use causes these symptoms or whether they co-occur for other reasons, the findings echo previous research linking heavy pornography consumption to emotional distress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers highlighted that certain patterns of brain activity observed in the high-frequency group resemble those seen in individuals with substance use disorders and even schizophrenia. Specifically, the increased connectivity in prefrontal areas, combined with altered physiological states and impaired cognitive performance, suggest that frequent pornography consumption may lead to neural and behavioral patterns that mimic other forms of addiction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also explored how watching pornography affected emotional expression. The low-frequency group showed more diverse and reactive expressions—including surprise, fear, and disgust—while the high-frequency group appeared more emotionally flat, with more vacant or neutral expressions. This finding supports the idea that repeated exposure to explicit content may blunt emotional responsiveness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors note that while psychotherapy remains the most common treatment for problematic pornography use, other interventions have been proposed, including hormone-based medications and drugs typically used to treat obsessive-compulsive behavior. Their findings raise the possibility that treatments developed for substance addiction might also be relevant in managing internet pornography addiction, although this remains a topic of debate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As with all research, there are some limitations that should be taken into account. The sample size was small, especially in the high-frequency group, which included only five individuals. This limitation may reduce the generalizability of the findings and increases the possibility of random error. Additionally, some of the observed differences in brain connectivity did not remain statistically significant after correcting for false discovery rate, a procedure used to account for the large number of comparisons made in brain imaging studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another challenge was recruitment. Due to ethical and practical constraints, it was difficult to find participants with very high levels of pornography consumption who were willing to take part in a laboratory-based experiment. As a result, even the high-frequency group in this study may represent relatively moderate users compared to populations in broader surveys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The effects of internet pornography addiction on brain functional connectivity in the prefrontal lobe exhibit characteristics similar to those of drug addiction,” the researchers concluded. “Moreover, individuals who frequently consume internet pornography report that they experience stronger sexual arousal and heightened pleasure while viewing, which subsequently adversely affects their cognition and emotions. Further research is needed to follow up on these preliminary findings.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fnhum.2025.1477914" target="_blank"&gt;The impact of internet pornography addiction on brain function: a functional near-infrared spectroscopy study&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Qicheng Shu, Shiyu Tang, Zhenhua Wu, Jiahuan Feng, Wenhao Lv, and Min Huang.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Tue, 17 Jun 2025 18:14:01 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMivgFBVV95cUxNdDRVU1FBY3g3Q1RuYnk3UklhSVhvVm43UEpFbGIxaUdTTDc5WWhoTFM2YmJ5VERwTGYxSm1VQ0c1ZkpVdlI4MDhLMExfNEl5NXpSN1RRY1lWTHozekx4M2o1R2hRZkY2RWM5VExSbm8xOWFKc3dYV2QzRjZMNWd2bnpGNjlMWm5sRWZpbXB0VU93RXktSmtkM3FQSEM4VXVRUmYyWGthWjNqazMtWjNlck1xcmJpYjNCeTF5UkVR</guid></item><item><title>有争议的饮料，在减肥方面可能比水更好-每日邮报 | The controversial drink that may be better than water for weight loss - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMisAFBVV95cUxOaFJma1U3M2lTNGMtd09ncXNLQzhfdVVpRTdDTHlDS3JRZWt4WkY2Q0JvelJYT0ZSb2dFYUg4QlI5MjFjN0t3TUF1NXc0Y2pNaG1RMGxsZXpCSEluVHVfaEVkOUJiVF80V3BzMmFGY1lHYnFWUndqOFNlRWRFbkMxOG95alVEM2RjUnkyLUJUXy1mVGZid1FIaU4zOG9uUGRxRWRYZThLOTN6YTNOblNPNNIBtgFBVV95cUxPajZkQy1iMzU2U2d3QnlvV3ZGMWRkMGFSUzdaVzRFcEcxUG9WMjFRcHQ0XzZtbFpuYWVRcTIxYU9jWF9CdEh5ckNzQk9Eb21BQU1WTlBDcUZDdk1lZUEyeG5tR2lMaGVHSkhoVmtZNDNzZHE5SWhVS3dEbXdDUURnYkhTdFhiaVBIcmJYM0xHa2lzMXEtV0l2Nkw5WnhORzJqUU9EbklGbGtVTjRUdzNQRVVYRDRtZw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Popular diet sodas beloved by &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/donald_trump/index.html" id="mol-5792e6d0-4b99-11f0-b20e-293d84c8345c"&gt;Donald Trump&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a target="_self" href="/tvshowbiz/taylor_swift/index.html" id="mol-57a92df0-4b99-11f0-b20e-293d84c8345c" class=""&gt;Taylor Swift&lt;/a&gt; are better for you than water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Well, at least when it comes to losing weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Recently, videos have circulated on &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/tiktok/index.html" id="mol-0bff59e0-4ba0-11f0-b20e-293d84c8345c"&gt;TikTok&lt;/a&gt; claiming the hidden sweetener-infused soda benefit — citing year-long studies that found participants drinking two cans of diet soda a day lost twice as much weight as those drinking water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But now nutritionists say there may be some method to the madness, by stating that that anything that can help someone reduce their calorie intake can help with &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/weight_loss/index.html" id="mol-6f432830-4ba3-11f0-ab60-0d2cbedb70ba"&gt;weight loss&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This may include diet beverages, they said, which could help someone satisfy sugar cravings — reducing snacking on other calorific snacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But they warn the drinks likely will not lead to long-term weight loss because they do not solve sugar cravings, which can lead someone to re-gain weight after a diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Marion Nestle, a top nutritionist at NYU Langone, told the Daily Mail: 'Weight gain is the result of eating more calories than are expended in metabolism and physical activity. Anything that reduce calorie intake, from any source, should help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Neither water nor diet sodas have calories, but diet sodas have chemical sweeteners that might encourage eating more food.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She added: 'Studies on the effects of diet soda are mixed. Water, by definition, is neutral.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Taylor Swift is known to be a fan of Diet Coke, and was pictured in advertisements for the drink in 2013&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The speculation on diet sodas vs water for weight loss was sparked by a resurfaced 2015 study that suggested sweetener-infused beverages may boost weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the paper 303 overweight or obese adults — mostly women in their 40s — were split into two groups and asked to follow a particular diet for a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One group was asked to drink two cans of diet soda every day, and given coupons for Coca Cola products — including Diet Coke — as well as for Diet Pepsi and Diet Dr Pepper among others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While the others were asked to consume the equivalent amount of water every day over the same period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Participants were also allowed to consume sugar-sweetened beverages and those in the water group could have diet soda too, but had to consume their daily water as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;All participants were put through a weight loss program — involving exercise and diet guidance — for 12 weeks and were then monitored for 40 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At the end of the study, those who were drinking water had lost 5.4lbs overall but those drinking diet sodas had lost 13.7lbs — or double the weight. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers said the difference could be down to the sweetened drinks helping reduce cravings for something sweet, helping participants to reduce consumption of sugary foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But the study had several drawbacks, including that participants were only tracked for a year and it only included people who were already regular diet soda drinkers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nearly a decade later, the &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41366-023-01393-3"&gt;study was repeated&lt;/a&gt; — by another group of researchers at Liverpool University, in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Like the first, it found those drinking the diet sodas lost 16.5lbs, or about 23 percent more, than those drinking water, who lost 16.5lbs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Donald Trump is also a fan, and reported to have up to 12 cans of Diet Coke a day. He is pictured above in May this year&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But unlike the first study, the results were not significant — meaning another factor had a role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers had included people who regularly drank diet sodas, but also about one in four participants who did not regularly consume them prior to the trial — a key difference to the previous research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts suggest this could mean that more people on the water diet did not have strong sweet-food cravings, leading them to consume less food overall.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Hector Perez, a bariatric surgeon in Mexico at &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://renewbariatrics.com/"&gt;Renew Bariatrics&lt;/a&gt;, said the studies reflected largely what he saw in his clinic — that diet sodas can help people lose weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He told DailyMail.com: 'Research showing that people using artificially sweetened beverages actually lost more weight than those drinking water surprises people, but it lines up with what I see in practice. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'For some patients, that familiar sweet taste keeps them compliant. They’re less likely to binge later, less likely to feel deprived, and more likely to stick to the plan. It’s not about the Diet Coke doing something magical, it’s about it preventing something destructive.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But he warned it wasn't a magic formula, adding some people who lean on it too heavily become hooked — which can disrupt their long term weight loss progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Caroline Susie, a dietitian and spokeswoman at the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, said that water is still the 'gold standard' for hydration and weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But she added that, 'When low- or no-calorie sweetened beverages replace higher-calorie drinks, they can help reduce overall energy intake, which supports weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'For people who are trying to reduce sugar but still want flavor, sweetener-infused beverages may help them stay on track and avoid higher-calorie alternatives.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The jury is still very much out on whether diet sodas could help someone to lose weight (stock)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Diet sodas have been the focus of mountains of research on whether they can help to boost weight loss, although concrete evidence to back this up has been scant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Instead, researchers have raised concerns over the sweeteners used within them — like aspartame, used in Diet Coke, which has been labeled a &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-12245725/WHOs-cancer-research-agency-say-aspartame-sweetener-possible-carcinogen-sources.html"&gt;possible carcinogen&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While studies have also&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14805961/Diet-soda-shockingly-linked-devastating-disease-kills-100-000-Americans-year.html"&gt; warned that consuming &lt;/a&gt;the sodas regularly can raise someones risk of type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They say this is because the sweetener used, saccharin, can interfere with how the body interprets insulin — raising the risk of complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The science is still very much unclear on whether diet sodas could help someone lose weight more quickly than if they drunk water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The World Health Organization has indicated that much of the data in this area is poor, with trials typically only lasting three months or less.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some reviews of studies have warned that consuming too much diet soda can have long-term negative health effects, including impaired glucose metabolism and increased risk of comorbidities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And others have found little impact on weight loss from consuming diet soda instead of water — including a &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35285920/"&gt;2022 meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt; of 17 studies which found sweetener-infused beverages offered only a 'small improvement' in body weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Avery Zenker, a registered dietitian for MyHealthTeam in Canada, said: 'Choosing diet soda instead of water could reinforce a preference for sweet flavors, which may affect appetite regulation or lead to seeking out other sweet foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'In contrast, water tends to promote a more neutral palate and a natural connection with thirst and hunger cues.

Anything that reduce calorie intake, from any source, should help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Neither water nor diet sodas have calories, but diet sodas have chemical sweeteners that might encourage eating more food.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She added: 'Studies on the effects of diet soda are mixed. Water, by definition, is neutral.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Taylor Swift is known to be a fan of Diet Coke, and was pictured in advertisements for the drink in 2013&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The speculation on diet sodas vs water for weight loss was sparked by a resurfaced 2015 study that suggested sweetener-infused beverages may boost weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the paper 303 overweight or obese adults — mostly women in their 40s — were split into two groups and asked to follow a particular diet for a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One group was asked to drink two cans of diet soda every day, and given coupons for Coca Cola products — including Diet Coke — as well as for Diet Pepsi and Diet Dr Pepper among others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While the others were asked to consume the equivalent amount of water every day over the same period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Participants were also allowed to consume sugar-sweetened beverages and those in the water group could have diet soda too, but had to consume their daily water as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;All participants were put through a weight loss program — involving exercise and diet guidance — for 12 weeks and were then monitored for 40 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At the end of the study, those who were drinking water had lost 5.4lbs overall but those drinking diet sodas had lost 13.7lbs — or double the weight. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers said the difference could be down to the sweetened drinks helping reduce cravings for something sweet, helping participants to reduce consumption of sugary foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But the study had several drawbacks, including that participants were only tracked for a year and it only included people who were already regular diet soda drinkers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nearly a decade later, the &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41366-023-01393-3"&gt;study was repeated&lt;/a&gt; — by another group of researchers at Liverpool University, in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Like the first, it found those drinking the diet sodas lost 16.5lbs, or about 23 percent more, than those drinking water, who lost 16.5lbs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Donald Trump is also a fan, and reported to have up to 12 cans of Diet Coke a day. He is pictured above in May this year&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But unlike the first study, the results were not significant — meaning another factor had a role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers had included people who regularly drank diet sodas, but also about one in four participants who did not regularly consume them prior to the trial — a key difference to the previous research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts suggest this could mean that more people on the water diet did not have strong sweet-food cravings, leading them to consume less food overall.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Hector Perez, a bariatric surgeon in Mexico at &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://renewbariatrics.com/"&gt;Renew Bariatrics&lt;/a&gt;, said the studies reflected largely what he saw in his clinic — that diet sodas can help people lose weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He told DailyMail.com: 'Research showing that people using artificially sweetened beverages actually lost more weight than those drinking water surprises people, but it lines up with what I see in practice. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'For some patients, that familiar sweet taste keeps them compliant. They’re less likely to binge later, less likely to feel deprived, and more likely to stick to the plan. It’s not about the Diet Coke doing something magical, it’s about it preventing something destructive.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But he warned it wasn't a magic formula, adding some people who lean on it too heavily become hooked — which can disrupt their long term weight loss progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Caroline Susie, a dietitian and spokeswoman at the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, said that water is still the 'gold standard' for hydration and weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But she added that, 'When low- or no-calorie sweetened beverages replace higher-calorie drinks, they can help reduce overall energy intake, which supports weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'For people who are trying to reduce sugar but still want flavor, sweetener-infused beverages may help them stay on track and avoid higher-calorie alternatives.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The jury is still very much out on whether diet sodas could help someone to lose weight (stock)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Diet sodas have been the focus of mountains of research on whether they can help to boost weight loss, although concrete evidence to back this up has been scant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Instead, researchers have raised concerns over the sweeteners used within them — like aspartame, used in Diet Coke, which has been labeled a &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-12245725/WHOs-cancer-research-agency-say-aspartame-sweetener-possible-carcinogen-sources.html"&gt;possible carcinogen&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While studies have also&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14805961/Diet-soda-shockingly-linked-devastating-disease-kills-100-000-Americans-year.html"&gt; warned that consuming &lt;/a&gt;the sodas regularly can raise someones risk of type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They say this is because the sweetener used, saccharin, can interfere with how the body interprets insulin — raising the risk of complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The science is still very much unclear on whether diet sodas could help someone lose weight more quickly than if they drunk water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The World Health Organization has indicated that much of the data in this area is poor, with trials typically only lasting three months or less.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some reviews of studies have warned that consuming too much diet soda can have long-term negative health effects, including impaired glucose metabolism and increased risk of comorbidities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And others have found little impact on weight loss from consuming diet soda instead of water — including a &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35285920/"&gt;2022 meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt; of 17 studies which found sweetener-infused beverages offered only a 'small improvement' in body weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Avery Zenker, a registered dietitian for MyHealthTeam in Canada, said: 'Choosing diet soda instead of water could reinforce a preference for sweet flavors, which may affect appetite regulation or lead to seeking out other sweet foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'In contrast, water tends to promote a more neutral palate and a natural connection with thirst and hunger cues. Over time, these could influence someone's relationship with food and overall lifestyle.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She added: 'There's also growing research that artificial sweeteners could negatively alter the gut microbiome. Gut microbiome health is associated with weight, where gut imbalances could be playing a factor in obesity and make weight loss more difficult.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Tue, 17 Jun 2025 18:06:03 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisAFBVV95cUxOaFJma1U3M2lTNGMtd09ncXNLQzhfdVVpRTdDTHlDS3JRZWt4WkY2Q0JvelJYT0ZSb2dFYUg4QlI5MjFjN0t3TUF1NXc0Y2pNaG1RMGxsZXpCSEluVHVfaEVkOUJiVF80V3BzMmFGY1lHYnFWUndqOFNlRWRFbkMxOG95alVEM2RjUnkyLUJUXy1mVGZid1FIaU4zOG9uUGRxRWRYZThLOTN6YTNOblNPNA</guid></item><item><title>新的“剃刀刀片喉咙”新冠肺炎亚型在加利福尼亚州迅速占据一席之地- SFGATE | New 'razor blade throat' COVID subvariant quickly gains ground in California - SFGATE</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinwFBVV95cUxPSGpNYURwcVUzS1g2VGRRbWQ4VWxhcml0Zl96Zzd3SExsT1BPbEJzNUdnR1FxT3ZwMmdYQUhuYURXUnhkRVRfaWQ5UTZnTkEya1MwX01SR2RRclRNU0ZJc2lYYkxxQTJtWkUxbGpwYl9ZMUdRQjY2LXZjOVVhSHZkRXhuMTVhS2EyWGtBVDdiTktWZ0JkWGFWR3FmemNfeWc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;When it comes to weight loss, surgery still reigns supreme. Research out today shows that people undergoing bariatric surgery tend to lose significantly more weight than people taking the newest, most effective GLP-1 medications for obesity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scientists at New York University conducted the study, which analyzed real-world data from obesity patients. People who received surgery lost five times more weight over a two year span on average than those who were prescribed a GLP-1 drug, they found. The findings also suggest that GLP-1 drugs aren’t as effective in the real world as they are in clinical trials, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I think the takeaway is when you see a new popular drug come out, you have to take it with a grain of salt. And I think you have to wait a few years for the real world data to come out, because it might temper the results you’re seeing in trials,” senior study researcher Karan Chhabra, a bariatric surgeon and assistant professor of surgery and population health at the NYU Grossman School of Medicine, told Gizmodo.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Bariatric surgery—particularly the sleeve gastrectomy and gastric bypass—has long been considered the most effective treatment for obesity. People usually lose between 20% and 30% of their baseline weight following surgery, and often experience &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/landmark-study-finds-life-altering-benefits-for-teens-a-decade-after-weight-loss-surgery-2000518382"&gt;long-lasting improvements&lt;/a&gt; in their general health as a result.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But in recent years, the emergence of newer GLP-1 drugs like semaglutide (the active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy) has dramatically changed the field of obesity medicine. These drugs are typically more effective (&lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/ozempic-weight-loss-drugs-fen-phen-risks-1851337644"&gt;and safer&lt;/a&gt;) than past nonsurgical obesity treatments, with people on average losing between 10% and 20% of their weight in clinical trials. And they, too, have been associated with &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/people-on-ozempic-are-drinking-way-less-2000600281"&gt;health benefits&lt;/a&gt; that extend beyond weight loss.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At first glance, the data had suggested GLP-1 drugs could approach—or &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/the-best-obesity-drugs-arent-even-here-yet-2000547636"&gt;even surpass&lt;/a&gt;—the effectiveness of bariatric surgery. But according to Chhabra, there hasn’t yet been a rigorous head-to-head comparison of these two different types of obesity treatments among real-world patients.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Chhabra and his colleagues examined the anonymous medical records of over 50,000 people who received surgery (either a sleeve gastrectomy or gastric bypass) or GLP-1 therapy (either semaglutide or tirzepatide) through NYU Langone Health or NYC Health + Hospitals between 2018 and 2024. The researchers adjusted for factors like age, starting BMI, and other health conditions to make the two groups comparable. The patients and their weight loss outcomes were tracked for two years.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On average, surgical patients lost 58 pounds (around 24% of their total weight) by the end of year two, whereas GLP-1 patients on average lost 12 pounds (around 4.7% of their total weight)—a fivefold difference. The results were slightly better for people who stayed on their medications for a full year (7% weight loss) and for those who took tirzepatide, the newest and most effective GLP-1 drug available (8% to 9%). But the outcomes still fell well short of the success seen with surgery—not to mention the results from earlier clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The team’s findings were &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550728925001881"&gt;presented&lt;/a&gt; this week at the annual meeting of the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery (ASMBS).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are likely several reasons why these drugs aren’t as successful as they’ve appeared to be in trials, Chhabra noted. As many as 70% of GLP-1 patients discontinue use by the first year, for instance. Some will quit because the side effects, typically gastrointestinal symptoms like nausea and diarrhea, are too much to bear; others may stop simply because they can’t afford the drugs any longer (GLP-1 medications often aren’t covered by insurance and can cost upwards of $1,000 a month without coverage). Many of the GLP-1 patients in their study also never reached the maximum dose.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Chhabra also suspects that many people in the real world aren’t getting the supportive care and follow-up they would get from doctors in a clinical trial. GLP-1 drugs have fueled a growing telemedicine industry—for instance, one in which people are often prescribed the medications remotely by medical professionals they’ll never interact with personally. (Until recently, people could also easily get compounded versions of semaglutide and tirzepatide, with even less assurance of safety or effectiveness.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers aren’t saying that people with obesity shouldn’t take GLP-1 drugs, nor that bariatric surgery is the ideal option for everyone. Some people might prefer a one-time treatment, for instance, or may not have the insurance or resources needed to cover long-term GLP-1 therapy. Others may be nervous about going through with any invasive procedure or have other pre-existing conditions that could complicate surgery but not GLP-1 therapy.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, people will need to be aware of these treatments’ respective pros and cons, and those who choose to go with GLP-1s should manage their expectations, according to Chhabra.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“They have to know that, at least as of now in the real world, their weight loss is not going to be what we’re seeing with surgery and they also have to know that it’s a lifelong treatment,” he said. “We don’t yet have any protocols for people to maintain weight loss once they’ve stopped medications so it’s important for people to just acknowledge those realities. And I worry that a lot of people are starting medications without really knowing what they’re getting into.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The team next plans to sift through more data to figure out exactly why real-life patients on GLP-1 therapy aren’t losing as much weight as expected.&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Gizmodo</author><pubDate>Tue, 17 Jun 2025 17:05:43 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisgFBVV95cUxNQnJjNlZ5LWYtZ1JHWHdBT3p1dk9UakVFY0FXRnhkUDY4MDB0eUNnUGhLSEowelJ1aENsbUdDT2Y4RDFnUHhDSjVFQVMxemRCQU5YYWgxNVNyNmN0TUhOWWNidVR0ZlJzSkZzSGxFby05TU5Ud0MtcVJQNXBNUkNuTGhSUTBhY1ZDMF8xZnN0eEhEMFl1MGRQNi10aFR5WHlUS0M3Z2RNNlVhcUduMmFCRVZB</guid></item><item><title>比尔·盖茨：我父亲死于阿尔茨海默氏症。但我对抗击疾病比以往任何时候都更加乐观- statnews.com | Bill Gates: I lost my father to Alzheimer’s.

Although he is on my mind every day, I always find myself thinking about him even more often this time of year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;My dad was a giant in every sense of the word. More than anyone else, he shaped the values of the Gates Foundation, and everything we have accomplished is a testament to his vision of a better world. Sadly, we lost my dad in 2020 to Alzheimer’s disease. Watching my brilliant, loving father go downhill and disappear was a brutal experience.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the years since his passing, I’ve met far too many people who had similar experiences with their own loved ones. More than &lt;a href="https://www.alz.org/alzheimers-dementia/facts-figures" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;7 million people in the United States&lt;/a&gt; are currently living with Alzheimer’s disease. That means about 1 out of every 9 people over the age of 65 have it. As life expectancies continue to go up, those numbers will only increase.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But here’s the good news: We are making massive progress in the fight against Alzheimer’s and related dementias.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I saw some of the reasons for optimism firsthand during a visit to Indiana in 2024. I met with the team at Indiana University’s School of Medicine in Indianapolis — where they have an incredible center that is doing lots of leading-edge neuroscience — and took a super cool tour of their biomarker labs. I also got the opportunity to look under the hood of new automated machines that will soon be running diagnostics around the world. It’s an exciting time in a challenging space.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;During my visit, I learned more about the latest big breakthrough in Alzheimer’s R&amp;amp;D: blood-based diagnostic tests. A number of different companies have approaches in the pipeline, but each of them works in roughly the same way, by detecting the ratio of amyloid plaques in the brain. I’m optimistic that these tests will be a game-changer. Here in the U.S., this work reached a huge milestone in May: &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/05/16/alzheimers-fujirebio-fda-approval/"&gt;The FDA approved the first blood-based test for patients 55 years and older&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Until recently, the only way to confirm a suspected Alzheimer’s diagnosis was to get either a &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003827.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;PET scan&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK557553/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;spinal tap&lt;/a&gt;. Neither is the kind of test a doctor would order unless you were showing clear signs of decline. But catching Alzheimer’s early is key. We now know that the disease begins 15 to  20 years before you start to see any signs. A simple, accurate, and easy-to-run blood test might one day make routine screening possible, identifying patients long before they experience cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When I talk people about the promise of these new diagnostics, I’m often asked, “What is the point of getting diagnosed if I can’t do anything about it?”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s a fair question— but soon it will be moot. The FDA has approved two drugs for the treatment of Alzheimer’s. Both have proven to modestly slow down the progression of the disease, but what I’m really excited about is their potential when paired with an early diagnostic. My main takeaway from my visit to Indiana is that these treatments could be drastically more impactful than I initially thought when given early in the disease’s progression.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://trials.lilly.com/en-US/trial/302480" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Phase 3 clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; are underway now to prove just how transformative these drugs are for people with presymptomatic Alzheimer’s, and we could see results as soon as 2026. Until then, the drugs will continue to help patients who are already showing cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I’m also optimistic that researchers will continue to improve current treatments and develop new drugs. This will require running lots of clinical trials. Without a simple diagnostic test, it is often difficult to find enough eligible patients. In some cases, it takes even take longer to enroll participants — as long as three years! — than to conduct the study. My hope is that the new blood tests will get the recruitment time down to less than a year and accelerate the development of new drugs.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;All of this progress hinges, of course, on continued funding for Alzheimer’s research. Some of the biggest breakthroughs to date were supported by federal grants, like the discovery of the connection between amyloid proteins and the disease. This isn’t unusual: Medical R&amp;amp;D often relies on government funding to support projects that explore foundational science or aren’t commercially viable yet.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We are on the cusp of turning the tide against dementia — which makes this an especially bad time to pull back on research. Recent cuts to the National Institutes of Health and other government institutions threaten to stop progress in its tracks, and no individual or private organization can fill the gap.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is the moment to spend &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; money on research, not less. Right now, all over the world, researchers are collecting data about Alzheimer’s disease. New tools are making it easier for them to share information and work together. As a result, the quest to stop Alzheimer’s has never had more momentum. For my part, I worked with a coalition of partners to create the &lt;a href="https://www.alzheimersdata.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Alzheimer’s Disease Data Initiative&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://grip-research.org/platform" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Global Research and Imaging Platform&lt;/a&gt;, and I am proud to support organizations like the Alzheimer’s Drug Discovery Foundation’s Diagnostics Accelerator and &lt;a href="https://www.alz.org/partthecloud/overview.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Part the Cloud&lt;/a&gt;. All of these efforts simplify how researchers and data scientists work together to share data and develop algorithms and tools in order to make advances in the field.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There is still a huge amount of work to be done — like deepening our understanding of the disease’s pathology and developing even better diagnostics. But I am blown away by how much we have learned about Alzheimer’s over the last couple of years.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When we lost my dad, an Alzheimer’s diagnosis was a death sentence. Just five years later, that is finally starting to change. I cannot help but be filled with a sense of hope when I think of all the progress being made on Alzheimer’s, even with so many challenges happening around the world. We are closer than ever before to a world where no one has to watch someone they love suffer from this awful disease.&lt;/p&gt;

Medical professionals across multiple disciplines also advocate for a balanced and nutritious &lt;a href="https://www.delish.com/food/a64540833/is-carnivore-diet-healthy/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:diet;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;diet&lt;/a&gt; to maintain your overall health. But sometimes even your favorite foods can do more harm than good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The food we eat is packed with different nutrients that impact our bodies in their own ways. When you take medication and eat certain foods, they can interact negatively and affect the efficacy of your medication or induce unpleasant side effects. And some of the most common culprits are ingredients you may already have in your kitchen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We consulted &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewfranklynmiller/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr Andy Franklyn-Miller,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Dr Andy Franklyn-Miller,&lt;/a&gt; MBBS, PhD, MRCGP FFSEM, a dual board-certified Sports and Exercise Medicine Physician and Chief Medical and Innovation Officer at &lt;a href="https://www.nuritas.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Nuritas;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Nuritas&lt;/a&gt;, to break down some of the most common foods that can interact with medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But first, a disclaimer: this is by no means an exhaustive list of ingredients or a substitute for medical advice from your own healthcare team. When you start taking a new medication, we suggest you consult your doctor or pharmacist about what foods to look out for and how to adjust your diet accordingly. Depending on the medication and your own individual care plan, those adjustments can range from avoiding a food entirely to reducing your intake to carefully timing the consumption of your food with your doses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Grapefruit&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;R.Tsubin - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you take prescription medication, you may need to put down your &lt;a href="https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/a43758194/paloma-cocktail-recipe/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:paloma;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;paloma&lt;/a&gt;. Grapefruit, as well as its juice, is a common ingredient that interacts with a wide range of prescriptions. “Grapefruit inhibits the enzyme CYP3A4 in the liver and intestines, which metabolizes many drugs,” Franklyn-Miller says. “This can lead to higher drug concentrations in the bloodstream.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without this enzyme, your medications will accumulate and linger in your bloodstream, which can increase your risk of side effects. Grapefruit causes interactions across several drug categories, including statins, calcium channel blockers, and immunosuppressants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Dairy Products&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;Jose A. Bernat Bacete - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Calcium has long been heralded as an essential mineral, but it may have less than ideal effects if you take certain antibiotics. “Calcium-rich foods like milk, cheese, and yogurt can bind to antibiotics such as tetracycline and fluoroquinolones like ciprofloxacin, forming insoluble complexes that reduce drug absorption in the gut,” Franklyn-Miller says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same goes for any foods supplemented with calcium, like certain varieties of orange juice and &lt;a href="https://www.delish.com/kitchen-tools/a65059238/is-almond-milk-or-oat-milk-healthier/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:many almond milks;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;many almond milks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Leafy Greens&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;Crispin la valiente - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;A general rule of thumb is that darker greens have more nutrient density. One of the most common nutrients is vitamin K, which plays an essential role in blood clotting and bone health. But if you take certain anticoagulant blood pressure medications, vitamin K is more harmful than helpful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Foods like spinach, kale, and broccoli, high in vitamin K, can counteract the effects of anticoagulants like warfarin, which relies on inhibiting vitamin K-dependent clotting factors to prevent blood clots,” says Franklyn-Miller.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Alcohol&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;Oscar Wong - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medical professionals warn about the adverse health effects of consuming large quantities of alcohol, which is classified as a &lt;a href="https://www.delish.com/kitchen-tools/a64342317/is-drinking-wine-every-day-healthy/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:carcinogen;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;carcinogen&lt;/a&gt;. But beyond increasing your risk of cancer and organ damage in the long term, alcohol also can have a significant impact on your prescription medications in the short term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Alcohol can amplify or diminish the effects of medications,” Franklyn-Miller says. “For instance, it enhances the sedative effects of benzodiazepines like diazepam and increases the risk of liver toxicity when combined with acetaminophen.” Alcohol also greatly increases the sedative effects of melatonin, which is why Franklyn-Miller suggests the use of other natural peptides as alternative sleep aids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Aged, Cured, &amp;amp; Fermented Foods&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;LauriPatterson - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the oldest and most prevalent food preservation techniques, like aging, curing, and fermenting, lead to the development of the amino acid tyramine. Tyramine can be found in large quantities in foods like cheese, soy sauce, sauerkraut, sausages, and different types of alcohol. It’s a natural byproduct of these preservation processes, but tyramine also interacts with particular medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Franklyn-Miller says tyramine-rich foods “can cause dangerous blood pressure spikes in patients taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), used for depression or Parkinson’s disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again: this list isn't comprehensive, nor is it meant to replace guidance from your doctor or medical team. If you have any questions or concerns about how your medications may interact with certain foods, always consult your healthcare provider before making any changes to your diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 17 Jun 2025 17:02:59 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMicEFVX3lxTE5KUjdubVlMR3FUNW1Ld3h2RUFqUHJWTFBpU29vUnZ4Q0RzQmp3X0FKUldBeGxOSlZydG9yREhHbkNKWi1XNlBLNGJHRWw5T3ZXcEhMQUNTZ1hPa1c1U19hS0VlTG9FdWdLUVZwM3hHcXE</guid></item><item><title>什么是代谢综合征–我们真的需要担心吗？ -卫报 | What is metabolic syndrome – and do we really need to worry about it? - The Guardian</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigAFBVV95cUxQR09CZ190emJTZk5NcHo2Ql84WGk3aE5kWDg1OHBpX3dOdVdNbVVZVEVSUTltOEZ0ajZVYk1rU0NFTjd5Nzc1YVNWMHVLRVhWRFVEOU5MTTJnUnB5czQyLXNBME9wNWR3enhMdm9ScERuenIzeU1Ia1g5amctNlViNw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body-commercial-selector article-body-viewer-selector dcr-11jq3zt"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-15rw6c2"&gt;M&lt;/span&gt;etabolic syndrome is trending online.

Some content creators do relay accurate information about it, but messaging can take a turn toward scienceploitation, or the use of scientific language to sell untested products and diet plans, says &lt;a href="https://www.ualberta.ca/en/law/faculty-and-research/health-law-institute/people/timothycaulfield.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Tim Caulfield&lt;/a&gt;, a professor and research director of the Health Law Institute at the University of Alberta.

Here’s what doctors and scientists say about it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Metabolic syndrome refers to having multiple conditions that increase the risk of health problems like diabetes, stroke and heart disease. These conditions include high blood pressure, high blood sugar, abdominal obesity, high blood triglycerides and low HDL cholesterol, also known as the “good cholesterol.” According to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, having &lt;a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/metabolic-syndrome" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;three or more&lt;/a&gt; of those conditions means you may have metabolic syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“When you combine these conditions, you develop metabolic syndrome,” explains Dr Blanca Lizaola-Mayo, a quadruple board-certified physician, the Medical Director of the Transplant Hepatology Center and the co-founder of the Metabolic Liver Clinic at Mayo Clinic in Arizona.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Many people with metabolic syndrome also have &lt;a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/metabolic-syndrome" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;insulin resistance&lt;/a&gt;, which makes it harder for cells to absorb glucose, raising blood sugar levels and increasing the risk of related health problems. Insulin is one of several hormones that help regulate metabolism. Factors like poor diet and chronic stress can dysregulate these hormones, contributing to metabolic syndrome, explains Lizaola-Mayo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Sometimes, content creators use the phrase “metabolic dysfunction” instead. These terms are being used online to describe a similar phenomenon, says Lizaola-Mayo. But “metabolic syndrome” refers to specific medical conditions, as described above. Meanwhile, there is no &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35785479/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;unified definition of “metabolic dysfunction”&lt;/a&gt;, but it refers more generally to the metabolism not functioning well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;According to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, &lt;a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/metabolic-syndrome" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;one in three&lt;/a&gt; American adults has metabolic syndrome. In the UK, the estimate is &lt;a href="https://www.heartuk.org.uk/genetic-conditions/metabolic-syndrome" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;one in four&lt;/a&gt; adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;While the risk of metabolic syndrome &lt;a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/metabolic-syndrome/causes" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;increases&lt;/a&gt; with age, incidence is &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/pmj/article/99/1175/985/7076129" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;rising&lt;/a&gt; overall. This prevalence may be partly explained by &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8595506/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;increasing&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/may/14/should-i-worry-about-how-long-i-spend-sitting-down" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;sedentary behavior&lt;/a&gt; among adults, along with the proliferation of highly processed foods and food additives that can &lt;a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/384/bmj-2023-077310" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;trigger&lt;/a&gt; inflammation, says Lizaola-Mayo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-are-mitochondria" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;What are mitochondria?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Mitochondria are cell parts that convert nutrients into adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which provides energy for cellular processes. To have good health, we need our mitochondria to produce energy efficiently and communicate well, says &lt;a href="https://www.neurology.columbia.edu/profile/martin-picard-phd" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Martin Picard&lt;/a&gt;, an associate professor and doctor of the Mitochondrial Psychobiology Group at Columbia University Irving Medical Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;People with metabolic syndrome may have some signs of reduced mitochondrial function, says &lt;a href="https://www.colorado.edu/iphy/people/research-professors/matthew-j-rossman" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Matt Rossman&lt;/a&gt;, an assistant research professor in integrative physiology at the University of Colorado, Boulder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-is-mitochondrial-dysfunction" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;What is mitochondrial dysfunction?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In this context, the term “dysfunction” does not mean that mitochondria are broken or damaged, though &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@dhru.purohit/video/7368516938818948394?q=mitochondrial%20dysfunciton&amp;amp;t=1748627444850" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;that phrasing is sometimes misused&lt;/a&gt; online and in wellness spaces. “You can have metabolic syndrome without having defective mitochondria,” Picard says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The term “mitochondrial dysfunction” doesn’t necessarily mean something is wrong with the mitochondria, but suggests they aren’t working as efficiently as they should, says Jerry Chipuk, a professor of oncological sciences and dermatology, as well as the founder and director of the Mitochondrial Analysis Facility, at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Sanna Darvish, a PhD student candidate at CU Boulder, says “mitochondrial dysfunction” can be a vague term, but in her and Rossman’s research, it’s related to a process that results in oxidative stress. This is linked to ageing and health issues, like metabolic syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Although a person with metabolic syndrome may have less efficient mitochondria, this is distinct from a mitochondrial disease, which is &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3786640/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;a very rare condition&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The signs of metabolic syndrome are the underlying conditions mentioned above, like high blood sugar and high blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;But it can also be a “silent disease”, explains Lizaola-Mayo. For example, metabolic syndrome increases the risk of type 2 diabetes, and many diagnosed individuals “have been diabetic for years without realizing it”, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Some subtle changes may indicate a decline in metabolic health, she says, including frequent headaches, blurry vision, excessive thirst and increased urination. Unusual tiredness and weakness can also indicate an issue. Medical providers use blood pressure and blood tests to &lt;a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/metabolic-syndrome/symptoms" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;diagnose&lt;/a&gt; metabolic syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Genetic and environmental factors influence the development of metabolic syndrome. The latter is what we can control, says Lizaola-Mayo, but it can be challenging to eat well and exercise consistently.

The best meal plans and exercise routines are the ones you enjoy, she says, because those are the ones you’ll stick with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“The reality is that we don’t need to diet,” she says. “We need to change our nutrition for good.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;GLP-1 medications can &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/ng-interactive/2025/may/17/weight-loss-drugs-altering-views-how-body-brain-work" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;help patients&lt;/a&gt; whose metabolic syndrome has progressed to type 2 diabetes. Still, these medications need to be used in conjunction with lifestyle modifications to achieve long-term benefits, says Lizaola-Mayo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Preventive care, including blood work and &lt;a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/treatment-tests-and-therapies/routine-screenings" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;routine screenings&lt;/a&gt;, is one of the best ways to avoid future illnesses. If you’re concerned about metabolic syndrome, seek a regular checkup with your primary care physician.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-do-you-keep-mitochondria-healthy" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;How do you keep mitochondria healthy?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Mitochondria rely on various nutrients to make ATP, Chipuk explains, so a balanced diet is ideal, he says. But a very carbohydrate-heavy or high-sugar diet can erode mitochondrial function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Exercise has a “profound effect” on mitochondria, says Rossman, increasing the number of mitochondria and supporting their ability to consume oxygen and produce ATP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;While &lt;a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/obesity-disrupts-mitochondria-reduces-fat-burning" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;animal studies&lt;/a&gt; suggest obesity can make mitochondria less effective, Chipuk cautions that not all forms of weight loss are healthy. He emphasizes it’s “more about strengthening the body than simply eliminating extra pounds”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Activities like chronic smoking and drinking alcohol can contribute to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213231714001104" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;mitochondrial dysfunction&lt;/a&gt;. Stress also impedes mitochondria, Chipuk says. Meanwhile, positive life experiences seem to be associated with &lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1321881111" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;healthier mitochondria&lt;/a&gt;, says Picard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-about-supplements" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;What about supplements?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11393155/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; on mitochondrial health supplements is ongoing. But in most cases, there’s not enough valid medical information to support the use of supplements for metabolic syndrome, says Lizaola-Mayo. More large randomized controlled trials are needed to determine if they can provide clinically meaningful benefits, says Rossman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“It’s essential to be very careful with supplements,” says Lizaola-Mayo. “You can achieve more with exercise and a simple, healthy diet.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Picard also finds supplements “overrated” and doesn’t see them as the way forward for mitochondrial health, instead emphasizing the medical benefits of exercise and nutrition. Lizaola-Mayo cautions that &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5502701/#:~:text" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; has shown some supplements contain additives that &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2821951" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;damage the liver&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Navigating health decisions is challenging, even when you’re feeling well, says Caufield.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“The conventional healthcare system does not treat people well, especially women and people of color,” he says. “On top of that, resource constraints can make it even more complicated.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;So it’s understandable that people turn to the internet for guidance. But beware “grifters exploiting genuine problems with the health care system and using scientific language to sell their products”, says Caufield. Red flags include offering overly simple solutions to complex issues, or relying on a single study, he says: “If something sounds too good to be true, it probably is.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Tue, 17 Jun 2025 16:23:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigAFBVV95cUxQR09CZ190emJTZk5NcHo2Ql84WGk3aE5kWDg1OHBpX3dOdVdNbVVZVEVSUTltOEZ0ajZVYk1rU0NFTjd5Nzc1YVNWMHVLRVhWRFVEOU5MTTJnUnB5czQyLXNBME9wNWR3enhMdm9ScERuenIzeU1Ia1g5amctNlViNw</guid></item><item><title>“不健康”的植物性饮食可能会显著增加心脏病风险-今日医学新闻 | 'Unhealthy' plant-based diets may significantly raise heart disease risk - Medical News Today</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMisgFBVV95cUxQbmpJTWNQNHFWSlRjbjJlYVhlbmpaYlo4SmVQcXBYMTducm8yVGQzYkM5OUpHNUJTSUp6YlpWUG85UmxpZGVsbzNtWi1HU3kybmxhS0ZVTGM3ek5kaWwzTDNxN2I4NjV0bEFyVW94YnpqVkRCMnhUdWVWV1lxYXJ4cG9ZemwwMHJqZGxCN0lDMzREOGJnNTgtQ0pvbjI1cndER3M5cDR2SkpwTEJEN3U4Yl9R?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-12va8w7"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;figure class="css-yhe8zq"&gt;&lt;span class="css-rwmw5v"&gt;&lt;span class="css-mjp0j9"&gt;&lt;picture class="css-16pk1is"&gt;&lt;source srcset="https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/06/plant-based-chicken-burger-1296x728-header-1024x575.jpg 750w" media="(min-width: 1190px)"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source srcset="https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/06/plant-based-chicken-burger-1296x728-header-1024x575.jpg 750w" media="(min-width: 990px)"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source srcset="https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/06/plant-based-chicken-burger-1296x728-header-1024x575.jpg 879w" media="(min-width: 768px)"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img src="https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/06/plant-based-chicken-burger-1296x728-header-1024x575.jpg" alt="A person holding a plant-based chicken burger between their hands" class="css-etv4j0"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;hl-share-overlay class="css-1mqo1cs"&gt;&lt;a class="icon-hl-pinterest css-11oz8gb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" data-event="Any Page|Image Pinterest Click|Icon Clicked" data-element-event="OPEN|CONTENTBLOCK|Any Page|Article Body|BUTTON|Image Widget Pinterest Click|" href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.medicalnewstoday.com%2Farticles%2Funhealthy-plant-based-diets-may-significantly-raise-heart-disease-risk&amp;amp;media=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.post.rvohealth.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F3%2F2025%2F06%2Fplant-based-chicken-burger-1296x728-header-1024x575.jpg&amp;amp;description=Heart%20attack%3A%20Unhealthy%20plant-based%20diet%20may%20increase%20risk%20by%2065%25" title="Share on Pinterest" data-pin-custom="true" data-share-url="https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/06/plant-based-chicken-burger-1296x728-header-1024x575.jpg"&gt;&lt;span class="css-z1zfa"&gt;Share on Pinterest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-share-overlay&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;figcaption class="css-13b3g0x"&gt;Not all plant-based meat alternatives are considered healthy. Anastasiya Mihailovna/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new study finds that while many plant-based foods are healthy for the heart, many are not.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The study concluded that eating a diet high in unhealthy plant-based foods was associated with a higher level of a key heart attack biomarker.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Plant-based meat substitutes can be high in sodium and heavily processed, both of which are unhealthy for the heart.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study confirms that healthy plant-based foods can be beneficial for the heart. However, not all plant-based foods qualify as healthy, and the study finds that those foods can be just as damaging to the heart as their non-plant-based counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors of the study assessed associations between plant diets of various qualities and a trio of critical cardiac biomarkers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For many people who choose not to eat animal-based foods for moral reasons, the potential health benefits of a plant-based diet may be considered a happy byproduct or even a reward. The study suggests that this is not necessarily incorrect, as long as one considers that the rules that apply to healthy eating in general also apply to plant-based foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;During interviews taken throughout the NHANES survey, participants reported their food intake for a previous 24-hour period, as blood samples were taken to measure the relevant biomarkers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study’s biomarkers of concern were cardiac troponin T, cardiac troponin I, and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide. Troponins are indicators of cardiac muscle damage, which is a sign of &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/151444/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;myocardial infarction or heart attack&lt;/a&gt;.

While these levels are not of immediate concern, they may be interpreted as a warning sign of potential future issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers used the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s &lt;a href="https://www.ars.usda.gov/arsuserfiles/80400530/pdf/mped/mped2_doc.Pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;MyPyramid Equivalents 2.0&lt;/a&gt; database to sort each reported food into one of three categories:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;healthy plant-based food&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;unhealthy plant-based food&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;animal-based food.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analysis revealed that adherence to a healthy plant-based diet was associated with a 49% lower likelihood of having elevated levels of cardiac troponin I.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People following an unhealthy plant-based diet had a 65% greater chance of elevated levels of cardiac troponin I.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors of the study found no strong association with either healthy or unhealthy plant-based foods and cardiac troponin T or N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Plant-based foods are not automatically healthier than their animal-product-based counterparts,” said &lt;a href="https://entirelynourished.com/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Michelle Routhenstein&lt;/a&gt;, who is a registered dietitian specializing in heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While many plant-based diets can reduce cardiovascular risk due to their nutritional profile, such as being low in saturated fat, &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/323133/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;high in fiber&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/325728/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;high in potassium&lt;/a&gt;, magnesium, calcium, and &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/301506/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;antioxidants&lt;/a&gt;, not all plant-based foods share these benefits,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.joinmidi.com/team/jayne-morgan" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Jayne Morgan, MD&lt;/a&gt;, cardiologist at Hello Heart, pointed out that “meat substitutes are frequent unhealthy culprits hidden within plant-based diets, and can actually be quite high in sodium, additives, and saturated fats, often from coconut oil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Coconut oil or palm oil are often added for texture. These are high in saturated fat, which may raise LDL (‘bad’) cholesterol and contribute to heart disease risk. In fact, some plant-based burgers can actually have the similar amounts of saturated fat (6-8 grams) as a beef patty,” Morgan said.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Routhenstein noted that these saturated fats can potentially promote insulin resistance as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How much salt is in plant-based meat?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Further, many plant-based meats are heavily seasoned to mimic meat flavors. This often means very high sodium levels, which is a major contributor to hypertension. A plain chicken breast might have 70 mg of sodium [in four ounces of chicken], while a processed plant burger could have 400–600 mg of sodium!”&lt;br&gt;— Jayne Morgan, MD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Some plant-based substitutes may be highly processed,” Routhenstein said, “and include ingredients that can actually harm &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/how-to-improve-heart-health/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;heart health&lt;/a&gt;. This applies regardless of whether the food is plant- or animal-based.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The level of processing is a critical factor in determining how healthy they are for your heart,” cautioned Morgan. “When it comes to heart health, it’s not just about what you eat, but also how processed the food is.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Bottom line, highly processed foods — whether plant-based or animal-based — tend to be worse for heart health than whole or minimally processed foods.”&lt;br&gt;— Jayne Morgan, MD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Processing may include additives such as methylcelluose, modified starches, carrageenan, and gums that may trigger inflammation or gut issues impacting the microbiome.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Processing also takes away beneficial components of natural foods such as isolated proteins, diminishing the nutritional profile of whole food sources such as lentils or beans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The goal,” stated Morgan, “is to always maximize nutrients that protect the heart.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are looking to replace animal proteins, Routhenstein said to “look for foods low in saturated fat and sodium, with minimal additives and preservatives. Choose whole food ingredients that are rich in protein, fiber, and &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/phytonutrients/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;phytonutrients&lt;/a&gt; to meet your goals — such as beans, legumes, tofu, and tempeh.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To avoid processed foods, “Be on the alert for long ingredient lists full of additives or ‘natural flavorings.’ In fact, the word ‘natural’ is often a red flag,” &lt;strong&gt;Morgan warned&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Choose unsalted or lightly salted options whenever possible. Seek recognizable foods, i.e., whole foods — and remember that fiber helps to lower cholesterol. Lentils, chickpeas, and black beans are good options. Look for oils such as olive, avocado, or canola.

&lt;p&gt;While physical health declined in the long term for all age groups, and mental health increased, the differences between groups were sustained over time, which the researchers said highlighted the need for age-tailored care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More research is needed to determine what kind of mental health support may maximize quality of life in people with younger age of onset, and which specific aspects of physical health may be targeted to improve quality of life in those with older onset disease, they said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2211034825003037"&gt;Age of multiple sclerosis symptom onset affects mental and physical health-related quality of life in opposite directions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;,” was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Multiple Sclerosis and Related Disorders.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In MS, the immune system mistakenly attacks the protective covering of nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord, causing damage. This results in &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/symptoms-of-multiple-sclerosis/"&gt;MS symptoms&lt;/a&gt; such as blurred vision, fatigue, and difficulty walking — all of which pose limitations in daily life and take a toll on mental health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While MS usually begins in adulthood, it can develop before age 18, in which case it is called &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/4-types-ms/#Rare_Forms"&gt;pediatric-onset MS&lt;/a&gt; (POMS). Some studies have suggested that people with pediatric-onset disease may develop physical disability when they are several years younger than those who develop the disease in adulthood, but evidence to date has been mixed. It’s also not clear how the age at MS onset affects mental health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To find out, a team of researchers in Canada examined data from 699 patients who were followed over time as part of the Canadian Prospective Cohort Study to Understand Progression in Multiple Sclerosis (&lt;a href="https://bmcneurol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12883-021-02447-7"&gt;CanProCo&lt;/a&gt;), which is &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/news-posts/2022/04/11/1m-invested-canadian-study-effects-childhood-onset-ms-over-time/"&gt;funded&lt;/a&gt; in part by &lt;a href="https://www.biogen.ca/"&gt;Biogen Canada&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.rochecanada.com/"&gt;Roche Canada&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="https://braincanada.ca/"&gt;Brain Canada Foundation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The researchers looked at how the age at which someone first experiences &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/symptoms-of-multiple-sclerosis/"&gt;MS symptoms&lt;/a&gt; affects their health-related quality of life — both physically and mentally — as they live with the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The majority of participants had &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/relapsing-remitting-multiple-sclerosis-rrms/"&gt;relapsing-remitting MS&lt;/a&gt; (93%), and the rest had &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/primary-progressive-multiple-sclerosis-ppms/"&gt;primary progressive MS&lt;/a&gt;. The average age at symptom onset was 33.2, with 16.9% having symptoms before age 25 and 2.3% having POMS. At the time of the analysis, they had been living with the disease for a mean of 4.8 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Results showed that patients who developed MS at a younger age tended to report better physical health than those with a later onset. Physical health was measured using the MS Quality of Life-54 (MSQoL-54), where higher scores mean better health. For every five-year increase in age of onset, scores decreased by 1.5 points, which is considered the minimal clinically important clinical difference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mental health-related quality of life, which was also measured using the MSQoL-54, showed the opposite pattern. Patients who developed MS at a younger age reported worse mental health than those who developed it when they were older, with scores increasing 2.5 points — the minimal clinically important clinical difference for this score — for every 12-year increase in age of onset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over time, physical health scores dropped and mental health scores rose in all patients. This challenges the common practice of dividing study patients into two groups — pediatric and adult onset — and suggests researchers might look more closely at how different ages within those groups may lead to different outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Patterns in physical and mental health perceptions seen in pediatric onset MS are also seen in people with young adult-onset MS, challenging the role for studying age of onset dichotomously as done previously,” the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The length of time someone has had MS, known as disease duration, did not fully explain the differences in physical and mental health between age groups. Instead, disability levels, measured by the Expanded Disability Status Scale, did account for 63.7% of the differences in physical health and 61.3% of the differences in mental health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This suggests that other factors — possibly related to self-management abilities, disease-modifying therapy use, and social participation — may influence how people with MS experience their physical and mental health, the researchers said. These factors could potentially be changed or improved, offering a strategy to achieve better long-term outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Future studies evaluating HrQoL [health-related quality of life] over longer periods will be important to provide evidence-based mental health support to maximize HrQoL for people with young onset MS,” the team wrote. “In contrast, ongoing studies evaluating specific aspects of physical health in older onset MS … will be important to maximize the longevity of physical functioning in people with MS.”&lt;/p&gt;

In that time I have had a front seat to a dramatic version of the adverse effect that oncologists often mention in passing to breast cancer patients using anti-oestrogen therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“How often do you experience this?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“A dozen times on a good day,” she shrugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Roughly three-quarters of breast cancers are oestrogen-receptor positive, which means the cancer cells are stimulated by oestrogen. Women with this type of cancer benefit from oestrogen suppression, achieved via different methods including a pill, an injection and removal of the ovaries. This induces menopause in younger women and more complete oestrogen suppression in the already menopausal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;With more than 20,000 Australian women and 2 million women worldwide diagnosed with breast cancer every year, anti-oestrogen medication is akin to the penicillin of oncology. Each week, I write, renew and replace multiple scripts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;But while every prescriber mentions the anticipated side-effect of hot flushes, it strikes me that no one (including me) quite explains the living horror that many patients go on to experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Why is that?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Women who have concluded an arduous trek of chemotherapy and radiation for early breast cancer express the hope of “never having to go through this again”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Women with metastatic breast cancer harbour the hope that their cancer, while not curable, may remain at bay for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Every woman’s risk profile warrants a tailored conversation but, broadly speaking, imagine giving this advice: “There is an effective medication to reduce recurrence risk and improve survival. Over the many years you will be on it, you &lt;a href="https://www.bcna.org.au/resources/side-effects/side-effects-by-diagnosis-or-treatment/side-effects-of-hormone-blocking-therapy/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;could experience&lt;/a&gt; hot flushes, stiff joints, disturbed sleep, low mood, weight gain and sexual dysfunction.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;If it sounds like punishment served at the end of a punishing diagnosis, it is. However, when a drug works, oncologists want to encourage adherence and hope that the side-effects either don’t occur or can be managed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Vasomotor symptoms”, the medical term for hot flushes, affect up to 90% of women with breast cancer and are often severe. Up to half of all women prescribed anti-oestrogen medication stop taking the drug – and they are just the ones who tell us. Every oncologist knows the heart-sink moment when a high-risk patient declines treatment. But we also know all too well the toll that led them to do so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Given the ubiquitous nature of hot flushes, the lack of good treatments is frustrating. Of the panoply of advertised options such as cognitive behavioural therapy, acupuncture, hypnosis, diet, exercise and off-label use of antidepressants and anticonvulsants, none has been shown to help in a meaningful way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Then there is the irony of taking one medication to counter the side-effect of another and gaining weight and its associated complications in the process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;As a result, most women just put up with the trailing cost of having breast cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Now, there is hope. In a &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMoa2415566" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;randomised controlled trial&lt;/a&gt; of drug versus placebo, a once-daily pill meaningfully reduced hot flushes in women taking anti-oestrogen therapy for breast cancer. &lt;a href="https://www.bayer.com/en/us/news-stories/elinzanetant" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Elinzanetant&lt;/a&gt; works by affecting the brain signals involved in temperature regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;At baseline, women experienced a mean of a dozen daily episodes. By one month, 61% of women on active treatment reported a reduction of at least 50% in the daily frequency of moderate-to-severe hot flushes compared with 27% on placebo. Sleep quality improved, as did overall quality of life. Crossover from placebo to the active drug resulted in similar findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;No drug is without side-effects. More than 60% of women in each group reported at least one mild adverse event but severe ones were rare. Somnolence, fatigue and diarrhoea were reported more frequently in the active therapy group but they can also be caused by cancer therapy. More than 90% of women who completed one year of treatment chose to continue for an optional two years, suggesting a high rate of acceptability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="c316db28-eaaa-411e-82a3-4c2b678a9d7a" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":23,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"The experts: oncologists on the simple, doable, everyday things they do to try to prevent cancer","elementId":"c316db28-eaaa-411e-82a3-4c2b678a9d7a","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/article/2024/jul/11/the-experts-oncologists-on-the-simple-doable-everyday-things-they-do-to-try-to-prevent-cancer"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":8,"display":0,"theme":1}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The drug is yet unapproved and oncologists will seek more details before widespread prescribing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Breast cancer outcomes are poorer in non-white women but 88% of the participants were white.

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investigators at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology report walking more than 100 minutes per day was associated with a 23% lower risk of chronic low back pain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;  
                                         

                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Low back pain affects people of all ages and accounts for 7.7% of all years lived with disability worldwide, ranking among the most costly chronic conditions in health care. In the US, back pain generates some of the highest health care spending.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walking is the most affordable and accessible form of exercise for many. While &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/guidelines/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;guidelines&lt;/a&gt; recommend maintaining &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/physical+activity/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;physical activity&lt;/a&gt; for the management of chronic low back pain, they offer no explicit targets for walking frequency or duration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the study, "Volume and Intensity of Walking and Risk of Chronic Low Back Pain," &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2835297" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;JAMA Network Open&lt;/i&gt;, researchers conducted a &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/prospective+cohort+study/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;prospective cohort study&lt;/a&gt; to examine whether accelerometer-derived daily walking volume and walking intensity are associated with the risk of chronic LBP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants included 11,194 adults aged 20 years or older without chronic low back pain at baseline, drawn from the Trøndelag Health Study between 2017 and 2019, with follow-up from 2021 to 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two tri-axial AX3 accelerometers worn for a week measured daily walking volume and walking intensity. Self-reported &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/chronic+low+back+pain/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;chronic low back pain&lt;/a&gt; at follow-up, defined as pain lasting three months or longer in the past 12 months, served as the primary outcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those walking 101–124 minutes per day showed a risk ratio of 0.77 (95% CI, 0.68–0.87), and those walking 125 minutes or more showed a risk ratio of 0.76 (95% CI, 0.67–0.87). Higher walking intensity was also associated with reduced risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Findings suggest public health strategies promoting walking volume may confer more pronounced preventive benefits than walking intensity for reducing the burden of chronic &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/low+back+pain/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;low back pain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

To provide an apt example, an Instagram video shows how a &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/golden-retriever" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Golden Retriever;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Golden Retriever&lt;/a&gt; named Baker attracts all kinds of animals. In the caption, the adorable and gentle pooch is referred to as “A real life Disney Prince.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Instagram video shows Golden Retriever’s interaction with various animals&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent video on Instagram features a compilation of clips of a Golden Retriever’s interaction with various animals. Describing the pet’s personality, his owner mentions a line on it, saying, “My golden has the gentlest soul and attracts all kinds of animals.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The video begins with the &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com/news/180020-dog-lounging-pool-pregnant-mom-viral-video" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:dog;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;dog&lt;/a&gt; named Baker showcasing a curious face while looking at a bird. The two creatures observe each other in close proximity. In the next scene, someone holds a dragonfly while the pooch tries to jump a little and smell it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further, &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/bakerbarnes" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Baker;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Baker&lt;/a&gt; interacts with a Koi fish as he leans towards a pond, and one fish jumps up and tries to hold the canine’s nose. He pulls his head back first, but becomes curious again. In the final clip, the pet approaches a flying bug and reacts similarly. Throughout his interactions with different creatures, none of the animals reject Baker’s advances. It proves the dog’s gentle behavior towards others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the video has gained viewers’ attention. They called Baker a “gentle spirit,” “sweetie,” and “gentle soul.” A user commented, “How can you be so sweet,” while another wrote, “What a beautiful little soul your dog has.” Some referred to him as “Disney princess” and “adorable prince.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, a few of them liked the Golden Retriever’s interaction with the fish the most. One said, “Oh I love his floppy ears watching the koi fish.” A viewer also mentioned, “i love that the koi fish also wanted to boop him.” Since the upload, the Instagram video has received over 25K likes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com/news/180029-dog-golden-retriever-animal-instagram-video" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Gentle Dog Attracts All Kinds of Animals in Compilation Video;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Gentle Dog Attracts All Kinds of Animals in Compilation Video&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:DogTime;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;DogTime&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 17 Jun 2025 15:12:54 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMid0FVX3lxTE9oa0kyWGxtNFVRUnduaVp5MURhWlZHUnNwMTZxWTNLbHZrZjlSaGlWQ1BOcU5PLWk1VnBSVllaakppeS1KSFBsUDFLbkVhblJySVlZX1d6aVlTczJ6NVdlY3I2Z1VrNDNFeUdWcWxxNngyNEVZQk9J</guid></item><item><title>如果您已经接受了这6种日常生活，那么您就是优雅衰老的大师- VegOut | If you’ve embraced these 6 daily routines, you are a master of graceful aging - VegOut</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMisgFBVV95cUxNMXUyTzhlZ1o3TTlSR1pqSkI0elg1SjhDY3JHaHQ2QUgtVTRlZlZLZ3lXTFJpaHFwazZYRzFGb2dzRUk2bHZmNGVFWFVwblN3WVBQVm9NdXIwVGdiMndYZmFFRGRpaWszV25jVGhQMTU5M0VRYU1jM1I0RTlfSVBEMWk5Mzc1Y2VCWWUyZHhsNzdrODZvQnR5MEM0MnlSd3ZHYTNMOFNSZXRXQkIxNTdPTVhR?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page__content mt-4"&gt;
							&lt;p data-start="118" data-end="515"&gt;We were halfway through brunch when my friend Cora—who just turned 60—whipped a resistance band from her purse “in case a park workout breaks out later.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="118" data-end="515"&gt;Everyone laughed, but no one was surprised. Cora has become the unofficial yard‑stick for aging well in our circle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="118" data-end="515"&gt;She carries herself with the calm of someone who’s done the emotional math and decided each day is worth compound interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="517" data-end="849"&gt;That got me thinking: What line items belong on the “aging gracefully” balance sheet?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="517" data-end="849"&gt;After a decade of turning financial dashboards into habit trackers, I’ve landed on six daily routines that raise your vitality bottom line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="517" data-end="849"&gt;Each one is actionable, budget‑friendly, and—if you already practice them—proof you’re ahead of the curve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="856" data-end="892"&gt;1. Moving like it’s non‑negotiable&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="894" data-end="1296"&gt;Picture a zero‑based budget: every dollar gets assigned before the month begins.&lt;br data-start="974" data-end="977"&gt;Graceful agers treat movement the same way—no leftovers, no “maybe tomorrow.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="894" data-end="1296"&gt;My own spreadsheet shows three non‑consecutive 10‑minute blocks: a brisk walk between morning meetings, a set of body‑weight squats before lunch, and a dance‑along video after work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="894" data-end="1296"&gt;That’s it. Thirty minutes, yet the ROI keeps compounding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1298" data-end="1675"&gt;Harvard epidemiologist &lt;strong data-start="1321" data-end="1338"&gt;Dr. I‑Min Lee&lt;/strong&gt; calls exercise “the closest thing we have to a magic pill” for longevity &lt;span class="" data-state="closed"&gt;&lt;span class="ms-1 inline-flex max-w-full items-center relative top-[-0.094rem] animate-[show_150ms_ease-in]"&gt;&lt;a class="flex h-4.5 overflow-hidden rounded-xl px-2 text-[0.5625em] font-medium text-token-text-secondary! bg-[#F4F4F4]! dark:bg-[#303030]! transition-colors duration-150 ease-in-out" href="https://www.harvardmagazine.com/2023/harvard-scientists-exercise-science-and-health?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;span class="relative start-0 bottom-0 flex h-full w-full items-center"&gt;&lt;span class="flex h-4 w-full items-center justify-between overflow-hidden"&gt;&lt;span class="max-w-full grow truncate overflow-hidden text-center"&gt;harvardmagazine.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1298" data-end="1675"&gt;The benefits read like an all‑in‑one ETF: lower blood pressure, better insulin sensitivity, brighter mood. And because micro‑workouts sidestep the “I need an hour” objection, they’re the easiest way to lock in gains daily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1677" data-end="1877"&gt;If you’re already penciling movement into your calendar—walking calls, stair breaks, yoga stretches while the kettle boils—you’re signaling to your future self that mobility is non‑negotiable capital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="1884" data-end="1924"&gt;2. Prioritizing sleep like your 401(k)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1926" data-end="2207"&gt;You wouldn’t skip automatic contributions to a retirement plan; why skip the nightly deposits of deep sleep?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1926" data-end="2207"&gt;Neuroscientist &lt;strong data-start="2050" data-end="2068"&gt;Matthew Walker&lt;/strong&gt; calls sleep “the Swiss Army knife of health” &lt;span class="" data-state="closed"&gt;&lt;span class="ms-1 inline-flex max-w-full items-center relative top-[-0.094rem] animate-[show_150ms_ease-in]"&gt;&lt;a class="flex h-4.5 overflow-hidden rounded-xl px-2 text-[0.5625em] font-medium text-token-text-secondary! bg-[#F4F4F4]! dark:bg-[#303030]! transition-colors duration-150 ease-in-out" href="https://www.npr.org/2017/11/13/563831137/the-swiss-army-knife-of-health-a-good-nights-sleep?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;span class="relative start-0 bottom-0 flex h-full w-full items-center"&gt;&lt;span class="flex h-4 w-full items-center justify-between overflow-hidden"&gt;&lt;span class="max-w-full grow truncate overflow-hidden text-center"&gt;npr.org&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, repairing everything from memory to immune function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2209" data-end="2460"&gt;A trick I borrowed from budgeting: “pay yourself first.” At 9 p.m., phone goes on airplane mode, lights dim, lo‑fi playlist cues the wind‑down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2209" data-end="2460"&gt;This simple rule shaved 20 minutes off my sleep‑onset time—worth roughly two extra hours of REM per week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2462" data-end="2728"&gt;Already guarding an eight‑hour window? That’s mastery in action. Quality sleep stabilizes appetite hormones, sharpens emotional regulation, and even improves skin barrier repair—dividends makeup can’t fake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2462" data-end="2728"&gt;Keep treating bedtime like it belongs on the balance sheet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="2735" data-end="2774"&gt;3. Feeding your gut’s retirement fund&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2776" data-end="3075"&gt;Fiber and fermented foods are the dividend stocks of nutrition: boring until you notice they keep paying out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2776" data-end="3075"&gt;I batch‑prep overnight oats with chia and stir a spoonful of homemade kimchi (my old fermenting hobby) into salads. The goal is 25–30 grams of fiber and at least one probiotic food daily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3077" data-end="3343"&gt;Why? A diverse gut microbiome produces short‑chain fatty acids that lower inflammation—an under‑the‑radar driver of age‑related decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3077" data-end="3343"&gt;People who age gracefully often talk about “feeling light” after meals; their microbiota balance is doing unsung heavy lifting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3345" data-end="3533"&gt;If you’re already sipping kombucha, sprinkling flaxseed, or swapping white rice for quinoa, you’re future‑proofing your metabolism and mood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3345" data-end="3533"&gt;Consider it interest that never stops accruing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="3540" data-end="3573"&gt;4. Keeping curiosity on autopay&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3575" data-end="3812"&gt;Remember Cora’s resistance band? She also just took a pottery class and is learning basic Korean, because K‑dramas “hit different when you get the jokes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3575" data-end="3812"&gt;Novel skill‑building isn’t a midlife vanity project; it’s neural cross‑training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3814" data-end="4132"&gt;A Johns Hopkins–led study found that older adults who learned multiple real‑world skills simultaneously showed cognitive gains comparable to people 30 years younger &lt;span class="" data-state="closed"&gt;&lt;span class="ms-1 inline-flex max-w-full items-center relative top-[-0.094rem] animate-[show_150ms_ease-in]"&gt;&lt;a class="flex h-4.5 overflow-hidden rounded-xl px-2 text-[0.5625em] font-medium text-token-text-secondary! bg-[#F4F4F4]! dark:bg-[#303030]! transition-colors duration-150 ease-in-out" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10394988/?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;span class="relative start-0 bottom-0 flex h-full w-full items-center"&gt;&lt;span class="flex h-4 w-full items-center justify-between overflow-hidden"&gt;&lt;span class="max-w-full grow truncate overflow-hidden text-center"&gt;pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3814" data-end="4132"&gt;Think of each new hobby—gardening, coding, ukulele—as a diversified asset that hedges against mental stagnation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4134" data-end="4395"&gt;Already blocking 20 minutes for Duolingo, Udemy, or a DIY home‑repair video? You’re feeding the brain’s growth budget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4134" data-end="4395"&gt;Keep stacking micro‑lessons; the returns arrive as sharper recall, creative problem‑solving, and a sense of agency no wrinkle cream can match.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="4402" data-end="4443"&gt;5. Banking micro‑moments of mindfulness&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4445" data-end="4658"&gt;When anxiety spikes, I open a blank Google Sheet, breathe three times, and do nothing else for 60 seconds—it’s my mental “reconciliation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4445" data-end="4658"&gt;The point isn’t productivity; it’s noticing tension before it compounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4660" data-end="4961"&gt;Mindfulness practices—from two‑minute box breaths to a phone‑free walk—reduce cortisol and strengthen the prefrontal cortex, the decision‑maker that keeps reactions aligned with long‑term goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4660" data-end="4961"&gt;The beauty? You can sprinkle these pauses between any tasks without blocking extra calendar real estate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4963" data-end="5194"&gt;If you’re already pausing to sense your shoulders unclench or naming the flavor of your coffee before chugging it, you’re not just calm—you’re structurally upgrading neural circuitry that decides how gracefully you navigate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="5201" data-end="5238"&gt;6. Cultivating social micro‑touches&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5240" data-end="5543"&gt;Longevity researchers keep circling back to one metric: meaningful connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5240" data-end="5543"&gt;Yet the graceful agers I survey don’t necessarily have huge networks; they have consistent micro‑touches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5240" data-end="5543"&gt;A 90‑second voice note to a cousin, a two‑line text to an old colleague, a hallway compliment that says “I see you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5545" data-end="5846"&gt;Think of each interaction as a small deposit into a shared emotional account. Over months, it yields trust, perspective, even accountability—critical when setbacks hit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5545" data-end="5846"&gt;Social micro‑touches also act like real‑time market indicators; they reveal when your energy is dipping or resentment creeping in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5848" data-end="6020"&gt;If you’re already nudging relationships forward with tiny, authentic gestures, you’re reinforcing a safety net that cushions aging’s inevitable curveballs. That’s graceful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="6027" data-end="6043"&gt;Final words&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6045" data-end="6161"&gt;Aging well isn’t a grand slam; it’s dollar‑cost averaging—steady inputs that harness time instead of wrestling it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6163" data-end="6172"&gt;If you:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul data-start="6173" data-end="6432"&gt;
&lt;li data-start="6173" data-end="6219"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6175" data-end="6219"&gt;schedule movement like a standing expense,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-start="6220" data-end="6266"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6222" data-end="6266"&gt;clock eight solid hours as non‑negotiable,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-start="6267" data-end="6296"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6269" data-end="6296"&gt;fiber‑feed the gut daily,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-start="6297" data-end="6349"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6299" data-end="6349"&gt;learn something delightfully useless on purpose,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-start="6350" data-end="6392"&gt;

But sometimes even your favorite foods can do more harm than good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="1" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;The food we eat is packed with different nutrients that impact our bodies in their own ways. When you take medication and eat certain foods, they can interact negatively and affect the efficacy of your medication or induce unpleasant side effects. And some of the most common culprits are ingredients you may already have in your kitchen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="2" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;We consulted &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewfranklynmiller/" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewfranklynmiller/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Dr Andy Franklyn-Miller," data-node-id="2.1" class="body-link css-1i7jlb0 emevuu60"&gt;Dr Andy Franklyn-Miller,&lt;/a&gt; MBBS, PhD, MRCGP FFSEM, a dual board-certified Sports and Exercise Medicine Physician and Chief Medical and Innovation Officer at &lt;a href="https://www.nuritas.com/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.nuritas.com/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Nuritas" data-node-id="2.3" class="body-link css-1i7jlb0 emevuu60"&gt;Nuritas&lt;/a&gt;, to break down some of the most common foods that can interact with medications. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="4" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;But first, a disclaimer: this is by no means an exhaustive list of ingredients or a substitute for medical advice from your own healthcare team. When you start taking a new medication, we suggest you consult your doctor or pharmacist about what foods to look out for and how to adjust your diet accordingly. Depending on the medication and your own individual care plan, those adjustments can range from avoiding a food entirely to reducing your intake to carefully timing the consumption of your food with your doses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="grapefruit" data-node-id="6" class="body-h2 css-1iyazm5 emevuu60"&gt;Grapefruit&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="8" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;If you take prescription medication, you may need to put down your &lt;a href="https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/a43758194/paloma-cocktail-recipe/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/a43758194/paloma-cocktail-recipe/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="paloma" data-node-id="8.1" class="body-link css-1i7jlb0 emevuu60"&gt;paloma&lt;/a&gt;. Grapefruit, as well as its juice, is a common ingredient that interacts with a wide range of prescriptions. “Grapefruit inhibits the enzyme CYP3A4 in the liver and intestines, which metabolizes many drugs,” Franklyn-Miller says. “This can lead to higher drug concentrations in the bloodstream.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="9" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Without this enzyme, your medications will accumulate and linger in your bloodstream, which can increase your risk of side effects. Grapefruit causes interactions across several drug categories, including statins, calcium channel blockers, and immunosuppressants. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="dairy-products" data-node-id="10" class="body-h2 css-1iyazm5 emevuu60"&gt;Dairy Products&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;section data-embed="body-image" data-lazy-id="P0-14" data-node-id="11" class="embed"&gt;&lt;div size="medium" data-embed="body-image" class="align-center size-medium embed css-6i9ia4 e1fodxfw4"&gt;&lt;div class="css-uwraif e1fodxfw3"&gt;&lt;p class="css-swqnqv e1fodxfw2"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-theme-key="photo-credit-figcaption" class="css-1am3yn9 e1g9hcy40"&gt;&lt;span data-theme-key="photo-credit-creditor" class="css-1wn44x5 e1geg53v2"&gt;Jose A.

One of the most common nutrients is vitamin K, which plays an essential role in blood clotting and bone health. But if you take certain anticoagulant blood pressure medications, vitamin K is more harmful than helpful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="17" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;“Foods like spinach, kale, and broccoli, high in vitamin K, can counteract the effects of anticoagulants like warfarin, which relies on inhibiting vitamin K-dependent clotting factors to prevent blood clots,” says Franklyn-Miller.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="alcohol" data-node-id="18" class="body-h2 css-1iyazm5 emevuu60"&gt;Alcohol&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="20" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Medical professionals warn about the adverse health effects of consuming large quantities of alcohol, which is classified as a &lt;a href="https://www.delish.com/kitchen-tools/a64342317/is-drinking-wine-every-day-healthy/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.delish.com/kitchen-tools/a64342317/is-drinking-wine-every-day-healthy/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="carcinogen" data-node-id="20.1" class="body-link css-1i7jlb0 emevuu60"&gt;carcinogen&lt;/a&gt;. But beyond increasing your risk of cancer and organ damage in the long term, alcohol also can have a significant impact on your prescription medications in the short term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="21" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;“Alcohol can amplify or diminish the effects of medications,” Franklyn-Miller says. “For instance, it enhances the sedative effects of benzodiazepines like diazepam and increases the risk of liver toxicity when combined with acetaminophen.” Alcohol also greatly increases the sedative effects of melatonin, which is why Franklyn-Miller suggests the use of other natural peptides as alternative sleep aids. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="aged-cured--fermented-foods" data-node-id="22" class="body-h2 css-1iyazm5 emevuu60"&gt;Aged, Cured, &amp;amp; Fermented Foods&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;section data-embed="body-image" data-lazy-id="P0-17" data-node-id="23" class="embed"&gt;&lt;div size="medium" data-embed="body-image" class="align-center size-medium embed css-6i9ia4 e1fodxfw4"&gt;&lt;div class="css-uwraif e1fodxfw3"&gt;&lt;p class="css-swqnqv e1fodxfw2"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-theme-key="photo-credit-figcaption" class="css-1am3yn9 e1g9hcy40"&gt;&lt;span data-theme-key="photo-credit-creditor" class="css-1wn44x5 e1geg53v2"&gt;LauriPatterson&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="css-1j11w10 e1geg53v0"&gt;//&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="css-1wn44x5 e1geg53v1"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="24" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Some of the oldest and most prevalent food preservation techniques, like aging, curing, and fermenting, lead to the development of the amino acid tyramine. Tyramine can be found in large quantities in foods like cheese, soy sauce, sauerkraut, sausages, and different types of alcohol. It’s a natural byproduct of these preservation processes, but tyramine also interacts with particular medications. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="25" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Franklyn-Miller says tyramine-rich foods “can cause dangerous blood pressure spikes in patients taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), used for depression or Parkinson’s disease.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="26" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Again: this list isn't comprehensive, nor is it meant to replace guidance from your doctor or medical team.

                        &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drinking coffee appears to be linked with healthier aging by potentially lowering the risk of chronic diseases, such as heart disease, diabetes and neurodegenerative disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“A recent study followed over 47,000 women for several decades, and it found that those who consumed the highest amounts of caffeine, primarily from coffee, have 13% greater odds of healthy aging,” said&lt;a href="https://mydoctor.kaiserpermanente.org/mas/providers/christieyoussef" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt; Christie Youssef&lt;/a&gt;, a family medicine physician with Kaiser Permanente in Fairfax, Virginia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Healthy aging in this study was defined as reaching the age of 70 or older without major chronic diseases or cognitive impairment,” said Youssef.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Youssef said the study adds to a growing body evidence of benefits of caffeinated coffee, but cannot prove direct cause and effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1084789" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;According to the study, researchers&lt;/a&gt; didn’t find any indication that tea or decaffeinated coffee held the same benefits as caffeinated coffee. Drinking more cola was tied to a significantly lower chance of healthy aging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“To consume coffee moderately, you want to consider sticking to two to four cups per day,” said Youssef. “And keep in mind that one cup means 8 ounces, not a jumbo mug.”
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She suggests avoiding limiting sugar and high fat creamers, especially those containing processed additives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Think about flavoring your coffee with a splash of unsweetened plant milk, or cinnamon or vanilla extract, instead of syrups or flavored creamers,” Youssef said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While benefits of caffeine include improved alertness and memory support, excessive intake can cause jitteriness and insomnia, headaches or increased heart rate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://cdmcd.co/k9MRKx" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;The research&lt;/a&gt;, led by Harvard University’s school of public health, was presented on June 2 at the American Society for Nutrition’s annual meeting.&lt;/p&gt;

the medications on &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/social-media"&gt;social media&lt;/a&gt;, often illegally, and thanks to online pharmacies, it seems easier than ever to get hold of some.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-image_articleImage__eyzAn"&gt;&lt;cite class="image-credit_imageCredit__YMlqS"&gt;While some blokes might think they've stumbled upon a miracle, it seems its all an illusion (Getty Stock)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is Ozempic penis?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Well, some blokes who have been using the drug are reporting some growth downstairs, with plenty of people on Reddit noticing the 'issue'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;In the comments, multiple site users confirmed they’d also seen positive change, which is certainly more than can be said to the &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/news/health/ozempic-health-warning-mhra-471511-20250605"&gt;less fortunate females&lt;/a&gt; who are using the jab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;But before you go rushing to buy some, in the hope that you can gain rather than lose as most people use the jabs for, a urologist has seemingly debunked the theory about maximising your manhood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is really happening?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Rather than it actually adding centimetres to your member, it seems as if the fat around the penis is actually just reducing, which gives off the illusion of things being a bit bigger - which is certainly better than nothing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Speaking to HuffPost UK, urologist Dr Martina Ambardjieva explained: “As a urologist, I can say there’s no evidence that semaglutide (Ozempic) or other GLP-1 agonists cause actual penile tissue growth,” she shared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-image_articleImage__eyzAn"&gt;&lt;cite class="image-credit_imageCredit__YMlqS"&gt;Ozempic has become very popular among those wanting to lose weight (Getty stock)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;“However, there is a plausible physiological explanation for why some men perceive their penis to be larger after significant weight loss.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;“When a man loses weight, particularly rapidly as with GLP-1 drugs, this fat pad shrinks, revealing more of the shaft and making the penis appear longer,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;“It’s not growth, it’s exposure.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Still, this sounds like sunshine and rainbows compared to some of the other less desirable side effects of the drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>LADbible</author><pubDate>Tue, 17 Jun 2025 14:38:58 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiogFBVV95cUxNWGRVemN5NlB6c0l3bEFxTDNya18zYmpFTVRDcnFPSXhZajJhaHF4NktmSUJuS1JLZXAwcTg4ZTRqMXY5QmhxYVpLbVNjckhidEpvUThSNC1KSXZsRGc5ekdiZWFXaU5uN0wyYXFZekdQa2lZNlp3elFvZnl6WG1iV3BtT2huOC1URHdJQjA0aE1BZkpYUk9sZzBvWVJPZzdLSFE</guid></item><item><title>新泽西州剃刀刀片喉咙新冠肺炎亚变种病情加重-补丁 | Razor Blade Throat COVID Subvariant Sickens More In NJ - Patch</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilAFBVV95cUxQWFRYQ0dMMGoyeUhqanNWOTc4bXdKNUM0RFF3dzdBcHRjb2RyVnpZamdxcjFRcFpFaER3RXlZNUNvTE9OYURlRWk3NkNCSm9BeUNSZ3FELUNjNVV6VmJsSXFLQmJsX1VLRTNRLU9TYnc5NmlBckhHbFNmcnQzX0pZb25Ba1Q3bWdsV2FtM2hYVm1wR0pN0gGqAUFVX3lxTFByT3ZPamFJSm56amotRjhpSUM4MTI5RER4UlhsWTNZa1ZKelVlWlhvUWRJSG9MZk1WUXR5c0FRdWlYc1BHRkxhSDFrZnEwWVFlZHprMjNqTXR5WHNTbWlqVUdzdWQzcHNVT3JFTUNVOFIxS0VJcmlYQWkzVDRaaENtVDZEVWdNeHhaXzhPTXJoajd6ZnppVHc2Y1FmQUtpWlgtVTduLVk2UlN3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__LDG2k"&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW JERSEY - The new COVID-19 omicron subvariant, Nimbus (NB.1.8.1), has become the dominant strain across the United States and in the Garden State. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__LDG2k"&gt;&lt;p&gt;While 140 total cases across all strains of COVID have been reported in the state, the latest &lt;a href="https://www.nj.gov/health/respiratory-viruses/data-and-reports/#respiratory-illness-dashboard" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;available data&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Needles 1,000 times thinner than a human hair could replace painful cancer biopsies and render obsolete the traditional methods of diagnosing diseases, according to new research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The patches containing tens of millions of ‘nanoneedles’ offer a “painless and less invasive” alternative for millions of patients worldwide who undergo the common biopsy in order to confirm or monitor diseases including cancer and Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But traditional biopsies can cause complications, and the pain can deter patients from seeking early diagnosis or follow-up tests. They also remove small pieces of tissue, which limits how often and how comprehensively doctors can analyze diseased organs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, scientists at King’s College London have developed a nanoneedle patch that painlessly collects molecular information from tissues—without removing or damaging them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They say it could allow healthcare teams to monitor disease in real time and perform multiple, repeatable tests from the same area—something impossible with current biopsies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pgs-dpg-flex" data-pgs-partner-id="good-news-network"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the nanoneedles are so thin and don’t remove tissue, the research team found that they cause no damage or pain for patients compared to standard biopsies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BREAKTHROUGH&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a title="Scientists Identify New Way Cancers Sustain Themselves–and How Ginger Could Disrupt it" href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/scientists-identify-new-way-cancers-sustain-themselves-and-that-ginger-could-disrupt-it/" rel="bookmark"&gt;Scientists Identify New Way Cancers Sustain Themselves–and How Ginger Could Disrupt it&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We have been working on nanoneedles for 12 years, but this is our most exciting development yet,” said research leader Dr. Ciro Chiappini &lt;a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/news/tens-millions-nanoneedles-could-replace-painful-cancer-biopsies" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;in a King’s College statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It opens a world of possibilities for people with brain cancer, Alzheimer’s, and for advancing personalized medicine. It will allow scientists – and eventually clinicians – to study disease in real time like never before.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In preclinical studies, the team applied the patch to brain cancer tissue taken from human biopsies and mouse models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nanoneedles extracted molecular ‘fingerprints’—including lipids, proteins, and mRNAs—from cells, without removing or harming the tissue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WOW&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a title="Bear Shocks Vets By Going into Remission From Terminal Cancer After Taking Meds in Honey–a Rare Treat That Delights Her" href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/bear-shocks-vets-by-going-into-remission-from-terminal-cancer-after-taking-meds-in-honey-a-rare-treat-that-delights-her/" rel="bookmark"&gt;Bear Shocks Vets By Going into Remission From Terminal Cancer After Taking Meds in Honey–a Rare Treat That Delights Her&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tissue imprint is then analyzed using mass spectrometry and artificial intelligence, giving doctors detailed insights into whether a tumor is present, and how it is responding to treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This approach provides multidimensional molecular information from different types of cells within the same tissue,” explained Dr. Chiappini. “Traditional biopsies simply cannot do that. And because the process does not destroy the tissue, we can sample the same tissue multiple times, which was previously impossible.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SAFELY TARGETING TUMORS&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a title="Cancer-Fighting Implant Developed to Treat Tumors by Safely Triggering Potent Immune Responses" href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/cancer-fighting-implant-developed-to-treat-tumors-by-safely-triggering-potent-immune-responses/" rel="bookmark"&gt;Cancer-Fighting Implant Developed to Treat Tumors by Safely Triggering Potent Immune Responses&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He says the patch, described in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41565-025-01955-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Nature Nanotechnology&lt;/a&gt;, could be used during brain surgery to help surgeons make faster, more precise decisions: by applying the patch to a suspicious area, results could be obtained within 20 minutes and speed up decisions about removing cancerous tissue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Made using the same manufacturing techniques as computer chips, the nanoneedles can be integrated into common medical devices such as bandages, endoscopes and contact lenses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;INSPIRING RESEARCH&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a title="Fighting Cancer Without Fighting: Scientists Switch Tumor Cells Back to Healthy Ones at ‘Critical’ Moment" href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/fighting-cancer-without-fighting-scientists-switch-tumor-cells-back-to-healthy-ones-at-critical-moment/" rel="bookmark"&gt;Fighting Cancer Without Fighting: Scientists Switch Tumor Cells Back to Healthy Ones at ‘Critical’ Moment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This could be the beginning of the end for painful biopsies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our technology opens up new ways to diagnose and monitor disease safely and painlessly – helping doctors and patients make better, faster decisions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SHARE THE DEVELOPMENT With Medical Crews on Social Media…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Further, the latter can impair mental alertness and increase the risk of falls or accidents, Dr. McDanel says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/study-reveals-surprising-factor-may-142500059.html" data-ylk="slk:New Study Reveals Surprising Factor That May Increase Dementia Risk;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Study Reveals Surprising Factor That May Increase Dementia Risk&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;This is particularly true for older adults who take this medication. “In older adults, reduced brain reserve makes them more vulnerable to these effects,” Dr. Kamboj explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In fact, Dr. Nguyen would say it’s “very risky” for elderly patients to take a high dosage of doxylamine succinate for a prolonged period. The level of risk depends on the dose, duration and individual factors, McDanel adds, like age, other medications taken and overall brain health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Within certain parameters, it *can* be safe—and even helpful and recommended. “Generally speaking, doxylamine can be safe when used in the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible,” Dr. McDanel says. “It is even recommended fairly regularly for &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/1-early-pregnancy-symptom-most-210000339.html" data-ylk="slk:pregnant women;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;pregnant women&lt;/a&gt; to help with &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/normal-feel-nauseous-every-day-172500216.html" data-ylk="slk:nausea;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;nausea&lt;/a&gt; as it is effective for this, along with vitamin B6, and is safe for the fetus.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Since the safety profile is so individualized, your best bet is to talk to your primary care provider, who knows your history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;It’s also worth noting that when it comes to sleep, medication may not be the answer we would assume it to be. “They don’t provide the deep, restorative sleep that our brains need,” Dr. Allen says. “In fact, they can disrupt the natural sleep architecture, leading to less &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/alzheimers-dementia-rem-sleep-study-january-2025" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:REM sleep;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;REM sleep&lt;/a&gt;, which is crucial for memory consolidation and emotional regulation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Safer, Effective Alternatives&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;If you need more long-term support with allergies or sleep, other options are probably safer bets. Ahead, doctors share tips and treatments to consider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;For allergies&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Try a newer antihistamine, like loratadine (Claritin), cetirizine (Zyrtec) or fexofenadine (Allegra). Dr. Allen says they're generally safer because they don’t cross the blood-brain barrier as easily and have fewer side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Second-generation antihistamines are also less likely to make you drowsy, a major complaint with first-generation antihistamines. “Allergists often recommend these over first-generation antihistamines due to the lower chance of causing sedation, while maintaining the same, if not more, clinical efficacy for treating allergic conditions,” Dr. McDanel adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;She also encourages steroid nasal sprays, addressing underlying medical conditions and talking to your healthcare provider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Additionally, Dr. Nguyen mentions prescription medication, such as montelukast, and allergy shots. “Allergy immunotherapy (allergy shots) is the most effective treatment for moderate to severe allergies,” she adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/fda-warns-severe-risk-popular-091524232.html" data-ylk="slk:FDA Warns of Newly Identified ‘Severe’ Risk of Popular Over-the-Counter Allergy Medications;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FDA Warns of Newly Identified ‘Severe’ Risk of Popular Over-the-Counter Allergy Medications&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;For sleep&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;If you struggle with sleep, Dr. Allen has several suggestions. His first recommendation is cognitive behavioral therapy for &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/chronic-insomnia-patient-journey" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:insomnia;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;insomnia&lt;/a&gt; (CBT-I). “This is the gold standard for chronic sleep problems,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/most-important-habit-want-8-213000424.html" data-ylk="slk:Sleep hygiene;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;Sleep hygiene&lt;/a&gt; is still important too. Need a refresher on what that looks like? Dr. Allen encourages the following:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="mb-4"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Establishing a consistent sleep routine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Limiting screen time before bed&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Avoiding stimulants late in the day&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Creating a cool, dark sleeping environment&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Talking to a doctor about medication (or supplements) if necessary&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Dr. Nguyen agrees that CBT-I and good sleep habits are good options. “This is considered the safest way to treat insomnia,” she explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;And again, this long-term concern about doxylamine and brain health doesn’t mean the medication is totally off limits. “Occasional use (e.g., for a bad cold or jet lag) is not known to pose major harm in healthy adults,” Dr. Kamboj says. “The concern arises with habitual or long-term use, particularly in older individuals.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Up Next:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/m-brain-scientist-2-minute-172932467.html" data-ylk="slk:Related: ‘I’m a Brain Scientist, and This 2-Minute Habit Makes Me Feel 10 Times Sharper’;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;Related: ‘I’m a Brain Scientist, and This 2-Minute Habit Makes Me Feel 10 Times Sharper’&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Sources&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/common-over-the-counter-medication-may-harm-brain-health" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:This Common Over-the-Counter Medication May Harm Brain Health, Doctors Say—Do You Take It?;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;This Common Over-the-Counter Medication May Harm Brain Health, Doctors Say—Do You Take It?&lt;/a&gt; first appeared on Parade on Jun 17, 2025&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;i&gt;This story was originally reported by &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/common-over-the-counter-medication-may-harm-brain-health" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Parade;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Parade&lt;/a&gt; on Jun 17, 2025, where it first appeared.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Tue, 17 Jun 2025 14:02:33 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiggFBVV95cUxQbUtIWVRXT04xek9TdkVvMmx0WlMyMS0tSFY0QUVTN0Jkbk1CTVJ5U1g5N2xrem5OMWwtQ0R1RWkwcUtWYUZWcFdpNHNtY1ltbXJXQjJBRkJ4LXpCMS1rZW9VSjF2cV9nV2h3ZzRTUzJ6YWhYZTlsd0szZHB3RE1Xa3JB</guid></item><item><title>根据营养师的说法，在Aldi购买排名第一的抗炎零食- EatingWell | The #1 Anti-Inflammatory Snack to Buy at Aldi, According to Dietitians - EatingWell</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihgFBVV95cUxONGZZcm9xR05xZjEwbWJkOEY0WjlHdjBOQWdhVmk5QjNBbm9QVlpqVHp0a0hSeVk2YXZOYnlmenFScWIxbXNHN0s3Z2lzdnNpU09hNk00U2Z0TUNtZzZvVTRhSGdzc0hFMnMyRnkwa3hXMTV3LXAxVEJBd2lnMmF3dzc4M3pIUQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-callout--summary mntl-sc-block-universal-callout--tips mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-summary callout--bordered" data-text="Key Points" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While often associated with more expensive items, like salmon filets or goji berries, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/292071/the-best-foods-to-eat-to-fight-inflammation/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;anti-inflammatory foods&lt;/a&gt; don’t have to be expensive or found only at specialty stores. In fact, some of the most powerful anti-inflammatory foods are hiding in plain sight—like on the shelves at your local Aldi. While the store offers plenty of nutritious options, one standout is &lt;a href="https://shop.aldi.us/store/aldi/products/20197952-southern-grove-chopped-walnuts-8-oz" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Southern Grove Chopped Walnuts.&lt;/a&gt; We spoke with registered dietitians to understand why it’s a top snack for combating chronic inflammation and how to choose other anti-inflammatory options while cruising the aisles at Aldi.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; These unsalted walnuts are more than just a crunchy snack. They’re also rich in &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/291962/8-best-vegan-omega-3-rich-foods/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;plant-based omega-3s&lt;/a&gt;, antioxidants and fiber, making them an ideal choice for folks looking to reduce inflammation and support overall health. Here are some of the reasons we picked Southern Grove Chopped Walnuts as the best anti-inflammatory snack at Aldi.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; They’re Rich in Plant-Based Omega-3s &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Walnuts are an excellent source of alpha-linolenic acid (ALA)—a type of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8035578/omega-3-supplements-benefits/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;omega-3 fatty acid&lt;/a&gt; your body can’t produce on its own. ALA is a short-chain omega-3 mainly found in plant foods that &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-nutrient-to-lower-inflammation-8783795" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;helps reduce inflammation&lt;/a&gt; and support heart health, says &lt;a href="https://nourishednutritionandfitness.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="3" rel="nofollow"&gt;Eliza Whitaker, MS, RDN&lt;/a&gt;. While walnuts are often compared to salmon for their impressive omega-3 content, it’s worth noting that ALA has to get converted into EPA and DHA—types of omega-3s found in fatty fish—and the process isn’t the most efficient. Still, don’t let that deter you from enjoying ALA-rich foods—this healthy fat still packs a potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory punch.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

These compounds act as antioxidants, protecting cells from oxidative stress and inflammation.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Once digested, gut bacteria convert ellagitannins into urolithins, which have demonstrated anti-inflammatory effects, particularly in the colon.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; In fact, one study found that consuming walnuts daily resulted in higher levels of urolithin A and reduced inflammatory markers in the blood and in colon tissue.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Another way walnuts may help combat inflammation is through their beneficial effects on &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/how-your-gut-health-impacts-your-body-8695122" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;the gut microbiome&lt;/a&gt;. “Walnuts have long been studied for their gut health benefits, and they shine in this research,” says Danahy. For example, one study found significant improvements in the amount of beneficial gut bacteria in people eating a walnut-enriched diet.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; So what do billions of microorganisms have to do with inflammation? Research consistently shows that a healthy gut microbiome helps reduce inflammation via multiple pathways, including through the production of short-chain fatty acids—anti-inflammatory compounds produced by healthy gut bacteria.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Walnuts provide a unique trio of nutrients—omega-3s, vitamin E and polyphenoles—that may &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290813/mind-diet-best-foods-to-eat-to-keep-your-brain-young/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;support brain health&lt;/a&gt; as you age. For instance, one review linked these nutrients with improved memory, quicker cognitive processing speed and reduced risk of neurodegenerative disease in older adults.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Depending on your location, one 8-ounce bag of Southern Grove Chopped Walnuts costs $3.19, which is about half the price of the same sized bag (but different brands) at stores like Safeway and WholeFoods.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When shopping at Aldi for other anti-inflammatory snacks, keep these expert-backed tips on what to look for in mind:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Omega-3s: &lt;/strong&gt;One review found that consuming &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/foods-with-as-many-omega-3s-as-salmon-11681920" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;omega-3-rich foods&lt;/a&gt; daily was linked with lower levels of inflammatory markers.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; For this reason, consider stocking up on walnuts, chia seeds, flax seeds and fatty fish, like tuna and salmon. “Even a small handful of walnuts a day can make a difference,” adds Danahy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fiber: &lt;/strong&gt;Fiber supports gut health and can help &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/habit-to-avoid-for-chronic-inflammation-8644317" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;reduce systemic inflammation&lt;/a&gt;. Danahy suggests &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8024516/best-high-fiber-snack-foods/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;high-fiber snacks&lt;/a&gt; like oats, mixed nuts and berries. Whitaker also adds that, when it comes to snacks, pairing fiber with healthy fats can help stabilize hunger between meals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Little, if Any, Added Sugar: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/sneaky-signs-eating-too-much-sugar-11721349" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;Diets high in added sugar&lt;/a&gt; have been linked to increased inflammation and risk of chronic diseases. For this reason, it’s best to look for foods that are &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/whats-the-difference-between-natural-and-added-sugars-11694001" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="5"&gt;low in—or free of—added sugars&lt;/a&gt;. “Choosing whole-food snacks over ultra-processed ones is an easy way to avoid excess sugar,” says Whitaker.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Aldi’s Southern Grove Chopped Walnuts is an unassuming pantry staple that packs an impressive nutritional punch. Thanks to their omega-3, fiber and antioxidant content, walnuts are an excellent snack choice if you’re looking to lower inflammation and support gut and brain health. The unsalted, pre-chopped walnuts at Aldi makes it easy to sprinkle them over oatmeal, yogurt or salads. And remember: walnuts are just one of many anti-inflammatory foods &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-food-experts-buy-at-aldi-11725240" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;available at Aldi&lt;/a&gt;. Pair these chopped nuts with whole grains, fatty fish and a variety of colorful fruits and vegetables to get the most benefit.

Among 374 adults aged 19 to 82, age, blood pressure, and BMI were the top predictors of success on a focus-and-speed-based attention test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While diet and exercise played a smaller role, they were still associated with better outcomes, particularly in offsetting high BMI or blood pressure.

Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reported in &lt;em&gt;The Journal of Nutrition&lt;/em&gt;, the study found that age, blood pressure and body mass index were the strongest predictors of success on a test called the flanker task, which requires participants to focus on a central object without becoming distracted by flanking information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diet and exercise also played a smaller but relevant role in performance on the test, the team found, sometimes appearing to offset the ill effects of a high BMI or other potentially detrimental factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This study used machine learning to evaluate a host of variables at once to help identify those that align most closely with cognitive performance,” said Naiman Khan, a professor of health and kinesiology at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign who led the work with kinesiology Ph.D. student Shreya Verma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Standard statistical approaches cannot embrace this level of complexity all at once.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To build the model, the team used data collected from 374 adults 19 to 82 years of age. The data included participant demographics, such as age, BMI, blood pressure and physical activity levels, along with dietary patterns and performance on a flanker test that measured their processing speed and accuracy in determining the orientation of a central arrow flanked by other arrows that pointed in the same or opposite direction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is a well-established measure of cognitive function that assesses attention and inhibitory control,” Khan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous studies have found that several factors are implicated in the preservation of cognitive function across the lifespan, Khan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Adherence to the healthy eating index, a measure of diet quality, has been linked to superior executive function and processing speed in older adults,” he said. “Other studies have found that diets that are rich in antioxidants, omega-3 fatty acids and vitamins are associated with better cognitive function.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension, or DASH diet, the Mediterranean diet, and a diet that combines the two, called the MIND diet, all “have been linked to protective effects against cognitive decline and dementia,” the researchers wrote. Physical factors, such as BMI and blood pressure, along with increased physical activity also are strong predictors of cognitive health, or decline, in aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Clearly, cognitive health is driven by a host of factors, but which ones are most important?” Verma said. “We wanted to evaluate the relative strength of each of these factors in combination with all the others.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Machine learning “offers a promising avenue for analyzing large datasets with multiple variables and identifying patterns that may not be apparent through conventional statistical approaches,” the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team tested various machine learning algorithms to see which one best weighed the various factors to predict the speed of accurate responses in the flanker test. The researchers tested the predictive ability of each algorithm, using a variety of approaches to validate those that appeared to perform the best.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found that age was the most influential predictor of performance on the test, followed by diastolic blood pressure, BMI and systolic blood pressure. Adherence to the healthy eating index was less predictive of cognitive performance than blood pressure or BMI but also correlated with better performance on the test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Physical activity emerged as a moderate predictor of reaction time, with results suggesting it may interact with other lifestyle factors, such as diet and body weight, to influence cognitive performance,” Khan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This study reveals how machine learning can bring precision and nuance to the field of nutritional neuroscience,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By moving beyond traditional approaches, machine learning could help tailor strategies for aging populations, individuals with metabolic risks or those seeking to enhance cognitive function through lifestyle changes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Personalized Nutrition Initiative and National Center for Supercomputing Applications at the U. of I. supported this research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Khan is a dietitian and an affiliate faculty member of the Division of Nutritional Sciences, the Neuroscience Program and the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology at Illinois.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this AI and brain health research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#5c3835253d1c353030353233352f72393829" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Diana Yates&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://illinois.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Illinois&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Diana Yates – University of Illinois&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tjnut.2025.05.003" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Predicting cognitive outcome through nutrition and health markers using supervised machine learning&lt;/a&gt;” by Naiman Khan et al. &lt;em&gt;Journal of Nutrition&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Predicting cognitive outcome through nutrition and health markers using supervised machine learning&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="sectitle0015"&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Machine learning (ML) use in health research is growing, yet its application to predict cognitive outcomes using diverse health indicators is underinvestigated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="sectitle0020"&gt;Objectives&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We used ML models to predict cognitive performance based on a set of health and behavioral factors, aiming to identify key contributors to cognitive function for insights into potential personalized interventions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="sectitle0025"&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data from 374 adults aged 19–82 y (227 females) were used to develop ML models predicting cognitive performance (reaction time in milliseconds) on a modified Eriksen flanker task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Features included demographics, anthropometric measures, dietary indices (Healthy Eating Index, Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension, Mediterranean, and Mediterranean–Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay), self-reported physical activity, and systolic and diastolic blood pressures. The data set was split (80:20) for training and testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Predictive models (decision trees, random forest, AdaBoost, XGBoost, gradient boosting, linear, ridge, and lasso regression) were used with hyperparameter tuning and crossvalidation. Feature importance was calculated using permutation importance, whereas performance using mean absolute error (MAE) and mean squared error.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="sectitle0030"&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Random forest regressor exhibited the best performance, with the lowest MAE (training: 0.66 ms; testing: 0.78 ms) and mean squared error (training: 0.70 ms&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;; testing: 1.05 ms&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).

              &lt;p&gt;Asthma is a chronic respiratory disease that often causes sudden and intense shortness of breath. The disease impacts around &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/facts-in-pictures/detail/asthma"&gt;339 million&lt;/a&gt; people worldwide, and in the U.S. nine people on average die from asthma &lt;a href="https://aafa.org/asthma/asthma-facts/"&gt;every&lt;/a&gt; day.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers in the U.K. have found that women who work night shifts are more likely to have moderate or severe asthma than women who work during the day. The study, published Monday in the journal &lt;a href="https://publications.ersnet.org/content/erjor/early/2025/05/28/2312054100137-2025"&gt;ERJ Open Research&lt;/a&gt;, does not reveal any such tendency in men working nightshifts, and could hold important implications for public health guidance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The team had previously shown that permanent night shift workers in general are more likely to suffer from moderate-severe asthma compared to day workers. Scientists also know that asthma is more prevalent and severe in adult &lt;a href="https://publications.ersnet.org/content/errev/30/162/210067"&gt;women&lt;/a&gt; than adult men. “Since increasing numbers of females are becoming shift workers it is important to determine if shift work-associated asthma risk is higher in females,” the researchers wrote in the study. &lt;a href="https://www.nwhealthlaporte.com/shift-work"&gt;Shift&lt;/a&gt; work refers to scheduled working periods that fall outside of traditional daytime hours. “Our main aim was to investigate sex differences in the association between shift work and asthma.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers did so by analyzing data belonging to over 274,541 working people from the U.K. Biobank, a biomedical database open to health researchers. From this initial pool, they found that 5.3% had asthma, and 1.9% of those had moderate or severe asthma. The team then looked into whether the people in these categories worked during the day, during nightshifts, or a mix of both.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The researchers found that female shift workers in general are more likely to suffer from asthma, and women who only work nightshifts have 50% higher likelihood of developing moderate or severe asthma than female daytime workers. Furthermore, the risk increases “with both number of monthly night shifts and longer lifetime duration of night shift work,” they explained. Interestingly, the data did not reveal any differences in the prevalence of asthma in men based on their work schedule.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“This type of research cannot explain why shift work and asthma are linked,” Robert Maidstone, a co-author of the study and a researcher at the University of Manchester’s School of Biological Sciences, said in a university &lt;a href="https://www.manchester.ac.uk/about/news/women-who-work-nightshifts-are-more-likely-to-have-asthma/"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. “However, it could be because shift work disrupts the body clock, including the levels of male and female sex hormones. High testosterone has previously been shown to be protective against asthma, and so lower testosterone in women could play a role. Alternatively, men and women work different types of shift jobs, and this could be a factor.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Among women not taking hormone replacement therapy (&lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/15245-hormone-therapy-for-menopause-symptoms"&gt;HRT&lt;/a&gt;, a treatment for menopausal symptoms), postmenopausal women working only night shifts were almost twice as likely to have moderate-severe asthma than female day workers. This suggests that HRT might protect nightshift workers from asthma, though the researchers admit that more studies are needed to confirm this.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“This research suggests that working nightshifts could be a risk factor for asthma in women, but not in men. The majority of workers will not have an easy option of switching their shift pattern, so we need further research to verify and understand this link and find out what could be done to reduce the risk for women who work shifts,” explained Florence Schleich from the European Respiratory Society, who was not involved in the study.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Moving forward, the researchers aim to investigate how sex hormones might influence asthma prevalence among shift workers. Perhaps this line of research will also shed light on what drives the respiratory disease, given that the exact &lt;a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/asthma/causes"&gt;cause&lt;/a&gt; remains a mystery.&lt;/p&gt;

The researchers took blood samples at the start of the study, after six weeks, and after 12 weeks to track the participants’ cholesterol, inflammation, and blood sugar levels.

That ultimately lowers the amount of cholesterol circulating in your blood. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="15" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;“On the inflammation side, beans deliver a strong one-two punch," he adds. "Their fiber feeds beneficial gut bacteria, which produce short-chain fatty acids like butyrate that calm systemic inflammation."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="16" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;But that's not all. Beans also contain polyphenols, a type of antioxidant that helps reduce inflammation by lowering oxidative stress and supporting the body’s natural inflammatory response, says &lt;a href="https://kerigansny.com/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-node-id="16.1" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://kerigansny.com/" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Keri Gans" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Keri Gans&lt;/a&gt;, RDN, dietitian and host of &lt;em data-node-id="16.3"&gt;The Keri Report&lt;/em&gt; podcast. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-much-do-i-need-to-eat-each-day-to-see-these-effects" data-node-id="17" class="body-h2 css-1eo7s1x emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="17.0"&gt;How much do I need to eat each day to see these effects&lt;/strong&gt;? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="18" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;This particular study looked at the health impact of eating a cup of beans per day.

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;In a nutshell&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Coffee drinkers who consumed 1-3 cups daily had a 15-17% lower risk of dying early compared to non-coffee drinkers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Health benefits only applied to black coffee or coffee with minimal added sugar (less than half a teaspoon per cup) and saturated fat&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Coffee drinks high in sugar and saturated fat showed no protective effects, potentially eliminating coffee’s health benefits entirely&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MEDFORD, Mass. —&lt;/strong&gt; Americans love their coffee, with about half of us reaching for a cup every single day. And here’s some news that might make your morning brew taste even better: that daily coffee habit could be cutting your risk of dying early by up to 17% — but there’s a catch that could cancel out the benefits.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A study tracking nearly 50,000 American adults for more than a decade found that &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/coffee/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;coffee drinkers&lt;/a&gt; lived longer than those who skipped their daily caffeine fix. The twist? The life-extending benefits were only seen in people who drank black coffee or coffee with very little added sugar and saturated fat. Those sugary, creamy coffee shop drinks? They offered no measurable health advantage. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to the study, coffee with higher levels of &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/added-sugar/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;added sugar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/saturated-fat/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;saturated fat&lt;/a&gt; was not associated with lower death rates. Moreover, the benefits were not seen in people who preferred a decaf brew. The research took a detailed look at what Americans are actually putting in their coffee, and the findings raise red flags about our sweetened coffee culture.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-nearly-50-000-americans-tracked-for-over-a-decade"&gt;Nearly 50,000 Americans Tracked for Over a Decade&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers from Tufts University analyzed coffee drinking habits and health outcomes in 46,322 adults aged 20 and older who participated in U.S. government health surveys between 1999 and 2018. Participants were followed for roughly 9 to 11 years, with actual mortality outcomes tracked using National Death Index records.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;During that time, 7,074 participants died — 1,176 from &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/category/cancer/"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; and 1,089 from &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/heart-disease/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;cardiovascular disease&lt;/a&gt;. Compared to non-coffee drinkers, those who drank coffee had significantly lower mortality rates. The greatest benefit appeared in people drinking 2 to 3 cups a day, who had a 17% lower risk of dying during the follow-up period. Even those who drank less than a cup a day saw an 11% lower risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-sweetened-coffee-may-cancel-the-health-benefits"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why Sweetened Coffee May Cancel the Health Benefits&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers also examined what went into those cups of coffee. Each beverage was classified based on how much added sugar and saturated fat it contained per 8-ounce serving.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Drinking &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/strongest-coffees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;black coffee&lt;/a&gt; was associated with a 14% lower risk of all-cause mortality. Coffee with small amounts of added sugar (under 2.5 grams per cup) and saturated fat (under 1 gram per cup) also showed the same 14% reduction.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But for people drinking coffee with higher amounts of sugar and saturated fat, there was no statistically significant reduction &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/drinking-coffee-only-in-the-morning-lowers-risk-of-death-from-any-cause/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;in risk of death&lt;/a&gt;. For context, the average U.S. coffee drink contains 3.24 grams of added sugar and 0.52 grams of saturated fat per 8-ounce cup, suggesting that many Americans are overshooting the threshold where coffee may offer health benefits.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-caffeine-key-to-longevity"&gt;Caffeine Key to Longevity&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study, published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S002231662500286X?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;The Journal of Nutrition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;,  also found that caffeinated coffee — not decaf — was driving most of the observed health benefits. While &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/best-decaf-coffee/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;decaffeinated coffee&lt;/a&gt; showed no clear association with longevity, caffeinated coffee was linked to reduced risk of death from both all causes and cardiovascular disease.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That’s in line with previous research suggesting that caffeine &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/caffeine/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;may play a protective role&lt;/a&gt; by boosting metabolism, reducing inflammation, and improving insulin sensitivity. Coffee also contains other bioactive compounds like chlorogenic acid and polyphenols that are thought to have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the protective effects of coffee were only observed among people who did not drink tea. Among &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/tea/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;tea drinkers&lt;/a&gt;, the association between coffee and longevity disappeared, though the study doesn’t explain why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-it-s-best-to-be-basic"&gt;It’s Best To Be Basic&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For the estimated 150 million Americans who drink coffee daily, this study delivers both a bit of good news and a wake-up call. The good news: your coffee habit could be helping you live longer. The reality check: if your go-to drink includes lots of sugar, cream, or flavored syrups, those potential benefits may be lost.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers adjusted for a wide range of lifestyle and health variables, including age, sex, race, income, smoking, alcohol use, exercise, diet quality, and preexisting conditions. Even then, the association between simple coffee and lower mortality still held up.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The takeaway? A basic &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/coffee/"&gt;cup of coffee&lt;/a&gt;, especially when consumed black or lightly sweetened, may be one of the healthiest parts of your day. But when that cup starts to resemble dessert and doesn’t have caffeine, the health perks may disappear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-methodology"&gt;Methodology&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers analyzed data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) conducted between 1999 and 2018, focusing on 46,322 adults aged 20 and older. They tracked coffee consumption using detailed 24-hour dietary recalls and categorized coffee types based on caffeine content and amounts of added sugar and saturated fat. Participants were followed for a median of 9.3 to 11.3 years, with mortality data obtained through linkage to the National Death Index through December 2019.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-results"&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;During the follow-up period, 7,074 deaths occurred. Coffee consumption of 1-3 cups per day was associated with 15-17% lower all-cause mortality risk. The greatest benefit was seen with 2-3 cups daily (17% reduction). However, mortality benefits were limited to black coffee and coffee with low added sugar (&amp;lt;2.5g per cup) and low saturated fat (&amp;lt;1g per cup). Coffee with high levels of sugar and saturated fat showed no protective effects. The benefits were primarily associated with caffeinated rather than decaffeinated coffee. For cardiovascular disease mortality analysis, only data from 1999-2014 cycles were used.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-limitations"&gt;Limitations&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study relied on one or two days of dietary recalls, which may not capture typical long-term intake patterns. Coffee consumption correlates with various lifestyle factors, and while researchers adjusted for known confounders, residual confounding cannot be ruled out. The study couldn’t distinguish between different types of cancer deaths due to small numbers, and information about coffee preparation methods wasn’t available.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-funding-and-disclosures"&gt;Funding and Disclosures&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This study was supported by the National Institutes of Health (award number R01MD011501). One author (FFZ) reported financial support from NIH, while all other authors reported no conflicts of interest. The funding sources had no role in study design, data collection, analysis, or manuscript preparation.&lt;/p&gt;

The study pinpoints a specific eating plan—the MIND diet—as having a meaningful impact on &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/memory/a64646631/blood-test-dementia-risk-study/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:dementia risk;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;dementia risk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, following a specific diet won't automatically wipe away any risk of developing dementia, but neurologists say these new findings are worth paying attention to. Here’s why that is, and what they make of the results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meet the experts&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href="https://www.providence.org/doctors/profile/203880-clifford-segil" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Clifford Segil,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Clifford Segil,&lt;/a&gt; DO, is a neurologist at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, CA; &lt;a href="https://neurology.msu.edu/directory/amit-sachdev" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Amit Sachdev,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Amit Sachdev,&lt;/a&gt; MD, MS, is the medical director in the Department of Neurology at Michigan State University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What did the study find?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the study, researchers analyzed data from nearly 93,000 American adults who participated in the Multiethnic Cohort Study, a long-term study that started in the ‘90s. At the start of the study, the participants were between 45 and 75 years old. During the study period, more than 21,000 developed Alzheimer’s disease or related dementias.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers discovered that study participants who closely followed the MIND diet had a 9 percent lower risk of developing dementia. There was a difference in race, too: People who were African American, Latino, or White had a 13 percent lower risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the researchers also discovered that people who followed the MIND diet more closely over 10 years, even if they weren't super consistent at the start of the study, had a 25 percent lower risk of dementia compared to those who stopped adhering as much to the eating plan over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the MIND diet?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/memory/a60480600/mind-diet-slow-aging-lower-dementia-risk-study/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:MIND diet;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;MIND diet&lt;/a&gt; stands for Mediterranean–DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay. It’s an iteration of the Mediterranean diet that is focused on eating plant-based foods with the goal of preventing dementia, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/alzheimers-and-dementia/what-do-we-know-about-diet-and-prevention-alzheimers-disease" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:National Institute on Aging;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;National Institute on Aging&lt;/a&gt; (NIA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The MIND diet encourages people to focus on eating green leafy vegetables, berries, whole grains, beans, and nuts. It also encourages followers to have olive oil and one or more weekly servings of fish, while limiting red meat, sweets, cheese, butter and margarine, and fast and fried food, per the NIA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why is the MIND diet able to reduce dementia risk?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study didn’t find that following a MIND diet &lt;em&gt;caused&lt;/em&gt; a drop in dementia risk—it just found a link between people who followed the diet and lower risk. But neurologists say there could be something behind this link.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The MIND diet is generally a balanced diet that manages portion control and offers a diversity of food choices,” says &lt;a href="https://neurology.msu.edu/directory/amit-sachdev" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Amit Sachdev,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Amit Sachdev,&lt;/a&gt; MD, MS, medical director in the Department of Neurology at Michigan State University. “This approach offers benefits for improving cardiovascular and cerebrovascular health. By improving blood flow to the brain, overall brain health can be improved.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.providence.org/doctors/profile/203880-clifford-segil" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Clifford Segil,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Clifford Segil,&lt;/a&gt; DO, a neurologist at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, CA, agrees. “Eating healthy prevents cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease which, in turn, prevents heart attacks and strokes,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How else can I protect my brain through diet?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;That question is still under investigation, Dr. Segil says. “Many diets have been proposed to decrease your risk of getting Alzheimer’s dementia as we age and it still remains challenging to see any diet is ‘neuro-protective’ against getting Alzheimer’s dementia,” he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, Dr. Segil suggests that it may be best to avoid diets that are high in fats and sugars, and limit simple carbohydrates and &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/food/a64728479/ultraprocessed-foods-list-health-effects/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:ultra-processed foods;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;ultra-processed foods&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/13524585251341174"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Gender-affirming interventions and prognosis in multiple sclerosis&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,” was published in &lt;em&gt;Multiple Sclerosis Journal. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent years, there’s been a growing recognition of transgender and gender-diverse identities, both referring to people who don’t identify with the sex they were assigned at birth. Transgender women are &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/ms-symptoms-in-women/"&gt;women&lt;/a&gt; who were assigned male at birth, whereas transgender men are &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/ms-symptoms-in-men/"&gt;men&lt;/a&gt; who were assigned female at birth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gender-affirming care often involves hormone therapy — typically estrogen for transgender women and testosterone for transgender men — to help transgender people’s bodies better reflect their internal sense of self. For example, transgender women will grow breasts with hormone therapy and transgender men will grow facial hair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In MS, the immune system launches an inflammatory attack that damages nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord. Hormones like estrogen and testosterone can affect the immune system in complex ways, so it’s plausible that hormone-based therapy used for gender-affirming care could affect MS disease activity. There’s virtually no data about how hormone therapies impact MS however, even though research suggests nearly 1 in 200 people with MS identify as transgender or gender-diverse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Both sex chromosomes and sex hormones impact the immune system. However, the effect of cross-sex hormone administration on MS is not sufficiently studied and potentially contributes to alterations in disease course in [transgender and gender diverse people with] MS,” the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;MS activity after gender-affirming care&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, scientists report on outcomes from 10 transgender adults — five women and five men — who started hormone therapy. Soon after initiating gender-affirming care, seven of them (four women, three men) had new signs of disease activity visible on &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/multiple-sclerosis-diagnosis/mri-magnetic-resonance-imaging/"&gt;MRI scans&lt;/a&gt;. Of them, one woman and two men also had new clinical activity, that is, new or worsening &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/symptoms-of-multiple-sclerosis/"&gt;MS symptoms&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“[I]n our cohort, most patients experienced increased disease activity after [gender-affirming hormone therapy] initiation, with a comparable [distribution between transgender men and transgender women],” the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disability was higher in transgender women than men, however, with researchers noting that the disease course in MS may differ between them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the adults had been diagnosed with MS before starting hormone therapy, but new MS activity following the start of hormone therapy marked the first onset of MS in two of the cases. “One [transgender woman] and one [transgender man] developed symptomatic MS within the first year of [gender-affirming hormone therapy],” the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The data indicate that gender-affirming hormone therapy may increase MS activity, said the researchers said, who cautioned that the patient sample was too small to be able to draw a firm conclusion about cause-and-effect in their study. Only one patient was taking a &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/treatments-that-modify-the-disease-course/"&gt;disease-modifying therapy&lt;/a&gt;, which can reduce the risk of MS disease activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers emphasized that more research is needed to study the impact of hormone therapy in transgender people with MS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/13524585251341177"&gt;commentary&lt;/a&gt; published with the study echoed this point, noting that a search on one of the main bibliographic databases for studies on transgender people with MS yields only about 10 papers, whereas a search for MS and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) yields hundreds, even though this rare type of brain infection that can affect people taking certain MS treatments affects fewer than 2% of MS patients..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Researchers should address the gaps on gender diversity and gender-affirming hormonal treatments, in particular in relation to MS outcomes and potential interactions with MS management,” noted the commentary, which advised that “people involved in MS care should be genuinely inclusive, with sensitive and gender-neutral attitudes” in order to provide the best possible care for transgender and gender-diverse people with MS.&lt;/p&gt;

This is the first reported case in Dallas amid a larger outbreak that has already infected nearly 800 people statewide and claimed the lives of two children.

Authorities are now tracking her movements and notifying potentially exposed individuals. Although this is currently classified as an isolated incident, it coincides with a growing outbreak across Texas — with 744 confirmed cases and 96 hospitalizations since January. Two deaths have been reported in unvaccinated school-aged children, intensifying the public health response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why measles is one of the most dangerous and contagious viruses in the world&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles is far from a harmless childhood illness. It spreads through the air and remains active on surfaces for up to two hours, infecting 90% of unvaccinated people exposed to it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms begin with a fever, cough, and runny nose, but rapidly develop into tell-tale red rashes and small white spots inside the mouth. If untreated or contracted by vulnerable individuals, it can lead to severe complications such as pneumonia, brain swelling, and even death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vaccinated but still infected: Understanding breakthrough measles cases&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the woman in Dallas was fully vaccinated, rare "breakthrough" infections can occur. The measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine is 97% effective after two doses, but no vaccine offers absolute protection. Still, vaccinated individuals typically experience milder symptoms and are less likely to transmit the disease. The greatest concern lies with the unvaccinated population, especially children under 5 and individuals with weakened immune systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;CDC issues travel advisory: Airports and crowded spaces can be hotspots&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC warns that travelers are at heightened risk, especially in crowded places like airports, train stations, and large events. Infected travelers can unknowingly carry the virus across state and national borders, spreading it to communities with lower vaccination coverage. The advisory urges travelers to verify their immunity and ensure they’re up to date on MMR vaccinations before flying, particularly to or from international destinations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Falling vaccination rates are fueling measles’ dangerous comeback&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A troubling national trend is worsening the outbreak: childhood MMR vaccination rates are slipping. A Johns Hopkins University study found that 78% of US. counties saw declines in MMR coverage in 2024. The national average now stands at 91% — well below the 95% threshold needed to maintain herd immunity. If this continues, measles could shift from an occasional threat to a recurring public health crisis, reversing the US.

Watch for symptoms like fever, coughing, and rash for up to 21 days after possible exposure. Adults unsure of their immunity should consult a doctor, and parents are urged to ensure their children are fully vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Tue, 17 Jun 2025 12:46:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>大脑灵活性，非恒定专注，标志着智力-神经科学新闻 | Brain Flexibility, Not Constant Focus, Marks Intelligence - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidEFVX3lxTFB6Wk9MaHY4eVNJak5DMnRDNGNJQUxoVVpEYlhRMTA4cVBxTHVIUWpNSFlBTFpIWURCa0p1Ynd2RnNNWTRVRHpBY190blJyQmRxeVFtMTlrRXRmVlg3VVc2VmFPOFRoSU5xeFVmajR3YXl0dmho?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;New research shows that individuals with higher cognitive ability have stronger, more flexible synchronization of brain rhythms—specifically theta waves—in the midfrontal region during mentally demanding tasks. These neural signals coordinate dynamically, especially during moments of decision-making, allowing people to maintain focus and adapt more quickly to changing rules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study used EEG recordings from 148 participants as they completed cognitive control tasks, revealing that smarter brains operate more like adaptable orchestras than metronomes. This flexible brain rhythm coordination could be a key neural signature of intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Theta Synchrony:&lt;/strong&gt; Midfrontal theta wave synchronization increases during key decision moments.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cognitive Link:&lt;/strong&gt; Stronger, flexible theta coordination is associated with higher cognitive ability.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adaptability Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Intelligence may depend more on dynamic rhythm shifts than on constant brainwave activity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When the brain is under pressure, certain neural signals begin to move in sync – much like a well-rehearsed orchestra. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study from Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz (JGU) is the first to show how flexibly this neural synchrony adjusts to different situations and that this dynamic coordination is closely linked to cognitive abilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-110943"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/inte3llige3nce-flexibility-neurosicencec.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/inte3llige3nce-flexibility-neurosicencec-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/inte3llige3nce-flexibility-neurosicencec-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/inte3llige3nce-flexibility-neurosicencec-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/inte3llige3nce-flexibility-neurosicencec-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/inte3llige3nce-flexibility-neurosicencec-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/inte3llige3nce-flexibility-neurosicencec-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/inte3llige3nce-flexibility-neurosicencec.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/inte3llige3nce-flexibility-neurosicencec.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/inte3llige3nce-flexibility-neurosicencec-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/inte3llige3nce-flexibility-neurosicencec-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/inte3llige3nce-flexibility-neurosicencec-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/inte3llige3nce-flexibility-neurosicencec-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/inte3llige3nce-flexibility-neurosicencec-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/inte3llige3nce-flexibility-neurosicencec-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;These brainwaves oscillate between four and eight hertz and belong to the group of slower neural frequencies. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Specific signals in the midfrontal brain region are better synchronized in people with higher cognitive ability – especially during demanding phases of reasoning,” explained Professor Anna-Lena Schubert from JGU’s Institute of Psychology, lead author of the study recently published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Experimental Psychology: General.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers focused on the midfrontal area of the brain and the measurable coordination of the so-called theta waves. These brainwaves oscillate between four and eight hertz and belong to the group of slower neural frequencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They tend to appear when the brain is particularly challenged such as during focused thinking or when we need to consciously control our behavior,” said Schubert, who heads the Analysis and Modeling of Complex Data Lab at JGU.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Being able to focus even next to a buzzing phone&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 148 participants in the study, aged between 18 and 60, first completed tests assessing memory and intelligence before their brain activity was recorded using electroencephalography (EEG).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This method measures tiny electrical signals in the brain using electrodes placed on the scalp and is a well-established technique for gaining precise insights into cognitive processes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During EEG recording, participants completed three mentally demanding tasks designed to assess cognitive control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers were interested in the participants’ ability to flexibly shift between changing rules, which is an essential aspect of intelligent information processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, participants had to press a button to decide whether a number was even or odd, and moments later whether it was greater or less than five.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each switch of rules required rapid adjustment of mental strategies – a process that allowed researchers to closely observe how the brain’s networks coordinate in real time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result, individuals with higher cognitive abilities showed especially strong synchronization of theta waves during crucial moments, particularly when making decisions. Their brains were better at sustaining purposeful thought when it mattered most.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People with stronger midfrontal theta connectivity are often better at maintaining focus and tuning out distractions, be it that your phone buzzes while you’re working or that you intend to read a book in a busy train station,” explained Schubert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A flexible rhythm in the brain&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Anna-Lena Schubert was particularly surprised by how closely this brain rhythm coordination was tied to cognitive abilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We did not expect the relationship to be this clear,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What mattered most was not continuous synchronization, but the brain’s ability to adapt its timing flexibly and contextually – like an orchestra that follows a skilled conductor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The midfrontal region often sets the tone in this coordination but works in concert with other areas across the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This midfrontal theta connectivity appears to be particularly relevant during the execution of decisions, however not during the preparatory mental adjustment to new task rules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous EEG studies on cognitive ability mostly examined activity in isolated brain regions. In contrast, this study took a network-level approach, examining how different areas interact across multiple tasks to identify stable, overarching patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings show that individual differences in cognitive ability are linked to the brain’s dynamic network behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Potential applications such as brain-based training tools or diagnostics are still a long way off,” emphasized Schubert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But our study offers important groundwork for understanding how intelligence functions at a neural level.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A follow-up study, now seeking participants aged 40 and older from the Rhine-Main region, will explore which biological and cognitive factors further support this kind of efficient brain coordination and the role of additional cognitive abilities, such as processing speed and working memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this neuroscience and intelligence research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#cca7adb8a4bea5a2e2baa3a5abb88cb9a2a5e1a1ada5a2b6e2a8a9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Kathrin Voigt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://uni-mainz.de" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Kathrin Voigt – Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1037/xge0001780" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Trait characteristics of midfrontal theta connectivity as a neurocognitive measure of cognitive control and its relation to general cognitive abilities&lt;/a&gt;” by Anna-Lena Schubert et al. &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Journal of Experimental Psychology: General&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trait characteristics of midfrontal theta connectivity as a neurocognitive measure of cognitive control and its relation to general cognitive abilities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding the neurocognitive basis of cognitive control and its relationship with general cognitive ability is a key challenge in individual differences research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study investigates midfrontal theta connectivity as a neurocognitive marker for individual differences in cognitive control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using electroencephalography, we examined midfrontal global theta connectivity across three distinct cognitive control tasks in 148 participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our findings reveal that midfrontal theta connectivity can be modeled as a trait-like latent variable, indicating its consistency across tasks and stability over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the reliability of the observed measures was found to be low to moderate, suggesting substantial measurement error.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also replicated previous results, finding a strong correlation (&lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt; = 0.64) between midfrontal theta connectivity and cognitive abilities, especially during higher order stages of information processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We disentangled the specific cognitive processes contributing to this relationship by employing a task-cueing paradigm with distinct cue and target intervals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results indicated that only theta connectivity during response-related processes, not during cue-evoked task-set reconfiguration, correlated with cognitive abilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These insights significantly advance theoretical models of intelligence, highlighting the critical role of specific aspects of cognitive control in cognitive abilities.&lt;/p&gt;

But they need to know what to expect from the treatment that they’re choosing, and that needs to be guided by real-world data, not clinical trial data,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Prof Naveed Sattar, of the University of Glasgow, who was not involved in the work, pointed to recent follow-up studies of &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/apr/11/people-using-drug-mounjaro-sustain-weight-loss-over-three-years-trial-finds" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;trials involving tirzepatide&lt;/a&gt; showing substantial weight loss over three years. But he said in real life many patients stop medicines early either because of their cost or poorly handled side-effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“That said, bariatric surgery done well can do well for many people and is certainly cheaper over the longer run,” he said. “The issue may be that most people likely prefer to take medicines for weight loss rather than have surgery, at least in the first instance, now that the medicines can approach weight loss levels seen with surgery.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Tue, 17 Jun 2025 12:29:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMixgFBVV95cUxPSDRIV29pU1dsaEhDT1V0NkJQVjl2ZzJZNXNUVVk5dEM4bERnbFlndzFGUl9HM2RvT2RYaTc0NXZyQ0NrMVhvM3Uwa2dWMm9OMlNXUkVJME1Ha0VIMkZjOFVjeENVTDRCdWVFa3VDNUo5aFhKemdER01lUWE1eHo0Zm5PLWQ1ZW13bUs4UmgwTkltaTg4dUFaS1pXaWp1Q3FVVWxKLUxad3VfN3RrOG5LV3E3RmJwdW5uTmVRUXpyR0l2VEVqcFE</guid></item><item><title>阑尾癌在年轻人中上升—但为什么？ - DW | Appendix cancer rises in young people — but why? - DW</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiwFBVV95cUxPbDFsZElBYXJnZWQ0VnVEVXlnSGh5QU9qV01XMFVKY0huMUQxOVY3SWdfREhJNFl3T3lNY2t4dE5SLWJpMXlxdjI4SFhKcmQ1R2hzWHZGZlB2X1FMMG9GSi1tZXlNRk9YRjJyM185RklUb0hZZ0RZS19BM211TGQ5T1ZoSmYtLWtjamM40gGLAUFVX3lxTE9iSGNHUlJwbUstUHEwc1RXdmtpTDQ5Ui1JUmtuSFJuTW54RWFlVUUzMG1FY2V2bHNqWWRoTkttUEZSTXdpaTRUSUd3TXN6bG15NUFQcmdwMGRJVk1HQmRFMEprV0x6cVhzc3NRclhTR1JRVl9BUkVfTzZ0c3BTTFZHZlk4eHNLNHJhaTA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="cc0m0op s1ebneao rich-text t1it8i9i r1wgtjne wgx1hx2 b1ho1h07"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Appendix cancer is one of the rarest types of cancers, with cases generally limited to older adults, if ever, in cancer clinics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But a &lt;a rel="noopener follow" target="_blank" class="external-link" href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/ANNALS-24-02479" title="External link — new study in the journal Annals of Internal Medicine"&gt;new study in the journal Annals of Internal Medicine&lt;svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewbox="0 0 20 20"&gt;&lt;path d="M11.5 3.5 11.5 4.233C14.342 4.233 15.167 4.245 15.167 4.258L8.984 10.467 10.033 11.516C14.826 6.725 16.228 5.333 16.242 5.333L16.267 9 17.733 9 17.733 2.767 11.5 2.767 11.5 3.5M2.267 11 2.267 17.233 16.733 17.233 16.733 12 15.267 12 15.25 15.75 9.5 15.75 3.75 15.75 3.75 6.25 9.5 6.233 9.5 4.767 2.267 4.767 2.267 11 "&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has found that the number of appendix cancer cases has increased dramatically — specifically in people born after the 1970s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the number of people getting appendix cancer is still very low — just a few people per million get the disease per year — the incidence has at least tripled, or even quadrupled, in younger generations, compared with those born in the 1940s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What's concerning health experts is that appendix cancer is part of &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/colorectal-cancer-rates-are-rising-in-under-50s/a-68134116"&gt;a trend of rising rates of cancers in young adults&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Colorectal, testicular, breast, ovarian, pancreas cancers are among many types of cancers rising in the same age group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's in every region of the world, too. &lt;a rel="noopener follow" target="_blank" class="external-link" href="https://www.thelancet.com/action/showPdf?pii=S1470-2045%2824%2900600-4" title="External link — A study in the journal The Lancet"&gt;A study in the journal The Lancet&lt;svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewbox="0 0 20 20"&gt;&lt;path d="M11.5 3.5 11.5 4.233C14.342 4.233 15.167 4.245 15.167 4.258L8.984 10.467 10.033 11.516C14.826 6.725 16.228 5.333 16.242 5.333L16.267 9 17.733 9 17.733 2.767 11.5 2.767 11.5 3.5M2.267 11 2.267 17.233 16.733 17.233 16.733 12 15.267 12 15.25 15.75 9.5 15.75 3.75 15.75 3.75 6.25 9.5 6.233 9.5 4.767 2.267 4.767 2.267 11 "&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt; found that early-onset colorectal cancer incidence rates were rising in 27 of the 50 countries and territories that researchers examined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The major health challenge for the future is that young people may carry this enhanced cancer risk with them into older age, potentially hampering significant progress in treating cancers over the past decades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This shift has left many experts puzzled and searching for answers," wrote Justin Stebbing, a biomedical scientist at Anglia Ruskin University, UK, in &lt;a rel="noopener follow" target="_blank" class="external-link" href="https://theconversation.com/appendix-cancer-rising-among-younger-generation-new-study-258607" title="External link — the Conversation"&gt;the Conversation&lt;svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewbox="0 0 20 20"&gt;&lt;path d="M11.5 3.5 11.5 4.233C14.342 4.233 15.167 4.245 15.167 4.258L8.984 10.467 10.033 11.516C14.826 6.725 16.228 5.333 16.242 5.333L16.267 9 17.733 9 17.733 2.767 11.5 2.767 11.5 3.5M2.267 11 2.267 17.233 16.733 17.233 16.733 12 15.267 12 15.25 15.75 9.5 15.75 3.75 15.75 3.75 6.25 9.5 6.233 9.5 4.767 2.267 4.767 2.267 11 "&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What is causing the rising cancer rates among young adults?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The short answer is that researchers do not know what is causing more young people to develop cancer today than fifty years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While they understand that certain risk factors may influence such diseases, they don't fully understand &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; or whether they directly&lt;em&gt; cause&lt;/em&gt; cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Smoking, obesity and diet are all well-established risk factors, but how they impact the disease is not well-known.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scientists have ruled out genetic factors, as they say this would not explain why it is happening in any particular age group. Their best guess now is that people in born in the 1990s were exposed to chemicals and other environmental factors that were not around before then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, some studies say exposure to microplastics and  &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/forever-chemicals-toxic-substances-chemicals-health-pfas/a-72129225"&gt;"forever chemicals"&lt;/a&gt; in the environment may cause more cancers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other studies link a rise in early-onset cancers with changes in the gut microbiome, perhaps caused by dietary changes, or increased antibiotic use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And some studies link the so-called "Western diet" and rising obesity rates with early-onset cancers. The Western diet is characterized by &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/how-unhealthy-are-processed-foods/a-68276757"&gt;a high intake of ultra-processed foods&lt;/a&gt; and sugar, while lacking fruit, vegetables, and fiber.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, until now, such studies have only ever provided &lt;em&gt;correlative&lt;/em&gt; links — they may be an associated risk or contributing factor, but &lt;em&gt;not the cause of cancers&lt;/em&gt;, especially in young people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span data-slot-id="Article_InContent-1" class="rich-text-ad"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;How to reduce your risk of getting cancer&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best advice is to focus on prevention and awareness. Medical experts advise lifestyle changes to reduce exposure to things that could cause cancer in young people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Maintaining a healthy weight, eating a balanced diet rich in fruit, vegetables and whole grains, and staying physically active are all steps that can lower the risk of many types of cancer," wrote Stebbing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cancer Research UK — just one of many national bodies in the world — has these tips on how to reduce the risks of getting cancer:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Have a healthy balanced diet rich in fresh and unprocessed foods&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Enjoy the sun safely with sunscreen — known as "slip slop slap" in Australia&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Cut down on alcohol and smoking&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Keep a healthy weight and exercise frequently&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/new-hpv-test-crucial-step-for-eradicating-cervical-cancer/a-65989089"&gt;Get the HPV vaccine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;The contents of a patient's entrails could be key to assessing how close they are to death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No, it's not some form of living &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haruspex"&gt;haruspicy&lt;/a&gt;. A team of doctors led by Alexander de Porto of the University of Chicago and the University of Amsterdam has created an index of markers in a patient's feces that can help gauge the risk of mortality within 30 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They have named it the metabolic dysbiosis score (MDS), and it could help save the lives of critically ill patients in medical intensive care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their results, they caution, require further investigation and validation, but offer exciting promise as a future tool for diagnostic medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The findings suggest that fecal metabolic dysbiosis, quantified through the MDS, holds potential as a biomarker to identify critically ill patients at increased risk of mortality," de Porto and his colleagues, Eric Pamer and Bhakti Patel of the University of Chicago, told ScienceAlert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This underscores the importance of gut-derived metabolites as independent contributors to host resilience, offering an avenue for precision medicine."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_164803" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-164803" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/fecal-bacteria-642x557.jpg" alt="A Patient's Poop Could Predict How Likely They Are to Die Within 30 Days" class="wp-image-164803 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/fecal-bacteria-642x557.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/fecal-bacteria-479x415.jpg 479w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/fecal-bacteria-768x666.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/fecal-bacteria-1536x1332.jpg 1536w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/fecal-bacteria-600x520.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/fecal-bacteria.jpg 1859w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-164803" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Scanning electron micrograph of bacteria cultured from a sample of human feces. (Steve Gschmeissner/Science Photo Library/Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Critically ill patients admitted to intensive care units often develop severe syndromes such as &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepsis"&gt;sepsis&lt;/a&gt; and acute respiratory distress – but these syndromes don't always develop and evolve in the same way. This heterogeneity poses a huge challenge for trying to treat these patients; two patients with the same syndrome may respond to the same treatment very differently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One way to circumvent this challenge, the researchers said, is to identify specific traits to treat rather than attacking the whole syndrome at once. Scientists know that critically ill patients often have reduced diversity in their &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-strange-world-of-organisms-lives-inside-you-but-not-like-you-think"&gt;gut microbiota&lt;/a&gt;, as well as altered concentrations of the metabolites produced by their microbiomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;De Porto and his colleagues embarked on an investigation into &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/changes-in-gut-bacteria-are-present-long-before-signs-of-parkinsons-appear"&gt;dysbiosis&lt;/a&gt;, an imbalance in the gut microbiome, in critically ill patients, as a trait that could be treated. They studied fecal samples collected from 196 patients exhibiting respiratory failure or shock, dividing them into a training cohort of 147 patients and a validation cohort of 49 patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They used these samples to develop the MDS, based on concentrations of 13 distinct fecal metabolites. The results indicate an auspicious avenue for further investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The MDS performed well in predicting mortality in the training cohort of medical ICU patients, with 84 percent accuracy, 89 percent sensitivity, and 71 percent specificity," the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"However, the validation cohort, despite showing similar trends, failed to reach statistical significance, probably due to its smaller sample size. These findings highlight the promise of the MDS but also underscore the necessity to validate its predictive capacity and generalizability in independent cohorts before widespread application."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What the researchers found particularly interesting is that, even though a lack of diversity in the microbiome has previously been associated with adverse outcomes in critically ill patients, they could find no such link. Instead, their results showed a strong link between dysbiosis and increased mortality risk, suggesting that an imbalance in the microbiome plays a crucial role in patient health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lot more work needs to be done before the team's approach is suitable for clinical application. The null result in the validation cohort of just 47 patients shows that quite a bit of refinement is required. However, there are several encouraging points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lab has shown, for instance, that fecal metabolites can identify liver transplant patients who have a higher risk of developing a post-operative infection. In addition, while specific treatments have not yet been investigated or identified, the MDS indicates some pathways for further exploration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The metabolites comprising the score, such as short-chain fatty acids, bile acids, and tryptophan metabolites, point to biological pathways that might be targeted therapeutically," the researchers said. "Potential interventions might include dietary changes, administration of probiotics, or direct supplementation with these metabolites."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next step is to work on validating MDS in new sets of patients, and to examine whether the link between the observed dysbioses and the increased mortality risk is causal or symptomatic of another cause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Subsequently," the researchers said, "intervention trials targeting specific metabolites or metabolic pathways are necessary to assess therapeutic benefits."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.adt1466"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Science Advances&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Creatine may help improve energy and strength during workouts.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.health.com/bcaa-8425164" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;BCAAs&lt;/a&gt; are three amino acids—&lt;span data-tts="true"&gt;leucine&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span data-tts="true"&gt;isoleucine&lt;/span&gt;, and &lt;span data-tts="true"&gt;valine—&lt;/span&gt;that aren't naturally made in the body. Amino acids are substances your body turns into protein that help with food digestion and repair muscle tissue. When consumed, they're absorbed and broken down in the skeletal muscle, the type of muscle that controls movement.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; BCAAs may help you:&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You can find BCAAs naturally in meat and dairy, nuts, and seeds. BCAA supplements are safe in doses of up to 20 grams daily for up to six weeks. One study recommends a daily BCAAs dose of two to 10 grams at least three days before, immediately before, and after exercise. More research is necessary to find out the best time to take BCAAs and how effective they are long-term.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Potential side effects of BCAAs include nausea, stomach pain, muscle cramps, and decreased appetite.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.health.com/creatine-7109306" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Creatine&lt;/a&gt; is made from the amino acids &lt;span data-tts="true"&gt;glycine&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span data-tts="true"&gt;arginine&lt;/span&gt;, and &lt;span data-tts="true"&gt;methionine&lt;/span&gt;. It may help improve physical performance, strength, and energy during short workouts. Creatine may also help protect your body from inflammation and cell damage. It's in foods like beef, pork, and seafood, as well as supplements.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Creatine makes adenosine triphosphate (ATP), a substance that gives energy to muscles. It also helps prevent &lt;a href="https://www.health.com/fitness/delayed-onset-muscle-soreness-doms" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;muscle soreness&lt;/a&gt; by reducing &lt;a href="https://www.health.com/lactic-acid-7255194" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;lactate&lt;/a&gt; build-up.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When taking creatine supplements, you typically start with 20 grams daily for up to seven days, followed by three to five grams daily for up to 12 weeks. Starting with a larger "loading dose" may increase how much creatine your body stores. This higher storage can help you perform at a higher intensity and recover more quickly.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Weight gain is the most common side effect of creatine. Creatine draws water into your muscles, also known as &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.health.com/water-retention-8710716" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;water retention&lt;/a&gt;. Less common side effects include stomach cramping, nausea, diarrhea, and muscle cramps.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;td&gt;Potential side effects&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Nausea, stomach pain, muscle cramps, and insulin resistance&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Weight gain due to water retention, stomach cramping&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Stored in the body&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; BCAAs may work well for people whose main goal is muscle growth. Amino acids are necessary for making proteins, which you need to grow and maintain muscle.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; BCAA supplements may help people who don't consume enough protein daily. It won't improve muscle mass in people who meet their daily protein requirement, which is at least 1.6 grams per kilogram of body weight per day. Taking protein supplements that contain BCAAs, such as&lt;a href="https://www.health.com/whey-protein-7376427" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt; whey&lt;/a&gt; and&lt;a href="https://www.health.com/casein-protein-7964442" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt; casein&lt;/a&gt;, helps you meet your daily protein intake.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-who-should-use-creatine"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Adults aged 57-70 may benefit from taking creatine since it can improve muscle mass and strength, two factors that become more important as you age.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Using creatine when you're older can help:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improve balance and stability&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improve the ability to complete tasks independently&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lower the risk of age-related diseases, such as &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.health.com/condition/osteoporosis-overview" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;osteoporosis&lt;/a&gt; (bone thinning and weakening)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Combining creatine with&lt;a href="https://www.health.com/heavy-light-all-weightlifting-builds-muscle-7571500" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt; resistance training&lt;/a&gt;, such as push-ups, sit-ups, and crunches, can provide more health benefits.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Vegetarians may also benefit from taking creatine. This is because creatine is naturally found mainly in meat and dairy products.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; BCAAs and creatine are safe to use together. BCAAs can help with muscle protein production and repair, while creatine helps with energy and strength.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You can safely take these supplements at the same time. For example, if you use powder supplements, you can mix both in the same drink or smoothie. If you take them together, check to make sure they don’t contain any other ingredients that shouldn't be mixed. Your healthcare provider can help you review the label.
&lt;/p&gt;

As a treatment for people already living with HIV, it costs &lt;a href="https://www.pharmexec.com/view/new-beginnings-sunlenca" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;about $39,000 annually&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;It could, however, be made for only $25 (£18.40) a year – including a 30% profit margin – analysis from the University of Liverpool and others suggests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Dr Andrew Hill, one of the researchers, said making lenacapavir unaffordable in countries with HIV epidemics would only make things worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Even high-income countries will not be able to afford wide scale use of lenacapavir at prices above $20,000 a year.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Hill &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/article/2024/jul/23/hiv-aids-prevention-vaccine-lenacapavir-sunlenca-pharmaceuticals-gilead-generic-licensing" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;had calculated a generic price of $40 annually&lt;/a&gt; last year, but said the interest from generic manufacturers had warranted new analysis. This showed lenacapavir could be mass produced for $35 to $46 a year, if there was annual demand for 2m doses, falling to $25 at scaled up production of 5m to 10m doses each year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In 2023 there were 1.3m new HIV infections.

Dr Hill’s research indicates that this gamechanging innovation could – within a year of launch – be produced and sold for just $25 per person per year. To charge 1,000 times more for a medicine with pandemic-ending potential would be abhorrent. We cannot end Aids with medicines that are so costly.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Amid &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/mar/18/global-health-trump-usaid-cuts-hiv-aids-2030-drugs-vaccine-research-africa" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;widespread fears that aid cuts will see a reversal of decades of progress &lt;/a&gt;in controlling HIV, Byanyima said long-acting preventive medicines such as lenacapavir could offer a breakthrough for countries and “turn off the tap of new infections”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;She called on Gilead to “do the right thing, save countless lives, and end this pandemic”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="549b0bfe-ab5c-451b-812b-a99bfe4bd7b4" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":12,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"Breakthrough in search for HIV cure leaves researchers ‘overwhelmed’","elementId":"549b0bfe-ab5c-451b-812b-a99bfe4bd7b4","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/jun/05/breakthrough-in-search-for-hiv-cure-leaves-researchers-overwhelmed"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":0,"display":0,"theme":0}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Gilead &lt;a href="https://www.gilead.com/news/news-details/2024/gilead-signs-royalty-free-voluntary-licensing-agreements-with-six-generic-manufacturers-to-increase-access-to-lenacapavir-for-hiv-prevention-in-high-incidence-resource-limited-countries" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;has agreements with six generic companies&lt;/a&gt; to allow the production of low-cost versions of lenacapavir for &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2024/oct/03/gamechanger-hiv-prevention-drug-to-be-made-available-cheaply-in-120-countries" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;120 low-income countries&lt;/a&gt;, and has promised to supply doses for about 2 million people at no profit before generic supplies come to market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;European regulatory approvals, &lt;a href="https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/leaflet/infographic-medicines-use-outside-eu-eu-m4all_en.pdf" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;facilitating approval in many low- and middle-income countries&lt;/a&gt;, are expected later this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;But campaigners say countries where a third of new HIV cases occur are excluded by the Gilead scheme – including Brazil, Argentina, and parts of eastern Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In a statement, Gilead said the company “understands the importance of access for lenacapavir for PrEP [pre-exposure prophylaxis] if it is approved, and we’re taking steps at unprecedented speed to plan for access to lenacapavir for PrEP globally – particularly in low- and lower-middle-income countries where the need is greatest”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The company said external price estimates were based on assumptions of higher use of HIV prevention drugs than currently, or projected. It said global price planning was in progress and would take into account “nearly two decades of research and development, constant learning and iteration, and manufacturing investments to deliver lenacapavir at scale”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Tue, 17 Jun 2025 11:01:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisAFBVV95cUxPNmFEZ0FMd1VqNXVldDVjZmlaVGI5MHpXUGdyR2pacDF2THQ0R1R1MlBNMEQwUUhFNnNtX0Q1RTJHcHRXOUhBN3V3azMwdHBhY080S3BRSkRfQXlDOU0tbEpSMTJHOFZCdVBTNkh6YUpJTExvc0ZFVlo1X2VySjktVm9sUG9jQUFJTmdSU1kySTB2dE1pdGZtZjVxQ3JZaDNLcExkbEhpYXVKQXhBX0tyRw</guid></item><item><title>SHOCK研究发现，在减肥方面，一次性治疗比Ozempic更好……因为精神疾病之间存在联系--《每日邮报》 | Shock study finds one-off treatment better than Ozempic for weight loss... as psychiatric disorders are linked - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A one-off weight-loss treatment that has been around since the 1950s is far superior than drugs like Ozempic when it comes to shifting pounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A major new study found bariatric surgery - which involves reducing the size of the stomach - is up to five times more effective than the blockbuster new shots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/new_york/index.html" id="mol-679cb970-4ad1-11f0-ac14-c5c1547e8386" class=""&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt;

 &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;About 40million Americans and 500,000 Brits report taking weight loss drugs like Ozempic or Wegovy at some point in their lives (file photo)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The authors of both studies warned patients looking to lose weight should considered these risks before starting a weight loss shot or opting for surgery. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Avery Brown, lead author of the first study and surgical resident at NYU Langone Health, said: 'Clinical trials show weight loss between 15 percent to 21 percent for GLP-1s, but this study suggests that weight loss in the real world is considerably lower even for patients who have active prescriptions for an entire year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We know as many as 70 percent of patients may discontinue treatment within one year.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About one in eight Americans - about 43million - report taking a GLP-1 agonist like Ozempic or Wegovy at some point in their lives, along with 500,000 in the UK. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And recent research shows their popularity has soared 600 percent since 2019.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, 300,000 Americans and 7,000 Brits undergo weight loss surgery each year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These surgeries involve decreasing the size of the stomach or changing how the digestive system works to make patients eat less and lose weight.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Both studies were unveiled this week at the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery (ASMBS) 2025 Annual Scientific Meeting in Washington DC. Neither team has published the full results. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The first study looked at 51,085 patients from NYU Langone Health and NYC Health + Hospitals who had bariatric surgery or were prescribed semaglutide of tirzepatide - the active ingredients in Ozempic, Wegovy and Mounjaro between 2018 and 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Those who had surgery underwent either sleeve gastrectomy or Roux en-Y gastric bypass.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The former reduces stomach size by 80 percent by creating a sleeve-like shape, while the former creates a small pouch and connects it directly to the small intestine so it bypasses part of the stomach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over the course of two years, surgical patients on average lost 58 pounds or 24 percent of their total body weight. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Those taking GLP-1s for six months lost 12 pounds or 4.7 percent of their total body weight, while patients who stuck to the shots for a year lost seven percent of their body weight. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers did not look at the effects of GLP-1s after two years. It's unclear exactly why, but this could be because so many users quit before this mark.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Ann Rogers, president of the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery who was not involved in the study, said: 'While both patient groups lose weight, metabolic and bariatric surgery is much more effective and durable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Those who get insufficient weight loss with GLP-1s or have challenges complying with treatment due to side effects or costs, should consider bariatric surgery as an option or even in combination.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers speculate patients may stop weight loss shots before their prescription runs out due to not getting the results they want fast enough. Additionally, they may suffer harsh side effects like stomach paralysis and blindness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And the second study released this week showed they may be more likely to suffer anxiety, cognitive issues or psychotic disorders.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Researchers suspect people getting weight loss surgery may have better results than those on Ozempic because a large percentage of GLP-1 users quit using the drugs. Side effects could be to blame. Brea Hand (left), for example, told DailyMail.com she required five hospital visits before doctors diagnosed her with gastroparesis, which was allegedly caused by Ozempic. And Brad Roberts claimed in a lawsuit the drug gave him joint and muscle pain&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;That study, from researchers at Tulane University in Louisiana, looked at 33,600 patients who had bariatric surgery and 33,600 who were perscribed GLP-1 medications for five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They found people who had surgery were 54 percent less likely to develop cognitive deficits like memory issues, 18 percent less likely to have anxiety and 17 percent less likely to develop substance abuse issues than people on weight loss drugs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While it's unclear exactly why bariatric surgery lowered these risks, the experts suggested it could be due to surgery causing faster, more consistent results.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Shauna Levy, study co-author and chief in the Division of MIS/Bariatric surgery at Tulane University School of Medicine, said: 'The study shows metabolic and bariatric surgery confers a strong protective effect against common mental health disorders in a head-to-head comparison with GLP-1 pharmacotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The data supports embedding psychiatric screening and support within both surgical and medical obesity programs to help reduce the potential mental health burden after treatment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Further investigation is needed, however, to determine why the psychological impact is so different between treatment modalities.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
