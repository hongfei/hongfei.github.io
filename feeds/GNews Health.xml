When they're not taking it [marijuana], their threshold of being able to handle anxiety is so low they actually require it just to function in daily life.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Forty-four percent of 19- to 30-year-olds used marijuana in 2022, the latest date available, or 25.3million people, &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://nida.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/2023/08/marijuana-and-hallucinogen-use-binge-drinking-reached-historic-highs-among-adults-35-to-50"&gt;estimates suggest&lt;/a&gt;, up from 28 percent that used the substance in 2012. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Studies suggest that users have a roughly 30 percent chance of &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14183807/elton-john-america-worst-decisions-health.html"&gt;becoming addicted to weed&lt;/a&gt;, with signs of addiction including inability to reduce usage, constant cravings and relationship problems. Withdrawal can feature a lack of appetite, restless sleep, mood swings and, in more extreme cases, uncontrolled vomiting. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;a target="_self" href="/news/article-6106111/One-seven-Americans-used-marijuana-year.html"&gt;According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse&lt;/a&gt;, approximately 2.7million Americans meet the criteria for marijuana use disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Addiction may be attributable to the drug's potency, which has increased over time. Ryan Sultan, a psychiatrist at Integrative Psychiatry who specializes in substance use, said the strength of marijuana products had increased by design.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘One of the marketing schemes is to talk about your [marijuana] being as strong as possible. When you get stronger, the risk of addiction for anything is going to go up,’ he told DailyMail.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;More young adults are becoming addicted to cannabis, experts suggest (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Pollock added: ‘Kids grew up with the idea from parents and [others] that weed is a very bad substance; it's illegal and you can't engage in it. All of a sudden, they're seeing it's legal with weed shops on every corner.’ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Marijuana is illegal at the federal level and &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/news/article-11645727/How-America-surrendered-marijuana-KAYLA-BRANTLEY-reveals-pot-ubiquitous-US.html"&gt;fully legal in 24 states&lt;/a&gt;, plus Washington DC. More than half of Americans live in states where recreational marijuana is legal, and 79 percent live in a county with at least one dispensary, according to the &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2025/07/08/facts-about-marijuana/"&gt;Pew Research Center&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A typical dispensary sells ‘pre-rolls’, such as joints and blunts, as well as gummies and edibles. Dozens of strains are available from $25.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The content of THC, the psychoactive ingredient that makes one 'high' after consuming marijuana, in most strains is around 20 to 30 percent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is a significant rise in THC content from 1995, when the average batch of marijuana seized by the DEA had a THC content of four percent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sultan said: ‘An old joint would have a little bit of weed, like a skinny, little coffee straw, and now we have these massive, enormous joints.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In weed pens and vapes, THC can reach percentages in the 90s. They are normally available for $50 to $100. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Pollock said: ‘Weed pens make it very convenient. They reduce the amount of smell quite a bit, so even in school or at work, it's very easy to hide it in comparison to other addictive substances such as alcohol, where it is much more apparent that someone is actively under the influence.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sultan is also concerned about the pens and vapes, as they are part of a trend of marijuana products designed for faster, easier consumption, with weed at its strongest levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above graph shows how cannabis use has risen among 19-to-30-year-olds and older adults as more states have legalized the drug&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the US, marijuana is illegal at the federal level, classified as Schedule 1, putting it in the same class as heroin and ecstasy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;President Donald Trump said in August that he was 'looking' at reclassifying the drug: ‘Some people like it, some people hate it. Some people hate the whole concept of marijuana because if it does bad for the children, it does bad for people that are older than children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘It's a very complicated subject, the subject of marijuana. I've heard great things having to do with medical and I've heard bad things having to do with just about everything else.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Joe Biden’s administration &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/16/us/politics/marijuana-schedule-drug-biden.html"&gt;proposed &lt;/a&gt;moving marijuana to a Schedule 3 drug last May. A Schedule 3 drug, such as ketamine or testosterone, has 'moderate to low potential for physical and psychological dependence.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sultan, however, believes there should be more oversight around weed, especially its source. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Weed grown illegally can be contaminated with pesticides or other toxic ingredients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said: 'It's gone from a boutique hobby to organizations that are trying to make money. There's very little regulation or enforcement of regulation around quality [of] ingredients, whether the label is accurate or looking for pesticides. It's supposed to all be tested but a lot of the testing is a little bit of a joke.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Last year, the &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2024-12-19/california-weed-cleanup"&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;/a&gt; found that 'more than half of cannabis smoking products in California’s legal market contain chemicals for which there is no public safety monitoring.'&lt;/p&gt;

About 80 percent of patients reported using weed products, which were largely acquired from 'informal sources' such as dealers, online sellers or friends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Looking ahead, Pollock and Sultan believe there need to be drastic changes to the industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sultan added: 'If science was in charge of the laws, which we never have been, we would pretty clearly say that no one should be using under the age of 25.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 25 Aug 2025 08:17:47 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinAFBVV95cUxNejQ1VjhNbVVVTFJZRWtyY2Mwb3pJY2oxUEVQQTF0YU9WVUxua3g0Wmx3T0FPZFNYankzZ2VpX19wSklQbTZqUEFMOVlPTkYyTVVWYkpMWS1VaVdvLVZtZ2xwRjIwY25ZLWwweGRpSTRhTkUzeTZ4NXpTRTFBbGFhLVVnMjNBT1VxOUlqOFJNNjFHdUxHNFZQQVh2SzLSAaIBQVVfeXFMT05ycUNhR3c4aXBtbGY5THBXc2FuX0p6OWlIRUIwaTNKMkVRTzB3OF9CeHljZ1dDTGpWM0o5ZU50WXZtbHZSblU5X2lSWDdTbFlvZkxpc3lUcVN5SDR3VXQ5X19RdW1GRklBZXE2MUxnc3VoWFQwTzM4c2szRVlKdGNpbjJLQTFaakh2Qmo2R2pZSGs0YWVBMGpEMFdob1VoNVJ3</guid></item><item><title>心理学说，喜欢独处的人具有90%的人羡慕的9种品质- VegOut</title><link>https://vegoutmag.com/lifestyle/s-psychology-says-people-who-love-being-alone-have-these-9-qualities-that-90-of-people-envy/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page__content mt-4"&gt;
							&lt;p&gt;Here's something that might surprise you: the person who leaves the party early to go home and read isn't missing out. They're onto something. While society pushes the narrative that happiness requires constant connection, those who genuinely enjoy solitude have quietly developed qualities the rest of us spend thousands on therapy trying to achieve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research challenges everything we assume about loners. People who actively seek and enjoy time alone aren't damaged or deficient. They've figured out that &lt;a href="https://www.thepositivepsychologypeople.com/the-misconception-about-introversion-and-extroversion-enjoying-alone-time/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;solitude and loneliness&lt;/a&gt; are completely different things. One is being alone and feeling empty; the other is being alone and feeling full. Those who've mastered the latter have developed remarkably enviable traits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. They have bulletproof self-awareness&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who love solitude know themselves in ways that unsettle the rest of us. They can explain exactly why they reacted badly to that comment last Tuesday, what triggers their anxiety, which childhood experience shaped their thing about authority. This isn't narcissism—it's the result of spending actual time with their thoughts instead of drowning them out with podcasts and plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://hbr.org/2018/01/what-self-awareness-really-is-and-how-to-cultivate-it" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Research shows&lt;/a&gt; only 10-15% of the 95% of people who think they're self-aware, actually are. Those who regularly  spend time alone tend to fall into that rare category. They've had uncomfortable conversations with themselves that others avoid. They've sat with feelings long enough to understand them, not just react.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result? Better decisions, stable relationships, less time wasted on things that don't matter. They're not guessing what they want—they know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. They're creative without trying&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solitude lovers don't need brainstorming sessions or creative workshops. Their minds naturally generate ideas because they've given their brains something most of us deny them: unstructured time. When you're alone without distraction, your mind wanders into the &lt;a href="https://introvertdear.com/news/introverts-alone-time-science-marti-olsen-laney/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;default mode network&lt;/a&gt;—basically, your brain's screensaver mode where the magic happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is when random thoughts collide to form new ideas. It's why people get their best insights in the shower or on long walks alone. Those who regularly seek solitude are essentially giving themselves multiple shower moments every day. They're not forcing creativity; they're creating the conditions where it naturally emerges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Susan Cain, author of "Quiet," points out that many of our greatest innovations—from the theory of evolution to the personal computer—came from people who knew how to be alone with their thoughts. The correlation isn't coincidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3. They're emotionally independent (and it shows)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watch someone who loves solitude navigate a crisis. They don't immediately call six friends for advice or post vague status updates fishing for support. They sit with the problem, process it internally, then reach out if they actually need help—not because they can't handle feeling bad for five minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This &lt;a href="https://www.ebsco.com/research-starters/psychology/emotion-self-regulation#:~:text=Emotion%20self%2Dregulation%20is%20the,illness%20in%20children%20and%20adults." target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;emotional self-regulation&lt;/a&gt; is incredibly rare. Most of us use other people as emotional regulators, constantly seeking validation, comfort, distraction. But those comfortable with solitude have learned to be their own emotional support system first. They still value connections, but aren't dependent on others to manage their internal weather.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their relationships are cleaner. They're not using friends as therapists or partners as parents. They show up whole, not as emotional vampires seeking completion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4. They have laser focus in a distracted world&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who love being alone have trained their brains to do something most of us have forgotten how to do: concentrate on one thing for extended periods without checking their phone. They can read entire books. They can work on projects for hours. They can have thoughts that last longer than a TikTok video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn't because they're naturally better at focusing. It's because solitude is essentially focus training. When you're alone without distractions, you have to learn to be with whatever you're doing. There's no one to talk to, no social energy to feed off. Just you and the task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our attention-deficit culture, this ability to sustain &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7851038/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;deep focus&lt;/a&gt; is becoming a superpower. While everyone else is struggling with productivity hacks and focus apps, solitude lovers have been building this muscle naturally through their quiet afternoons alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;5. They're authentically themselves (because they've met themselves)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's something different about people who spend significant time alone—they seem more solidly themselves. They're not trying on personalities or adapting interests to match whoever they're with. They know what they like, believe, value because they've had time to figure it out without outside influence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7851038/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;authentic self-knowledge&lt;/a&gt; means less susceptibility to peer pressure, trends, manipulation. They've built identity from inside out, not from external feedback. While everyone wonders "who am I?" they've answered that question—multiple times, in depth, probably in journals they'll never share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ironically, by caring less about fitting in, they become more interesting. Authenticity is magnetic, and they've got it in abundance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;6. They're masters of emotional intelligence&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contrary to the stereotype of the emotionally stunted loner, people who enjoy solitude often have superior emotional intelligence. They've spent so much time observing their own emotional patterns that they've become experts at recognizing them in others. They notice the slight tension in someone's voice, the forced smile, the subtle shift in energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This comes from &lt;a href="https://fns.sg/the-four-archetypes-of-self-awareness/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;internal self-awareness&lt;/a&gt;—understanding your own emotions so well that you can recognize their echoes in others. Solitude lovers have done the homework on their own emotional landscape, which makes them surprisingly good at navigating others'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They're often the friends who check in at exactly the right moment, who know when to push and when to give space, who can sit with someone else's difficult emotions because they've already sat with their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;7. They solve problems differently (and often better)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Give a problem to someone who loves solitude and watch what happens. They don't immediately crowdsource solutions or form a committee. They take the problem away, sit with it, turn it over in their mind, approach it from seventeen different angles. Then they come back with a solution that no one else thought of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is because solitude allows for &lt;a href="https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/divergent-thinking#:~:text=Divergent%20thinking%20expands%20possibilities.,make%20decisions%20based%20on%20evidence." target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;divergent thinking&lt;/a&gt;—the ability to generate creative ideas by exploring many possible solutions. When you're alone, you're not anchored by groupthink or conventional wisdom. Your mind is free to wander down weird paths and make unexpected connections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While everyone else is following the same problem-solving playbook, solitude lovers are writing their own. They're not necessarily smarter—they've just given their brains the space to think differently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;8. They have unusual resilience&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who enjoy being alone have a secret weapon when life gets hard: they're already comfortable with discomfort. They've sat through boring afternoons, restless evenings, anxious mornings without immediately reaching for distraction. They've learned difficult feelings pass if you let them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This builds emotional resilience that's hard to develop otherwise. When crisis hits, they don't panic about being alone with thoughts—that's their default. They know how to be their own companion through difficulty, never truly alone even by themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They've been doing exposure therapy for existential discomfort their whole lives. While others learn to sit with uncertainty through meditation apps, they've been doing it naturally for years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;9. They choose quality over quantity (in everything)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who love solitude are ruthlessly selective—with their time, their relationships, their commitments. They've learned that everything has an opportunity cost measured in alone time, so they make sure it's worth it. This leads to a life that might look smaller from the outside but feels infinitely richer from the inside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They have fewer friends, but deeper friendships. Fewer hobbies, but genuine expertise. Fewer experiences, but more meaningful ones. They've figured out that depth beats breadth almost every time, and they structure their lives accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This quality-over-quantity approach extends to their inner life too. They'd rather have one profound insight than twenty surface-level observations. One hour of genuine solitude beats ten hours of distracted alone time. They're not just choosing to be alone—they're choosing to be alone well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Final thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most interesting thing about people who love solitude isn't that they've opted out of society—most haven't. They've figured out you can't give what you don't have. All those qualities we admire—creativity, authenticity, emotional intelligence, resilience—grow in the quiet spaces we usually try to fill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plot twist: people who love being alone often make the best company. They show up complete, not as needy fragments seeking validation. They listen better because they're not just waiting to talk. They're more interesting because they've actually developed interests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe the secret isn't forcing ourselves to be more social or to love solitude. Maybe it's recognizing that people who've figured out how to be alone have developed the very qualities that make being together worthwhile. They're not antisocial—they're doing the homework the rest of us keep avoiding. Judging by the results, maybe we should take notes.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Cannabis compounds are showing early promise for healthy aging, a new study has found. However, much more research is needed to learn how results might differ depending on&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-reveal-how-long-a-cannabis-high-actually-lasts"&gt; the frequency of use&lt;/a&gt; and the individual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers in the UK reviewed 18 different studies across 15 years of research (2008 to 2023), involving both &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory_mouse"&gt;animal models&lt;/a&gt; and human participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"By synthesizing findings from preclinical models, clinical studies, and real-world evidence, we aimed to elucidate the potential of cannabinoids, in fostering healthy aging, mitigate age-related decline, and promote well-being in older populations," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s42238-025-00267-x"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers in their published paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cannabis-linked-to-2x-risk-of-heart-disease-death-scientists-discover"&gt;Cannabis Linked to 2x Risk of Heart Disease Death, Scientists Discover&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientists focused on the key cannabis compounds &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabidiol"&gt;cannabidiol&lt;/a&gt; (CBD) and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrahydrocannabinol"&gt;tetrahydrocannabinol&lt;/a&gt; (THC), finding some strong results for anti-aging effects in animal tests, and more mixed results in humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, the statistics are "promising" in terms of how cannabis can reduce inflammation and protect the brain, the researchers &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s42238-025-00267-x"&gt;say&lt;/a&gt;. In animals, cannabis doses were linked to longer lifespans, improved learning, and reduced inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the researchers caution against overhyping these positive signs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_171458" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-171458" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/CannabisTable.jpg" alt="Cannabis use" class="wp-image-171458 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/CannabisTable.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/CannabisTable-623x415.jpg 623w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/CannabisTable-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-171458" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Cannabis use has been linked to both positive and negative health effects.

These aren't easy results to interpret.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers are also keen to acknowledge that staying healthy into old age is dependent on a whole host of factors, including &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-30-year-study-may-have-found-the-single-best-diet-for-healthy-aging"&gt;what we eat&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-reveal-how-much-sleep-you-need-for-successful-aging"&gt;how much sleep&lt;/a&gt; we get. Cannabis is only part of the story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"While these compounds show promise in addressing specific age-related challenges, maintaining a healthy lifestyle through a balanced diet, regular exercise, good sleep hygiene, and stress management remains crucial for promoting healthy aging and overall well-being," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s42238-025-00267-x"&gt;writes&lt;/a&gt; the team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's cautious optimism, and the review does highlight a gap in our knowledge: we need more research into the effects of cannabis on people, involving greater numbers of participants, longer periods of time, and clearer signs of cause and effect when it comes to anti-aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We know that the drug is now being used more and more for medicinal purposes, and is legal in an increasing number of places in the world. However, there are still plenty of questions over &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cannabis-use-is-linked-to-epigenetic-changes-scientists-discover"&gt;just how cannabis use impacts us&lt;/a&gt; – based on age, dosage amount, and accompanying health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The world's population is getting older, and our bodies are being asked to live for longer than ever before, on average. Scientists are keen to figure out ways to ensure that longer lifespans can be &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/want-to-live-past-100-experts-recommend-these-four-habits"&gt;enjoyed in good health&lt;/a&gt;, and careful cannabis use could be something worth investigating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"With aging emerging as a global challenge linked to chronic diseases, identifying interventions that support a healthy lifespan and healthspan has become imperative," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s42238-025-00267-x"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study has been published in the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s42238-025-00267-x"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Journal of Cannabis Research&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

The materials are then processed and refined, releasing large amounts of heat-trapping gas along the way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;On the disposal end, less than 10% of plastic is properly recycled, &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/plastic-pollution-health-crisis-disease-death/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:per;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;per&lt;/a&gt; CBS, which means the majority of our plastic waste winds up in already overflowing landfills and in fragile habitats. Over time, plastic litter may leach chemicals into soil systems, water sources, and food supplies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;Why is plastic pollution concerning?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The new report references evidence to suggest that human health can be negatively affected by plastic pollution throughout the life course, from infancy onward, and with risks higher in young children. Potential health concerns include reproductive issues, cognitive dysfunction, cardiovascular problems, stroke, and cancer — and may total over a trillion dollars annually in economic losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In terms of its environmental tolls, the production of plastics generated close to 2 billion tons of heat-trapping gases in 2019 alone, &lt;a href="https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/science/climate-issues/plastics" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:according to;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;according to&lt;/a&gt; the United Nations. Just a few years later, the UN would take up the mission of convening global talks to reach an international treaty addressing the plastics crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In conjunction with its new report, The Lancet's Countdown on Health and Plastics was launched as an independent monitoring effort just ahead of the latest round of UN-hosted negotiations this August. Indeed, Countdown co-authors noted the "expected finalisation of this treaty."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Unfortunately, by the end of this month's meeting, the talks had failed to reach an agreement, with oil-producing parties refusing to move forward with plastic production caps, preferring to lean on recycling and waste management strategies instead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Meanwhile, rising global temperatures and plastic pollution are "causing disease, death and disability today in tens of thousands of people," Landrigan said, &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/plastic-pollution-health-crisis-disease-death/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:per;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;per&lt;/a&gt; CBS. "and these harms will become more severe in the years ahead as the planet continues to warm and plastic production continues to increase.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;What's being done about plastic pollution?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;While researchers work to develop new and more flexible recycling technologies as well as plastic-sensing methods for detecting pollution, widespread &lt;a href="http://guide.thecooldown.com/actions/support-eco-friendly-initiatives-by-mainstream-brands" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:anti-plastic initiatives;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;anti-plastic initiatives&lt;/a&gt; and community cleanup efforts can help individuals tackle the issue as a collective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Households can take steps to reduce use and pollution by making simple &lt;a href="https://guide.thecooldown.com/journeys/use-less-plastic/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:plastic-free swaps;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;plastic-free swaps&lt;/a&gt; at home.

It’s fast, detailed, and helps catch problems that other scans might miss. Over the years, technology has made CT scans even sharper and more useful, which explains why hospitals and clinics are using them more than ever. In fact, in the US, the number of CT scans being done has climbed back up after the pandemic slowdown and is now higher than before. Simply put, CT has moved from being “special” to almost essential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/experts-warn-of-salmonella-dublin-cattle-born-superbug-that-is-spreading-to-humans/articleshow/123487059.cms" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/intermittent-fasting-can-increase-the-risk-of-heart-disease-finds-study-heres-what-it-means/articleshow/123488759.cms" rel="noopener" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Intermittent fasting can increase the risk of heart disease, finds study: Here's what it means&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;keyword id="7628252" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="JAMA-study" source="Orion"&gt;JAMA study&lt;/keyword&gt; highlights the life threatening risk associated with annual computed tomography (CT) examinations in the United States&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2832778" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;study &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;has found that the widespread use of CT scans in the United States could be linked to about 103,000 new cancer cases over the lifetime of those exposed in 2023 alone. With 93 million CT scans performed that year, researchers estimate that radiation from these scans could account for roughly 5% of all new cancer diagnoses annually if current practices continue. The study highlights that while CT scans are an essential diagnostic tool saving countless lives, their radiation exposure is a known cancer risk, especially concerning children, who are more sensitive to radiation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How did researchers estimate the 103,000 future cancers?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers estimated the projected 103,000 future cancers from the 2023 CT scans by combining several key data points and methods:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Number of CT scans: They used data showing that approximately 93 million CT scans were performed in the US in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Radiation dose per scan: Each type of CT scan involves a measurable radiation dose, which is known from medical physics and radiology studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Risk models: Researchers applied well-established cancer risk models, primarily based on data from atomic bomb survivors and other radiation-exposed populations. These models estimate the lifetime risk of developing cancer per unit of radiation exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Demographic factors: The risk assessment accounted for age, sex, and the specific organs exposed during the CT scan, recognizing that younger patients have higher sensitivity to radiation-induced cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lifetime risk projection: By multiplying the radiation dose from each scan by the associated cancer risk and the number of scans performed, then summing across all scan types and patient demographics, researchers estimated the total number of future cancer cases attributable to 2023 examinations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adjustments for uncertainty: Researchers included statistical uncertainty ranges and sensitivity analyses to reflect confidence intervals in their estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This approach integrates real-world CT scan usage data with recognized radiation risk science to provide a credible projection of the potential long-term cancer burden from medical CT imaging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most common cancers projected to result from CT radiation include lung, colon, leukemia, bladder, and breast cancers. Abdominal and pelvic CT scans contribute to the largest share of these cancer cases. The risk per scan is higher in children but, since adults undergo the majority of scans, most projected cancers occur in adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts emphasize that for individual patients, the risk from a necessary CT scan is low and the benefits usually outweigh the risks. However, the growing use of CT imaging, sometimes in situations without clear clinical need, raises concerns. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How should one weigh CT scan benefits versus radiation risk?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weighing the benefits of a CT scan against the radiation risk depends on your specific health situation, and it’s important to discuss this with your healthcare provider. Here’s a simple way to approach it:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medical necessity: If your doctor recommends a CT scan, it’s usually because the potential benefits, accurate diagnosis, guiding treatment, or detecting serious conditions, outweigh the small risk of radiation. Often, CT scans provide critical information that other tests cannot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Risk factors: Consider your age, overall health, and frequency of past scans. Younger people and children are more sensitive to radiation. If you’ve had multiple CT scans recently, it’s worth discussing whether this scan is essential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alternatives: Ask if there are non-radiation imaging options like MRI or ultrasound that could provide similar information. Sometimes these are suitable alternatives with no radiation exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Radiation dose: Inquire about the radiation dose for your particular CT scan. Advances in technology have reduced doses significantly, and radiologists strive to use the lowest dose needed for clear images.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Communication: Be open with your doctor about your concerns. Together, you can evaluate the urgency of the scan, potential health consequences of skipping it, and personal risk factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="59"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In most cases, if a CT scan is recommended by a qualified provider, the benefit of accurate diagnosis and treatment outweighs the risk. But it’s always good to have a clear, informed discussion tailored to your health needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="61"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study calls attention to balancing CT scan benefits with their potential long-term cancer risks, urging more cautious and judicious use of this powerful imaging technology in US healthcare. "If current practices persist, CT-associated cancer could eventually account for 5% of all new cancer diagnoses annually," the researchers have warned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="63"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="64"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Mon, 25 Aug 2025 02:29:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>没有毯子就无法入睡的人（即使在夏天）通常具有这5个特征- VegOut</title><link>https://vegoutmag.com/lifestyle/r-people-who-cant-fall-asleep-without-a-blanket-even-in-summer-usually-share-these-5-traits/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page__content mt-4"&gt;
							&lt;p&gt;Back in college, I had a roommate who would wrap himself in a thick comforter while our apartment hit 78 degrees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The AC was broken, windows were open, and there he was—cocooned like he was camping in the Arctic instead of sweating through a Brooklyn heatwave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Aren't you dying in there?" I asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Can't sleep without it," he mumbled through the fabric fortress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought he was just being dramatic. But turns out, the need for blanket security—even when it's physically uncomfortable—reveals some fascinating things about how our brains work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After diving into the research (and interrogating every blanket-dependent person I know), I've noticed six traits that keep showing up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. They're highly sensitive to their environment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blanket sleepers aren't just picky about temperature—they're tuned into everything. Like that friend who immediately notices when someone rearranges the furniture or can't concentrate if there's even the faintest hum from the refrigerator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This heightened sensitivity is actually a real thing. Researchers call it "&lt;a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/highly-sensitive-person"&gt;sensory processing sensitivity&lt;/a&gt;," and about 20% of people have it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their nervous systems pick up on subtleties others miss: the way light hits the wall differently, slight changes in air pressure, even emotional shifts in the room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For these folks, a blanket isn't just about warmth—it's about creating consistent sensory input. The gentle, even pressure acts like a buffer against all those tiny environmental changes that might otherwise keep their brains alert and scanning for threats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think of it like wearing noise-canceling headphones, but for your entire body. The blanket creates a predictable sensory environment that lets their mind finally downshift into sleep mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. They crave routine and predictability&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know those people who eat the same breakfast every day, take the same route to work, and get genuinely thrown off when their favorite coffee shop changes its menu? Yeah, they probably sleep with blankets year-round too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's something deeply satisfying about having one part of your day that stays exactly the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When everything else feels chaotic—work deadlines, family drama, the general unpredictability of existing as a human—that familiar weight and texture becomes an anchor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started noticing this pattern when I was tracking my own sleep habits last year. On nights when my routine got disrupted—late dinner, different pillow, forgot to charge my phone—I slept terribly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the one constant that helped me drift off, even on weird nights? My lightweight blanket, folded just so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The blanket becomes part of a sleep ritual that signals to your brain: "Okay, we're doing this thing we always do. Time to power down." It's like having a consistent opening chord in the song of sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3. They're naturally more anxious&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's where things get interesting. Anxiety and blanket dependency often go hand in hand, and it's not just because anxious people are "needy" or "childish." There's actual &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/anxiety/do-weighted-blankets-work"&gt;neuroscience&lt;/a&gt; behind it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we're anxious, our nervous system is stuck in alert mode—heart rate elevated, muscles tense, mind racing through worst-case scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deep pressure from a blanket triggers something called "deep pressure stimulation," which activates our parasympathetic nervous system (the "rest and digest" mode) and helps regulate cortisol levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's the same reason weighted blankets became so popular, or why some people find tight hugs incredibly calming. The pressure creates a physiological shift that anxious brains desperately need but often can't access on their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One friend described it perfectly: "Without my blanket, I feel like I'm floating in space. With it, I feel grounded." That sense of being unmoored, untethered—that's anxiety talking. And the blanket provides literal and figurative weight to counter that feeling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4. They're deeply introspective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This might sound like a stretch, but hear me out. People who need blankets for sleep tend to be the same ones who spend a lot of time in their heads—processing the day, analyzing interactions, planning tomorrow, or just letting their minds wander through random thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Introspective people often struggle with what sleep researchers call "&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-90673-1"&gt;cognitive arousal&lt;/a&gt;"—their brains don't have an easy off switch. They're the ones lying in bed remembering a conversation from three weeks ago or suddenly solving a work problem at 11 PM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The blanket creates a physical boundary that helps contain all that mental activity. It's like building a soft fortress around your thoughts, giving them a defined space instead of letting them scatter everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I experienced this firsthand during a particularly stressful period where I was obsessing over a career decision. No blanket meant lying there mentally drafting pros and cons lists until 2 AM. With my trusty throw, somehow that same mental energy felt more contained, more manageable. Less like thoughts spiraling outward, more like them settling inward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;5. They value emotional security above comfort&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, blanket sleepers will choose emotional comfort over physical comfort almost every time. They'll endure being hot, sweaty, or uncomfortable because the alternative—feeling exposed or unprotected—is worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not about temperature regulation; it's about emotional regulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The blanket represents safety, security, a known quantity in a world full of unknowns. Taking it away feels like removing a shield, leaving them vulnerable to whatever anxieties or worries might creep in during those quiet moments before sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think about it: sleep is when we're most defenseless. We're unconscious, unaware, completely out of control. For people who already tend toward anxiety or sensitivity, adding the feeling of physical exposure makes that vulnerability unbearable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've watched friends choose to be uncomfortably warm rather than sleep without their blanket, even when they're complaining about the heat. It's not logical—it's emotional. And emotions don't care about logic when it comes to feeling safe enough to fall asleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Final words&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of this is about being "weak" or "childish." Needing a blanket to sleep comfortably is just one way some brains have learned to self-regulate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a pretty elegant solution, actually—using something simple and accessible to address complex neurological and emotional needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're a year-round blanket sleeper, you're probably someone who feels deeply, notices subtly, and needs a little extra help creating the conditions for rest. That's not a flaw—it's just how your particular nervous system works best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if you're sharing a bed with someone who insists on blankets in July, maybe cut them some slack. They're not trying to torture you with their body heat. They're just trying to feel safe enough to fall asleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes the simplest solutions are the most profound ones. A blanket isn't just fabric—it's a tool for emotional regulation, sensory management, and psychological safety. Not bad for something you can pick up at Target for twenty bucks.&lt;/p&gt;

We're not just seeing CRPV, but we're seeing increases in Lyme disease and other mosquito-borne illnesses and tick-borne illnesses as well,' Dr Omer Awan of the University of &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/maryland/index.html" id="mol-d44c1a30-811c-11f0-9b9e-e7814d9122b1"&gt;Maryland&lt;/a&gt; School of Medicine told the Daily Mail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Awan noted that the type of heat and moist conditions mosquitoes, ticks, and fleas thrive in has been spreading out into parts of the US that have never dealt with those conditions before. And the viruses affecting rabbits, squirrels, and deer are spread by insect bites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Throughout the northern US and &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/canada/index.html" id="mol-fece0f70-811c-11f0-9b9e-e7814d9122b1" class="class"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;, squirrels have been spreading squirrel fibromatosis, a virus causing wart-like growths that may ooze fluid but usually heal on their own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In rabbits, cases of cottontail rabbit papilloma virus (CRPV), also known as Shope papilloma virus, have been spreading north throughout the Midwest, moving from &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/colorado/index.html" id="mol-fece0f71-811c-11f0-9b9e-e7814d9122b1" class="class"&gt;Colorado&lt;/a&gt; to Minnesota, &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/nebraska/index.html" id="mol-fece0f72-811c-11f0-9b9e-e7814d9122b1" class="class"&gt;Nebraska&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/south-dakota/index.html" id="mol-fece0f73-811c-11f0-9b9e-e7814d9122b1" class="class"&gt;South Dakota&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Americans from the Pacific Northwest to the Northeast have spotted cases of deer cutaneous fibroma, better known as deer warts. This condition is the same viral family as the &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/hpv/index.html" id="mol-13f603d0-811d-11f0-9b9e-e7814d9122b1" class="class"&gt;human papillomavirus&lt;/a&gt;, causing growths all over a deer's body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A Reddit user recently posted images of a rabbit in Shope papilloma virus in Saint Paul, Minnesota in late July &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Deer warts are spread by a virus which is transmitted through mosquito and tick bites. This deer, posted on X, was photographed in Ohio &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While the sightings are taking Americans by surprise, experts assured that these grotesque conditions are not new diseases, but are centuries-old viruses that only infect the species carrying them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Awan emphasized that humans cannot contract any of these conditions from wildlife or the insects that bite them. That's because each virus will not replicate in a tick or mosquito for it to be transmitted to people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, as the summer heat bleeds into more months of the year, the doctor warned that these disease-carrying pests are living longer and invading more states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;That puts more Americans at risk for the other diseases they carry, including Lyme, West Nile, Zika, Dengue Fever, and Chikungunya, all of which are potentially fatal conditions in severe cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The threat will not likely be year-round but certainly will expand by weeks, if not months, in the year. We will start to see these diseases become endemic in areas not thought to harbor these diseases, which is already occurring,' Dr Awan explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This is a prime environment and climate for many of these illnesses to soar. I think it's sort of a perfect storm for many of these diseases to thrive,' he added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;AccuWeather has forecasted that the fall will be hotter than normal for parts of 25 states, particularly in the eastern and northwestern US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;AccuWeather's lead long-range expert Paul Pastelok said: 'There is a clear trend of hot and sticky summer weather sticking around longer into the back-to-school season across much of the East Coast and many other parts of the country.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The AccuWeather team added it's not just the fall forecast that's a problem; warmer temperatures throughout all of 2025 have affected the number of disease-carrying insects people will see the rest of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Disease-carrying mosquitoes cannot transmit deer warts, squirrel fibromatosis, or cottontail rabbit papilloma virus, but they can infect humans with other illnesses&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Residents in Canada have also captured images of infected squirrels who were covered in hairless tumors associated with fibromatosis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Warmer, humid weather doesn't just bring outdoor fun - it can bring mosquitoes. These insects thrive in wet, hot climates. The location's weather patterns over the past several months can determine how many mosquitoes emerge,' meteorologists explained. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While climate changes in recent years have helped the virus to spread, Dr Awan noted that there's one other factor contributing to the increase in mutated animal sightings: social media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'People are starting to talk about it more, they're starting to document it more on social media, and hence, there's been a lot more discussion about this,' the doctor explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'When you look at a rabbit, you start to see these outgrowths through the head, the face, the neck. It certainly prompts your attention, and people take pictures of it, and they talk about it,' he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In Colorado, there have been multiple sightings of rabbits with CRPV, particularly near the city of Fort Collins, over the last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Colorado Parks and Wildlife (CPW) has urged anyone who sees infected rabbits to stay away and not touch them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Reports of squirrel fibromatosis, or squirrel pox, date back to 2023, when residents in Maine captured images of common gray squirrels covered in tumors while visiting their backyards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Squirrel fibromatosis is caused by a virus that cannot be transmitted to people or other animals&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A Reddit user posted an image in 2024 of a rabbit in Fort Collins, Colorado, exhibiting signs of Shope papilloma virus&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;In late June, a Reddit users photographed a young deer with its face completely covered in warts in Milwaukee, Wisconsin&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While disease-carrying insects can transmit the virus, wildlife experts believe homeowners who put bird feeders in their yards may have also unintentionally caused the virus to spread to more squirrels who gathered there looking for food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Shevenell Webb from the Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife said: 'It's like when you get a large concentration of people. If someone is sick and it's something that spreads easily, others are going to catch it.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As for deer warts, the condition is part of the same broad family of viruses that can affect humans, known as papillomaviruses, which target the skin and mucous membranes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In humans, papillomaviruses cause conditions like common warts, plantar warts, and genital warts, and some strains are linked to cancers such as cervical or throat cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Deer warts can be small, like a pea, or grow as big as a football, appearing gray, black, or fleshy and often hairless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The condition is rarely fatal. The deer's immune system fights off the virus, and the warts shrink and disappear on their own after a few months. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In rare cases, if the warts grow too large or become infected with bacteria, they can cause problems like blocking a deer's vision or ability to eat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

These include forgetfulness, difficulty learning, and slower reflexes. So what contributes to an aging brain? A new study has found the culprit behind it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent study by researchers at the University of California, San Francisco, has identified a protein that’s at the center of this decline. The findings of the research are published in &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-025-00940-z" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Nature&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Aging and the &lt;keyword id="6361813" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="brain" source="Orion"&gt;brain&lt;/keyword&gt; &lt;br&gt;      &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that a certain protein slows the aging brain, and they know how to counter it. Aging is particularly harsh on the hippocampus, which is the brain region responsible for learning and memory. To understand what aging does to the brain, the researchers looked at the genes and proteins in the hippocampus that changed over time. They observed this in mice model. What they found is significant for further research on &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6039826/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;aging&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; and cognitive decline. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that there was one difference between the old and young animals. It was the presence of a protein called FTL1. The researchers observed that the old mice had more FTL1, compared to the younger mice. Interestingly, the presence of FTL1 also led to fewer connections between brain cells in the hippocampus and diminished cognitive abilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The study&lt;br&gt;      &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;To further understand if FTL1 was the culprit, the researchers artificially elevated FTL1 levels in young mice. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What they found was striking. They noticed that the brains and behavior of the young mice began to resemble that of old mice. In experiments in petri dishes, nerve cells engineered to make lots of FTL1 grew simple, one-armed neurites — rather than the branching neurites that normal cells create.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the researchers lowered the levels of FTL1 in the hippocampus of the old mice, surprisingly, they began to regain their youth. The old mice also had more connections between nerve cells, and also responded to memory tests in a better way. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is truly a reversal of impairments. It’s much more than merely delaying or preventing symptoms,” Saul Villeda, PhD, associate director of the UCSF Bakar Aging Research Institute and senior author of the paper, said, in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also noticed that the FTL1 slowed down metabolism in the cells of the hippocampus in old mice. But the researchers had found a way to combat it. They treated the cells with a compound that stimulates metabolism and prevented these effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers are optimistic that their work could lead to therapies that block the effects of FTL1 in the brain. “We’re seeing more opportunities to alleviate the worst consequences of old age. It’s a hopeful time to be working on the biology of aging,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Mon, 25 Aug 2025 00:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikAJBVV95cUxPaEtxcVhPMEp3dU9lV01MOE9fNkg5X3o1M085SXdVX010bXFQZVZ0VDM5RzlIQUV3bGREd3h1azFwVGk1TkdkenBQeGkyR01yQ2VseEphdVVIakJxRjE0dGRDdkhTeFNVaHlYWnhVRUxic01RZmE1YjJJRm5yNElJX2FtYW56VFJ6MW1kcEFtbDNmQTliY01CUS1nTDNWWkFXTy1kNkdjeEttc0ZSaUZSYm1xTVplbkZJdDJEUHBQQkxoOWcyRTFfVDB6ZUIwZkhmaHVoVkdWaFZxcHBmTUpfaTFjajNTVHA3OTdfMFItQThLYWxEX25mcUV1dl9uX1BGSUZxT0liMjVxbHNVdGRVMA</guid></item><item><title>随着廉价血压药物与致命的乳腺癌作斗争取得突破- Vanguard News</title><link>https://www.vanguardngr.com/2025/08/breakthrough-as-cheap-blood-pressure-drug-fights-deadly-breast-cancer/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Vanguard News</author><pubDate>Mon, 25 Aug 2025 00:19:59 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqgFBVV95cUxNLUQxUXhNQzM3X0xRWmpTYkVobWd0MDNUbVlyZ05LQlhEQVRPY1RmQ0dibEM5T3JPZ2V1eXZyeXNzYVgwMG5icWVmblJuazFHdlpHV0h3V1BGd0NnY0NORnJtNHo2c2hIclkwcjZkZGpDUEp6bEVIRGFXQ1EtMDEzNmQzNHFIWHFVeFhUWlVOSTQyR3ZtY1JXZk1LX0Z5a2FKMHEyeTRvZHM5Z9IBrwFBVV95cUxPR084aE1fSTlENHFuNVRsRXJnLTJKbldDYzhGUW5GVVpBWG1NX0pldmdoa0M5cndVb2VsMVlyYkllV3hvUmgwakNaSTJza0duaGlRaEpaRHJqcHpfcG9vaTI2MGxaUmpscVJYZWh1VzVmUm1YQVdiUkhiNzBkb29UelBJSGZzZWw3R05rakRKaWQ0THVTTWtqZjh2cTNycHNDdHVxT3J1XzVxWXlZczY0</guid></item><item><title>5件与糖尿病药物不太搭配的事情- EatingWell</title><link>https://www.eatingwell.com/things-that-don-t-mix-well-with-your-diabetes-medications-11795966</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-callout--summary mntl-sc-block-universal-callout--tips mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-summary callout--bordered" data-text="Key Points" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;

But understanding what specific foods and drinks interact with your medications is also key. “Diabetes medications are designed to work in a very specific way to help &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290068/12-healthy-ways-to-lower-your-blood-sugar/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;control your blood sugar&lt;/a&gt;,” says&lt;a href="https://baptisthealth.net/academics/residencies-and-fellowships/pharmacy/pgy2-pharmacy-residency-programs/pgy2-ambulatory-care-pharmacy-residency/pgy2-ambulatory-care-pharmacy-residency-preceptors" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt; Elaina Rosario, Pharm.D., CPh, BCACP, CDCES&lt;/a&gt;. “When you eat certain foods, they can change how your medication is absorbed, how it works in your body, or how quickly it is used up. This can sometimes make the medication less effective, or in some cases, too strong.” 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rebeccaemch/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Rebecca Emch, Pharm.D.&lt;/a&gt;, agrees, “From a pharmaceutical perspective, food interactions with diabetes medications occur through several mechanisms.” The effects vary depending on the type of medication you’re taking. “For medications like metformin, certain foods can affect absorption rates and bioavailability,” says Emch. However, this type of interaction isn’t as common since many times the foods in the diet don’t directly affect absorption of the medications. Instead, Emch says that it’s more common that foods eaten work against their intended purpose. “When you take a diabetes medication to lower blood sugar, and then consume foods that cause &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/habits-that-can-spike-your-blood-sugar-11762553" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;rapid glucose spikes&lt;/a&gt;, you're essentially creating a tug-of-war in your system,” she says. Other foods like those high in fat may also have an impact. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Because of these effects,&lt;a href="https://www.rikernutritionconsulting.com/about-cari" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt; Cari Riker, RDN, LDN, CDCES&lt;/a&gt; emphasizes the importance of following a diet that helps you best &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/simple-ways-to-keep-blood-sugar-in-check-11791785" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;manage your blood sugar&lt;/a&gt; while also preventing medication interactions. “Selecting foods that reduce these impacts can help improve tolerance and effectiveness,” says Riker. We’re sharing which types of foods may interact with your diabetes medications and tips on how to stay safe.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Some dietary fats like unsaturated fats are beneficial for health, but saturated fats in excess are associated with an &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/risk-factors-prediabetes-8733895" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;increased risk for type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Additionally, meals that are high in fat may affect the bioavailability of certain medications. “High-fat foods slow digestion which delays how quickly some medications are absorbed and when they take effect,” says&lt;a href="https://nourishedwithdaria.com/about-diabetes-dietitian/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt; Daria Zajac, RD, LDN&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “Examples of high fat foods include whole-fat dairy products, processed meats, fried foods and baked goods like cookies and cake.” Not only can they slow down how fast a medication works, according to Rosario, they can also trigger the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/common-side-effects-of-glp-1-medication-8778573" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;gastrointestinal side effects&lt;/a&gt; of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RA) such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-2-foods-high-in-added-sugar"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 2. Foods High in Added Sugar &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;  “Limiting &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-packaged-foods-for-blood-sugar-8747313" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;high-sugar foods&lt;/a&gt; can help prevent rapid spikes and crashes in blood sugar,” says Riker. This is because foods with added sugar may make it more difficult for your diabetes medication to work as intended. Emch points to high sugar foods like candy, sodas and desserts as well as fruit juices as some of the biggest culprits when it comes to foods that work against your diabetes medication. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “These don't stop medications like metformin from working, but they make it significantly harder to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290068/12-healthy-ways-to-lower-your-blood-sugar/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;maintain stable blood sugar levels&lt;/a&gt;,” says Emch. “It's like trying to bail water out of a boat while someone else is pouring more water in.” This doesn’t mean avoiding all foods with carbohydrates and sugar. Instead, focus on whole food sources of carbohydrates that are also natural sources of fiber like beans and legumes, whole grains, and whole fruits and vegetables whenever possible. “The quality and quantity of carbohydrates matter,” says Riker.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Highly Processed and Refined Carbohydrates &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Foods that are primarily carbohydrates and are also highly processed like white bread, high sugar cereals, chips, pretzels, crackers and baked goods like croissants, cookies and pies can often cause a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/reasons-for-high-blood-sugar-11741305" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;spike in your blood sugar&lt;/a&gt;. “If you take a fast-acting insulin or a medication that works with meals, this sudden spike can make it difficult for the medication to keep up, or it could lead to a sudden drop later if the medication works too aggressively to bring it down,” says Rosario.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “While your diabetes medication is designed to manage blood sugar, it's much easier for it to work effectively when your blood sugar levels are kept more stable.” If you choose to include &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8047875/what-are-refined-carbs/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;highly processed or refined carbohydrates&lt;/a&gt; in your diet, it can help to pair them with protein or fat as part of a balanced meal. This combination can help to slow digestion which may prevent blood sugar spikes.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; However, most of the diet should not be made up of highly processed carbohydrate sources. “The American Diabetes Association (ADA) specifically recommends that people with diabetes preferentially eat minimally processed sources of carbohydrate that are high in fiber,” says&lt;a href="https://diabetes.org/about-us/board-of-directors" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt; Joshua J. Neumiller, Pharm.D., CDCES, FADCES, FASCP&lt;/a&gt;, president of health care &amp;amp; education at the American Diabetes Association.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Medications that are in the class of SGLT2 inhibitors like Jardiance, Steglatro, and Farxiga work by allowing excess sugar to be removed via urine.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The diuretic effect of these medications may be compounded by the diuretic effect of excess caffeine. This doesn’t mean a cup of coffee or two will be a cause for concern, but those taking these medications should consider sticking to the recommended limit of 400mg caffeine per day (or approximately three to four cups of coffee).&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Alcohol should be limited when taking diabetes medications,” says Zajac. Drinking alcohol on an empty stomach or when skipping meals may worsen the effect it has when taking diabetes medications. “Alcohol increases the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/sneaky-signs-your-blood-sugar-is-too-low-11746496" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;risk of low blood sugar&lt;/a&gt;, especially for those taking insulin or sulfonylureas, since it interferes with the liver’s ability to release glucose into the bloodstream,” says Riker.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Riker also says that alcohol can worsen side effects like nausea and digestive upset when taking medications like metformin. “For those on SGLT2 inhibitors (i.e. Jardiance, Farxiga), alcohol’s dehydrating effects can increase the chances of dehydration, low blood pressure and rare but serious complications like diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA).”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Following recommendations to limit alcohol is essential when undergoing diabetes treatment. “The ADA recommends that people with diabetes &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/alcohol-and-your-health-11685623" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;consume alcohol in moderation&lt;/a&gt; by limiting intake to ≤2 drinks per day for men and ≤1 drink per day for women,” says Neumiller. “It is important that people with diabetes understand that hypoglycemia can be delayed after drinking alcohol and that blood glucose levels should be monitored carefully to prevent severe low blood glucose levels.” For these reasons, it’s recommended that any alcohol intake is discussed with your doctor pharmacist.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; With so many diabetes medications available today, it’s difficult to provide one-size-fits-all recommendations when it comes to your diet and food choices. “Your pharmacist is a great resource for understanding how best to take your diabetes medications in relation to meals and if any specific types of foods should be avoided with your prescribed medications,” says Neumiller. These tips can get you started with making changes that work best for you.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Consider Meal Timing:&lt;/strong&gt; Be sure to time meals and snacks appropriately depending on what’s recommended for your medication as different medications can have different effects. “Some medications need to be taken with the first bite of a meal, while others are taken 30 minutes before, and some are taken with your evening meal,” says Rosario. “Missing the right timing can affect how well the medication works.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Stay Hydrated:&lt;/strong&gt; “Hydration is essential, especially for those on SGLT2 inhibitors like Jardiance or Farxiga, which can increase fluid loss and raise the risk of dehydration or electrolyte imbalance,” says Riker. Drink primarily water and other unsweetened beverages to promote optimal hydration.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Consider Portion Sizes:&lt;/strong&gt; Some medications may require paying special attention to portion sizes than others. “For those on GLP-1 receptor agonists such as Ozempic, Trulicity, or Victoza, large or high-sugar meals may worsen nausea or lead to dumping syndrome,” says Riker.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Monitor Your Numbers:&lt;/strong&gt; “A tool that can be used to monitor how foods affect your blood sugar is a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/heres-why-you-shouldnt-measure-your-blood-sugar-with-your-smartwatch-according-to-the-fda-8601517" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;continuous glucose monitor&lt;/a&gt;,” says Rosario. “They are available with a prescription and over the counter and provide a great insight on how food and your diabetes medications affect your blood sugar levels.” When you monitor your blood sugar, you can identify trends based on the foods you eat and the timing of your medications. “Pay attention to how you feel after eating certain foods. If you notice a pattern of feeling unwell or having unusual blood sugar readings after a particular meal, it's a good idea to talk to your doctor or a registered dietitian,” says Rosario.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Consider All Medications and Supplements:&lt;/strong&gt; “Other medications and supplements can affect blood sugar or interact with diabetes drugs, so it’s important to consider your full medication list when planning meals,” says Zajac. Pharmacists are an important resource to patients when identifying potential food-drug interactions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Managing diabetes requires paying close attention to when and what you eat as well as the timing of your medication. You should adjust your diet to allow room for the foods you enjoy while also limiting those that may cause significant interactions with your diabetes medications like those &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/sneaky-signs-eating-too-much-sugar-11721349" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;high in added sugars&lt;/a&gt;, saturated fat, highly processed carbohydrates, and caffeine.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_49-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_50-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Monitoring your blood sugar is the best way to ensure your current plan is working for you. But seeking the care of a registered dietitian or other healthcare provider can be helpful to provide guidance and support, especially if you’re newly diagnosed. “Bottom line, it is important to work with your healthcare professional to be educated on possible side effects of your medication so you can better manage your blood sugar levels and prevent side effects,” says Riker.&lt;br&gt;

However, people often transport and store water bottles &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/29/well/eat/plastic-water-bottle-health-microplastics.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:in their cars;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;in their cars&lt;/a&gt;, where ambient temperatures can soar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"The crucial temperature that that starts to happen in is around 140 to 170°F, which is very normal to get to inside of a hot car in the summertime. It's at that point that it starts to become more likely that you're going to pull particles or chemicals into your water," Tuten said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;Why is that concerning?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Microplastics are particles of plastic smaller than 5 millimeters in size — and while their effects have yet to be fully quantified, a growing body of evidence links them to a number of adverse health impacts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Their small size allows microplastics to penetrate virtually every part of the human body, as well as soil, the ocean, rivers, and remote areas like Antarctica.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Ongoing research identified potential reproductive impacts, vascular damage, and cancer linked to exposure to microplastics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Dr. Wei-Chin Ho, an assistant professor of biology at UT Tyler, cautioned East Texans about a higher risk of microbial contamination in extreme heat. While his warning concerned bacteria, it aligned well with what Tuten discussed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"Just because you can not see [it] does not mean it is not there," Ho said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;What can be done about it?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://guide.thecooldown.com/actions/explore-critical-climate-issues/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Staying aware;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Staying aware&lt;/a&gt; of environmental risks like microplastics is important as scientific understanding of the issue evolves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;It's difficult to &lt;a href="http://guide.thecooldown.com/actions/choose-plastic-free-options-for-everyday-products" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:avoid plastic entirely;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;avoid plastic entirely&lt;/a&gt;, but &lt;a href="http://guide.thecooldown.com/journeys/use-less-plastic/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:using less plastic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;using less plastic&lt;/a&gt; — particularly for personal water bottles and tumblers — is a great way to reduce direct exposure to microplastics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Join our &lt;a href="https://www.thecooldown.com/tech-newsletter/?rec46XrRMPgZfQY79" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:free newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;free newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for weekly updates on the latest innovations &lt;strong&gt;improving our lives&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;shaping our future&lt;/strong&gt;, and don't miss &lt;a href="https://rb.gy/ivhzmj" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:this cool list;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;this cool list&lt;/a&gt; of easy ways to help yourself while helping the planet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>yahoo.com</author><pubDate>Sun, 24 Aug 2025 23:55:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilAFBVV95cUxOTEg0VEoxekc5N2piVmZoRzdvYUFNcl9td3BreDI3RjcySHNoUFhRM3hyUGp5OUQ0dDhXbE5TUXNhUWk4YzRzOC1UR2ZzREFZemNWdGxid2ZONUtaOHZtM3pLLXVYeUxCX2RybFZCM25uRVBadWZsVUJ4RE5xVEM4cHVuRHg4OVZNZWdxMkFKalhkWENR</guid></item><item><title>研究发现， “毒药之王”正在世界各地的稻田中积聚- Earth.com</title><link>https://www.earth.com/news/king-of-poisons-arsenic-is-building-up-in-warming-rice-fields-around-the-world/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page_content__AwOj6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rice feeds billions. It thrives in warm, wet fields and stores energy in a way that fits busy lives and tight budgets. Those same flooded fields can also make arsenic more available to rice plants, and some of that arsenic can end up in the grain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A growing body of field evidence points to a new twist: &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/astonishing-global-heat-in-january-2025-defied-climate-expectations/"&gt;as the planet warms&lt;/a&gt; and CO₂ rises, flooded soils lose oxygen more often and for longer stretches. That chemical shift frees arsenic from soil particles, and rice roots take up more of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-climate-rice-and-arsenic"&gt;Climate, rice, and arsenic&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After years of outdoor trials, researchers report that &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/world-water-day-2025-preserving-glaciers-protecting-our-future/"&gt;climate conditions&lt;/a&gt; expected by mid-century would increase the flow of inorganic arsenic – the harmful form – from soil to plant to grain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work appears in a leading medical journal and was conducted by teams at Columbia University’s &lt;a href="https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Mailman School of Public Health&lt;/a&gt;, with collaborators in China and the United States. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our results suggest that this increase in arsenic levels could significantly elevate the incidence of heart disease, diabetes, and other non-cancer health effects,” explained &lt;a href="https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/profile/lewis-ziska" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Dr. Lewis Ziska&lt;/a&gt;, associate professor of Environmental Health Sciences at the Columbia Mailman School.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-arsenic-is-in-rice"&gt;Why arsenic is in rice&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arsenic occurs naturally in many soils and waters. In paddies that stay flooded, oxygen dwindles. Iron minerals that normally bind arsenic dissolve, and arsenic becomes more mobile. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Warmer conditions paired with higher CO₂ push that chemistry along, especially in fields that remain waterlogged. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under future settings – temperatures &lt;a href="https://climate.mit.edu/ask-mit/why-did-ipcc-choose-2deg-c-goal-limiting-global-warming" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;more than 2°C&lt;/a&gt; (about 3.6°F) above pre-industrial levels plus elevated CO₂ – the balance tilts toward more inorganic arsenic entering the plant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That does not make every bowl risky. Local geology, irrigation sources, soil type, and farming practices all shape grain levels. It does mean that the odds can shift in places where paddies stay saturated for long periods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-studying-rice-and-arsenic"&gt;Studying rice and arsenic&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientists did not rely on short greenhouse trials. They grew 28 rice varieties outdoors for roughly a decade using a Free-Air CO₂ Enrichment (&lt;a href="https://ess.science.energy.gov/face/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;FACE&lt;/a&gt;) system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This process releases extra CO₂ around crops in the open air so that sunlight, wind, microbes, and soil behave as they do in real life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those long-running field data then fed into models linking plant arsenic levels to typical rice intake and body size across major &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/feeding-the-world-without-harming-nature-the-complex-balance-of-farming/"&gt;rice-eating countries&lt;/a&gt; in Asia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The projections indicate a sizable shift in risk. Lifetime cancer risks, particularly for lung and bladder cancer, increased by 44% relative to ambient conditions. China alone may face 19.3 million excess cancer cases related to arsenic exposure through rice. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“From a health perspective, the toxicological effects of chronic iAs exposure are well established; and include cancers of the lung, bladder, and skin, as well as ischemic &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/heart-disease-kills-differently-now-than-five-decades-ago/"&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt;,” said Dr. Ziska.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Non-cancer outcomes also matter. The modeling points to increased risks for cardiovascular and metabolic diseases tied to long-term inorganic arsenic exposure in populations with high rice intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-where-risks-are-the-highest"&gt;Where risks are the highest&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diet and water sources shape exposure. Regions where rice is a daily staple and paddies are often kept flooded will see the largest impacts under warmer, CO₂-richer conditions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Ingesting rice in regions like southern China and Southeast and South Asia is already a significant source of dietary arsenic and cancer risk,” said Dr. Ziska.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within countries, irrigation that draws from arsenic-rich groundwater can raise grain levels. Varieties also differ in how strongly they transport arsenic from roots to grain, which creates room for practical solutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-this-is-bad-what-can-be-done"&gt;This is bad, what can be done?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/genetic-fixes-may-save-crops-from-climate-stress/"&gt;Plant breeding&lt;/a&gt; can help: select and develop varieties that limit arsenic uptake even when soils push it toward the roots. Breeders already see large differences among rice lines in how much arsenic reaches the grain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/trillions-of-cubic-meters-of-water-is-used-to-grow-crops-each-year/"&gt;Water management&lt;/a&gt; is another lever. Continuous flooding increases arsenic mobility, while giving soils time to drain lets oxygen return, which can hold arsenic in less available forms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Post-harvest steps matter too. Milling and cooking methods can reduce how much arsenic ends up on the plate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No single fix works everywhere. Shifting water regimes, for example, can raise cadmium in some settings, so local testing and tailored management are essential to avoid trading one problem for another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-limits-and-moving-parts"&gt;Limits and moving parts&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any mid-century projection carries uncertainty. Policies can bend emissions paths, and farmers adapt as technology and economics shift. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diets change with income, urbanization, and migration. The underlying processes are well established. The decade of fieldwork done for this study adds weight because it includes real weather, pests, and &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/engineered-plant-microbiomes-the-future-of-crop-protection/"&gt;microbial communities&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-rice-arsenic-and-human-health"&gt;Rice, arsenic, and human health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rice remains a staple food, and the findings from this research don’t claim that every bowl on every table becomes unsafe. Instead, the scientists point to smarter ways of managing risk and a need to act upstream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Farmers can adjust irrigation where feasible. Breeders can favor varieties that move less arsenic to the grain. Public health agencies can track arsenic in grains and irrigation sources to guide choices in hotspots. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our study underscores the urgent need for action to reduce arsenic exposure in rice, especially as climate change continues to affect &lt;a href="https://www.nifa.usda.gov/topics/global-food-security" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;global food security&lt;/a&gt;,” said Dr. Ziska.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keeping rice safe in a warming world is within reach: breed smarter, water smarter, process smarter—and cut emissions, because the air over our fields follows us to the table.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full study was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanplh/article/PIIS2542-5196(25)00055-5/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;The Lancet Planetary Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Sun, 24 Aug 2025 23:54:08 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqgFBVV95cUxQZ3pJbENnR3VuVHZNY2JyWC1EaXZlanJsSVBxbENqWmhNWkJDWDBfUWVjYVdfQ0xqcWpWV0c2NTF5YlRiY3U5eTV0QzJKbEJRVkhUVE0wTElpSmpoYjU2ejNpaWNzcTQ2M2MyaXJ6R1ZSY3U0UVdKSGduZm10RktJckRTd0ZRQ1gyZlMyWE1YUkVFVURiTnNMN0VDM2d4a0V4ak5tSHVHRGlwQQ</guid></item><item><title>卫生官员警告疫情威胁，危险病毒病例增加一倍以上： “我们看到令人担忧的增长” - yahoo.com</title><link>https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/health-officials-warn-epidemic-threat-235000423.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="" data-article-body="true"&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Dozens of cases of a potentially debilitating vector-borne disease have been identified in the United Kingdom this year, the &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c7419g1l488o" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:BBC;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt; reports, almost twice as many as last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;What's happening?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;On the surface, this uptick in cases of chikungunya virus might not appear to be concerning in scale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In all, &lt;a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/chikungunya-virus-uk-symptoms-travel-advice-b2809382.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:73 people;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;73 people&lt;/a&gt; in the U.K. contracted chikungunya, up from 27 in the same span of time in 2024 — a 170% increase in cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Chikungunya is a &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/chikungunya" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:vector-borne illness;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;vector-borne illness&lt;/a&gt;, infecting humans through mosquito bites.

for” but emphasizes goals like these differ from person to person.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The platform stipulates that 11–15 push-ups per day in a single set are suitable for women in their 20s. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;For those in their 30s, 9–13 pushups is a realistic goal, while &lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/single-woman-swears-off-dating-after-first-date-with-older-egomaniac/" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener "&gt;females&lt;/a&gt; between 39 and 49 should aim for 6–10 repetitions. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tiktok-embed" cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@samanthabanwer/video/7488514417689169183"

nofollow"&gt;@samanthabanwer&lt;/a&gt; while health recommendations can be incredibly valuable, it’s important to remember that there is no universal standard for “every.” Every body is unique — health and happiness should not be reduced to a single number. The ability to do 11 push-ups doesn’t necessarily correlate with being healthy, happy, and/or confident. True personal growth should be measured by how you feel in your own body each day, rather than by arbitrary metrics such as the number of push-ups you can do. &lt;a title="fitness"

enough.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Harvard Health confirms that the number of pushups a person can do is proportionate to one’s level of fitness&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Brown goes on to say that while not vitally important, exceeding these age-grouped goals is a sign that the individual is fitter than average.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tiktok-embed" cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@katieyharrold/video/7488080584363904302"

statement.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“How many you can do at one time offers a real-time measurement of your strength and muscular endurance and is an easy tool to help you improve,” the Harvard Health website &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/rise-push-ups-classic-exercise-can-motivate-get-stronger-2019021810165" target="_blank" class=" staff-link"

important than making a specific number an ultimate goal&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="attachment-link-container shareable-image-block" id="woman-elbow-stock-1-68ab441f2e97e-png__700"

becomes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Push-ups don’t just tone your arms – they strengthen bones, improve cardiovascular health, and help fight off the effects of aging, especially for post-menopausal women.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Another reason for exercising daily is the fact that muscles deteriorate 3-8% every decade after the age of 30.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="attachment-link-container shareable-image-block" id="doctor-shares-11-push-up-challenge-and-other-ways-to-get-healthier-68ab465550346-png__700"

&lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/japanese-walking-trend-may-be-better-than-10000-steps-a-day/" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener "&gt;fitness&lt;/a&gt; and “build[ing] strength

			&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A daily cup of coffee could be blunting the effects of certain antibiotic treatments, according to a new study analyzing the reaction of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia_coli"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; bacteria to caffeine.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The international team of researchers behind the study looked at 94 different chemical substances and how they changed &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;E. coli:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt; specifically, how they altered the systems that control what gets into and out of the bacterial cells.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Around a third of the substances tested were shown to interfere with gene activity related to managing traffic in and out of the cell. But caffeine was the one that stood out. It led to the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;E. coli&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt; absorbing a lower level of some antibiotics, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciprofloxacin"&gt;&lt;span&gt;including ciprofloxacin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Our data show that several substances can subtly but systematically influence gene regulation in bacteria," &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/university/news-and-publications/press-releases/press-releases/article/study-finds-caffeine-can-weaken-effectiveness-of-certain-antibiotics/"&gt;&lt;span&gt;says&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; microbiologist Christoph Binsfeld, from the University of Würzburg in Germany.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/coffee-can-mess-with-your-medication-a-pharmacist-explains-why"&gt;Coffee Can Mess With Your Medication. A Pharmacist Explains Why.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This is part of ongoing research into what's known as low-level antibiotic resistance. Not &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/ancient-killer-is-rapidly-becoming-resistant-to-antibiotics-warns-study"&gt;&lt;span&gt;the fully fledged kind&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, where bacteria adapt to resist targeted treatments directly, but subtler effects that are triggered by changes in how genes operate and the way that these bugs respond to their environment.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We already know that bacteria such as &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;E. coli&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41579-018-0048-6"&gt;&lt;span&gt;use these adaptive responses&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; to maximize their chances of survival in whatever environment they find themselves in. What's not known are the precise biological mechanisms being used, which can tell scientists more about how bacteria pathogens stay alive and how we might beat them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_171596" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-171596" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/CaffeineBacteria.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-171596 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/CaffeineBacteria.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/CaffeineBacteria-600x355.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-171596" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Researchers spotted differences in the bacteria's response to antibiotics after contact with  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/how-does-caffeine-wake-you-up" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73115" data-postid="171594" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;caffeine&lt;/a&gt;. (Binsfeld et al., &lt;em&gt;PLOS Biology&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The analysis showed that a particular protein called Rob played a bigger role than previously thought in controlling what gets in and out of the bacteria cells. It was involved in about a third of all the changes spotted by the researchers, including those triggered by the introduction of caffeine.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Caffeine triggers a cascade of events starting with the gene regulator Rob and culminating in the change of several transport proteins in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;E. coli&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt; – which in turn leads to a reduced uptake of antibiotics such as ciprofloxacin," &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/university/news-and-publications/press-releases/press-releases/article/study-finds-caffeine-can-weaken-effectiveness-of-certain-antibiotics/"&gt;&lt;span&gt;says&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; biological engineer Ana Rita Brochado, from the University of Tübingen in Germany.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It's important to note that this research is based on tests carried out in the lab: it's not fully clear how this might work in actual human beings, or how much coffee you'd &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/key-health-perks-of-coffee-depend-on-when-you-drink-it-suggests-study"&gt;&lt;span&gt;actually have to drink&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; to make a noticeable difference to antibiotic response, but this is something future research can look into.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Another discovery by the researchers was that the antibiotic weakening effect was not seen in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salmonella_enterica"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Salmonella enterica&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, another harmful bacteria closely related to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;E. coli&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt;. This is a response that seems to only apply to certain kinds of bacteria.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;There are several ways that the research can be taken forward, to get a more precise idea of what we're dealing with here, but a better understanding of this low-level antibiotic resistance is essential to making therapeutic approaches &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/psychedelic-drugs-have-huge-therapeutic-potential-an-expert-explains-why"&gt;&lt;span&gt;as effective as possible&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Based on these findings, we foresee a challenging, but unavoidable and important task in mapping key determinants of transport functions across different bacteria," &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3003260"&gt;&lt;span&gt;write&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; the researchers in their published paper.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The research has been published in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3003260"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;PLOS Biology&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It makes sense to approach some marketing efforts with skepticism. Scams, artificial intelligence and deceptive social media posts are common, with people you don’t know seeking to profit from your behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But should people extend this same skepticism to pediatricians who advise vaccines for children? Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said financial bonuses are driving such recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/how-vaccine-hesitancy-may-be-driving-a-spike-in-pediatric-flu-deaths"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WATCH:&lt;/strong&gt; How vaccine hesitancy may be driving a spike in pediatric flu deaths&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Doctors are being paid to vaccinate, not to evaluate,” Kennedy said in an Aug. 8 &lt;a href="https://mvau.lt/media/ab888656-9b01-48fc-8341-fc4588a3bbe6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;u&gt;video&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; posted on X. “They’re pressured to follow the money, not the science.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doctors and public health officials have been &lt;a href="https://vaccinateyourfamily.org/are-doctors-vaccine-recommendations-motivated-by-profits/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;u&gt;fielding questions&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://theunbiasedscipod.substack.com/p/no-doctors-dont-push-vaccines-for" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;u&gt;on this&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.uvpediatrics.com/topics/who-profits-from-my-vaccine-choices/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;u&gt;topic&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://shotofprevention.com/2014/10/22/are-doctors-vaccine-recommendations-motivated-by-profits/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;u&gt;for years&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A close look at the process by which vaccines are administered shows pediatric practices make little profit — and sometimes lose money — on vaccines. Four experienced pediatricians told us evidence-based science and medicine drives pediatricians’ childhood vaccination recommendations. Years of research and vaccine safety data also bolster these recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Christoph Diasio, a pediatrician at Sandhills Pediatrics in North Carolina, said the argument that doctors profit off of vaccines is counterintuitive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If it was really about all the money, it would be better for kids to be sick so you’d see more sick children and get to take care of more sick children, right?” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is your pediatrician making profits off childhood vaccines? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It costs money to stock, store and administer a vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pediatricians sometimes store thousands of dollars worth of vaccines in specialized medical-grade refrigeration units, which can be expensive. They pay to insure vaccines in case anything happens to them. Some practices buy thermostats that monitor vaccines’ temperature and backup generators to run the refrigerators in the event of a power outage. They also pay nursing staff to administer vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Vaccines are hugely expensive,” said Dr. Jesse Hackell, a retired general pediatrician and chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics’ committee on pediatric workforce. “We lay out a lot of money up front.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/why-the-american-academy-of-pediatrics-is-diverging-from-cdc-vaccine-guidelines"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WATCH:&lt;/strong&gt; Why the American Academy of Pediatrics is diverging from CDC vaccine guidelines&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a child with private insurance gets a vaccine, the pediatrician is paid for the vaccine product and for its administration, Hackell said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many pediatricians also participate in a federal &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines-for-children/about/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;u&gt;program&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that provides vaccines for free to eligible children whose parents can’t afford them. Participating in that program &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10206937/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;u&gt;isn’t profitable&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; because even though they get the vaccines for free, pediatricians store and insure them, and Medicaid reimbursements often don’t cover the costs. But many choose to participate and provide those vaccines anyway because it’s valuable for patients, Hackell said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When discussing vaccine recommendations, pediatricians don’t make different recommendations based on how or if a child is insured, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Jason Terk, a pediatrician at Cook Children’s Health Care System in Texas, said a practice’s ability to make a profit on vaccines depends on its specific situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Terk’s practice is part of a larger pediatric health care system, which means it doesn’t lose money on vaccines and makes a small profit, he said. Some small independent practices might not be able to secure terms with insurance companies that adequately pay for vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Suzanne Berman, a pediatrician at Plateau Pediatrics, a rural health clinic in Crossville, Tennessee, said that 75% of her practice’s patients have Medicaid and qualify for the Vaccines for Children program, which the practice loses money on. When she factored in private insurance companies’ payments, she estimated her practice roughly breaks even on vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The goal is to not lose money on vaccines,” Terk said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So what’s driving your pediatrician’s vaccine recommendations?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pediatricians typically recommend parents vaccinate their children following either the American Academy of Pediatrics’ or the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s recommended vaccine schedules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diasio said the driving force behind pediatric vaccine recommendations is straightforward: Trained physicians have seen kids die of vaccine-preventable diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I saw kids who died of invasive pneumococcal disease, which is what the Prevnar vaccine protects against,” Diasio said. “We remember those kids; we wouldn’t wish that on anyone.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, your pediatrician will consider your child’s health holistically before making vaccine recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, a few children —  less than 1% of all children — have medical reasons they cannot receive a particular vaccine, Hackell said. This could include children with severe allergies to certain vaccine components or children who are immunosuppressed and could be at higher risk from live virus vaccines such as the measles or chickenpox vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When people have questions about whether their kids should get vaccines, they really need to talk to their child’s doctor,” Diasio said. “Don’t get lost down a rabbit hole of the internet or on social media, which is programmed and refined to do whatever it can to keep you online longer.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Vaccines are hugely expensive,” said Dr. Jesse Hackell, a retired general pediatrician and chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics’ committee on pediatric workforce. “We lay out a lot of money up front.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/why-the-american-academy-of-pediatrics-is-diverging-from-cdc-vaccine-guidelines"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WATCH:&lt;/strong&gt; Why the American Academy of Pediatrics is diverging from CDC vaccine guidelines&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a child with private insurance gets a vaccine, the pediatrician is paid for the vaccine product and for its administration, Hackell said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many pediatricians also participate in a federal &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines-for-children/about/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;u&gt;program&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that provides vaccines for free to eligible children whose parents can’t afford them. Participating in that program &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10206937/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;u&gt;isn’t profitable&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; because even though they get the vaccines for free, pediatricians store and insure them, and Medicaid reimbursements often don’t cover the costs. But many choose to participate and provide those vaccines anyway because it’s valuable for patients, Hackell said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When discussing vaccine recommendations, pediatricians don’t make different recommendations based on how or if a child is insured, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Jason Terk, a pediatrician at Cook Children’s Health Care System in Texas, said a practice’s ability to make a profit on vaccines depends on its specific situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Terk’s practice is part of a larger pediatric health care system, which means it doesn’t lose money on vaccines and makes a small profit, he said. Some small independent practices might not be able to secure terms with insurance companies that adequately pay for vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Suzanne Berman, a pediatrician at Plateau Pediatrics, a rural health clinic in Crossville, Tennessee, said that 75% of her practice’s patients have Medicaid and qualify for the Vaccines for Children program, which the practice loses money on. When she factored in private insurance companies’ payments, she estimated her practice roughly breaks even on vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The goal is to not lose money on vaccines,” Terk said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So what’s driving your pediatrician’s vaccine recommendations?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pediatricians typically recommend parents vaccinate their children following either the American Academy of Pediatrics’ or the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s recommended vaccine schedules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diasio said the driving force behind pediatric vaccine recommendations is straightforward: Trained physicians have seen kids die of vaccine-preventable diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I saw kids who died of invasive pneumococcal disease, which is what the Prevnar vaccine protects against,” Diasio said. “We remember those kids; we wouldn’t wish that on anyone.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, your pediatrician will consider your child’s health holistically before making vaccine recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, a few children —  less than 1% of all children — have medical reasons they cannot receive a particular vaccine, Hackell said. This could include children with severe allergies to certain vaccine components or children who are immunosuppressed and could be at higher risk from live virus vaccines such as the measles or chickenpox vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When people have questions about whether their kids should get vaccines, they really need to talk to their child’s doctor,” Diasio said. “Don’t get lost down a rabbit hole of the internet or on social media, which is programmed and refined to do whatever it can to keep you online longer.”&lt;/p&gt;

Kennedy — better known as Bobby, and the father of our current health secretary, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. — delivered a &lt;a href="https://rfkhumanrights.org/speech/address-at-vanderbilt-university/" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;rousing address&lt;/a&gt; at Vanderbilt University that came to be known as one of his greatest speeches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quoting his presidential uncle John, who had himself &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/07/05/cia-agent-oswald-kennedy-assassination" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;been assassinated&lt;/a&gt; less than five years prior, Kennedy told those Vanderbilt students that they were the people who had "&lt;a href="https://www.jfklibrary.org/archives/other-resources/john-f-kennedy-speeches/university-of-southern-california-19601101" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;the least ties to the present and the greatest ties to the future&lt;/a&gt;" — a future that seemed, thanks to the Vietnam War and civil unrest stateside, dangerously close to not happening at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bobby Kennedy's hopeful promise to the United States' young voters couldn't seem further away in 2025, as his son's anti-scientific turn at the Department of Health and Human Services has led to all manner of hasty research cancellations that put their futures at risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps most damningly, the younger Kennedy has elected to "&lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/hhs-winds-down-mrna-development-under-barda.html" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;wind down&lt;/a&gt;" the development of mRNA vaccines and cancel $500 million in research contracts because of his &lt;a href="https://futurism.com/neoscope/measles-patients-vitamin-overuse-rfk-jr" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;vaccine skepticism&lt;/a&gt;, particularly as it relates to COVID-19 vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Along with its incredible efficacy at staving off further death from the coronavirus pandemic, researchers working with mRNA believe they may be &lt;a href="https://futurism.com/neoscope/cancer-vaccines-mrna-future" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;close to achieving&lt;/a&gt; a monumental milestone: creating a &lt;a href="https://scitechdaily.com/new-mrna-cancer-vaccine-delivers-stunning-results-sparks-universal-treatment-hopes/" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;universal cancer vaccine&lt;/a&gt; using the promising biotechnology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starting in 2016, virologist Rick Bright headed the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) — the agency that pioneered mRNA research in the US — until he was illegally ousted by president Donald Trump in May 2020 for a &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/22/us/politics/rick-bright-trump-hydroxychloroquine-coronavirus.html" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;whistleblower complaint&lt;/a&gt; about his first administration's promotion of hydroxychloroquine as a COVID treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an alarming &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/18/opinion/mrna-vaccines.html" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;piece for the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; this past week, Bright likened American supremacy on mRNA research to a military advantage — one that RFK Jr. is throwing away with his ill-advised anti-vax policies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As with the COVID vaccines, which were primed for success by years of prior research from BARDA, the US has been leading the charge on mRNA cancer vaccines. With the health secretary's errant and dangerous "skepticism," Bright wrote, that lead is at great risk of slipping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If the United States abandons mRNA, it will not simply be forfeiting a public health advantage. It will be ceding a strategic asset," Bright wrote. "In national security terms, mRNA is the equivalent of a missile defense system for biology. The ability to rapidly design, produce and deploy medical countermeasures is as vital to our defense as any military capability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Adversaries that invest in this technology," he continued, "will be able to respond faster to outbreaks, protecting their populations sooner than we can."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The former BARDA head is not alone neither in his concerns nor his view of American mRNA research as a military asset. In an &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/future-pulse/2025/08/22/losing-the-mrna-arms-race-00518439" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;interview with &lt;em&gt;Politico&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Johnathan Kagan, the cofounder of a biotech startup called Corner Therapeutics that works with novel mRNA applications, suggested that America could be poised to lose the vaccine war.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I get the impression that many people in Washington don’t realize we’re in the middle of a new arms race," Kagan told the magazine. We’re not in the middle of a nuclear arms race anymore. We’re in the middle of a biomedical arms race."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kagan named China as our greatest "arms race competitor," and cited a recent visit to the country where COVID was first detected as proof.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"China is in an incredible position to take advantage of this," he said. "I was in China for a conference in May, and the enthusiasm for science, the enthusiasm for innovation and for mRNA-based investment could not be higher."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While our impressive mRNA arsenal is still intact for now, Bright, the BARDA virologist, said it's only a matter of time before we lose that "decisive advantage."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In an era when biological threats can be engineered," he wrote for the &lt;em&gt;NYT&lt;/em&gt;, "losing this competitive edge would leave the United States vulnerable and dependent on others for lifesaving tools."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More on RFK Jr.: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://futurism.com/neoscope/health-secretary-rfk-jr-medical-advice" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Trump's Crackpot Secretary of Health Admits That Literally Nobody Should Be Taking Medical Advice from Him&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Futurism</author><pubDate>Sun, 24 Aug 2025 18:15:26 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMickFVX3lxTE1xbEl1LXE2MENOWC16anUxREJva3VhMjZtM2dMY21HTmRabXctNWdPQllDQ2JfYkZWX0s0UG9Jd1FySzFLcnpST2UxRXVyWFVObDhSRUUyeVpBQWl4TkVjSS03Q2xvbEtDMk9ETVZFWVRmQQ</guid></item><item><title>“Ozempic Vulva”正在导致一些女性进行阴唇膨胀和手术-福布斯</title><link>https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucelee/2025/08/24/ozempic-vulva-is-leading-some-women-to-get-labia-puffing-and-surgery/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="fs-article fs-responsive-text current-article article-body"&gt;&lt;figure class="embed-base image-embed embed-0" role="presentation"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="bMqrj"&gt;&lt;p class="Jp--BF7-"&gt;&lt;span class="Ccg9Ib-7 _8XF2kHYM"&gt;“Ozempic vulva" is an unoffcial term that women have been using to describe what they’ve been noticing in their genital areas after starting Ozempic or some other glucagon-like peptide-1 agonist.

Women have been using this term to describe what they’ve been noticing in their genital areas after starting Ozempic or some other glucagon-like peptide-1 agonist. And that’s stirred up more discussions about getting labia puffing or labiaplasty to deal with these effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article_paragraph_2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="article_paragraph_2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="subhead-embed"&gt;What Is ‘Ozempic Vulva’?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Vulva” is the official way to refer to a female’s between-the-legs external genital parts. This is the proper anatomical terminology as opposed to the word “vagina,” which is often mistakenly used to describe what’s really the vulva. Most of your vagina—if you have one—is usually not visible from the outside as your vagina is the elastic, muscular canal that connects the uterus to the outside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By contrast, your vulva consists of the openings to your vagina and urethra, the surrounding glands, your clitoris and the inner and outer lips of your vagina—also known as your labia. Your vulva also encompasses your mons pubis, the rounded area located in front of your pubic bones where hair typically grows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="vestpocket nsO6K"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, GLP-1 agonists have become the athleisurewear of medications—super-popular and mentioned seemingly everywhere. While GLP-1 agonists began as diabetes medications, the tides of their use really changed with the finding that these medications can cause significant weight loss. Speaking of tides, the active ingredient in the GLP-1 agonists end in “tide”—whether its semaglutide for Ozempic and Wegovy, liraglutide for Victoza and Saxenda, exenatide for Byetta and Bydureon, dulaglutide for Trulicity or tirzepatide for Mounjaro and Zepbound. &lt;a class="color-link" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2796491" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2796491" aria-label="A study published in JAMA Network Open"&gt;A study published in &lt;em data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2796491"&gt;JAMA Network Open&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; found that weekly semaglutide injections were associated with on average a 15-pound weight loss after three months and a 27-pound weight loss after six months. If you do the math, that’s an average loss of roughly five-pounds a month. That’s got a lot of people, including, surprise, surprise, celebrities, talking about GLP-1 agonists as if they were some kind of magical drug for weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ah, but in addition to the magical talk, there have also been people mentioning unexpected findings after beginning GLP-1 agonists, which brings us to the combination of the words “Ozempic" and “vulva.” This term is being used to describe the sagging skin, weaker muscles and dryness in the vulvar region that some GLP-1 agonist users have been noticing. Some have also commented on experiencing increased vaginal discharge after starting GLP-1 agonists. ”Ozempic vulva" is not an official medical term. Your doctor won’t be saying something like, “Looks like you have Ozempic vulva”—at least he or she shouldn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="fbs-ad--nativeinbody-d-wrapper fbs-ad--progressive"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="subhead-embed"&gt;‘Ozempic Vulva’ Is Likely A Result Of Rapid Weight Loss&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though the “O” word is being used, what’s being called “Ozempic vulva” is probably not directly caused by the medication itself. Instead, the sagging skin is a potential consequence of the rapid weight and fat loss that can occur with GLP-1 agonist use. While fat may seem like the enemy, the Thanos, when it comes to weight loss, fatty tissue actually serves various purposes including serving as energy stories and giving your different body parts their volume and shape. That includes giving your vulva, especially your mons pubis and labia majora, the volume and shape that people know and love. And when you use a GLP-1 agonist, you aren’t offered a menu where you can select the locations that you want to lose versus spare fat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the fat pads beneath your vulva rapidly shrink, they can be like Ant Man in the movie &lt;em&gt;The Ant Man and Wasp&lt;/em&gt;, when he shrunk and then his hoodie became several sizes too large. That’s because the hoodie didn’t shrink with him at the same time. Similarly, with rapid weight and fat pad loss, your skin may not be elastic enough to reduce in size and area as well, leading to sagging skin and soft tissue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="article_paragraph_7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pelvic muscle weakness may be due indirectly to the way GLP-1 agonists work. GLP-1 agonists help with weight loss in large part by suppressing your appetite and the “food chatter” that happens in your head, often to the point that people forget and need to force themselves to eat, if you can imagine that. If you aren’t eating enough, you could also not be getting the necessary nutrients. This could lead to loss of lean muscle mass, which, in turn, could result in pelvic muscle weakness.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It’s not clear what may be causing the dryness and increased discharge that’s being reported on social media. Of course, when it comes to posts on social media, you can’t necessarily be sure of whatever’s being said. People may not be accurately conveying what their symptoms may be or what other things they may be doing besides taking GLP-1 medications. This can be unintentional or—here’s a shocker—some people can actually lie on the Internet. Imagine that. Therefore, using social media and other Internet posts for medical observations and advice can be kind of like listening to what’s written on the inside a bathroom stall or what’s said by some random stranger you met on the subway platform but somehow got into a conversation with about your genitals. More scientific studies are needed to confirm what else GLP-1 agonists may be doing to the vulvar region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="subhead-embed"&gt;What Can Be Done About ‘Ozempic Vulva’&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What you do about “Ozempic vulva” depends on how bothersome the symptoms may be. If the only thing that’s bothering you is the appearance of your vulva, you’ve got to ask yourself how much your expectations of the shape down there are being shaped by other people’s unrealistic expectations and unrealistic things like porn. (Yes, that’s another shocker, porn can be unrealistic.) Remember what’s considered attractive is very subjective and greatly shaped by what’s seen in entertainment and various types of media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, “Ozempic vulva” could be a sign that you may be going for weight loss a little too aggressively. A slower more measured approach could allow your body and your other daily behaviors to adapt. It’s important to make sure that you are concurrently maintaining proper nutrition and exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the sagging skin is causing actual functional problems like chafing, then you may want to see your doctor to first explore non-invasive options. Depending on your situation, your doctor may suggest various moisturizers and lubricants. There’s also the possibility that you may have something else going on at the same time. For example, perimenopause can result in dryness, discomfort and other symptoms in that area,&lt;a class="color-link" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucelee/2024/12/15/how-halle-berrys-perimenopause-symptoms-were-misdiagnosed-as-herpes/" data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucelee/2024/12/15/how-halle-berrys-perimenopause-symptoms-were-misdiagnosed-as-herpes/" target="_self" aria-label="as I’ve described previously in Forbes"&gt; as I’ve described previously in &lt;em data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucelee/2024/12/15/how-halle-berrys-perimenopause-symptoms-were-misdiagnosed-as-herpes/"&gt;Forbes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. That’s why seeing a doctor can be better than simply Sherlock Holmsing on social media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are experiencing muscle weakness, all of the above apply as well. Proper nutrition and exercise are important. Your doctor may recommend Kegel exercises and other types of pelvic floor physiotherapy to strengthen your pelvic muscles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="subhead-embed"&gt;‘Ozempic Vulva’ May Be Prompting More Women To Consider Labia Puffing And Labiaplasty&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are finding the sagging skin to be too bothersome to be managed via non-invasive approaches, there are procedures available. One of these procedures is labia puffing, This is where a doctor injects some kind of dermal filler, like hyaluronic acid or fat, into your labia majora, the outer lips of the vulva, to give them more volume. It’s ratehr similar to the penis filler and scrotal filler procedures that finance bros have been getting, &lt;a class="color-link" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucelee/2025/02/23/men-are-getting-filler-injected-into-their-genitals-to-get-larger/" data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucelee/2025/02/23/men-are-getting-filler-injected-into-their-genitals-to-get-larger/" target="_self" aria-label="as I’ve described previously in Forbes"&gt;as I’ve described previously in &lt;em data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucelee/2025/02/23/men-are-getting-filler-injected-into-their-genitals-to-get-larger/"&gt;Forbes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This procedure isn’t as invasive as surgery but it isn’t completely risk-free. After all, you are getting a needle stuck into your genitals. You could get swelling, bruising, pain and other types of irritation at the injection site. Infection and greater damage are risks, especially if the healthcare professional doing the injection is not skilled, not careful, not qualified or not even a healthcare professional. There’s the rare possibility of allergic reactions. The filler could go in unevenly, resulting in labial asymmetry. Or too much filler could be injected, which could lead to labia with an exclamation mark after them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s also the possibility that the filler could move or change over time. This can form lumps and other not so desired appearances. These are all reasons why if you choose to get labia puffing, you shouldn’t go cheap and look for a place that will offer coupons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A labiaplasty would be more invasive and involved. Typically, you’ll have to under some kind of anesthesia, whether its intravenous sedation plus local anesthesia or general anesthesia—which brings its own set of risks. The surgeon can do different things depending on what you want, ranging from cutting off excess tissue to reconstructing and sewing up different parts to inserting filler like fat. While this presents more options than labia puffing, it also increases all of the aforementioned risks. Remember the saying that the only minor surgery is surgery done on someone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Ozempic vulva” is yet another example of how GLP-1 agonists—while potentially very effective at helping you lose weight—are not magical, wonder drugs. It remains to be seen how effective they may be for different people over longer and longer periods of time. There’s a need for more studies to better determine this as well as the different potential effects and side effects. After all, there’s already been, oh, quite a few unofficial terms with the word Ozempic in them to describe the unexpected effects that people are experiencing with GLP-1 agonist use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve got some good news and some bad news.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The bad news is that a new study out of Harvard has established a link between eating potatoes and an increased risk of developing diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But the good news is not all potatoes are equal: There are plenty of spuds you can keep on your plate, but one preparation has a clear downside.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;A new study out of Harvard has established a link between eating potatoes and an increased risk of developing diabetes —but the good news is not all potatoes are equal. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Proxima Studio – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We’re shifting the conversation from, ‘Are potatoes good or bad?’ to a more nuanced — and useful — question: How are they prepared, and what might we eat instead?” &lt;a href="https://hsph.harvard.edu/news/potatoes-may-increase-risk-of-type-2-diabetes-depending-on-their-preparation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;said lead author&lt;/a&gt; Seyed Mohammad Mousavi, postdoctoral research fellow in the Department of Nutrition.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers followed over 205,000 people for more than 30 years, taking a close look a their diets.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They found that eating three servings of French fries a week spiked diabetes chances by 20% — but other types of potatoes, including baked and mashed, did not.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;That being said, they also found that replacing any type of potato with whole grain foods can lower your type 2 diabetes risk by 4%.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And swapping fries with whole grains? That will cut your risk by 19%, while even replacing them with refined grains like white bread made a positive difference.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The public health message here is simple and powerful: Small changes in our daily diet can have an important impact on the risk of type 2 diabetes,” said corresponding author Walter Willett, professor of epidemiology and nutrition.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Limiting potatoes — especially limiting French fries — and choosing healthy, whole-grain sources of carbohydrate could help lower the risk of type 2 diabetes across the population.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;They found that eating three servings of French fries a week spiked their diabetes chances by 20%. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;fahrwasser – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;





&lt;p&gt;This is the &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2022/12/26/potatoes-arent-always-bad-for-you-its-all-in-the-preparation/"&gt;second study&lt;/a&gt; in the past year that’s looked at the relationship between potatoes and diabetes. The last one, out of Australia, found that people who ate the most potatoes had a 9% higher diabetes risk compared to those who ate the fewest taters.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And their findings determined boiled potatoes to be the best option.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“When we separated boiled potatoes from mashed potatoes, fries or [chips], boiled potatoes were no longer associated with a higher risk of diabetes. They had a null effect,” said Dr. Nicola Bondonno from Edith Cowan University’s Nutrition and Health Innovation Research Institute, which conducted the research.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s only fries and mashed potatoes [that increase risk], the latter likely because [they’re] usually made with butter, cream and the like.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Picking healthier potato recipes seems to be the key — especially since potatoes actually have plenty of health benefits.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Other types of potatoes, including baked and mashed, did not increase diabetes risk. A previous study found boiled potatoes, in particular, had no effect on diabetes. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Valentina Rychkova – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They have lots of antioxidants like flavonoids, carotenoids and phenolic acids, which can help fight things like cancer and heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;And while starch gets a bad name, potatoes have resistant starch, which feed your gut nutrients and good bacteria. That’s great for digestive health and controlling blood sugar.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In 2022, Polish &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2022/12/07/potatoes-could-hold-a-powerful-new-treatment-for-cancer/"&gt;researchers found that glycoalkaloids&lt;/a&gt; — naturally occurring chemicals found in potatoes, peppers and goji berries — have some cancer-fighting properties.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Potatoes are just fantastic,” Caroline Susie, a registered nutritionist and spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, told &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/healthy-foods-bad-reputations-coffee-eggs-rcna147196" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;NBC News&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“What happens is, unfortunately, we tend to screw them up by not eating the skin or frying or mixing them with everything under the sun, like sour cream and butter and bacon”&lt;/p&gt;
						&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "I don't have a massive breakfast," de Latour explains. "If it was up to me, I would never have breakfast, but it's so necessary to start your day with some protein."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; And of course the gastroenterologist has a cup of coffee in the morning, too. Caffeinated or decaffeinated coffee is a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/bad-things-you-should-be-doing-for-gut-health-8598527" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;gut-friendly option&lt;/a&gt; that can aid in healthy digestion, per recent research&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re looking for a filling breakfast that can further satisfy your appetite, try a high-fiber gut-healthy smoothie, like gastroenterologist Will Bulsiewicz, M.D.’s &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8077126/gastroenterologist-breakfast-4-ingredient-smoothie/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;easy blueberry-banana smoothie&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-plant-forward-lunch"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Plant-Forward Lunch &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For lunch, de Latour goes for a plant-forward option like a salad, which is full of her favorite nutrient to recommend to her patients: fiber.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "Unfortunately, our country has a huge, massive issue: we're wildly &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/small-changes-that-helped-me-eat-more-fiber-11775341" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;under-eating fiber&lt;/a&gt; and it's very dangerous," she explains. This is supported by the 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans, as it’s reported that 90% to 97% of Americans aren’t consuming enough fiber in their diets.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; We think that de Latour would love some of our highly rated high-fiber lunch salads, like our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/8004437/kale-quinoa-apple-salad/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Kale, Quinoa &amp;amp; Apple Salad&lt;/a&gt; or our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/7944538/orange-mint-freekeh-salad-with-lima-beans/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Orange-Mint Freekeh Salad with Lima Beans&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-fulfilling-dinner"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Fulfilling Dinner &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Dinner is normally the most filling meal of the day, which at times makes it difficult to prepare. But the gastroenterologist likes sticking with her go-to nutritious choice.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "For dinner, I'll have cauliflower rice with lentils, because it's a protein and fiber mix, specifically plant protein," de Latour says. "And I add some yogurt and some achar, which is pickled vegetables."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; We love the protein and fiber combination from the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8041388/are-lentils-healthy/" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;lentils&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/cauliflower-rice-recipe-8401635" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;cauliflower rice&lt;/a&gt;, respectively. These nutrients help you stay satisfied after enjoying a bowl. Yogurt and pickled vegetables are both bursting with &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/281916/must-eat-fermented-foods-for-a-healthy-gut/" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;probiotics&lt;/a&gt;, which are amazing for the health of your gut microbiome. The doctor sticks to water for her drink with dinner, ensuring that she is &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/milk-hydration-benefits-11686387" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;refreshed and hydrated&lt;/a&gt; leading into the evening.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "It sounds very healthy, but it's delicious to me," de Latour says. "Whenever you try to create a habit change, but you enjoy it, you're more likely to stick with it. So that's been really good for my health, and I love it."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you love a healthy meal, why not stick with it? We think it's great that the doctor found a fulfilling dinner she loves including in her regular rotation. Try topping off our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/7886568/lentil-curry-with-cauliflower-rice/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Lentil Curry with Cauliflower Rice&lt;/a&gt; with a dollop of yogurt or your favorite fermented veggies, just like de Latour.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Overall, the gastroenterologist focuses on nutrients over meal diversity. Including enough fiber, protein and probiotics in her diet is important for her goals, and de Latour considers a plant-forward eating pattern best to meet her health needs.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "Find healthy foods you enjoy eating," de Latour advises. "If it's something that is good for you that you enjoy, you're more likely to do it."

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dietitians bust the top myths when it comes to managing cholesterol including which foods you should and should not avoid.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Not all fats are to blame for high cholesterol, but saturated fat is one that should be limited.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Weight and age don't determine risk for developing high cholesterol, so routine cholesterol screenings are important for everyone.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; About 25 million adults over the age of 20 in the United States have high cholesterol, so if you’re trying to figure out what you can do to lower yours, you’re not alone.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; While some believe dietary cholesterol is the main cause, others think only genetics are to blame. Misinformation about cholesterol is rampant, and that can make it hard to take action.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Don’t worry, though—we spoke with the dietitians, and we’re breaking down some of the most common myths about high cholesterol with expert-backed insights. You’ll learn what truly affects your cholesterol levels, actionable tips to better manage them and science-based strategies for improving your heart health. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Many people report that they’ve been told to cut out eggs and other foods that contain cholesterol after being diagnosed with high cholesterol. That’s because, at one time, experts believed that &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/do-you-need-to-limit-dietary-cholesterol-11734823" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;dietary cholesterol caused high cholesterol&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; However, the latest research shows that dietary cholesterol has a relatively small effect on blood cholesterol levels, whereas &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/the-1-thing-to-avoid-if-you-have-high-cholesterol-8691621" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;saturated fat&lt;/a&gt; and trans fat are much more influential in raising LDL (aka the “bad” cholesterol) levels.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Instead of avoiding cholesterol-rich foods altogether, I tell my clients to limit saturated fats found in fatty cuts of meat and full-fat dairy products,” says &lt;a href="https://revvhealth.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Marissa Beck, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;. It’s also a good idea to focus on adding heart-healthy fats, like those in nuts, seeds, avocados and fatty fish, she adds.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While dietary modifications are recommended to help improve abnormal cholesterol levels, they may not be enough to make a significant impact on their own. “This is because blood cholesterol may be impacted by several other factors like sleep, stress levels, exercise and genetics,” says &lt;a href="https://www.thedietitiandish.com/about-me" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Patricia Kolesa, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;. “It is important to set small attainable goals outside of diet to improve your sleep, incorporate joyful movement and stress-management techniques,” she adds.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You may have heard that you need to cut out all fats from your diet if you have high cholesterol, but that simply isn’t true. “While some fats can play a role in the development of high cholesterol, not all fats are created equal,” says &lt;a href="http://carlyinthekitchen.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Carly Hart, RDN, LDN&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Research shows that consuming too much &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7595261/whats-the-difference-between-saturated-fat-and-unsaturated-fat/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;saturated fat&lt;/a&gt; and trans fat can increase the risk of developing high cholesterol, but unsaturated fats may actually help to minimize that risk.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “Unsaturated fats have anti-inflammatory properties and can help to increase your HDL cholesterol (the “good” kind) and lower your LDL (the “bad” kind), reducing the risk of heart disease and stroke,” Hart adds. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Instead of eliminating fats from your diet completely, work on increasing your consumption of unsaturated fats—by adding more nuts, seeds, avocado and fatty fish—and decreasing your intake of saturated fat. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Most people with high cholesterol don’t have any symptoms, so it’s hard to know if you have it without testing. Some people with extremely high cholesterol may show physical signs of the condition, typically fatty deposits and xanthelasmas—yellow deposits around the eyelids. However, in more moderate cases, symptoms can be rare. That’s why it’s important to have regular checkups with your primary care doctor to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7877576/what-you-need-to-know-about-your-cholesterol-levels/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;monitor your cholesterol levels&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You might think that only people in larger bodies can get high cholesterol, “but it’s possible to have high cholesterol at any size because it’s related to things like genetics, family history and the foods we eat,” says &lt;a href="https://tweducate.wordpress.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Mandy Willig, Ph.D., RD&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It’s important to have your cholesterol levels checked regularly regardless of body size. This means every five years for healthy adults over the age of 20, or every year if you have diabetes or a family history of heart disease. Monitoring your lab work allows you to catch any problems early on so you can address them and make any necessary changes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “High cholesterol can develop at any age and often starts young, especially in those with a family history of heart disease,” explains &lt;a href="https://alexandria-hardy-rdn.clientsecure.me/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Alexandria Hardy, RDN, LDN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;In fact, about 7% of U.S. children and adolescents ages 6 to 19 have high total cholesterol.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Ideally, you shouldn’t wait until you’re diagnosed with high cholesterol to start being mindful of your eating pattern and lifestyle. Build heart-healthy habits early, like including more &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/2057241/top-high-fiber-foods-you-need-in-your-life/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;high-fiber foods&lt;/a&gt;, limiting saturated fats and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/whats-the-difference-between-natural-and-added-sugars-11694001" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;added sugars&lt;/a&gt;, exercising regularly and managing stress.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Changes to your eating habits, exercise routine and other lifestyle changes can help lower cholesterol. But in some instances, lifestyle modifications aren’t enough to make a significant impact and your doctor may recommend adding medications to your cholesterol management plan. Here are some habits you can get started on now to help lower your risk:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Limit Added Sugars. &lt;/strong&gt;If you’re trying to lower your cholesterol, be mindful of your added sugar intake. &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/67340/how-to-cut-back-on-sneaky-added-sugars/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Added sugar&lt;/a&gt; can be found in places you least expect it, like in packaged bread, pasta sauce and ketchup. The American Heart Association recommends limiting added sugars to less than 6% of daily calories (about 6 teaspoons per day for women and 9 for men).&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fill Up on Fiber. &lt;/strong&gt;A &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/you-just-started-a-high-fiber-diet-recipes-to-make-first-11692499" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;high-fiber diet&lt;/a&gt; can help reduce LDL and total cholesterol. Willig recommends eating fiber-rich foods like vegetables, fruits, whole grains and legumes to support healthy cholesterol levels at every body size. Try incorporating more high-fiber foods into your meals and snacks. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Limit Alcohol. &lt;/strong&gt;Heavy drinking is associated with higher LDL cholesterol and triglycerides.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/habit-to-break-for-lower-cholesterol-8749670" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;Cutting back on alcohol&lt;/a&gt; can make a big difference when it comes to lowering your cholesterol and improving heart health, making all of your other cholesterol-lowering efforts more worthwhile. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do Cardiovascular Exercise. &lt;/strong&gt;Exercise has been shown to increase HDL cholesterol and lower triglycerides and LDL-to-HDL ratio.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Add exercise that increases your heart rate, like going for a brisk walk, riding a bike or swimming. Try to do some type of movement each day. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; High cholesterol is more common than you think, but managing it starts with separating fact from fiction. Focus on increasing your fiber intake, adding heart-healthy fats and getting regular exercise. Remember, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/ways-to-lower-your-cholesterol-naturally-11769022" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;lifestyle changes&lt;/a&gt; can make a difference, but monitoring your cholesterol and working with your doctor are important for creating an effective plan for long-term success.

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="68" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeow33wt00123b79co7tvqt7@published"&gt;My husband (we’re both men) brought home a guy for a threesome without telling me, saying he wanted it to be a “surprise.” It was. The guy happened to be incredibly hot, so I went along with it anyway, but I think him springing this on me without consulting me first was pretty thoughtless. Should I try pulling the same trick on him and see how he likes it?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="84" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeow345v00153b7939qwg5c5@published"&gt;You’re asking if you should punish your husband for what? Bringing a hot guy home? Please. I agree with you that he should have asked you first, but he didn’t and you tacitly forgave that by having sex. If the experience was nevertheless unenjoyable or even if the shock of the proposition outshined the actual sex, a conversation is in order. Just ask him to talk about it with you first, explaining that this is not the type of surprise that you find fun.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="170" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeow348f00163b79vgbcc3bj@published"&gt;But if the sex was really good and you’re miffed purely on principle, I’m going to urge you to try to center yourself in the realm of the practical. You could look at this as a new era in your relationship: your thirds era. Your husband’s method was a bit sloppy but you had fun anyway, and now there is more of that kind of fun that you can have. By all means, you have been given an implicit pass to do the same (at least once), and you should if you are so inspired and can remain in the original sharing spirit. But doing the same thing to him for sheer retaliation is escalating; he was “thoughtless” in your assessment. Don’t see and raise him with calculating and punitive. Keep sex fun and share a guy because it’s a hot thing to do, not to settle a score. Not only is that adding negativity where it doesn’t belong, it’d be treating the third as a pawn, not a person.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="129" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeowbmbb002o3b79tvdgusgd@published"&gt;I’m a single, straight male who just turned 60. I’ve never really had much of a sex life outside of masturbation. I’m not a bad looking guy, as I’ve been told, but have never had much confidence in myself. The limited sexual encounters I’ve had have been mainly with escorts (that, however, is a topic for another day.) My question deals with ejaculation. Over the last several years, I’ve noticed a marked decrease in ejaculate strength and volume. When I orgasm, the result is often a dribble, and generally one shot. I masturbate 3-5 times a week on average. What I’d like to know is, is this normal for my age? If not, is there something that I can do to get a little more umph in my game?&lt;/p&gt;

From urologist Aaron Spitz’s &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Penis-Book-Complete-Penis-Everything-ebook/dp/B075DSL2NW/ref=sr_1_1?crid=31Z631J3NXG6&amp;amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.EoEP-cm0Woc0LkPmGS1vK_jlSTxv0tMjLkO82yWkhZ7uqDcUQ3t7PFLPp9149ZE6eIx59LuOw5S0lxfRXZSVCPw2s1acl8Zfa-9jKQaemunaTxPvRnFiRFLXMwrX5p9PMNhBfGBW_xebmQtcMnds-MF8NCKe-wPaIy-ChzgVA5sVApxSPe3pT7BTjhqWzhuzY73kN5WtjXmpkcSUK8aUp_XlZzUWsgLnZnd3EFGtqfY.XSWi-3552rdJ0kw81a9z2yUXnrC0peyfBxv3Ch21GQU&amp;amp;dib_tag=se&amp;amp;keywords=the+penis+book&amp;amp;qid=1755700283&amp;amp;sprefix=the+penis+book,aps,127&amp;amp;sr=8-1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Penis Book&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;div data-editable="text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;As men pass the threshold of middle age, their pelvic floor muscles become weaker and less semen is ejaculated with less force—even down to none at all. Also, the seminal vesicles tend to empty less completely and may become partially blocked by the prostate gland as it enlarges. These are normal consequences of getting older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="76" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeowbmbc002t3b794j062q7w@published"&gt;To put an even finer point on this, a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17430422/"&gt;2007 analysis&lt;/a&gt; of more than 6,000 semen samples found that on average, the peak semen volume came from subjects between 30 and 35 in age, and the lowest volumes came from subjects who were ages 55 and up. Spitz adds that other factors that may play a role in semen volume include hormone balance, hydration, overall health, level of arousal and the strength of one’s pelvic floor.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="125" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeowbmbc002u3b79i2z103ao@published"&gt;This may be entirely out of your control, but you may want to consider exercising your pelvic floor (or doing kegel exercises, as they’re called). This typically involves squeezing your pelvic floor muscles repeatedly for periods of time. You can locate the muscle by stopping your flow of urine—working your kegels basically amounts to doing that same thing over and over. There are various online guides for these exercises—I use the &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/stamena-longer-lasting-sex/id1106687104"&gt;Stamena app&lt;/a&gt;. Another thing to consider is the usefulness of abstinence. A &lt;a href="https://www.fertstert.org/article/S0015-0282(04)00877-5/fulltext"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; of 27 men followed for 16 months found that semen volume increased 11.9 percent per abstained day for the first four days of abstinence and 7.1 percent thereafter. Try taking a few days off and see if that boosts your balls.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="145" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeowbmbc002v3b79cv7exzhj@published"&gt;I don’t recommend any kind of supplements that purport to increase semen volume. Any kind of reported success from them is anecdotal and generally on a person-to-person basis (I’ve tried some for the sake of answering these very questions and saw no difference). “I know there are some supplements and despite a friend being one of the ‘founders’ of one of these I would not say they actually do anything,” Charles Welliver, director of men’s health at Albany Medical College and my go-to urology source, wrote to me in an email regarding your letter. Something else you might want to look into: Medications (including urologic ones) may cause lower semen volume so if you had any changes recently in your regimen, that may be the culprit. Otherwise, “This isn’t something you need to see a doctor about. There isn’t much you can do,” wrote Welliver.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="110" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeowbmbd002w3b79zqfdjv2r@published"&gt;You should also pause to consider why this matters to you. Maybe it’s a way of providing to yourself that your body isn’t as old as the years suggest, or maybe you just like to think to yourself, “Look what I made!,” while gazing at the giant puddle of sperm you just produced. But since your play is largely solo, you’re the only one who’s judging. It’s great to strive for more than what you already are and can do, but self-acceptance is key for happiness. If you can’t boost your volume, find a way to be OK with that. Even if they aren’t big, your loads are still yours.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="95" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeowbmbd002y3b794gowgxf0@published"&gt;I am having an issue that while not the biggest problem in the world, is still something I would rather not deal with.  My wife and I have been together for seven years, married for four. Within the last year and a half, if we don’t have sex the previous night, I wake up with morning wood. I’ve tried jerking off when my wife doesn’t want to have sex, but it doesn’t work. If I don’t get laid or at least a blow job, I will be guaranteed to be standing at attention come morning.  Any suggestions?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="120" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeowbmbd00313b793gti4kkd@published"&gt;Two thoughts on what’s going on here: Your reporting is imprecise (no shade, you aren’t a one-man scientist/subject and no one except me is truly concerned about your data), or this has something to do with hormones. Anecdotally, at least &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/1bftql8/how_longstrong_is_your_morning_wood_my_bf_is_only/"&gt;one person&lt;/a&gt; reports a more likelihood to get morning wood if he &lt;em&gt;has&lt;/em&gt; had sex the night before. Regardless, a person like you and a person like him are both likely getting multiple erections a night. The exact reasons for nocturnal penile tumescence, as it’s officially referred to, aren’t known, but it may have something to do with the bladder—perhaps as an alert of its fullness or because a full bladder &lt;a href="https://www.newcastle.edu.au/hippocampus/story/2020/male-erections"&gt;stimulates nerves&lt;/a&gt; that end up causing these spontaneous erections.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="92" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeowbmbd00323b7917dursc4@published"&gt;Morning erections can be a sign of penile/overall health. They are something a lot of guys deal with, mostly by walking them off or peeing upon waking. If your wood is persistent, jerk off or ask your wife if she’s down for a morning bone. Morning wood can be annoying, but its absence can indicate something worse. “Morning and overnight erections are normal! They are good for penile health, bringing in nourishing and oxygenated blood,” wrote Welliver, the urologist I quoted elsewhere in this column. Embrace your morning wood—however you see fit.&lt;/p&gt;

I’m healthy, fairly handsome, very intelligent, successful, musically talented, generous, and have a great sense of humor. But, I have the absolute most difficult time engaging any type of sex that involves my penis because it’s smaller than average, and noticeably so. It’s been over a decade since I’ve had sex, been on a date, or even had a kiss, because at this point, I have so little self-confidence that I haven’t even attempted to ask a woman out. The penis size issue is a mental block for me. &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2023/07/small-penis-solution-average-size.html"&gt;How do I move beyond this?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="cd92d0d7-721f-445b-938f-cbce28981299"&gt;Immune cells in the human brain may be critical to orchestrating the organ's development in the womb because they trigger a dramatic increase in an important type of nerve cell, new research suggests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Estimates suggest that these key cells, known as inhibitory interneurons, make up some 25% to 50% of the neurons in the adult cortex, the wrinkled tissue that covers the surface of the brain. In fact, the human cortex carries &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35737810/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35737810/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;more than double the number of interneurons&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as the mouse cortex does.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These interneurons relay signals between other brain cells and help keep that signaling in check with a chemical messenger called &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK513311/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK513311/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;GABA&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. As the brain's main "inhibitory" messenger, GABA helps turn down brain activity by making neurons less likely to fire, thus balancing out the "excitatory" signals that amplify brain activity. Various disorders have been tied to problems with interneurons, including &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6256185/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6256185/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;epilepsy&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6742424/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6742424/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;autism&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3090452/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3090452/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;schizophrenia&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mid-article-leaderboard" class="ad-unit sm:hidden block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check id="243cfeed-2538-43a7-aab4-998eadc98cd0"&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="caption-text"&gt;This figure shows examples of organoids grown by the researchers, where in the center column you can see that IGF1 drives cells to proliferate. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: Yu, D., Jain, S., Wangzhou, A. et al. Nature (2025). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09362-8)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p id="b7cd3eee-1d89-451d-bb49-90df9d69727c"&gt;Now, in a study published Aug. 6 in the journal &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1590019&amp;amp;xcust=livescience_us_8697653650723576302&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41586-025-09362-8&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Fhealth%2Fneuroscience%2Fminibrains-reveal-secrets-of-how-key-brain-cells-form-in-the-womb" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09362-8" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed="skimlinks" data-placeholder-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1590019&amp;amp;xcust=hawk-custom-tracking&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41586-025-09362-8&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Fhealth%2Fneuroscience%2Fminibrains-reveal-secrets-of-how-key-brain-cells-form-in-the-womb" data-google-interstitial="false" data-merchant-name="nature.com" data-merchant-network="SkimLinks"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Nature&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, researchers have uncovered a force that drives interneurons to multiply in the developing human brain — and they say it may be unique to our species.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-seasonal" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="b7cd3eee-1d89-451d-bb49-90df9d69727c-1"&gt;"That's why we cannot use traditional animal models," study co-author &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://profiles.ucsf.edu/diankun.yu" target="_blank" data-url="https://profiles.ucsf.edu/diankun.yu" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Diankun Yu&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an assistant researcher in pediatrics at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), told Live Science. To uncover this mechanism that may unfold only in the human brain, the researchers developed an &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/minibrains-brain-organoids-explained" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/minibrains-brain-organoids-explained"&gt;&lt;u&gt;organoid&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — a miniature 3D structure, grown from stem cells, that mimics a full-size structure found in the human body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior to the organoid study, research in lab animals suggested a link between the activation of the maternal immune system during pregnancy and a lower number of interneurons in the cortices of their offspring, compared to offspring that didn't experience an immune upset.

"It really adds a new dimension as to how microglia exert their function."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1590019&amp;amp;xcust=livescience_us_6406946944647214782&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41596-018-0032-7&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Fhealth%2Fneuroscience%2Fminibrains-reveal-secrets-of-how-key-brain-cells-form-in-the-womb" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41596-018-0032-7" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed="skimlinks" data-placeholder-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1590019&amp;amp;xcust=hawk-custom-tracking&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41596-018-0032-7&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Fhealth%2Fneuroscience%2Fminibrains-reveal-secrets-of-how-key-brain-cells-form-in-the-womb" data-google-interstitial="false" data-merchant-name="nature.com" data-merchant-network="SkimLinks"&gt;&lt;u&gt;built on previous work from other research groups&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to develop their organoids, which resembled a key structure in the fetal brain &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9294455/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9294455/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;from which many cortical interneurons arise&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. This structure is temporary, appearing around the eighth week of pregnancy in humans and disappearing about eight months after birth, Piao said. The researchers found a way to incorporate microglia into this model, which hadn't been done before, she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team found that the microglia in their organoids were a key source of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) in the developing minibrains and that the substance helped to drive the dramatic increase in interneurons seen in early development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ffdd769b-eba3-468e-9dc2-4c64705f040c"&gt;When the team tested what would happen when they turned off IGF1 signaling in various ways, they found that it blocked the rapid increase in interneurons. However, "when we deleted this gene in microglia in the mouse model, we did not see any change," Piao said. That suggests that this chain of events kicked off by microglia-made IGF1 may be unique to humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These findings indicate an evolutionary adaptation of microglial function to support the increased demand for interneurons in the human cortex," the researchers wrote in their report. In short, this finding hints at a feature of human evolution that might help to explain our unique cognitive abilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, organoids aren't exact replicas of the human brain, so there's a limit to what the 3D models can tell us. "So far the model is good enough for especially the proliferation stage, very early stage" of development, Yu said. But currently, these organoids don't do as well with later stages of brain development, he noted. They also don't capture circuit-level activity in the brain, Piao said, showing only activity within smaller, isolated structures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future work could help to further clarify this previously unknown role of immune cells in the brain, she said.&lt;/p&gt;

Researchers found that personalized gait retraining rivaled medication in effectiveness, opening the door to a new kind of treatment. Credit: Stock&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new study led by a Utah engineering professor shows that gait retraining can reduce pain and slow cartilage damage.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost one in four adults over the age of 40 live with painful osteoarthritis, a condition that has become one of the leading causes of disability. The disease gradually wears away the cartilage that cushions joints, and there is currently no way to restore this damage. For now, treatment typically focuses on pain management with medication, followed eventually by joint replacement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists from the University of Utah, &lt;span class="glossaryLink" aria-describedby="tt" data-cmtooltip="&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemTitle&amp;gt;New York University&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemBody&amp;gt;Founded in 1831, New York University (NYU) is a global research institution headquartered in Manhattan, widely recognized for its impact in fields like physics, neuroscience, and computer science.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;" data-gt-translate-attributes='[{"attribute":"data-cmtooltip", "format":"html"}]' tabindex="0" role="link"&gt;New York University&lt;/span&gt;, and Stanford University are now pointing to a promising alternative: gait retraining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a year-long randomized controlled trial, participants who adjusted the angle of their foot while walking reported pain relief comparable to medication. Importantly, these individuals also showed slower cartilage deterioration in their knees compared with those who received a placebo treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;First placebo-controlled proof&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="glossaryLink" aria-describedby="tt" data-cmtooltip="&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemTitle&amp;gt;The Lancet&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemBody&amp;gt;&amp;amp;lt;em&amp;amp;gt;The Lancet&amp;amp;lt;/em&amp;amp;gt; is one of the oldest and most respected peer-reviewed medical journals, founded in 1823. It publishes research, reviews, and commentary on global health, clinical medicine, and public health policy. The journal is known for its influence on healthcare debates and global health equity.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;" data-gt-translate-attributes='[{"attribute":"data-cmtooltip", "format":"html"}]' tabindex="0" role="link"&gt;The Lancet&lt;/span&gt; Rheumatology&lt;/em&gt; and co-led by Scott Uhlrich of Utah’s John and Marcia Price College of Engineering, these findings come from the first placebo-controlled study to demonstrate the effectiveness of a biomechanical intervention for osteoarthritis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’ve known that for people with osteoarthritis, higher loads in their knee accelerate progression, and that changing the foot angle can reduce knee load,” said Uhlrich, an assistant professor of mechanical engineering. “So the idea of a biomechanical intervention is not new, but there have not been randomized, placebo-controlled studies to show that they’re effective.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Tailoring treatment to each patient&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Backed by the &lt;span class="glossaryLink" aria-describedby="tt" data-cmtooltip="&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemTitle&amp;gt;National Institutes of Health&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemBody&amp;gt;The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the primary agency of the United States government responsible for biomedical and public health research. Founded in 1887, it is a part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The NIH conducts its own scientific research through its Intramural Research Program (IRP) and provides major biomedical research funding to non-NIH research facilities through its Extramural Research Program. With 27 different institutes and centers under its umbrella, the NIH covers a broad spectrum of health-related research, including specific diseases, population health, clinical research, and fundamental biological processes. Its mission is to seek fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems and the application of that knowledge to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce illness and disability.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;" data-gt-translate-attributes='[{"attribute":"data-cmtooltip", "format":"html"}]' tabindex="0" role="link"&gt;National Institutes of Health&lt;/span&gt; and other federal agencies, the researchers focused on patients with mild-to-moderate osteoarthritis in the medial compartment of the knee (the inner side of the leg), which carries more weight than the lateral, outer compartment. This type of osteoarthritis is the most widespread, but the best foot angle to lessen stress on the medial knee varies for each individual, depending on their natural gait and how it shifts when they adopt a new walking style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Previous trials prescribed the same intervention to all individuals, resulting in some individuals not reducing, or even increasing, their joint loading,” Uhlrich said. “We used a personalized approach to selecting each individual’s new walking pattern, which improved how much individuals could offload their knee and likely contributed to the positive effect on pain and cartilage that we saw.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe title="Treadmill Arthritis Gait Video" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Uq7TxlN-XLI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Using motion capture cameras, the researchers tracked the degree to which participants walked with their toes pointed inward or outward. Researchers could then calculate the loading in participants’ knees and prescribe the change in foot angle that reduced each individual’s loading. During weekly gait training visits, participants received vibrations on their lower leg after each step, teaching them to walk precisely with their prescribed foot angle. Credit: Utah Movement Bioengineering Lab&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During their first two sessions, participants underwent a baseline MRI and practiced walking on a pressure-sensitive treadmill while motion-capture cameras tracked their movements. These assessments revealed whether turning the foot inward or outward reduced knee loading more effectively, and whether a 5° or 10° adjustment was most suitable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This individualized evaluation also excluded participants for whom no foot angle adjustment could reduce knee stress. Including such individuals in earlier studies may explain why those trials produced inconclusive results on pain reduction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Placebo versus intervention&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the initial intake sessions, the 68 participants were divided into two groups. Half were placed in a sham treatment group designed to measure the placebo effect. These individuals were instructed to walk with foot angles that were identical to their natural gait. In contrast, participants in the intervention group were assigned a foot angle adjustment that most effectively reduced stress on their knees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both groups then took part in six weekly lab-based training sessions. During these sessions, participants received biofeedback in the form of gentle vibrations from a device attached to the shin, which guided them in maintaining the prescribed foot angle while walking on a treadmill. Following the training phase, participants were asked to continue practicing their new gait for at least 20 minutes each day until it became habitual. Regular follow-up visits confirmed that participants were sticking closely to their assigned gait, typically within a one-degree margin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a year, all participants self-reported their experience of knee pain and had a second MRI to quantitatively assess the damage to their knee cartilage.&lt;/p&gt;

At the beginning of the study, participants received a baseline MRI and walked on a force-sensitive treadmill while motion-capture cameras recorded their walking mechanics.

&lt;p&gt;“The reported decrease in pain over the placebo group was somewhere between what you’d expect from an over-the-counter medication, like ibuprofen, and a narcotic, like oxycontin,” Uhlrich said. “With the MRIs, we also saw slower degradation of a marker of cartilage health in the intervention group, which was quite exciting.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond the quantitative measures of effectiveness, participants in the study expressed enthusiasm for both the approach and the results. One participant said: “I don’t have to take a drug or wear a device…it’s just a part of my body now that will be with me for the rest of my days, so that I’m thrilled with.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;A long-term option&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants’ ability to adhere to the intervention over long periods of time is one of its potential advantages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Especially for people in their 30’s, 40’s, or 50’s, osteoarthritis could mean decades of pain management before they’re recommended for a joint replacement,” Uhrlich said. “This intervention could help fill that large treatment gap.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before this intervention can be clinically deployed, the gait retraining process will need to be streamlined. The motion-capture technique used to make the original foot angle prescription is expensive and time-consuming; the researchers envision this intervention to eventually be prescribed in a physical therapy clinic and retraining can happen while people go for a walk around their neighborhood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We and others have developed technology that could be used to both personalize and deliver this intervention in a clinical setting using mobile sensors, like smartphone video and a ‘smart shoe’,” Uhlrich said. Future studies of this approach are needed before the intervention can be made widely available to the public.&lt;/p&gt;

Participants were all over 30 (their average age was 41), and a majority were of higher socioeconomic status. Requirements were that they lived full-time at the highway-adjacent residence, did not have a history of heart attack, stroke, or other major cardiovascular event, and did not actively take any blood pressure or anti-inflammation medications. The group’s average blood pressure reading was 118.8/76.5 mm Hg at baseline (so within a normal range: The &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a65808722/aha-new-how-to-lower-blood-pressure-guidelines-2025/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:American Heart Association recommends;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;American Heart Association recommends&lt;/a&gt; aiming for 120/80 mm Hg or lower.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers installed custom-made HealthMate HEPA air purifiers in participants’ bedrooms and living rooms and confirmed that they were used 99% of the time during which the study took place. Participants’ blood pressures were measured four times over two months—at the beginning and end of a month-long “sham purification” or faux air purification and a month of real filtration—and they answered questions about their exposure to second-hand smoke, stress levels, exercise frequency, and general health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the study found that the introduction of HEPA filters in the homes of people who live near a highway and have elevated blood pressures “resulted in a modest but significant reduction in systolic blood pressure,” which is the upper number of a reading, explains &lt;a href="https://manhattancardiology.com/team/karishma-patwa-md/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Karishma Patwa, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Karishma Patwa, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, a cardiologist with Manhattan Cardiology and &lt;a href="https://www.labfinder.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:LabFinder;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;LabFinder&lt;/a&gt; contributor. The average net reduction was 3 mm Hg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How HEPA filters may help manage blood pressure&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Air pollution can trigger the sympathetic nervous system, increasing heart rate and vasoconstriction,” which is the constricting of blood vessels that allow for free blood flow, Dr. Patwa explains. Pollution can also cause chronic structural changes to the arteries, he adds, which can lead to hypertension. “HEPA filters reduce the pollution entering a home, thereby lowering those effects,” he concludes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is simply a reminder that so many different factors—mental and physical, internal and external—go into blood pressure management. “For me, the key takeaway to this study is that improving air quality, even with a simple low-cost measure, can lower systolic blood pressure, which leads to lower rates of cardiovascular disease,” Dr. Patwa adds.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Dyson Purifier Hot+Cool&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This hugely popular air purifier uses a HEPA filter that seals allergens inside.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A registered dietitian sets the record straight on those foods you were previously told are "bad" for heart health.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Foods like eggs, shellfish and full-fat dairy actually contain important heart-healthy nutrients.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;No need to cut out potatoes, coffee or dark chocolate — these foods can also be good for your heart. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For years, certain foods have been labeled as “bad” for heart health—often due to outdated nutrition myths or misleading advice from social media. However, research and expert insights reveal that many of these foods actually offer health benefits, including for the heart. In this article, we’ll highlight several so-called “bad” foods that may be better for your heart than you think.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-1-eggs"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 1. Eggs &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Eggs have long been controversial due to their cholesterol content. However, the current body of research shows that dietary cholesterol found in food has less impact on blood cholesterol than previously thought.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In fact, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Easy-Steps-Lower-Cholesterol-Portfolio/dp/B0D3B5LSDF/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2B74YF90IKZC7&amp;amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.fNASg5aKg7nChWnaUVBCrwxWXwpFq6al5XmFgZoIGIha7FZQZPdNk8zJ0pUqGvUnC-8f5Q1U9CcxAgvkHyjE7w.VpzWQFKYCb58V2pveU65Fhg1zqqHjj59UFGGQNweqlI&amp;amp;dib_tag=se&amp;amp;keywords=veronica+rouse&amp;amp;qid=1722441546&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;sprefix=veronica+rouse%2Cstripbooks%2C98&amp;amp;sr=1-1" data-component="amazon" data-source="affiliate" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Veronica Rouse, RD&lt;/a&gt;, points out that recent research studies have found moderate egg consumption (up to one egg per day) is not associated with an increased risk of heart disease.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In reality, eggs are an excellent source of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7913446/what-is-protein-why-do-you-need-it/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;complete protein&lt;/a&gt; and provide essential nutrients like choline, which supports both heart and brain health. And don’t be afraid to eat the whole egg—the yolk is where most of the vitamins, minerals and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/surprising-nutrient-for-better-heart-health-8686588" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;heart-healthy antioxidants&lt;/a&gt;, like lutein and zeaxanthin, are found.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-2-full-fat-dairy"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 2. Full-Fat Dairy &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Full-fat dairy products like yogurt and milk have long been criticized for their saturated fat content, but research shows they can be part of a heart-healthy diet. Rouse states, “A review article found that full-fat dairy consumption was not associated with an increased risk of heart disease and may even have protective effects due to its unique nutrient profile.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Rouse goes on to list the numerous nutrients found in dairy, including calcium, probiotics and potassium, that can support healthy blood pressure and cholesterol levels.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Shellfish, such as shrimp, mussels, lobster and oysters, are often avoided due to their cholesterol content. However, they’re actually rich in heart-healthy &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/foods-with-as-many-omega-3s-as-salmon-11681920" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;omega-3 fatty acids&lt;/a&gt; and low in saturated fat, making them a nutritious choice for cardiovascular health. Rouse points out, “Eating one to two servings of seafood per week may reduce the risk of coronary heart disease, stroke and even death, especially when replacing less-healthy foods in the diet.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Caffeine has often been controversial for raising blood pressure, but &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8069479/is-coffee-good-for-you/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;moderate coffee consumption&lt;/a&gt; (around 2 to 3 cups per day) has been linked to &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/is-drinking-too-much-coffee-bad-for-you-11745737" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;heart-health benefits&lt;/a&gt;. Rouse shares that a large cohort study found that coffee drinkers had a significant reduction of cardiovascular disease.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; These potential benefits may have something to do with the antioxidants found in coffee, like chlorogenic acid and polyphenols, which help reduce inflammation and support blood vessel function. Just be mindful of what you add to your cup—too much sugar or heavy cream can make it less heart-healthy.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-5-potatoes"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 5. Potatoes &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Potatoes often get unfairly criticized, but they’re actually a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8044322/are-potatoes-good-for-you/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;nutrient-packed vegetable&lt;/a&gt; loaded with fiber, energizing complex carbohydrates, vitamin C and potassium, which plays a key role in regulating blood pressure.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Rouse points out that what it all really boils down to&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;is how they’re prepared. She recommends boiling or baking them with the skin on for added fiber, instead of frying.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-6-chocolate"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 6. Chocolate &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Chocolate is often seen as a “bad” food that you should avoid for better health. However, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/benefits-of-chocolate-11760050" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;dark chocolate with a high cocoa content&lt;/a&gt; (70% cocoa or more) can actually be a heart-healthy food choice in moderation. &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8013599/what-happens-to-your-body-when-you-eat-chocolate-every-day/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Cocoa is rich in flavonoids&lt;/a&gt;, plant compounds that help lower blood pressure and improve circulation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Research supports these benefits—a meta-analysis study found that moderate chocolate consumption was associated with improvements in heart disease risk factors including lowering blood pressure, LDL cholesterol and fasting glucose.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While a heart-healthy diet is important, it’s just one part of the bigger picture. Here are a few other habits to consider for keeping your heart strong and healthy.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focus on Fiber:&lt;/strong&gt; Include plenty of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts and seeds in the diet to get your fiber in. Most people should be aiming for about &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8043390/too-much-fiber/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;25 to 36 grams of fiber per day&lt;/a&gt;. Rouse mentions especially focusing on &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7962360/what-is-the-difference-between-insoluble-and-soluble-fiber-according-to-a-dietitian/" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;soluble fiber sources&lt;/a&gt;, as these can help lower your LDL (“bad”) cholesterol.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prioritize Omega-3s:&lt;/strong&gt; Make sure to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-nutrient-to-lower-inflammation-8783795" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;prioritize omega-3 fatty acids&lt;/a&gt; from foods such as salmon, mackerel, sardines, chia seeds and walnuts, as omega-3s can help reduce inflammation and support heart function. Rouse reminds us, “The American Heart Association recommends eating fish at least twice a week for optimal heart health.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stay Active:&lt;/strong&gt; Regular physical activity strengthens the heart and improves circulation. Aim for the goal of at least 150 minutes of moderate exercise per week. Rouse emphasizes the importance of making movement realistic and sustainable, stating, “Even short bursts of 10-minute activity can help improve cholesterol levels and manage blood pressure.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-the-bottom-line"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; The Bottom Line &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Turns out some foods with a bad reputation can actually have surprising heart-health benefits. Eggs, full-fat dairy, shellfish, coffee, potatoes and dark chocolate can all be part of a heart-friendly diet when enjoyed in moderation and prepared in healthy ways.

Increased weight brings a higher risk of metabolic disorders such as insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, and even cardiovascular diseases. Among the various forms of exercise, there is one that requires no equipment, no expensive clothes—just a good pair of shoes and a little time from our busy schedules. This workout is none other than walking&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This article will review a 12-week randomised controlled trial that evaluated these effects in overweight and obese adults, highlighting the potential benefits of integrating moderate walking into weight loss strategies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What was the study about and its findings&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022316622105833" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;12-week randomized &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;controlled trial has revealed the potent role that moderate walking can play in improving the loss of fat mass and metabolic health when added to an energy-restricted diet in overweight and obese adults. The trial pitted two groups against each other: one was given a calorie-restricted diet alone, while another received the same diet plus a moderate walking program amounting to about 2.5 hours weekly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The groups were divided into two:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The diet + walking group lost 6.4 kg of fat mass on average.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The diet-only group lost 4.8 kg of fat mass on average.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Main conclusions were that although both groups had impressive weight loss across the intervention period, the diet combined with moderate walking resulted in larger decreases in fat mass. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More precisely, the group that participated in moderate walking in combination with dieting lost 6.4 kilograms of fat mass on average compared to 4.8 kilograms in the group that was on the diet alone. There is a significant 33% increase in fat loss from the introduction of moderate walking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The advantages went beyond fat reduction. The diet-plus-walking group also demonstrated substantial improvement in serum insulin concentrations and insulin resistance, as assessed by HOMA-IR, which did not occur in the diet-only group. This indicates that moderate walking not only contributes to fat loss but also increases insulin sensitivity, a key factor in preventing and treating metabolic conditions like type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Need for trial&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;It emphasised the effectiveness of moderate walking, which is a low cost, accessible form of exercise. For obese and overweight individuals, integrating regular walking along with a calorie-deficient diet can deliver significantly better results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walking is one of the simplest and most accessible forms of physical activity with a multitude of health benefits. A brisk walk of at least 30 minutes on most days, is all we need to reap the advantages with the intensity described as brisk enough to talk but not sing comfortably. Add walking to your routine, walking a dog, or taking stairs is all one needs to stay fit. It is as easy as it gets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Sun, 24 Aug 2025 13:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiigJBVV95cUxOUFYyN3hKcmJaa3BBQV81a0p6SzVaMndCOU5TSlVzR0s3b29zVTVTRnA3UXN4MVByUDVhcmdnVnd3Sm9XdGZQblVPUmxSNjhDSi05RWQ5NDBBTi11SWhKSGpsd1Vta1lURk1WVVltdjFsaTctemJpbzJJYUZnelA3T25HcS1DUkVNMll2NTJkZTRvMjMwcXBoNHBTZFJBbmktTkY4NUNiN1ljVldOXzV1RWRpYWF3VVpZZHJKWFJPRlhzQk5Ta21yQkpSdUdVdy15Mzk4QjRxM2dPSkpUQXpGLS0yNU5iNjU4bzYxX3RvREVFWGtsUnh3S1JIQUlRN2VhTlhmV2NuYXF0UQ</guid></item><item><title>带状疱疹疫苗可能有助于预防常见的年龄相关疾病-健康文摘</title><link>https://www.healthdigest.com/1945690/shingles-vaccine-help-prevent-common-age-related-illness-dementia/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="content" class="article"&gt;

&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Truth: You don't want to get shingles, the condition that occurs when the dormant virus that causes chickenpox reactivates. Often, it leads to painful rashes and blisters. (Which makes the crazy, frustrating &lt;a href="https://www.healthdigest.com/1120943/chickenpox-explained-causes-symptoms-and-treatments/" target="_blank"&gt;symptomatic itching of chickenpox&lt;/a&gt; seem like a walk in the park.) Fortunately, there's a fast way to lower your risk of being diagnosed: Get a shingles (herpes zoster) vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The shingles vaccine has been available throughout the United States since 2006, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.nvic.org/disease-vaccine/shingles/vaccine-history" target="_blank"&gt;National Vaccine Information Center&lt;/a&gt;, and it's designed to help you avoid an outbreak of shingles. But it may do much more: Research suggests that when you protect your body with a shingles vaccine, you may end up protecting your mind against age-related degenerative &lt;a href="https://www.healthdigest.com/903333/dementia-explained-causes-symptoms-and-treatments/" target="_blank"&gt;cognitive impairments that are called dementia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/dementia" target="_blank"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt;, around 57 million individuals worldwide live with dementia. Each year, around 10 million new people are diagnosed. There isn't a cure for dementia, although some medications and therapies can slow the mental decline of those who are affected by the condition.&lt;/p&gt;

				            &lt;div class="columns-holder "&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Scientists discovered a possible connection between the shingles vaccine and dementia as part of a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08800-x" target="_blank"&gt;2025 &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08800-x" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published in Nature. The experiment looked at medical data of a relatively homogeneous population of older adults who had and hadn't gotten the shingles vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Those who had received the shingles vaccine were about one-fifth less likely within a seven-year timeframe to be diagnosed with any type of dementia. Interestingly, the female subjects seemed to fare more favorably than their male counterparts in terms of having fewer cases of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Since the subjects received the live-attenuated shingles vaccine called Zostavax and not the recombinant vaccine Shingrix, it's not clear from the experiment if Shingrix would have the same effect. (This matters because Zostavax is no longer used in the United States.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-03201-5" target="_blank"&gt;2024 study&lt;/a&gt; in Nature Medicine came to a similar conclusion about the dementia-fighting potential of Shingrix. However, the study authors cautioned that larger studies were warranted to provide more evidence.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;But why would the shingles vaccine have such unintended potential benefits in the first place? According to the original Zostavax study, shingles reactivations have been associated with the development of dementia due to deposits of proteins in brain cells, as well as neuroinflammation. Consequently, stopping those reactivations might save the brain from the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;As explained by Northwestern University medical professor Dr. Aarati Didwania in an interview with &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/aging/shingles-vaccine-dementia-risk-older-adults-rcna198952" target="_blank"&gt;NBC News&lt;/a&gt;, it might not matter how the process works as long as it works. "Is it by decreasing inflammation or preventing the virus from reactivating?" she mused, ultimately noting that shingles "is a terrible, painful and debilitating condition," so getting the vaccine is important regardless of whether or not it lowers dementia risk. (Here's &lt;a href="https://www.healthdigest.com/356582/what-really-happens-to-your-body-when-you-get-vaccinated/" target="_blank"&gt;what to expect from your body when you receive a vaccine&lt;/a&gt; .)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/shingles/hcp/vaccine-considerations/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;, all people should consider getting the Shingrix vaccine after they turn 50. Even those who previously received the Zostavax vaccine may want to discuss receiving the Shingrix vaccine with their providers.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the course of their lives, humans can sometimes acquire fear responses to specific stimuli, animals, objects or situations, typically following adverse experiences or traumatic events. Understanding the brain processes associated with the extinction of these learned fearful responses could guide the development of more effective therapeutic strategies to treat phobias or other anxiety disorders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Researchers at Ruhr University Bochum, Paris Brain Institute—Institut du Cerveau, ICM, INSERM, CNRS, APHP, Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital and other institutes recently carried out a study investigating what happens in the brain when humans and other animals are learning to suppress fearful memories associated with specific stimuli and create new ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their findings, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-025-02268-5" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Nature Human Behavior&lt;/i&gt;, suggest that this process of fear &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/extinction/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;extinction&lt;/a&gt; is supported by stable and context-specific neural representations that are concurrently produced by a network of brain regions, including the amygdala and hippocampus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Extinction learning is a fundamental ability that is needed to adapt to a changing environment," Nikolai Axmacher, senior author of the paper, told Medical Xpress. "For example, one may have learned through bad experience that some &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/electrical+devices/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;electrical devices&lt;/a&gt; (e.g., a toaster) may be dangerous in case of malfunction and thus may be hesitant to use them in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"However, one could then find out that in a different environment, toasters are in fact safe. This is called extinction learning. Now, one striking aspect of extinction learning is that the original fear memory is not entirely gone—when coming back to the original environment, or when moving to a completely new place, one may think that toasters could be dangerous again."&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;Earlier studies have consistently shown that extinction learning (i.e., the process through which a person's emotional responses to a feared stimulus become less intense) is highly dependent on the context in which they encounter the stimulus. However, the exact neural mechanisms involved in this process had not yet been fully elucidated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Axmacher and his colleagues set out to fill this gap in the literature by conducting a series of experiments involving human participants. They specifically looked at how specific cues (e.g., pictures of objects) and contexts (e.g., videos of a given environment) are represented in the brains of different individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, they tried to determine whether context representations were more "specific" while a fear was becoming extinct than while people were learning to fear a particular stimulus. If this were the case, the neutral trace associated with one context would become more distinguishable from the trace of another context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"One particular challenge when analyzing these questions in humans is that the brain areas that are putatively relevant are very small and deep in the brain, and thus difficult to investigate," said Axmacher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We thus opted for a relatively uncommon method: we conducted recordings from thin electrodes implanted in the brain. This is not possible in healthy participants, but there are certain &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/epilepsy+patients/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;epilepsy patients&lt;/a&gt; in whom such electrodes are implanted anyway for clinical reasons (to test where their epilepsy comes from). These patients are of great value for addressing fundamental questions in cognitive neuroscience, and our labs have longstanding expertise in analyzing such data."&lt;/p&gt;

DOI: 10.1038/s41562-025-02268-5&lt;/figcaption&gt;  
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In their experiments, Axmacher and his colleagues showed participants who had electrodes implanted in their brains as part of their epilepsy treatment images of specific electric devices, including a toaster, a hair dryer, a fan and a washing machine. Some of these images were immediately followed by an aversive stimulus (i.e., the image of a person who looked fearful and a screaming sound).&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;p&gt;"Each of these pictures was shown in the background of a particular context," explained Axmacher. "During the experiment, some devices that were initially 'dangerous' became safe (i.e., they were not followed by the aversive stimulus any longer) to test extinction learning. We recorded brain activity from intracranial electrodes in several brain regions that we expected to be relevant for this process. Through the analysis of this data, we investigated how representations of the devices and the contexts were formed (and extinguished) in these areas."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the researchers analyzed the data they collected, they uncovered specific neural patterns that occurred when people were learning to associate specific objects with a sense of safety, as opposed to a threat. Firstly, they found that responses in the amygdala, a brain region that is known to play a part in &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/fear+responses/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;fear responses&lt;/a&gt; and the signaling of threats, were surprisingly associated with the safety of a given stimulus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Second, we indeed found that the neural representations of individual contexts were more specific during extinction than they were during acquisition," said Axmacher. "This effect occurred in a brain region called the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/prefrontal+cortex/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;prefrontal cortex&lt;/a&gt;, which is important for adaptive control of behavior, suggesting that these context representations may have been deliberatively modified by the patients. Finally, we observed that this effect influenced whether the patients would afterwards be fearful of the extinguished stimuli in a new experimental environment."&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;Axmacher and his colleagues observed that if neural representations of the extinction contexts presented to participants differed greatly from each other, their extinction learning did not generalize to a new environment. This essentially means that participants might no longer perceive an object (e.g., a toaster) as threatening in one context, but still thought it was in another context. This phenomenon, also referred to as 'return of fear,' thus appeared to be influenced by neural representations of contexts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team's findings could soon inspire similar studies focusing on the neural underpinnings of fear learning and extinction. Meanwhile, Axmacher and his colleagues plan to adapt their experiment to ensure that it is more aligned with everyday situations and settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our approach of 'extinction learning in the wild' assumes that in the real world, contingencies (i.e., whether something is dangerous or not) may change back and forth between contexts," added Axmacher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It would be relevant to investigate this phenomenon using technologies like Virtual Reality, which allow us to create immersive and engaging experiences in which naturalistic contexts can be created and manipulated. This leads to an exciting hypothesis: If—as our current results suggest—extinction learning leads to novel memory traces that suppress rather than replace the previously formed memories, does this mean that multiple changes lead to a hierarchy of mutually inhibiting memory traces?"&lt;/p&gt;

Researchers found that volunteers who experienced moderate arousal while listening to music were better at recalling details, while those with stronger or weaker emotions remembered only the gist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This suggests that music can shift the balance between gist- and detail-based memory depending on how it affects the listener emotionally. The findings highlight music’s potential as a low-cost, noninvasive tool for memory enhancement and therapeutic interventions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Moderate Emotion Helps:&lt;/strong&gt; Detail memory improved only when emotional response to music was moderate.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Too Much/Too Little Emotion:&lt;/strong&gt; Strong or weak emotions favored gist memory but blurred details.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Therapeutic Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; Music could help sharpen memory in aging, Alzheimer’s, or trauma treatment.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;UCLA&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Listening to music while doing something can make that activity more enjoyable. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But listening to music after an experience or activity can make it more memorable if you have the optimal emotional response while listening to it, according to new research by UCLA neuroscientists published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Neuroscience.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We found that whether music was negative or positive or whether it was familiar didn’t have as much of an influence on memory as the emotional response people felt while listening to it,” said corresponding author and UCLA integrative biology and physiology professor Stephanie Leal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-112408"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/music-memory-emotion-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/music-memory-emotion-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/music-memory-emotion-neuroscience-770x514.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/music-memory-emotion-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/music-memory-emotion-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/music-memory-emotion-neuroscience-293x196.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/music-memory-emotion-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/music-memory-emotion-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain and musical notes." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/music-memory-emotion-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/music-memory-emotion-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/music-memory-emotion-neuroscience-770x514.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/music-memory-emotion-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/music-memory-emotion-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/music-memory-emotion-neuroscience-293x196.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/music-memory-emotion-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Because the optimal response varied highly between individuals, further research will help Leal’s lab learn how their approach can be tailored for personalized therapies. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There was an optimal level of emotional response that aided in remembering the details of an experience. Too much or too little emotional response had to opposite effect – worse memory for details, but better memory for the gist of an experience.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists have been trying to tease apart the close association between music, emotions, and memory to find ways to improve learning and problems involving memory such as Alzheimer’s disease and PTSD. Music could become a powerful, noninvasive and even pleasant therapeutic tool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new study involved volunteers who viewed a series of ordinary household objects, such as telephones, laptops, and oranges. After viewing about 100 images, the volunteers listened to classical music for 10 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After their levels of emotional arousal had dropped back down to baseline, they completed tests of their memory for the objects they had seen. They were shown pictures that were either identical to the images they had seen, ones that were very similar but slightly different, and ones they hadn’t seen at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants had to identify if the images were exactly the same, or new or different in any way. They also answered questions about their familiarity with the music, and how they felt while listening to it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, music did not improve participants’ memory of the objects. But some individuals showed significant improvement — especially for recognizing that an object wasn’t quite the same during the memory test, but similar. All participants completed a standard questionnaire used by psychologists to measure emotional response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further analysis showed that the individuals with improved memory had experienced a moderate level of emotional arousal, so not too much or too little, whether listening to classical music that sounded uplifting or gloomy, or familiar or unfamiliar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who felt strong emotions in either direction, in fact, tended to have the most blurry recall of the objects and remembered the gist of the images better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Memory is often a balance between remembering the gist versus the details. Gist-based memory lets us forget some of the details while remembering the big picture of the information or experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is important because we can’t and don’t need to hang on to every detail of everything we encounter. But it’s also important to be able to remember some specific details, and for that we have detail-based memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We used a task designed to tap into the difference between gist- and detail-based memory,” Leal said. “Music helped with detail-based memory but only when the level of emotional arousal was just right for that person.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings suggest that listening to music immediately after an experience can alter what we remember. For example, listening to moderately arousing music after studying might help you remember the detailed information you need for a test the next day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, listening to music that provokes very strong emotional arousal immediately after studying might have the opposite effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key is finding that optimal level of emotional arousal from music after a learning task can enhance memory as well as what information you want to remember, like the gist or the details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Music has the ability to influence a part of your brain called the hippocampus, which is essential for turning experiences into memories,” Leal said. “We think it should be possible to tap into that in a selective way to boost or impair memory depending on the therapeutic goals.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, using music to boost memory for the details of an experience could help people keep their minds sharp as they age, and help improve memory for people in the early stages of Alzheimer’s disease. In conditions like anxiety and PTSD, using music that boosts gist-based memory to smooth out experiences that trigger a trauma response could help people cope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the optimal response varied highly between individuals, further research will help Leal’s lab learn how their approach can be tailored for personalized therapies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In my lab, we’re trying to detect changes in the brain and cognition early. Music is noninvasive, low cost, and easy to personalize, and by learning more about the mechanisms that connect it to memory, we can develop treatments and interventions to prevent the disease from progressing,” Leal said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If the federal government reduces funding for Alzheimer’s research, the chances that we’ll be able to develop this line of research into inexpensive yet effective treatments are very low, as developing personalized treatments requires lots of participants in research to really capture individual needs.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this music, learning, and emotion research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://newsroom.ucla.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Holly Ober&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://newsroom.ucla.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;UCLA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Holly Ober – UCLA&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/content/45/31/e0158252025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Fine-Tuning the Details: Post-encoding Music Differentially Impacts General and Detailed Memory&lt;/a&gt;” by Stephanie Leal et al. &lt;em&gt;Journal of Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fine-Tuning the Details: Post-encoding Music Differentially Impacts General and Detailed Memory&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Music can effectively induce emotional arousal, which is associated with the release of stress hormones that are important for the emotional modulation of memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thus, music may serve as a powerful modulator of memory and mood, making it a promising therapeutic tool for memory and mood disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease or depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, music’s impact on memory depends on its features, timing, and ability to elicit emotional arousal. In the current study, we manipulated various features of music played during post-encoding memory consolidation to elicit emotional arousal and impact subsequent memory in men and women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We found that larger increases and moderate decreases in post-encoding music-induced emotional arousal from baseline resulted in gist versus detail trade-offs in memory, with improved general memory but impaired detailed memory, while moderate increases in arousal from baseline corresponded to improved detailed memory, but impaired general memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, relative to controls, music-induced emotional arousal demonstrated unique impacts on detailed memory that are crucial in supporting episodic memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings suggest that music intervention does not uniformly impact memory and has important implications in developing personalized music-related interventions for those with memory and mood impairments.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Sun, 24 Aug 2025 13:25:59 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMic0FVX3lxTE5mc0dpSVdfMjlmUUZHYmZNWlBYaGh3ZFVFTl9wTWg1bjFTa01BaldlV0MyYXMtalhkWUFkR0ZKMm1iNE05X3FWZzJGSVU0OFJkQzVTUnVzV0JTMllHcS1BWlJiaHFqU2lzVkxYWkdyak1rT3c</guid></item><item><title>Fox在亚历山大市狂犬病检测呈阳性- WTOP</title><link>https://wtop.com/alexandria/2025/08/fox-tests-positive-for-rabies-in-alexandria/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="schema-summary"&gt;Health officials in Alexandria, Virginia, have issued a rabies alert after a fox in the Del Ray–Rosemont area tested positive for the virus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fox apparently had contact with a domestic cat near a home Tuesday. The Alexandria Health Department said the fox is now dead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The health department said it is working with the cat’s owner on “safe next steps,” but there is “an increased risk of rabies exposures in the community,” &lt;a href="https://www.alexandriava.gov/news-ahd/2025-08-22/alexandria-health-department-issues-rabies-alert-after-fox-in-the-del" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;according to a news release&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-end="516" data-start="391"&gt;The health department is urging residents not to approach wild or stray animals, and to make sure pets are up to date on rabies vaccinations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-end="657" data-start="518"&gt;Rabies can be deadly, and is easily spread through bites or scratches, the health department said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-end="657" data-start="518"&gt;Symptoms of rabies in animals include aggression, excessive drooling, and odd behavior, according to the news release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-end="657" data-start="518"&gt;Anyone who has seen animals having symptoms of rabies is asked to call Alexandria Animal Control at 703-746-4444. If you or your family members were exposed, contact the Alexandria Health Department at 703-746-4910 during their business hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Some social media users have recommended the use of a diversity jar as an easy way to improve gut health through at-home cooking.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A diversity jar aims to add a wider array of plants to your diet, which can boost gut health by fostering a more diverse microbiome in your digestive system.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Better gut health can improve digestion, strengthen the immune system, and support better nervous system function through the gut-brain axis.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Along with an emphasis on anything packed full of protein, there’s one health consideration that nutrition-focused individuals and content creators have been heavily tuned into over the past few years: gut health. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The term might sound nebulous at first, but as the American Medical Association explains, gut health “refers to the well-being of the digestive system, which is responsible for breaking down food, absorbing nutrients, and eliminating waste from the body.” A crucial part of this system is the &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/25201-gut-microbiome" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;gut microbiome&lt;/a&gt;, or the collection of microorganisms that aids digestion, supports your immune system, and even influences your nervous system.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Considering the far-reaching impacts of the gut microbiome throughout the body, it’s understandable that conscious consumers want to keep theirs balanced, diverse, and healthy. One strategy that several home cooks have suggested online for easily improving gut health is to create a diversity jar. Here’s everything you need to know about this simple nutrition tool and what experts think about it.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-is-a-diversity-jar"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block foodandwine-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What is a diversity jar? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block foodandwine-sc-block-embed mntl-sc-block-universal-embed "&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://zoe.com/learn/tim-spector" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Tim Spector&lt;/a&gt;, MD — a professor of epidemiology at King’s College London, the scientific co-founder of personalized nutrition service &lt;a href="https://zoe.com/en-gb" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;ZOE&lt;/a&gt;, and the person credited with popularizing the diversity jar — explains that the concept “is essentially a homemade mix of plant ingredients — think nuts, seeds, spices, dried herbs, grains, and even pulses — that you can sprinkle onto meals to boost the diversity of plants in your diet.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The name of the diversity jar gives a clear hint as to what it is. It is a jar filled with various shelf-stable ingredients stored in the kitchen to add a greater variety of plants to each meal. With just a small sprinkle of ingredients from a diversity jar, you can — ideally — incorporate several plants into a single dish.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This tool is meant to supplement your diet, not replace anything else, and Spector recommends “starting with a spoonful a day, and you can use that spoonful however you wish. Sprinkle it on your morning yogurt, add it to soups or salads, or stir it into a stew or curry. You can always build from there. The beauty is that how you use it is entirely up to you.”

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-benefits-does-a-diversity-jar-provide"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block foodandwine-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What benefits does a diversity jar provide? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; According to Lisa Moskovitz, RD, founder of &lt;a href="https://www.nynutritiongroup.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;NY Nutrition Group&lt;/a&gt; and author of &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Core-Healthy-Eating-Plan-Sustainable/dp/1507216106" data-component="amazon" data-source="affiliate" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Core 3 Healthy Eating Plan&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the greatest benefit of a diversity jar is “introducing more gut-friendly fiber and antioxidants.” She also notes that many nuts and seeds — ingredients you’ll typically find in a diversity jar — “pack in plenty of other great nutrients like magnesium, iron, potassium, and omega-3 fatty acids.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The diversity part of the diversity jar is key to boosting your gut health and microbiome. Consuming a wider variety of plants introduces more microbes to your gut, resulting in a more diverse microbiome in your digestive system. (Previous &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2024/apr/04/30-plants-week-gut-health" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; shows that eating more plants improves gut health, and Spector has recommended aiming to include at least 30 different plants into your diet each week.)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@chicago.dietitian?lang=en" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Samar Kullab&lt;/a&gt;, MS, RDN, LDN, explains that a more diverse gut microbiome can provide benefits like “a stronger immune system (less inflammation and lower risk of allergies and autoimmune conditions), a more resilient gut that bounces back faster after antibiotics or diet changes, and even better mental well-being, since your gut and brain are so deeply connected.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you suffer from chronic gut issues like bloating, constipation, diarrhea, or irritable bowel syndrome, trying a diversity jar might be an easy way to support your digestive health. (Of course, if you have any serious medical concerns, always check with your doctor to find the best course of action.)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-do-you-make-your-own-diversity-jar"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block foodandwine-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How do you make your own diversity jar? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block foodandwine-sc-block-embed mntl-sc-block-universal-embed mntl-sc-block-embed--instagram"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When building a diversity jar, dry goods are your friend. This jar will sit on a counter or in the pantry, so use only shelf-stable ingredients. You don’t need to be exact about the number of ingredients, but aiming for about 10–15 different components is a good target.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Spector notes that it’s best to aim for variety “both in flavor and in nutritional value.” This is why you should add in more than just two or three ingredients. Kullab suggests starting “with a base of seeds or grains like flax, hemp, black sesame, pumpkin seeds, rolled oats, or even quinoa flakes.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Next, incorporate a few nuts — any kind will do. (If you're using larger nuts like pecans or cashews, chopping or blending them will make it easier to sprinkle the mixture on your dishes.) Dried herbs, spices like turmeric, and adaptogens such as ashwagandha or maca are just a few examples of the many optional ingredients you can include.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Spector advises avoiding “anything highly processed or sweetened… The key is to keep it plant-based and well-balanced, with textures and flavors that enhance your meals rather than overpower them.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A diversity jar is meant to be playful. You may find that some combinations of ingredients don’t taste great on every dish you add them to, while other diversity jar recipes might be so delicious you'd want to sprinkle them on every meal, even if they weren't boosting your gut health.&lt;br&gt;

It can lead to long COVID, hospitalization and even death,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“COVID is dangerous, and particularly dangerous for folks who have immunosuppression, other chronic medical illnesses, or people who are older, and these medications can help reduce those risks,” Coles added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;COVID symptoms can look a lot like the symptoms of other upper respiratory infections, which makes testing important.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think with every new variant, there is this narrative that suggests that we could tell if someone has COVID based on their symptoms, and that the symptoms are significantly different or unique, but all in all, they appear to be undistinguishable from any other upper respiratory infection,” Harmony said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, congestion can happen whether it’s COVID or a cold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I would encourage everyone to test if you’re symptomatic,” added Coles.

That’s because mosquitoes are selective insects, and some people are more likely to get bites than others. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a few factors that could contribute to why this happens: In &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=pubmed&amp;amp;Cmd=ShowDetailView&amp;amp;TermToSearch=15311477&amp;amp;ordinalpos=3&amp;amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="one controlled study" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68a768eae4b03a473eb1c756" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=pubmed&amp;amp;Cmd=ShowDetailView&amp;amp;TermToSearch=15311477&amp;amp;ordinalpos=3&amp;amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="1"&gt;one controlled study&lt;/a&gt; by the Journal of Medical Entomology, the bugs landed on people with blood Type O nearly twice as frequently as those with Type A. The researchers noted this has to do with secretions we produce, which tips mosquitoes off on a person’s blood type. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;More research needs to be conducted on mosquitoes’ potential preference for certain blood types over others, said Jonathan F. Day, an entomology professor at the University of Florida. But he agreed that mosquitoes do pick up on some cues we give off that make the bugs more likely to land on certain people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These cues let them know they are going to a blood source,” Day said. “Perhaps CO2 is the most important. The amount of CO2 you produce, like people with high metabolic rates ― genetic, other factors ― increases the amount of carbon dioxide you give off. The more you give off, the more attractive you are to these arthropods.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what separates us from the nonliving entities that give off carbon dioxide, like cars? Mosquitoes look for primary cues in conjunction with what Day calls “secondary cues.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lactic acid — the stuff that causes our muscles to cramp during exercise — is one of those secondary cues, for example. Lactic acid is released through the skin, signaling to mosquitoes that we are a target, Day said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mosquitoes also have other qualities that help them pick up on secondary cues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Mosquitoes have excellent vision, but they fly close to the ground to stay out of the wind,” Day said. “They are able to contrast you with the horizon, so how you’re dressed matters. If you have on dark clothes, you are going to attract more because you’ll stand out from the horizon, whereas those wearing light colors won’t as much.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;A mosquito also takes in “tactile cues” once it has landed on you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Body heat is a really important tactile cue,” Day said. “That comes into play with genetic differences or physiological differences. Some people tend to run a little warmer — when they land, they’re looking for a place where blood is close to the skin.” That means those whose temperatures are a little higher are more likely to get the bite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lifestyle or other health factors may also play a role, said Melissa Piliang, a dermatologist at Cleveland Clinic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If body temperature is higher, you’re exercising and moving around a lot, or if you’re drinking alcohol, you are more attractive to mosquitoes,” Piliang said. “Being pregnant or being overweight also increases metabolic rate.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=pubmed&amp;amp;Cmd=ShowDetailView&amp;amp;TermToSearch=12083361&amp;amp;ordinalpos=3&amp;amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="One study" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68a768eae4b03a473eb1c756" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=pubmed&amp;amp;Cmd=ShowDetailView&amp;amp;TermToSearch=12083361&amp;amp;ordinalpos=3&amp;amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="2"&gt;One study&lt;/a&gt; showed that people who consumed just one can of beer were more at risk of attracting mosquitoes than those who didn’t. Of course, drinking outside is a popular summer and fall activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you’ve been moving around all day doing yardwork and then you stop around dusk and drink a beer on your patio, you’re definitely at risk of bites,” Piliang said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Photoboyko via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Photoboyko via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;Close-up of young female backpacker tourist applying bug spray on hands&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How To Prevent Mosquito Bites&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just because you might be more prone to bites doesn’t mean they have to be an inevitability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One of the very best things to do is to avoid peak activity times [for mosquitoes],” Day said. “There are very, very few species that are active in the middle of the day. They are very selective. Sunrise and sunset are when you’ll see peak activity.” Switching your early morning run to an after-work run could help here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, this tip won’t help you if you’re, say, throwing a BBQ for friends later at night. Try to cover as much skin as you can in these cases, Day said, especially in areas or at times mosquitoes are most likely to be present.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I love the fishing shirts and the long-legged outdoor pants that are breathable, but they prevent mosquitoes,” Day said. “A repellent that has a good protection time ― defined as the time from when you apply to when you get the first bite ― is also great. Roughly 5% DEET sprays gives you 90 minutes of complete coverage.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;DEET is a common ingredient in insect repellents, and sprays with DEET are probably the way to go if you know you’re at risk of bites, Piliang said. Despite the controversy over the health effects of DEET, &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/insect-repellents/deet" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="a 2014 review by the Environmental Protection Agency" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68a768eae4b03a473eb1c756" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.epa.gov/insect-repellents/deet" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="3"&gt;a 2014 review by the Environmental Protection Agency&lt;/a&gt; re-concluded that normal use of DEET products does not pose a risk to one’s health, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/westnile/prevention/index.html" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="including" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68a768eae4b03a473eb1c756" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.cdc.gov/westnile/prevention/index.html" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="4"&gt;including&lt;/a&gt; children, pregnant women and breastfeeding women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“DEET is the most effective,” Piliang said. “If you are going to be in a mosquito-prone place, knowing that they carry disease, it is your best bet.

The answer depends on your individual needs and goals, according to &lt;a href="https://www.gerrifrench.net/about" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Gerri French, MS, RDN, CDE;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Gerri French, MS, RDN, CDE&lt;/a&gt;, a nutritionist in Santa Barbara, California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Avocado nutrition&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Described by French as a "wholesome food with lots of merit,” this popular fruit is grown in warm climates like Florida, Mexico and California, and is usually in season late spring through late summer. Despite having over 500 different types of avocado, the Hass variety is likely what you’ll find in the grocery store.

However, they are rich in &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9312452/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:monounsaturated fats;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;monounsaturated fats&lt;/a&gt;, which are considered healthy — especially for your heart.

In those cases, it's smart to be extra mindful of how much avocado you're eating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to eat avocado&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, make sure it's ripe: Give it a squeeze and a little give, with a dark green skin, means it's good to eat. If it’s hard as a rock, simply put the avocado in a paper bag, and place it on your window sill or your counter for a few days, and it’ll ripen right up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next step is to cut it up, which requires a bit of finesse. Begin by slicing the avocado in half, lengthwise and carefully take out the pit. Then, use a spoon and scoop out the flesh of the avocado, and place on a cutting board. Finally, slice up the avocado into your desired thickness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In salads:&lt;/strong&gt; Drizzle lemon juice on a fresh slice, sprinkle it with salt and pepper and then toss into your salad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In salsa:&lt;/strong&gt; French enjoys eating avocados chopped up and mixed with beans, corn and tomatoes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On toast:&lt;/strong&gt; Mash up your avo and then add seasonings like lemon pepper, garlic salt or cajun seasoning and spread it on your favorite bread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In smoothies:&lt;/strong&gt; Blend avocado with leafy greens, a little fruit juice and water for a flavorful on-the-go smoothie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grilled:&lt;/strong&gt; Put slices on the grill and then top off your chicken.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Baked:&lt;/strong&gt; Bake avocados stuffed with a ground meat and cheese combo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;French offers this caution though that &lt;strong&gt;while avocado is a nutritional choice, “the company that it keeps can be the problem.” In other words, think about what you’re pairing it with.&lt;/strong&gt; For example, adding avos to your fave salad, but then drowning it with processed salad dressing is not so healthy. Guacamole is another example. While guacamole is healthy, overeating chips with it every day is not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The bottom line&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The takeaway from the experts and from research is pretty clear: Avocados are fine to eat every day, with a caveat. “Just because something’s healthy doesn’t mean more is better. &lt;strong&gt;Sticking to around ⅓ to ½ an avocado keeps things balanced without going overboard on calories or fat,” says Loewenstein.&lt;/strong&gt; So whether you slice it, dice it, blend it, mash it, grill it, bake it or fry it, avocado can be a healthy addition to most eating plans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Sun, 24 Aug 2025 10:36:44 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibkFVX3lxTFB2MWpCY0pXS0llWDZjZ1FQb3ZGSlo5Q2lSSDFqcy1DNVFBZ3pCUGJzMG9PQjZtSEp5aGMtNHhBVWU1dUFxTU56Y1k3YTFKWHdSWFBXWDIzVzJSeUR5TkpOZGktTy1ncWNaVm55eTlR</guid></item><item><title>科学家说，他们创造了一种比自然创造的更完美的新生命形式--未来主义</title><link>https://futurism.com/scientists-synthetic-lifeform-syn57</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section id="incArticle" class="post-content w-full space-y-4 lg:w-2/3 font-b text-3"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We've heard of GMOs, but this is ridiculous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists at the Medical Research Council's Laboratory of Molecular Biology say they've engineered a bacteria whose genetic code is more efficient than any other lifeform on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They call their creation "Syn57," a bioengineered strain of &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; — yes, the same bad boy that can make you extremely sick if you eat an undercooked hot dog&lt;strong&gt; — &lt;/strong&gt;which uses seven less codons than all life on earth. A codon, put simply, is a three-letter sequence found in DNA and RNA which delivers instructions for amino acids, a fundamental "building block" of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the past billions years or so, all known life on earth has used 64 codons. Scientists &lt;a href="https://www.genome.gov/25520300/online-education-kit-1966-genetic-code-cracked" class="underline hover:text-futurism hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;cracked the code&lt;/a&gt; detailing which codons corresponded to which amino acids — mapping the standard genetic code, in other words — in 1966, revealing only 20 total amino acids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intriguingly, they realized, evolution hadn't resulted in perfect efficiency, since some of the codons were clearly redundant. It raised a tantalizing possibility: was there room to trim some of the fat, engineering a more efficient organism from scratch?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First they just needed a proof of concept. In 2010, a team &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/news.2010.253" class="underline hover:text-futurism hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;24 researchers&lt;/a&gt; detailed the steps taken to create the world's first &lt;a href="https://www.jcvi.org/research/first-self-replicating-synthetic-bacterial-cell" class="underline hover:text-futurism hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;synthetic bacteria cell&lt;/a&gt;. Though it was — and still is — an astonishing feat, taking some 15 years to complete, the faux-cell was still only a faithful recreation of the stuffy ol' 64 codon version.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, in 2019, genetic researchers at Cambridge University were able to chip off at that natural redundancy and rework an E. coli strand &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-redesign-e-coli-s-genome-to-create-the-most-synthetic-life-form-yet" class="underline hover:text-futurism hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;down to 61 codons&lt;/a&gt; — demonstrating without a doubt that life can function with less than the tried-and-true 64. The incredible feat was &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-redesign-e-coli-s-genome-to-create-the-most-synthetic-life-form-yet" class="underline hover:text-futurism hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;heralded &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-redesign-e-coli-s-genome-to-create-the-most-synthetic-life-form-yet" class="underline hover:text-futurism hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;at the time&lt;/a&gt; as the "most ambitious attempt at a completely synthetic form of life" to date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And now they've gone even further. To make Syn57, the researchers went through the painstaking processing of altering over 101,000 lines of genetic code — first in theory, then in practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike the synthetic bacteria from 2010, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/31/science/dna-genetics-engineering-microbes.html" class="underline hover:text-futurism hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;according to the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, advances in DNA synthesis mean that genetic researchers can now construct genomes from scratch, avoiding some of the redundant codons from the start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You can start exploring what life will tolerate," Akos Nyerges, a synthetic biologist at Harvard told the newspaper. "We can finally test these alternative genetic codes."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nyerges was on one of the teams engaged in the race to build Syn57, which was ultimately won by the team at Cambridge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We definitely went through these periods where we were like, 'Well, will this be a dead end, or can we see this through?'" said Medical Research Council researcher Wesley Robertson, one of the authors of the Cambridge study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The result of their back-breaking experimentation?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Life still works," Robertson told the paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More on life: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://futurism.com/scientists-puzzled-giant-ancient-lifeforms" class="underline hover:text-futurism hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Scientists Puzzled by Giant Ancient Life Forms&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Futurism</author><pubDate>Sun, 24 Aug 2025 10:00:15 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiZ0FVX3lxTE1vV05QdWw1ejg2RUtQRUdETFZHai13Rjhkd0hpMzlGeEFzVjFwbGtVTkMtSlAyV2FrYm9iOXV2MTRwdndnRjgtOUdIZTFkYXhuTlJtOU1EbGhPYk0wUF8zd0VaVEZjdEU</guid></item><item><title>在这里，宾夕法尼亚州的猎人可以检查他们的鹿是否患有消瘦病- WITF</title><link>https://www.witf.org/2025/08/24/heres-where-pa-hunters-can-have-their-deer-checked-for-wasting-disease/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="content"&gt;

						&lt;p&gt;Pennsylvania hunters worried about deer they’ve shot being infected with chronic wasting disease can get their deer tested for free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the first time this fall, hunters can take the heads of deer shot anywhere in the state and deposit them in collection bins located throughout the 10 chronic wasting disease Disease Management Areas for free testing by the state Game Commission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Any deer head placed in a head bin will be tested, regardless of where in the state it was harvested,” said Game Commission spokesman Joshua Zimmerman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previously, those collection bins were reserved for the heads of deer taken within the management area where the deer were shot and where the bins were located.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hunters who shot deer outside a management area could submit samples on their own for testing to a laboratory for a fee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allowing hunters to now place heads in management area collection bins from deer taken anywhere in the state is good news for Lancaster County hunters concerned about chronic wasting disease, since there are seven collection bins located here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chronic wasting disease is an always-fatal disease that infects deer and elk by attacking the central nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was first found in 1967 in captive mule deer in Colorado, and then the first case in the wild was detected in an elk in Colorado in 1981.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chronic wasting disease has been spreading across North America ever since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Game Commission began testing for it in Pennsylvania in 1998, but it wasn’t found here until October 2012, when a captive deer in Adams County tested positive for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first confirmed case of chronic wasting disease in a wild deer in Pennsylvania was recorded a month later, when three deer in Bedford and Blair counties were found with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 2024-25 sampling year, the Game Commission tested over 11,000 deer for chronic wasting disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Samples from those deer were collected through a variety of avenues, including placing heads in the over 120 special, management area collection bins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 4,400 heads were obtained just from those collection bins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zimmerman reported that 30 deer were collected from the eight bins in Lancaster County.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None were found to have chronic wasting disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Statewide, a total of 530 deer were found to have chronic wasting disease from all the sampling done last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When chronic wasting disease is found in Pennsylvania, a management area is created around the site where the deer was found or harvested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Increased monitoring then occurs in that area, and hunters are subjected to a slate of special rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the rules are that no high-risk parts — spine, brain, spleen — may be taken out of the management area where a deer was shot, and deer feeding and the use of urine-based lures are banned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, there are 10 deer management areas in Pennsylvania, covering about a third of the state, mainly in the southcentral region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of Lancaster County is in management area 4, since chronic wasting disease was found in captive deer kept at a farm in the northern part of the county in 2018, and in the southern part in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chronic wasting disease has not ever been detected in wild deer in Lancaster County.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;READ: &lt;a title="Here's the deadline for applications for Middle Creek's annual archery deer hunt" href="https://lancasteronline.com/tncms/asset/editorial/fe8faa19-567f-4385-b81c-ef1b50d807f7/"&gt;Here’s the deadline for applications for Middle Creek’s annual archery deer hunt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Deer Management Area 4 head collection bins in the county are at:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Bowmansville Fire Company, 146 W. Maple Grove Road, Bowmansville&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— West Earl Township Building, 157 W. Metzler Road, Ephrata&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Muddy Run Recreation Park parking area on Route 372 at Old Pinnacle Road&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— State Game Lands 136 parking area, Puseyville Road and Street Road, Kirkwood&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Blue Rock Fire Rescue House 903, 3079 River Road, Conestoga&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Salisbury Township Office, 5581 Old Philadelphia Pike, Gap&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Middle Creek Wildlife Management Area, Hopeland Road, 1 mile East of Route 897&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Since head bins are placed in areas where chronic wasting disease has already been detected, it can help provide additional information as to the level of chronic wasting disease in the area and monitoring the effect of management activities over time,” Zimmerman said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It also provides hunters with additional information they can use when deciding to consume venison.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Game Commission advises hunters not to eat venison from deer known to have chronic wasting disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“While chronic wasting disease has not been shown to infect humans, federal health officials consider it a theoretical risk, leading to the recommendation to avoid consuming meat from chronic wasting disease-positive animals,” the agency’s website states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hunters who want to have deer tested for chronic wasting disease should place the head — with harvest tag filled out and attached to the ear — in a plastic garbage bag and seal it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antlers attached to the skull will not be returned, so remove those first if you want to keep them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Place the bag into a collection bin, where samples are picked up by Game Commission staff about twice a week during hunting seasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Samples from each head are removed and sent to a lab for testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When results are returned to the Game Commission, that information is entered into a database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agency then mails a postcard to the submitting hunter informing them how to check for results either online at pgc.pa.gov or by calling the chronic wasting disease hotline at 833-463-6293.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If chronic wasting disease is confirmed in a sample, the submitting hunter will be notified via certified letter with the test result and information on what the hunter can/should do next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zimmerman said it takes about two weeks for test results to come back, although that time might be a bit shorter in early archery season or a bit longer during the firearms season.&lt;/p&gt;

Recently, the mother of three noticed a pimple at the bottom right corner of her nose, near her nostril. Still, she decided not to pop it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"&lt;/strong&gt;I came home from work one night and I could feel my face was already starting to hurt badly," she says, noting that she washed her face to get all her makeup off and washed her hands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I was super clean about it, and my husband said, 'Let me try to pop it,'" she recalls. "I said, 'I don't think we should. I'm gonna let this one go for the first time, I'm not gonna touch it.' "&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Typically, Monaco's husband is the one who reminds her not to pick at her pimples. But this time around, he seemed to think it would be an easy one to pop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, Monaco washed her hands, sterilized the area, cleaned her extraction tools, and gave it a go. After five minutes, Monaco still wasn't successful, but she was more determined than ever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alisha Monaco/Tiktok&lt;/p&gt; Alisha Monaco and her pimple&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I was pushing on it, and this is where I knew I messed up because I pushed on it and tried to pop it, and my right ear popped," she recalls. "It scared the life out of me... I've never had that happen."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taking it as a warning sign, Monaco decided she wouldn't touch the blemish anymore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I cleaned it off again, washed my face, and brushed my teeth," she says. "I put a pimple patch on it, because I [wanted] to help absorb anything that came out of it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When she looked online to figure out what may have happened, she began reading up on the "triangle of death," an invisible triangle in the middle of your face from the bridge of your nose to the corners of your mouth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's recommended not to pop a pimple in that area, as "it can lead to an infection in your brain," according to the &lt;a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/danger-triangle" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Cleveland Clinic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;. The small surface area has "a direct line to the brain," thanks to the "cavernous sinus, a network of large veins located behind the eye sockets." Blood drains from the brain through this sinus, meaning an infection in the danger triangle "has a small but not impossible chance of traveling from your face right to your brain."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After just four hours of sleep, Monaco woke up in excruciating pain. When she ran to the bathroom, she saw that her smile was completely crooked. She was unable to lift one side of her face, and her vision was blurry on that same side. The ear that had popped also felt full of fluid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, she tried to go back to sleep, but when she woke up again, her face looked even more swollen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She got in her car and drove to urgent care, arriving right after they opened. Since she was just the second person in line, they treated her right away. She was prescribed an oral antibiotic, a topical antibiotic, a steroid pack, and Flonase for the fluid in her ear. Despite her discomfort and concern, they told her that her symptoms weren't out of the ordinary given the situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within the first 12 hours, Monaco says the swelling began to subside. After three days, it was gone entirely. As instructed, she finished the cycle of antibiotics and steroids even after feeling better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alisha Monaco/Tiktok&lt;/p&gt; Alisha Monaco pimple gone&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monaco documented her health saga on TikTok and posted a &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@lishmarie1/video/7535892627510611214" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:video;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; of herself in urgent care, captioned, "Reminder - do not pop a pimple in the death triangle. Or you'll end up in urgent care." The video amassed over 8.1 million views.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Michigan mom tells PEOPLE she hopes her experience serves as a reminder to people not to pop or pick at any blemishes in that area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What I am most happy about is that I'm sharing this, and there are so many people commenting saying, 'Oh my gosh, I have a pimple that just popped up in the area, and I'm not going to touch it,'" she shares.
