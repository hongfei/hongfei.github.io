Beyond confirming the presence of the disease, the test also helps determine the stage of its progression. This may fundamentally change how physicians manage Alzheimer’s care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The test was developed by experts at &lt;a href="https://medicine.washu.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis&lt;/a&gt; and Lund University in Sweden. Their studies indicate that a particular blood protein, MTBR-tau243, can be used to monitor the extent of dangerous tau accumulation in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tangles of tau protein are some of the hallmark characteristics of Alzheimer’s and are directly proportional to the intensity of the symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This new technique is considerably more convenient than brain scans since it is non-invasive, and does not require expensive procedures that are difficult to access.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-tracking-alzheimer-s-with-a-blood-test"&gt;Tracking Alzheimer’s with a blood test&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Right now, doctors can use several blood &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/blood-tests-offer-new-hope-in-detecting-alzheimers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;tests&lt;/a&gt; to help detect Alzheimer’s. Some of the tests that are already in use are based on earlier discoveries at Washington University. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These tests look for early warning signs but don’t reveal how much the disease has progressed. That’s a crucial gap. &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/medical-breakthrough-new-vaccine-may-prevent-alzheimers-disease/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Alzheimer’s treatments&lt;/a&gt; are most helpful in the early stages, before too much damage has been done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having a way to tell whether someone is in an early or late phase of the disease would help doctors decide which treatment would work best. It could also clarify whether a person’s memory or thinking issues are actually caused by Alzheimer’s or something else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This blood test clearly identifies Alzheimer’s tau tangles, which is our best biomarker measure of Alzheimer’s symptoms and dementia,” said co-senior author Dr. Randall J. Bateman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In clinical practice right now, we don’t have easy or accessible measures of Alzheimer’s tangles and &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/risk-of-dementia-is-much-higher-than-previously-thought/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;dementia&lt;/a&gt;, and so a tangle blood test like this can provide a much better indication if the symptoms are due to Alzheimer’s and may also help doctors decide which treatments are best for their patients.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-reliable-way-to-monitor-the-disease"&gt;A reliable way to monitor the disease&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s typically starts with a buildup of &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/sleeping-may-lower-levels-of-alzheimers-abnormal-proteins/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;amyloid protein&lt;/a&gt; in the brain. Tau tangles develop later and mark the point when symptoms begin to show. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best way to see these changes has been through PET scans, which can track amyloid and tau deposits. But these scans are expensive, time-consuming, and often only available in large hospitals or research centers. That’s why scientists have been working on blood-based alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team had already developed blood tests that measure amyloid plaque buildup. Earlier research showed that levels of MTBR-tau243 in spinal fluid could match up with brain tau levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this new study, the researchers demonstrated that they could get the same results using blood samples. A blood draw is much easier and more accessible than a spinal tap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-testing-the-new-approach"&gt;Testing the new approach&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To validate the test, the researchers used data from two groups of people. One group came from a research center at Washington University and included 108 volunteers. The other group included 55 people from a Swedish study known as BioFINDER-2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, the experts checked their findings with data from 739 additional people in the BioFINDER-2 group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These participants represented a range of Alzheimer’s stages – from people who had no symptoms but had amyloid in their brains, to those with mild cognitive issues, to people with full dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also included individuals with memory or thinking problems due to other conditions, and some who were cognitively healthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-alzheimer-s-progression-revealed-in-blood"&gt;Alzheimer’s progression revealed in blood&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results were promising. MTBR-tau243 levels in the blood matched the amount of tau tangles in the brain with 92% accuracy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In healthy people and those in the earliest stage of the disease, the levels were normal. But in people showing symptoms, the protein levels were clearly elevated – and much higher in those with advanced disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This difference made it easy to tell who was in an early or late stage of Alzheimer’s. It also helped distinguish Alzheimer’s dementia from other kinds of cognitive problems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That kind of clarity could make a huge difference in choosing the right treatment path.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new test uses technology licensed by Washington University to C2N Diagnostics, which previously developed similar blood tests for amyloid plaques. The earlier tests were designed to detect another tau protein called p-tau217.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I believe we will use blood-based p-tau217 to determine whether an individual has Alzheimer’s disease, but MTBR-tau243 will be a highly valuable complement in both clinical settings and research trials,” said Oskar Hansson, a professor of neurology at Lund University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When both of these &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/alzheimers-disease-earliest-biomarker-protein-psd-95-identified/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;biomarkers&lt;/a&gt; are positive, the likelihood that Alzheimer’s is the underlying cause of a person’s cognitive symptoms increases significantly, compared to when only p-tau217 is abnormal. This distinction is crucial for selecting the most appropriate treatment for each patient.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-looking-ahead-to-better-treatments"&gt;Looking ahead to better treatments&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, there are two FDA-approved drugs that target amyloid in the brain to slow Alzheimer’s. But more treatments are being tested – including ones that aim at tau protein and other disease mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As these therapies become available, doctors will need reliable ways to match the right treatment to each stage of the disease. Blood tests could be the key to this shift toward personalized Alzheimer’s care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re about to enter the era of personalized medicine for Alzheimer’s disease,” said Kanta Horie, a research associate professor of neurology at WashU Medicine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For early stages with low tau tangles, anti-amyloid therapies could be more efficacious than in late stages. But after the onset of dementia with high tau tangles, anti-tau therapy or one of the many other experimental approaches may be more effective.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Once we have a clinically available blood test for staging, plus treatments that work at different stages of the disease, doctors will be able to optimize their treatment plans for the specific needs of each patient.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full study was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-03617-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt;

By labeling synaptic proteins before and after behavioral training, scientists can now visualize where and how neural connections shift over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The technique revealed changes in the synaptic protein GluA2 in specific brain regions linked to new learning and across the brain in enriched environments. DELTA opens the door to uncovering the molecular basis of learning and memory by bridging the gap between behavior and cellular changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Whole-Brain View:&lt;/strong&gt; DELTA maps where synaptic protein changes occur during learning.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learning in Action:&lt;/strong&gt; Protein GluA2 changes reveal brain regions engaged by new tasks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Versatile Tool:&lt;/strong&gt; DELTA can track synaptic shifts in both standard and enriched environments.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;HHMI&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Janelia researchers have developed a new way to map how individual connections between neurons change across the entire brain during learning, giving scientists a new view into how changes in behavior show up in the brain.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neurons communicate with each other by passing millisecond-long signals across tiny junctions called synapses. Experiences cause the strength of these connections to change – a process called synaptic plasticity, which underlies learning and memory. But exactly where in the brain these changes occur during the learning process is largely unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108330"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/brain-mapping-synapses-learning-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/brain-mapping-synapses-learning-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/brain-mapping-synapses-learning-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/brain-mapping-synapses-learning-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/brain-mapping-synapses-learning-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/brain-mapping-synapses-learning-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/brain-mapping-synapses-learning-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/brain-mapping-synapses-learning-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/brain-mapping-synapses-learning-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/brain-mapping-synapses-learning-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/brain-mapping-synapses-learning-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/brain-mapping-synapses-learning-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/brain-mapping-synapses-learning-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/brain-mapping-synapses-learning-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/brain-mapping-synapses-learning-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;By enabling researchers to see these brain-wide changes, DELTA gives scientists a starting point for follow up studies to detail the cellular and molecular mechanisms behind learning and memory. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Janelia researchers have devised a new way to see where these synaptic changes are happening across the entire brain. The work was led by the Spruston and Lavis labs and the lab of former Janelia Senior Group Leader Karel Svoboda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new imaging method, DELTA, provides scientists with a brain-wide map of how individual synaptic proteins change over time. Proteins important for synaptic plasticity are known to be degraded or synthesized as synaptic connections change. So, tracking these synaptic protein changes during learning enables scientists to also understand how synaptic connections change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This information allows researchers to home in on areas of the brain that might be important for learning and memory and helps them figure out the molecular mechanisms behind the synaptic changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One of the problems in figuring out which molecules are in charge of what changes is that it’s very hard to know where those changes are happening. We didn’t have good way of figuring out where in the brain things are changing so we can focus our attention on the most interesting parts,” says Boaz Mohar, a Research Scientist in the Spruston Lab who led the research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Now we have a different way of looking at our manipulations and how they affect the circuit at the brain-wide level by using imaging to drill down on the subcellular structure. This helps us bridge that gap between behavior and mechanism.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The method works by first labeling a synaptic protein of interest in the mouse brain with a bright Janelia Fluor (JF) dye. To investigate how synaptic connections change during learning, the researchers used mice that had already been trained to on a simple task: learning to associate two distinct visual cues with a water reward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After this initial labeling, the mice were split into two groups: one group received water randomly at the two cues, as they had prior to labeling, while the task for the other group was modified such that only one of the cues was associated with the water reward. After a few days, once the researchers saw a clear difference between the two groups’ actions, the same synaptic protein of interest was labeled with a different JF dye in both groups of mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over those days, some of the original labeled proteins are degraded and some new proteins are synthesized, incorporating the second dye. By imaging the entire brain, researchers can see where the synaptic proteins have changed in both groups of mice, giving them a hint as to where changes in synaptic connections are happening during learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers saw that learning the modified task caused the synaptic protein they studied, GluA2, to change in specific brain regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also used the new method to see differences in protein turnover in mice living in a normal environment and mice living in an enriched environment with toys and companions. In this case, putting a mouse in an enriched environment caused widespread changes in GluA2 across the entire brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By enabling researchers to see these brain-wide changes, DELTA gives scientists a starting point for follow up studies to detail the cellular and molecular mechanisms behind learning and memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a next step, the researchers are working to add additional features to DELTA that will allow them to pinpoint when proteins are changing during the few days the animals are learning a task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the lab heads who led the project, Nelson Spruston, says the development of DELTA exemplifies the collaborative spirit of the research campus, with scientists across Janelia lending their knowledge in chemistry, imaging, behavior, and genetics to the project. The team also collaborated with experts outside Janelia, including researchers at Northwestern University who helped to validate the method.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, the team is working with scientists around the world to help them use DELTA to track synaptic changes in their own research, collaborations enabled through Janelia’s Visiting Scientist Program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is a quintessential Janelia project,” Spruston says. “It involved doing something that nobody has ever done before and required collaboration with lots of people who contributed expertise to make this all possible.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this brain mapping and synaptic plasticity research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#70121f1d0015091e3018181d195e1f0217" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Nanci Bompey&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://hhmi.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;HHMI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Nanci Bompey – HHMI&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41593-025-01923-4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;DELTA: a method for brain-wide measurement of synaptic protein turnover reveals localized plasticity during learning&lt;/a&gt;” by Boaz Mohar et al. &lt;em&gt;Nature Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DELTA: a method for brain-wide measurement of synaptic protein turnover reveals localized plasticity during learning&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Synaptic plasticity alters neuronal connections in response to experience, which is thought to underlie learning and memory. However, the loci of learning-related synaptic plasticity, and the degree to which plasticity is localized or distributed, remain largely unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here we describe a new method, DELTA, for mapping brain-wide changes in synaptic protein turnover with single-synapse resolution, based on Janelia Fluor dyes and HaloTag knock-in mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During associative learning, the turnover of the ionotropic glutamate receptor subunit GluA2, an indicator of synaptic plasticity, was enhanced in several brain regions, most markedly hippocampal area CA1. More broadly distributed increases in the turnover of synaptic proteins were observed in response to environmental enrichment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In CA1, GluA2 stability was regulated in an input-specific manner, with more turnover in layers containing input from CA3 compared to entorhinal cortex. DELTA will facilitate exploration of the molecular and circuit basis of learning and memory and other forms of plasticity at scales ranging from single synapses to the entire brain.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Apr 2025 13:28:49 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidEFVX3lxTE5TZHJRRXVRY05yTkFuakRWems3Y2dGX2NhdENRUzI4OGpaMTloSjVFUmRtX1BHZzJUb28zYkdkdUlxWWpfLVdZUzZhLW9udW4tWGZGM2gtOERaY0c1YWpPT0Y1NHg3czl6MG5mYk1qN0Fhd3dv</guid></item><item><title>Stress has a sweet spot. 5 tips to help you find it - CNN</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihwFBVV95cUxQNjlzVGQ0Tlc0QjJpejRvU2xzZy01b05yeWYtYWFSWHFfd1VORGk4SWt3T1VlTDM3dEZRN0ZLR0xad08xNDZOY1FkMG01eTJaSjU3OFNLeGhvcG16OWZoS0ZmNWdraE5ValYzQ3EzNTJvaEN4TFRITDE0UktTeGV6aTZPSTB4MmPSAX5BVV95cUxONXJzcUJrQm9fS2pBaUJCVnRiYy0yalgwMFlQS2xqNlhrUlFqUDFDYjV2bUxBaTVXZVFBLTV2UUp0SXFnbTdyNC1pbTV6bHFheUxVUThWWHZyeXY2U3JGY214WjJ2M21tM1pEbzlCYWVuWGlnVkRmWjlVczMtSWc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;(CNN) — &lt;/strong&gt;“Stress is bad for your health” is one message we consistently hear.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8xfe663000l3b6m64w2j5fd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            And it’s true: &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/04/health/stress-health-connection-wellness/index.html"&gt;stress can be detrimental&lt;/a&gt;, and lead to a whole host of ills, especially when it becomes chronic, unrelenting.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            But, it turns out, certain types of stress can &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/21/health/keep-cool-under-pressure-wellness/index.html"&gt;lead to growth opportunities&lt;/a&gt; and, according to one doctor and author of the new book, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Stress-Paradox-Essential-Management-Mind-Body-Soul-ebook/dp/B0CW13NLBZ" target="_blank"&gt;“The Stress Paradox: Why You Need Stress to Live Longer, Healthier, and Happier,”&lt;/a&gt; the right amount of it may actually be crucial to our wellbeing.

            “Yes, too much stress harms us, but not enough is actually just as harmful,” Dr. Sharon Bergquist told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta recently, on his podcast Chasing Life.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8xfwfqz000r3b6m0vkq5mbz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Bergquist, an assistant professor at Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;and the founder and director of &lt;a href="https://www.emoryhealthcare.org/centers-programs/lifestyle-medicine-wellness" target="_blank"&gt;Emory Lifestyle Medicine &amp;amp; Wellness&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;knows a thing or two about stress. As a child, she lived through the Iranian Revolution and ultimately her family was forced to flee.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8xfwfqz000s3b6mfpjvocf3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We were the last plane to leave before (Iranian leader Ruhollah) Khomeini came,” she recalled. “The airport was incredibly packed. I remember the whole process of trying to get through security and just the mass of people that were there and how we got onto the runway — every step of it.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8xfwfqz000t3b6m2hjq6t5g@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Her family fled to England, and eventually they settled in the United States. But life wasn’t exactly stress-free in the West either. “In eighth grade I could not write a paragraph in English without a lot of struggle. It would take me all night,” she said. Yet she managed to prosper, graduate as her high school’s valedictorian, attend Yale University as an undergraduate and then Harvard Medical School.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8xfwfqz000u3b6mgugrmm7q@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Bergquist’s childhood experiences planted the seeds for her interest in stress. “Ultimately it triggered this obsession for me of, why is it that some people grow and thrive from these experiences? And others don’t?” she said. She said she became really interested in the question of whether all stress is harmful.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            According to Bergquist’s research, it turns out that it depends on the type and amount of stress a person’s exposed to.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “I work with a lot of professionals (who) are very driven, but are also so passionate about what they do,” she said, noting that they lead what can be considered “stressful” lives. She counts herself among them.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8xfxzqw00123b6m5mfhqda5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I call that good stress, which I think has a very different effect on our bodies than the harmful stress that has become almost synonymous with what people describe as ‘stress’” she said. “I think I can now say with a comfortable level, that (the good) type of stress releases a biochemical profile that is actually health promoting: we release, for example, dopamine, serotonin, oxytocin.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8xfxzqw00133b6myjrvtmlt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The dopamine is from the reward for doing something meaningful, she explained. The serotonin is from the joy that comes from accomplishment and the oxytocin is from contributing to the greater good.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8xfxzqw00143b6mw7w9aazv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            She said “bad” stress is unpredictable, unavoidable, and not brief or intermittent but rather chronic. Our biochemical response to that type of stress is to release cortisol which eventually leads to the harmful downstream effects on our bodies, such as high blood pressure.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8xfxzqw00153b6ma9m5jns1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That trifecta of chemicals released when we take on good stress “mitigates our cortisol level. It literally builds our resilience to stress,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8xfxzqw00163b6m8zxfswra@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Resilience is like a muscle: It is dynamic and needs to be challenged to get stronger.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8xfxzqw00173b6m06wecz7g@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The key, really, is that our stress responses are there to help us. They’re there to help us adapt to our world,” she said, noting that for the entirety of human history that is how humans have survived and thrived.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8xfxzqw00183b6m696j75er@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “But the things that help us activate those stress responses have been removed from the fabric of our lives,” she said. No longer do we have to face environmental stressors such as food scarcity and exposure to extremes of heat and cold.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8xfxzqw00193b6mx4ihwmte@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The introduction of a lot of these comforts has removed our connection with the natural environment that we live in,” she said. Consequently “we are essentially handicapping ourselves because we are not allowing our bodies to do what they are so capable of doing.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8xfxzqw001a3b6m1thhggzp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            What can you do to introduce good stress into your life? Bergquist has five tips.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8xfxzqw001b3b6m5zw85epl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Challenge yourself to go outside your comfort zone without feeling overwhelmed,” said Bergquist via email.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8xfxzqw001c3b6ma6d3g7r8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Good stress is medicine. And like any medicine, the dose determines the response,” she explained. “Growth from stress happens when stress is in a hormetic, or Goldilocks, zone — a just right amount that’s not too much or too little.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8xfxzqw001d3b6mwyalwifz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In other words, push yourself to get in the water and swim, but don’t let yourself drown.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8xfxzqw001e3b6m5kx3q32t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Are you challenging yourself in ways that align with your beliefs? Or conflict with them?” Bergquist asked.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8xfxzqw001f3b6mqb86l8au@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Your heart and mind know the difference,” she said. “Persevering in situations where you feel stuck or disconnected from your values can become a harmful form of stress.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8xfxzqw001g3b6m0vt1v1yq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Good stress is not about simply positively reframing the stress in our lives,” she said. “But instead, deliberately taking action with meaningful and purpose-driven challenges as an antidote to the chronic stressors that we can’t control or avoid.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8xfxzqw001h3b6mag0uo3yd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For example, she said, it could involve accepting or creating a job opportunity that aligns with your values or learning a skill that you find rewarding.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8xfxzqw001i3b6mzh42j0q8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “To grow from stress, you have to make time for rest and recovery,” Bergquist said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8xfxzqw001j3b6moz69d5hg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Under stress, your body switches into a mode where you conserve energy and do internal housekeeping,” she said. “When you recover, your brain and body remodel and build new connections that better prepare you for future challenges.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8xfxzqw001k3b6mdni8hwib@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Recovery, Bergquist said, is just as important as good stress to gain benefits. “Even good stress can build up to becoming harmful without recovery.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





  &lt;h3 class="subheader inline-placeholder subheader" data-editable="text" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/subheader/instances/cm8xfy05e001v3b6mpo96ro26@published" data-component-name="subheader" id="lean-into-the-connection-between-your-mind-and-body" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
        Lean into the connection between your mind and body
&lt;/h3&gt;

            “Physically stressing yourself can help build mental resilience and vice versa,” Bergquist said. “It’s a remarkable process called cross-adaptation.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8xfxzqw001m3b6m33y2nz1c@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “When you experience good physical or psychological stress, you repair and regenerate your cells, which makes every part of your body healthier and stronger,” she explained.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8xfxzqw001n3b6mtyrfsv39@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            You can build mental resilience, for example, by physically stressing yourself (in a good way) by doing things like “eating plant-based foods with stress resistance-building phytochemicals, exercising vigorously, briefly exposing yourself to heat and cold, and fasting intermittently through time-restricted eating,” she said. “We have many tools for managing stress and lessening its harm.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8xfxzqw001o3b6mu90v2wof@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Experiencing stress is not a glitch— it’s a feature. “Our human history is one of overcoming stress — and becoming stronger because of it,” Bergquist said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8xfxzqw001p3b6mobup51i0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Through repeat cycles of stress and recovery, we summon our natural capability. It’s a gift we have inherited in our DNA,” she said. “Resilience is a muscle we can all build no matter where we are or what we are facing. It’s okay to have fears. And it’s okay to want to avoid challenges.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “Trust and do it anyway. The result can be life-changing,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

The study shows that the right side of the brainstem’s locus coeruleus (LC) activates a specific pathway to the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) during vicarious fear, while the left side processes direct fear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disabling the right LC-ACC pathway in mice erased their vicarious fear response, revealing the brain’s lateralized design for emotional processing. These findings offer new insights into empathy, social learning, and potential treatments for disorders like psychopathy, social anxiety, and autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lateralized Processing:&lt;/strong&gt; The right brainstem (LC) regulates vicarious fear, while the left handles direct fear.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vicarious Fear Pathway:&lt;/strong&gt; A specialized LC→ACC circuit activates only during observed distress in others.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Therapeutic Insight:&lt;/strong&gt; Findings may inform treatments for empathy-related psychiatric disorders.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Institute for Basic Science&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have you ever felt a chill run down your spine while watching someone else in distress?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This phenomenon, known as vicarious fear, allows us to experience fear by observing others—even when we are not in direct danger ourselves. This aligns with the concept of ‘putting oneself in another’s shoes’—both figuratively and, as research suggests, even neurologically. Just as we metaphorically step into another’s place to understand their emotions, our brain processes fear vicariously when we witness someone else’s distress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108322"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/fear-empathy-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/fear-empathy-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/fear-empathy-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/fear-empathy-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/fear-empathy-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/fear-empathy-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/fear-empathy-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/fear-empathy-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows the outline of a person." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/fear-empathy-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/fear-empathy-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/fear-empathy-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/fear-empathy-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/fear-empathy-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/fear-empathy-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/fear-empathy-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;While lateralization is well-known in language and motor control, this research shows that it also plays a role in emotional processing. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;While essential for social learning and survival, the neural mechanisms distinguishing direct fear (from personal threats) and vicarious fear (from others’ distress) have remained a mystery—until now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A research team led by Dr. SHIN Hee-sup at the Institute for Basic Science (IBS) has uncovered a fundamental brain circuit that distinguishes these two types of fear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their findings reveal that the locus coeruleus (LC), a small brainstem structure that produces norepinephrine (NA), plays a crucial role in processing fear—but in a lateralized manner, with the right and left hemispheres serving distinct functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For decades, scientists have studied how the brain processes fear, focusing primarily on regions like the amygdala and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). The locus coeruleus (LC) has also been recognized as a key player in stress and fear responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, until now, it was unknown whether the LC treats direct and vicarious fear as one and the same—or whether the brain has evolved distinct pathways for these different experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using advanced neuroscience techniques such as optogenetics (light-based neural control), fiber photometry (real-time neural activity measurement), and viral tracing (mapping brain connections), the researchers pinpointed a specialized neural circuit that selectively processes vicarious fear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They hypothesized that the right-hemisphere LC connects to the ACC to regulate fear learned from others, while a separate pathway governs direct fear responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test this idea, the team selectively inhibited neural pathways in mice and observed their behavioral responses. When a mouse saw another mouse receiving a mild foot shock—a model of vicarious fear—its right LC-ACC circuit became highly active.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, when this pathway was silenced using optogenetics, the observing mouse no longer exhibited freezing behavior, a hallmark of fear. In contrast, deactivating the left-side LC had no effect on any of the fear responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further experiments confirmed that this circuit relies on β-adrenergic receptors in the right ACC, as administering a beta-blocker (propranolol) also suppressed the vicarious fear response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also traced the inputs to the LC, identifying two key upstream regions: the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) and the central amygdala (CeA). Notably, the BNST→LC→ACC pathway was active only during vicarious fear, whereas the CeA→LC→BLA (basolateral amygdala) pathway was involved in both direct and vicarious fear, revealing a functional split in LC processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study is the first to demonstrate that the LC-NA system is functionally lateralized—meaning the brainstem itself has distinct right- and left-side roles in emotional processing. It also sheds light on how the brain differentiates between “your fear” and “mine,” providing insights into the neural basis of empathy and social learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings have significant implications for understanding and treating fear-related psychiatric conditions. Disorders such as psychopathy, antisocial personality disorder, social anxiety, and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) involve disruptions in fear regulation and social cognition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By identifying a dedicated neural circuit for vicarious fear, this research lays the groundwork for targeted therapies aimed at restoring normal fear processing in these conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also contributes to a broader understanding of brain asymmetry—the idea that different sides of the brain handle different functions. While lateralization is well-known in language and motor control, this research shows that it also plays a role in emotional processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead, the team plans to investigate whether similar pathways exist in the human brain. If so, this could bridge the gap between animal studies and clinical applications, potentially leading to new strategies for treating disorders related to fear and empathy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By revealing how our brains distinguish between direct and observed fear, this study sheds new light on the biological basis of empathy and emotional learning. It offers exciting possibilities for developing treatments for psychiatric conditions and deepens our understanding of how emotions are wired into the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#6a1d03060603191f022a03081944180f440118" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;William Suh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://ibs.re.kr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Institute for Basic Science&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;William Suh – Institute for Basic Science&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-57701-0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;The lateralized LC-NAergic system distinguishes vicarious versus direct fear in mice&lt;/a&gt;” by SHIN Hee-sup et al. &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The lateralized LC-NAergic system distinguishes vicarious versus direct fear in mice&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fear can be induced either directly through self-experience of aversive events or vicariously by observing conspecifics experiencing such events. The locus coeruleus-norepinephrine (LC-NA) system is crucial in fear responses and cognitive processes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We investigated whether the LC-NA system differentially processes these two types of fear, direct and vicarious in male mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results highlighted that the right hemisphere LC→anterior cingulate cortex pathway is uniquely crucial for vicarious fear, while the two inputs to the LC—from the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) and the central amygdala (CeA)—differentially contribute to fear processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The BNST plays a more targeted role in vicarious fear, and the CeA has a broader influence on fear in general. This underscores the complexity and specialization within the LC-NA system for fear-processing.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Apr 2025 12:35:42 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiZEFVX3lxTE1qTmMyMTJCbU1BMy0tTlJ1TWlHb2lDbmhva1ZsTU4yNkF3a0dKd0o5OXM1OHp5UE1fUlRqTnl3bnF3TjMwYkppSFUzTDVZMXZjT2FPdWJiQkFHMUZHQi12aGVQNC0</guid></item><item><title>Hinesburg resident attacked by coyote, police say - WPTZ</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicEFVX3lxTE9HZFN1ZnRIZnJUblIwczhRS0FqZFdVSWZWMVBySnRwU2tQOGxYeVRNV0FCbkN0cXF3RWhmZzB1dDZZNEtuU1BOMjFCVFlGRHFGOTJsY3B3TnpscDBNWmdENGRKUHpnUXByTW5ITkZxZ0g?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="article-content--body-text-raw"&gt;
						The Hinesburg Police Department has issued a warning about a coyote in the area, after a resident was reportedly attacked on Monday. Police took a report from an individual around 2:30 p.m. on Monday. The individual told police they had been attacked by a coyote on Leavensworth Road that  appeared to have porcupine quills in its mouth. It was not immediately clear if the coyote had rabies. However, Hinesburg police said the game warden had been contacted. The individual who encountered the coyote did not immediately report any injuries to police. Officials said he was seeking medical care as a precaution. The Hinesburg Police Department has asked people not to approach the animal but to call 802-482-3397 if they see it.

                    &lt;p&gt;New research says antidepressants taken by millions of Americans are linked to an increased risk of sudden cardiac death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings of the &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1078452?"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;, presented at the European Heart Rhythm Association’s 2025 Congress, found that individuals who succumbed to an unexpected death caused by a heart-related issue had a substantially higher rate of antidepressant usage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers looked at data from all deaths in Denmark of residents aged 18 to 90 during a single year in 2010. Among the group of just over 6,000 people who experienced sudden cardiac death that year, a disproportionately high number took antidepressants. However, one demographic, ages 18 to 29, did not show a statistically significant link.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analysis further broke down those on antidepressant medication into two buckets: individuals who took the medication for one to five years and those who took it for more than five years. Those in the first group were found to have a 56% higher risk of sudden cardiac death compared to those who were not on the medication. However, those in the second group had a 2.2 times (220%) higher risk than their non-medicated peers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, the study found a higher risk of cardiac death the longer someone was taking antidepressants, said study co-author Dr. Jasmin Mujkanovic of Rigshospitalet Hjertecentret, Copenhagen, Denmark, &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1078452?"&gt;according&lt;/a&gt; to a press release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Those exposed for six years or more were at even more increased risk than those exposed for one to five years, when compared with people unexposed to antidepressants in the general population.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ad post-ad"&gt;&lt;broadstreet-zone zone-id="172894" zone-alias=""&gt;&lt;/broadstreet-zone&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mujkanovic theorizes that the increase in risk could be driven by multiple factors, like the drugs themselves causing the adverse effects. She also says the exposure time to antidepressants could be an indicator of a more serious condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Additionally, the increase could be influenced by behavioral or lifestyle factors associated with depression, such as delayed healthcare seeking, and poor cardiovascular health,” said Mujkanovic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the United States, more than 20 million adults and 3.7 million kids ages 12 to 17 have depression. Across the country, roughly one in eight people manage the condition using antidepressants, Fortune &lt;a href="https://fortune.com/well/article/medication-antidepressants-ssri-risk-cardiac-death/"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

These infections disproportionately impact severely ill patients and those with weakened immune systems, including individuals undergoing cancer chemotherapy, living with HIV, and who have had organ transplants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Invasive fungal infections threaten the lives of the most vulnerable but countries lack the treatments needed to save lives,” said Dr Yukiko Nakatani, WHO Assistant Director-General for Antimicrobial Resistance &lt;em&gt;ad interim&lt;/em&gt;. “Not only is the pipeline of new antifungal drugs and diagnostics insufficient, there is a void in fungal testing in low- and middle-income countries, even in district hospitals. This diagnostic gap means the cause of people’s suffering remains unknown, making it difficult to get them the right treatments.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fungi in the top ‘critical priority’ category of the WHO’s  &lt;a target="_blank" href="/publications/i/item/9789240060241"&gt;fungal priority pathogens list (FPPL)&lt;/a&gt; are deadly, with mortality rates reaching as high as 88%. Advancements in treatments mean that more people are likely to be living with immunocompromised conditions, which also could mean increases in cases of invasive fungal diseases. This is a complex challenge to manage due to inaccessibility of diagnostic tools, limited availability of antifungal medicines, and a slow and complex R&amp;amp;D process for new treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Constrained process in developing treatments against deadly fungal infections&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO’s &lt;a href="https://iris.who.int/bitstream/handle/10665/380498/9789240105140-eng.pdf?sequence=1" target="_blank" data-sf-ec-immutable="" data-sf-marked=""&gt;report on antifungal drugs&lt;/a&gt; highlights that, in the past decade, only four new antifungal drugs have been approved by regulatory authorities in the United States of America, the European Union or China. Currently, nine antifungal medicines are in clinical development to use against the most health-threatening fungi, as detailed in the FPPL.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, only three candidates are in phase 3, the final stage of clinical development, meaning few approvals are expected within the next decade. Twenty-two drugs are in preclinical development, an insufficient number to feed a clinical pipeline considering the dropout rates, risks and challenges associated with earlier development stages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Issues with current antifungal treatments include serious side effects, frequent drug-drug interactions, limited dosage forms and the need for prolonged hospital stays. The report highlights the urgent need for safer antifungal medicines, possibly reducing requirements for continuous drug monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Antifungal medicines that work against a wide range of severe infections caused by fungal priority pathogens are also needed. Children are particularly underserved with few clinical trials exploring paediatric dosing and age-appropriate formulations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO recommends investing in global surveillance, expanding financial incentives for drug discovery and development, funding basic research to help identify new and unexploited targets on fungi for medicines, and investigating treatments that work by enhancing patients’ immune responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Landscape report of diagnostics for fungal priority pathogens&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new  &lt;a href="https://iris.who.int/bitstream/handle/10665/380836/9789240105539-eng.pdf?sequence=1" data-sf-ec-immutable="" data-sf-marked=""&gt;diagnostics report&lt;/a&gt; shows that while commercially available tests exist for fungal priority pathogens, these rely on well-equipped laboratories and trained staff, which means that most people in in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) do not benefit from them. All countries, but particularly LMICs, need faster, more accurate, cheaper and easier testing for a broad range of fungal priority pathogens, including diagnostic tools that can be used at or near point-of-care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are many challenges with existing antifungal diagnostics; they work only for a limited range of fungi, are insufficiently accurate and take a long time to obtain results. Most of the tests are not well suited to primary and secondary health facilities as certain diagnostics require stable electricity supplies within suitable and equipped laboratories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health workers often have insufficient knowledge about fungal infections as well as the impact of fungi growing more resistant to treatments, resulting in limited ability to perform the testing needed to determine the appropriate treatment. WHO calls for strengthening the global response against invasive fungal diseases and antifungal resistance, and is also developing an implementation blueprint for the FPPL.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Or that boys who are referred for an autism diagnosis are more than &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00127-010-0294-z" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;twice&lt;/a&gt; as likely to be &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27940569/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;diagnosed&lt;/a&gt; as autistic as are girls who have been referred? But this shouldn’t be surprising, as ‘autism is a male problem’, right? Almost every autism-related website, research paper or journal article tells us that autism occurs much more frequently in boys, on average about four times as often, although ratios of 15:1 have sometimes been quoted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But suppose you were told that teachers, presented with identical vignettes of hypothetical children, are more &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32488964/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;likely&lt;/a&gt; to identify the child as autistic and in need of support if the child is called ‘Jack’ than if the child is called ‘Chloe’. That girls who are eventually diagnosed as autistic may wait several more years than boys to be &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34868805/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;assessed&lt;/a&gt;. That research shows that up to &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;80 per&lt;/span&gt; cent of autistic females may initially receive an inappropriate diagnosis – of social anxiety, or an eating disorder, or borderline personality disorder – before it is &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8870038/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;recognised&lt;/a&gt; that they are autistic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Importantly, these missing autistic women have found their voices. There is an online forum for late-diagnosed autistic women called the Late Discovered Club. And over the past decade, we’ve seen powerful personal testimonies from women who have been told autism was ‘just for men’. As one mother &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5993544/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;: ‘I kept asking to have her evaluated, but with her being a girl, it was even less likely that the paediatrician would refer us. I remember her saying that this is usually a boys’ thing and she is only a little different.’ Now the mountain is a bit easier to climb. All in all, the newly diagnosed women reveal a flaw in our understanding of what autism is, fundamentally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="ld-dropcap"&gt;W&lt;/span&gt;hy and how were autistic women sidelined? On one level, a fixed belief in the maleness of autism was so strong that some researchers &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36778135/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;hunted&lt;/a&gt; for a ‘female protective effect’ or &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12039606/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;blamed&lt;/a&gt; autism on an ‘extreme male brain’. On top of that, gendered socialisation has driven autistic women underground, causing them to disguise and internalise their struggles, and depriving them of the help they need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s start with bias in the research itself. A 2021 &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8436080/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;survey&lt;/a&gt; found that, in more than 1,400 studies investigating autistic brains, more than &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;30 per&lt;/span&gt; cent studied only males. My own 2024 &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11177439/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;survey&lt;/a&gt; reported that, of more than 100 studies on brain models of autism, nearly &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;70 per&lt;/span&gt; cent tested only males (or included just one or two females). Of more than 4,000 autistic participants in these studies, fewer than &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;10 per&lt;/span&gt; cent were female. Early versions of ‘big data sets’, where results were combined to increase their scale and scope, also highlight the male spotlight problem. The first &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/mp201378" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; from the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE-I), launched in 2012 and containing fMRI brain scan and other data from more than 539 diagnosed individuals, reported only on analyses of 360 males. Scrutiny of the full ABIDE cohort, moreover, revealed that 485 &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;(88 per&lt;/span&gt; cent) of the data sets were from males and &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;25 per&lt;/span&gt; cent of the sites invited to participate had excluded females ‘by design’. When it comes to finding an explanation for autism, maleness was the only place many researchers looked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How did this happen? ‘Science is a bit like the joke about the drunk who is looking under a lamppost for a key that he has lost on the other side of the street, because that’s where the light is,’ Noam Chomsky said back in 1993. And all along, autism researchers have suffered from this ‘streetlight’ effect, falsely shining their light only on males.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pullquote"&gt;The film &lt;em&gt;Rain Man&lt;/em&gt; provided an instant stereotype of autism that powerfully influenced public consciousness&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet being male has never been part of any autism diagnosis in the formal sense. In 1943, Leo Kanner, one of the so-called ‘fathers of autism’, &lt;a href="https://autismtruths.org/pdf/Autistic%20Disturbances%20of%20Affective%20Contact%20-%20Leo%20Kanner.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;described&lt;/a&gt; 11 cases of what he called ‘early infantile autism’ – eight were boys, three were girls. But as cases of ‘Kanner’s syndrome’ accumulated, epidemiological surveys reported far greater prevalence in boys. Hans Asperger, writing at the same time as Kanner, made more of the maleness of the condition, referring to ‘an extreme variant of male intelligence’. His seminal &lt;a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1992-97284-002" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; focused on just four boys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the profile of autism was broadened in the 1980s, diagnoses increased so much that there was talk of an epidemic. Yet female diagnoses remained low, with some reporting male-female ratios of just &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;6-7 per&lt;/span&gt; cent. The film &lt;em&gt;Rain Man&lt;/em&gt; (1988), with Dustin Hoffman depicting an autistic savant with both extraordinary skills and bewildering behavioural problems, provided an instant stereotype of autism that powerfully influenced public consciousness of the condition. The picture of autism just didn’t include girls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Typical of self-fulfilling prophecies, the male spotlight was switched on. Committees of diagnosticians painstakingly drew up checklists of commonly occurring signs and symptoms, generating lengthy profiles of ‘typical’ autistic behaviour. So-called ‘gold standard’ tests became near compulsory, not only for a universally accepted &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11055457/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;diagnosis&lt;/a&gt;, but also for inclusion in &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-1-4419-1698-3_894" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; studies. And embedded in these assessment schedules was a pre-existing, circular problem. They were all derived from close attention to individuals who had already been diagnosed, the majority of whom were male. Parents might be asked about unusually intense, nerdy ‘boy-type’ interests: historical facts, calendar dates, makes of cars. Clinicians were asked to note ‘loner’ type behaviour: lack of eye contact, failure to engage with others. No tick boxes for more socially normal ‘girl-type’ interests, such as Barbie dolls or ponies, or red flags for apparently normal social exchanges that might, on closer analysis, come across as slightly stilted, even scripted – all hallmarks of autistic girls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="ld-dropcap"&gt;I&lt;/span&gt;t was not until the beginning of the &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;21st century&lt;/span&gt; that a wave of powerful personal testimonies from late-diagnosed autistic women eventually raised awareness of this gap in the autism story. Autistic women had found their voice and made clear their omission was not just a matter of not being truly autistic. Books with telling titles such as &lt;em&gt;Odd Girl Out: An Autistic Woman in a Neurotypical World&lt;/em&gt; (2017) by Laura James, or &lt;em&gt;Autism in Heels: The Untold Story of a Female Life on the Spectrum&lt;/em&gt; (2018) by Jennifer Cook O’Toole revealed lifelong struggles as an outsider in a bewildering, highly socialised, world. There were stories of being ostracised, bullied and ‘othered’, of being terrified to be spotted as different, of struggling fruitlessly to understand the invisible rules of social engagement that allowed others to effortlessly understand each other, form friendship groups and be popular. And of constantly being rebuffed when seeking help – ‘girls don’t get autism’, ‘you can’t be autistic, you make eye contact’, and ‘you don’t look autistic’. Stories of parents being told their daughters were ‘just shy’, and their adult selves diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, or generalised anxiety disorder, or depression, or eating disorders – clinicians missing the fundamental diagnosis: autism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the wake of all this, research woke up as well, offering a much-needed &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4284309/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;framework&lt;/a&gt; for sex and gender differences. Scientists began proactively recruiting females into their research cohorts, rather than &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9804357/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;avoiding&lt;/a&gt; them altogether or statistically screening them out as part of the ‘noise’ in their data. They were pressed to design research protocols that would actively identify aspects of autism that varied between males and females. It had become clear that there was a need to move away from the ‘less than’ approach based on a male template, with autistic females described as ‘less’ socially impaired than autistic males, or ‘less’ likely to show repetitive behaviours or highly focused interests than males. Researchers needed to acknowledge that the male spotlight problem in autism research meant that, when it came to autistic females, they had been looking in the wrong place and asking the wrong questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pullquote"&gt;The camouflager might come across as extremely shy. The masquerader might come across as an extravert&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are autistic females really different? The most startling answer concerns the very nature of autism, supposedly signalled by intentional social avoidance and elective isolation. Once there was a closer look at females on the spectrum, a core aspect of &lt;em&gt;their &lt;/em&gt;social behaviour was found to be, conversely, an intense focus on finding ways to &lt;em&gt;ensure&lt;/em&gt; social contact with others, of obsessively trying to find ways to fit in, to belong. Part of this was a powerful fear of being spotted as different, resulting in a lifelong &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5509825/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;pattern&lt;/a&gt; of exhaustive and exhausting attempts at camouflage, of devising ways to blend in, of ‘putting on their best normal’. This drive might entail closely watching facial expressions or gestures, mimicking styles of speech, or even generating scripts by listening to others’ verbal social exchanges and repetitively rehearsing them in secret. Interviewed for my new book, one late-diagnosed woman explained:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;When I was a young child, I went through a phase where I was terrified of going first in any group activity (and would have meltdowns if I was asked to do so). In hindsight, I was terrified at the prospect of having to demonstrate a behaviour without first being able to observe and copy an ‘acceptable’ model of that behaviour.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their painful struggles might be disguised by creating many different identities or masks that they could hide behind, masks that they hoped would allow them to join the gang, to be accepted as part of a social group. The camouflager might come across as extremely shy or quiet, never putting themselves forward, the girl in the corner, quietly tucking herself away from view. The masquerader, on the other hand, might come across as an extravert, or the performer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘I had been the geek, the book lover, the dancer, the academic, the sports fanatic, the food guru, the makeup expert. I had been whoever I needed to be,’ explains Katy Wells in her book &lt;em&gt;The Painted Clown&lt;/em&gt; (2021). ‘Whichever role I had played, had depended on who I had been with. My personas changed so readily. My survival had depended on my ability to adapt, to perform… to mask.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the unfolding story of autism, these behaviours had never served as any kind of red flag, and so these camouflaging chameleons, as they have been dubbed, remained unnoticed and overlooked – hiding in plain sight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="ld-embed-block-wrapper"&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" src="https://youtube.com/embed/VJHa9xk16Hw" class="ld-embed-block"&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;figcaption class="ld-embed-caption"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly, these undercover activities did not lead to a happy and successful life, filled with contented membership of multiple social groups. Once clinicians and researchers started to pay attention, they &lt;a href="https://europepmc.org/article/med/32429817" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; that camouflaging behaviour was linked to high levels of depression and anxiety, suicidal ideation and self-harm. Personal testimonies describe years of mental health crises, associated with multiple misdiagnoses, inappropriate treatment and medication, an ‘alphabet soup of diagnoses’, until the pieces fell into place and an autism assessment was finally suggested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="ld-embed-block-wrapper"&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" src="https://youtube.com/embed/VzWorS8CdBM" class="ld-embed-block"&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;figcaption class="ld-embed-caption"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is now a move to identify camouflaging behaviour, to spot a possible disconnect between someone’s outward appearance of coping and their inner signs of struggle – or even, in a break with traditional autism assessments, of actually asking the people concerned if and how they struggled with social situations. Did they consciously try to maintain eye contact for a certain amount of time? Did they make a note of social gestures and other non-verbal cues and then practise them in front of a mirror? Camouflaging, by definition, is hard to spot, but at least now practitioners and &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30361940/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;researchers&lt;/a&gt; who might help are looking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="ld-dropcap"&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;he new insights have triggered a reset in autism neuroscience research. In the early part of this century, there was an understandable focus on investigating atypical activity in the &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18771388/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;so-called&lt;/a&gt; social brain. This is a network of brain structures underpinning those skills needed to connect with other people, such as understanding what they might be thinking, getting pleasure from successful social interchanges or finding ways to avoid situations that might lead to social rejection. The early conclusions from such research, when applied to autism, was that it was associated with atypically low levels of activity in the social brain showing, for example, reduced coding of social cues, or an underactive social reward system, with limited signs of affective responsivity to social experiences, negative or positive. This fitted neatly with the accepted view of autistic individuals as asocial loners. But, as we know, these conclusions were based on an era of ‘men-only’ studies. What happened when you started testing women too? Evidence of an &lt;em&gt;over&lt;/em&gt;-active social brain emerged, indicating high levels of anxious self-monitoring in social situations and powerful affective responses to social rejection. A very different picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This raises the idea that autistic women have been missed not because they generally show milder versions of the fundamental signs of autism, as found in males, or because they are better at hiding such signs, but because &lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt; autism presents in a different way. Far from avoiding social interaction, it appears they are powerfully driven to seek it. However, in common with the traditional view of autism, they appear to lack the necessary skill-set to successfully achieve such interaction. They have the motivation, but not the means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps a different type of autism, but autism nonetheless. Here, there is a powerful drive for social contact, so strong that elaborate (and ultimately damaging) camouflaging schema are developed to disguise any clues that these masqueraders might not fit into the social groups they seek to join. Such camouflaging behaviour makes the underlying struggles harder to spot, but they are there, and the clinical guidelines and diagnostic definitions need to be revised to reflect this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pullquote"&gt;The evidence is that the autism community itself is characterised by high levels of gender variance&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There has been a &lt;a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/blog/observations/is-it-time-to-give-up-on-a-single-diagnostic-label-for-autism/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;suggestion&lt;/a&gt; that we need to move away from the all-embracing concept characterised by the spectrum approach, and re-introduce the notion of subtypes, such as &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;Type 1&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;Type 2&lt;/span&gt; autism, along the lines of disorders such as diabetes. Should these distinctions be couched in terms of a male autism phenotype and a female autism phenotype, given that most of the ‘Kanners’ are males and most of the ‘chameleons’ are female?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Probably not. There are some females who present with Kanner-type autism, as well as males who present with camouflaging behaviours. We should avoid repeating past mistakes arising from the inaccurate and simplistic grouping of so many aspects of human brains and behaviour into allegedly distinct ‘male’ and ‘female’ categories, especially in the face of &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24619651/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;evidence&lt;/a&gt; that the autism community itself is characterised by high levels of gender variance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some have suggested that chameleon-type autism is so different, it does not really fit on the spectrum at all. But that overlooks the core defining feature of autism, a distinctive difficulty with the fundamental human drive to be social, involved with the same brain networks. This can be harnessed as both a theoretical and an applied framework by attempts to understand, and ameliorate if necessary, the many manifestations of autism. Instead of finding a different home for an emerging group who don’t fit the traditional pattern, we must widen our understanding of autism yet again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps one of the most important lessons is that this story would not have emerged so effectively if autistic women had not found their voices, and if insightful autism &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9645671/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;researchers&lt;/a&gt; had not listened to them. The importance of formally including and understanding ‘lived experience’ in all aspects of autism research is being acknowledged; the autism community is now leading this addition of participatory research when investigating atypical behaviour. Autistic individuals are being included as partners in all aspects of the research process, from design and recruitment through to interpretation and discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Incorporating this unique type of expertise could bring equal benefits to other areas of atypical behaviour. Evidence of male bias in autism diagnosis raises a general question about the reliability of psychiatric categories as a whole. The fifth edition of the American Psychiatric Association’s&lt;em&gt; Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders &lt;/em&gt;(2013) is several inches thick and runs to approximately 1,000 pages; psychiatric diagnosis is not an exact, unbiased science. This matters. The labels generated by consulting such tomes have real-life consequences for ensuring access to support and understanding. They also have very significant consequences both for research programmes and the development of therapeutic practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is beginning to emerge, for &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11920-017-0791-9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;example&lt;/a&gt;, that significant numbers of patients with eating disorders are autistic, and that they form a group that is qualitatively and quantitatively different from eating-disordered patients who are not autistic. So, understanding this overlap, and being able to correctly identify the characteristics of the two groups, should be better enabled by the diagnostic process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, no matter what the presentation, an eventual diagnosis of autism appears to have a powerfully positive impact on the lives and self-image of late-diagnosed females. A common theme in many personal testimonies is the relief at ‘finally finding my tribe’, with exclamations that ‘my life finally made sense’ or ‘I’m not a broken neurotypical. I’m a healthy autistic me!’ So, however flawed the definition of autism currently is, it represents a real and recognisable community to a group for whom ‘belonging’ is the prime driver of their lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="ld-dropcap"&gt;W&lt;/span&gt;hat does the discovery of autism’s missing women tell us about wider issues of gendered socialisation and its uneven impact on females and males? ‘Many of the moments when my autism caused problems, or at least marked me out as different, were those moments when I had come up against some unspoken law about how a girl or woman should be, and failed to meet it,’ wrote Joanne Limburg in &lt;em&gt;Letters to My Weird Sisters&lt;/em&gt; (2021).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In trying to understand the ‘why’ of camouflaging, we need to discover what forces have driven a considerable number of autistic individuals, many of them women, to spend their developing years struggling to hide their autism. Why should a sub-set of the autistic population be apparently compelled to do everything they can to be part of a social group, even though their efforts result in physical and mental exhaustion and distress, and even render them vulnerable to abusive and damaging relationships?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is it relevant that most of these individuals are female? Are we looking at the playing out of a biological &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7777651/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;script&lt;/a&gt;, genetically and hormonally determined, that drives females more powerfully than males to prioritise social group membership or ‘belongingness’ above many other aspects of psychological wellbeing? Or are we looking at the impact of a culturally determined social training &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21803468/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;regime&lt;/a&gt;, encouraging low-profile compliance and conformity, careful camouflaging of any unusual traits, or compulsive internalising of any socially disruptive traits? Or are these alternatives inextricably entangled? As is often the case when studying human behaviour, sometimes it is the exceptions that can offer insights into so-called neurotypical rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is an ironic footnote here. Some critics of neuroscience research into gender differences express &lt;a href="https://scholar.harvard.edu/srichard/publications/autism-biomedical-platform-sex-difference-research" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;concern&lt;/a&gt; that focusing solely on biological sex as the source of such differences might support negative sexist stereotyping. On the other side of the coin, the alleged ‘maleness’ of autism is often cited as proof that there are indeed irrefutable (and unchallengeable) differences between the brains of women and the brains of men, so biological sex must be the source of such differences. The first group diminishes the concept of sex differences in the brain. The second group embraces the maleness of a brain-based condition such as autism as proof that the ‘female brain’ and the ‘male brain’ are real. At the nexus of these debates is autism’s male spotlight, which has cast a long shadow on our culture and consumed so much light we’ve been unable to fully focus on the whole picture of autism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pullquote"&gt;Their autism may itself be disguised by other conditions such as self-harm or eating disorders&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, finally, the ‘lost girls’ thread goes back further than we thought. It has emerged that the so-called fathers of autism were actually trumped by a Russian female psychiatrist, Grunya Sukhareva, who published finely detailed descriptions of autistic children in the 1920s. She quite explicitly drew comparisons between boys with autism and girls with autism. Her work was broadly overlooked until just &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00787-021-01875-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;two years ago&lt;/a&gt;. Yet another ‘missing woman’!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We now know that autistic women have been missing from autism headcounts because no-one was looking for them (the male spotlight problem) and because they were in disguise (the camouflaging problem). What next? How can we ensure that no-one goes missing again, and help these newer members of the autism community when they realise who &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;they are?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We must challenge the gatekeepers, such as the teachers who believe ‘only boys have autism’, the clinicians who think ‘girls don’t get autism’, the diagnosticians who set up boy-based templates for defining autistic behaviour, the researchers who assume that their men-only findings will suffice as explanations for autism as a whole. We must raise awareness that ‘autism is not just for males anymore’ and that the ‘white, nerdy, male’ stereotypes of autism (both professional and popular) are just a subtype of a much larger group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Autism professionals and support groups need to be aware that the lived experiences of chameleon-type autists are different from those of the Kanner group. Their obsessive need to belong at any cost makes them especially vulnerable to the type of bullying that is based on social ostracism and to abusive relationships. Their autism may itself be disguised by other conditions such as self-harm or eating disorders, which clinicians should be aware of. Therapeutic support must be geared to help the camouflagers and masqueraders, &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;as well.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the psychologist Damian Milton has &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09687599.2012.710008" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;identified&lt;/a&gt; a double empathy problem, the mutual misunderstanding between autistic and neurotypical individuals. The bewilderment experienced by autistic individuals in the social world of neurotypicals is matched by neurotypical lack of awareness of what it is like to experience the world so differently and how hard it can be to understand the social rules of engagement that govern successful and rewarding interactions with each other. Efforts to increase neurotypical understanding of autism now need to embrace autistic sisters as well as brothers for a broader, more nuanced view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have explored the many reasons why girls and women have been missing in the history of autism, and why it matters. We have found our way behind their masks and spotted their differently different autistic behaviour. We have finally welcomed them into our scanners and mapped their differently different brains. Hopefully, we can now make the world a better place for them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Aeon</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Apr 2025 10:00:23 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiggFBVV95cUxPdW15b2hISFk1OUo5dllubm1HdDVFQ3A4UHN0UzFRV0haMzJsd1BfTmZqQTFjdG15NF83LXFZclRCZ1RPMVpmYXN3eXVnZGV6M21BUVJpVEVfT2s1LUhyWF9PV3lwWWZ0YnJoUHAzaUprNjBXTGVOaTBBYzNXRVlXa1Vn</guid></item><item><title>Yes, CDC calls the fungus an ‘urgent’ threat.

It is more likely to impact the elderly and people who already are ill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have certainly seen it,” said Wu, chief epidemiologist and system director for infectious diseases at &lt;a href="https://hartfordhealthcare.org/"&gt;Hartford HealthCare&lt;/a&gt;, noting that an infection with the fungus “is very dangerous.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2023/p0320-cauris.html"&gt;The Los Angeles Times reported last week that the Georgia Department of Public Health recently reported a surge in cases in health care facilities, and a recent study found an alarming rate of spread in Florida hospitals.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="tqegJJLPXr"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.courant.com/2025/03/27/candida-auris-fungus-cdc/"&gt;Deadly, drug-resistant fungus CDC calls ‘urgent threat’ is spreading in hospitals&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, as stories circulate about the potentially deadly fungus spread in hospitals and senior care facilities across the country, Wu said it is important that people understand that this organism is present in many places and it is not making people sick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When it causes infection, that is when we start to worry,” Wu said. If it’s spread in a hospital setting or nursing home, that would be a problem, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The biggest concern is that it is transmissible and can develop resistance to anti-fungal medication very quickly,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But hospitals in Connecticut are well aware of this, watch for signs of infections in patients and are in regular contact with the &lt;a href="https://portal.ct.gov/dph/epidemiology-and-emerging-infections/candida_auris"&gt;state Department of Health,&lt;/a&gt; which also is knowledgeable and prepared, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The DPH notes that it collaborates with the &lt;a href="https://portal.ct.gov/dph/laboratory/laboratory-home/katherine-a-kelley-state-public-health-laboratory"&gt;Katherine A. Kelley State Public Health Laboratory&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/antimicrobial-resistance-laboratory-networks/php/about/domestic.html"&gt;CDC Antimicrobial Resistance Laboratory Networ&lt;/a&gt;k to “provide Connecticut health care facilities with rapid and accurate identification of Candida auris and appropriate infection control.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I will give credit to the state,” Wu said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wu, as does the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/candida-auris/tracking-c-auris/index.html?2023=All%20Years"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;, said hospitals and nursing homes use early case detection techniques, patient screening, and strict compliance with infection prevention and control practices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are prepared for it,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The state Department of Health&lt;a href="https://www.courant.com/2019/04/09/health-officials-connecticut-patient-with-dangerous-drug-resistant-fungus-is-better/"&gt; investigated Connecticut’s first case of Candida auris in June 2017&lt;/a&gt; in an acute care hospital. The person who contracted it may have picked it up in another county, &lt;a href="https://www.courant.com/2019/04/09/health-officials-connecticut-patient-with-dangerous-drug-resistant-fungus-is-better/"&gt;health department officials said in 2019. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wu said hospitals are able to identify people who may be at risk by asking questions about travel and length of travel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We get alerted and look for it,” he said, and if needed, patients can be placed in isolation while tests are done. “We try to be preventative.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wu said candida auris can be on surfaces and can be spread through fecal matter, but is not spread in an airborne way. Sanitation is crucial, he said, and part of this is “good hand hygiene.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC noted that candida auris can cause “infection in different parts of the body like the blood, wounds, and ears” and that symptoms “depend on the location and severity of infection. Symptoms may be similar to symptoms of infections caused by bacteria like fever or chills,” but there is “not a common set of symptoms specific for C. auris infections.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wu said he is concerned about cuts at the federal level when it comes to agencies dealing with health, as, if there is a “lack of flow of information we are going to be handcuffed.”  He said even the state DPH gets a lot of information from the federal level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="TYo88JM6LX"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.courant.com/2025/03/13/five-years-later-pandemic-response-fears-return/"&gt;Five years ago, COVID gripped the world in fear. Now scientists, doctors warn Trump’s policies are weakening public health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That flow of information is very important,” Wu said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wu has previously expressed concern about the spread of misinformation when it comes to health care issues,&lt;a href="https://www.courant.com/2025/03/28/texas-measles-outbreak-jumps-to-400-cases-including-more-cases-in-northeast-texas/"&gt; including about vaccinations.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wu said the same concern applies to the withdrawal of the United States from the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt;, “as then we are not getting information.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/withdrawing-the-united-states-from-the-worldhealth-organization/"&gt;White House order about the WHO withdrawal&lt;/a&gt; says the Secretary of State and the director of the Office of Management and Budget must “identify credible and transparent United States and international partners to assume necessary activities previously undertaken by the WHO.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wu said he does not think Connecticut residents should be alarmed about the candida fungus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They should not be fearful, but they should be very respectful,” he said, noting again the importance of good hygiene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wu has recently noted his concern about the recent &lt;a href="https://www.courant.com/2025/03/14/measles-cases/"&gt;measles&lt;/a&gt; cases and death that have occurred in the nation, which he said were preventable. He added that he sees mistrust in science and &lt;a href="https://www.courant.com/2025/03/14/rfk-jr-s-first-month-as-health-secretary-touting-french-fries-and-casting-doubts-on-vaccines/"&gt;mistrust in vaccines&lt;/a&gt;, “is like driving without a seatbelt,” and he supports vaccinations.&lt;/p&gt;

And constant soreness is not something to strive for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“A common misconception is that soreness means a workout was effective,” said Cedric Bryant, an exercise physiologist and the president and chief executive of the American Council on Exercise. “While some soreness is normal, it is not a requirement for muscle growth.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="css-1u37br4 eoo0vm40" id="link-3a8eefd"&gt;What Sore Muscles Mean&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;When your muscles feel sore a day or two after exercise, it’s typically because of microscopic tears in your muscle fibers that can &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/19/well/move/inflammation-exercise.html" title=""&gt;lead to inflammation&lt;/a&gt; and pain, said Laura Richardson, an exercise physiologist at the University of Michigan School of Kinesiology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;As your muscles repair during the days afterward, the pain dissipates, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Muscles also often grow stronger after soreness, but that discomfort is certainly not required for muscle growth, Dr. Bryant added. Many athletes do not get sore after workouts, even when they are continuing to improve their fitness and build muscle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“This does not mean the workout was ineffective,” Dr. Bryant said. It is usually a sign that their muscles have adapted to a regular training routine and have become “more efficient at handling the workload,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-1336jj"&gt;&lt;div class="css-121kum4"&gt;&lt;p class="css-171quhb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-asuuk5"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-7axq9l" data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true" class="css-1b5b8u1"&gt;&lt;path fill="currentColor" fill-rule="evenodd" d="M2.5 12a9.5 9.5 0 1 1 19 0 9.5 9.5 0 0 1-19 0Zm8.5 1.75v-7.5h2v7.5h-2Zm0 2v2h2v-2h-2Z" clip-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;div data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript-message" class="css-6yo1no"&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;We are having trouble retrieving the article content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dv1kvn" id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

          &lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Putting underpants on with bare feet could put millions at risk of a gruesome and embarrassing groin infection, a top doctor has warned. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;So-called 'crotch rot' is caused by the fungus, tinea corporis, commonly known as ringworm, and appears as scaly, itchy and sometimes red skin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And according to Dr Samuel Choudhury, a GP who specialises in skincare, the infection often spreads to the genital area via the feet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In a video shared to his 450,000 &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/tiktok/index.html" id="mol-e41f1720-0ece-11f0-8576-2bac6e02ea97"&gt;TikTok&lt;/a&gt; followers Dr Choudhury warned that foot ringworm is incredibly common — affecting around 70 per cent of people 'at least once in their life'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And studies show that around 20 per cent will, at some point, suffer the same infection in the groin area. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Choudhury explained that underwear comes into contact with the fungal spores on the feet, and carries them up to the groin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'So this is what you need to do to avoid jock itch [crotch infection],' he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Not wearing underwear is not the solution, but wearing your socks first is. It acts as a barrier so you contain the infection.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He added that those who suffer persistent jock itch should 'think about' the state of their feet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;a target="_self" href="/news/nhs/index.html" id="mol-1fa2a840-0ed2-11f0-8576-2bac6e02ea97" class=""&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt; guidance echoes Dr Choudhury's warnings, advising that fungal groin infeections are usually caused by reinfection from other parts of the body, like hands or feet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Studies have shown that young men are the most likely to suffer, as well as those who work in &lt;span&gt;high temperature environments, wear tight fitting clothing or are obese.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These fungi naturally live on your skin and typically don't cause problems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, wearing sweat-soaked clothes after exercising can lead to prolonged exposure to moisture, allowing the fungi to multiply quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Jock itch, sometimes referred to as 'crotch rot' is contagious for as long as the fungal spores are living on the skin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These spores can even live on surfaces like bedding and towels for over a year if they aren't washed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Advice to treat the infection includes washing affected skin areas daily, making sure to dry thoroughly as well as avoiding scratching and washing clothes and bedding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If symptoms don't improve with home treatments, experts advise contacting the doctor for advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors will typically prescribe an anti- fungal cream such as hydrocortisone and/or an oral anti-fungal if the infection gets worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lower back pain is a global epidemic with 619 million people suffering from this condition worldwide, according to an &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanrhe/article/PIIS2665-9913(23)00133-9/fulltext" data-url="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanrhe/article/PIIS2665-9913(23)00133-9/fulltext" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; published in &lt;em&gt;The Lancet Rheumatology&lt;/em&gt; journal.

"Personally, I prefer a standing forward fold because that is what feels best in my body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I feel that a forward fold offers a complete reset of my spine, and also helps to relax my neck and shoulders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“After a long day of sitting, and working at my desk, when I enter a forward fold, I feel relief through my backside body. I can feel the space between my vertebrae become more open."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-to-do-the-movement"&gt;&lt;span&gt;How to do the movement &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wood recommends completing three to five repetitions of standing forward fold and holding the stretch for 30 seconds. The instructor advises doing the move when you wake up, after you’ve finished work, and before bed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You can do this every day of the week," Wood explains. "There is no rule limiting how many forward folds one does, just be mindful with movement and breath."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-58XJRzaVDUXDpMv3LRscG5" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-58XJRzaVDUXDpMv3LRscG5 slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Start your week with achievable workout ideas, health tips and wellbeing advice in your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Repetitions:&lt;/strong&gt; 3-5 &lt;strong&gt;Time:&lt;/strong&gt; 30 seconds&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stand in a mountain pose with your feet hip-width apart, arms by your side and your &lt;a href="https://www.fitandwell.com/how-to/how-to-engage-your-core" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.fitandwell.com/how-to/how-to-engage-your-core"&gt;core engaged&lt;/a&gt;. Ground down through your feet to lengthen your spine.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Inhale and raise your arms overhead.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Exhale, fold forward by hinging at the hips. Maintain a small bend your knees and lead the movement with your chest.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Relax your hands and head towards the ground.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Draw your navel in and up and engage your quads (front thigh muscles) and hip flexors (at the top of your legs).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Move deeper into the stretch with every breath. Inhale, find length in your spine, exhale and fold deeper.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Modifications: &lt;/strong&gt;If your hands don’t reach the ground, place your hands on yoga blocks, or on your shins or hips. You may wish to bend your knees and bring your hands to your thighs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-the-benefits-of-doing-standing-forward-fold"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The benefits of doing standing forward fold&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Standing forward fold, or Uttanasana as it’s known in Sanskrit, is one of the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fitandwell.com/how-to/yoga-stretches-for-beginners" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.fitandwell.com/how-to/yoga-stretches-for-beginners"&gt;best yoga poses for beginners&lt;/a&gt; for flexibility. But that’s not the only benefit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Anytime you are folding forward in a yoga pose, there is a calming effect on the nervous system," Wood explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A standing forward fold also strengthens the thighs and knees, while stretching the&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;hamstrings, calves, hips, glutes, shoulders, and soles of feet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Folding forward also helps improve digestion. When the belly is folding over the thighs there&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;is gentle stimulation to the digestive system."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wood says forward fold can also help the spine stay strong and supple, supporting better posture.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;A new study has identified a protein that appears to be essential for hair growth and hair follicle protection. Called MCL‑1, it could potentially be targeted by treatments for certain &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-hair-loss-drug-approved-restores-80-of-hair-loss-in-some-alopecia-patients"&gt;kinds of baldness such as alopecia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Led by a team from the Duke‑NUS Medical School in Singapore and the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research in Australia, researchers found that when MCL-1 production was blocked in mice, the animals lost their hair later in life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hair follicles go through cycles of quiescence and growth, with MCL-1 playing a critical role in the latter phase. The protein doesn't seem to affect the resting phase or the initial development of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hair_follicle"&gt;hair follicles&lt;/a&gt;, however.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_156731" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-156731" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/HairChart.jpg" alt="Hair chart" class="wp-image-156731 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/HairChart.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/HairChart-611x415.jpg 611w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/HairChart-600x407.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-156731" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers studied the impact of MCL-1 on hair follicles in mice. (Chin et al., &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Acute MCL‑1 deletion rapidly depletes activated hair follicle  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/stem-cells" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73034" data-postid="156728" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;stem cells&lt;/a&gt; and completely blocks depilation‑induced hair regeneration in adult mice, while quiescent hair follicle stem cells remain unaffected," &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58150-5"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers in their published paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/cell-and-developmental-biology/articles/10.3389/fcell.2021.704547/full"&gt;already known&lt;/a&gt; that MCL-1 played an important role in protecting a number of different kinds of tissue from apoptosis; the programmed death of redundant or damaged cells to keep the body functioning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to hair, MCL-1 prevents follicle stem cells from being stressed and damaged as they 'reawaken' from rest. Without MCL-1 to protect them, these cells stop functioning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team was also able to reveal new details on MCL-1's function, identifying ways it suppresses another protein called BAK and how MCL-1 is regulated by a signaling pathway called ERBB. These details could be useful in developing new methods of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-surprise-hair-loss-breakthrough-sugar-gel-triggers-robust-regrowth"&gt;hair loss treatments&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"These findings suggest that ERBB signaling modulates MCL‑1 expression through translational control mechanisms, particularly during periods of heightened apoptosis and regression in the hair cycle," the researchers &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58150-5"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study was based solely on mice, so while there's good reason to think the same processes are happening on the top of our own heads, the findings will need to be replicated in clinical research on humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's also worth bearing in mind that there are several &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/why-hair-doesn-t-grow-on-wounded-skin-and-how-it-might-help-hair-loss-treatments"&gt;different kinds of alopecia&lt;/a&gt;, all with a variety of contributing causes: if treatments are one day developed that focus on boosting MCL-1, they're not going to work for all types of hair loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those limitations aside, this one protein's handiwork is a significant revelation concerning hair follicles' ability to grow hair. The findings could also inform future studies into other processes affected by MCL-1, including &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/oncology/articles/10.3389/fonc.2023.1226289/full"&gt;cancer cell death&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This study advances our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying hair follicle regeneration and offers new insights into how  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/stem-cells" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73034" data-postid="156728" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;stem cell&lt;/a&gt; survival and tissue regeneration are orchestrated," &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58150-5"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"These findings may have broader implications for controlling the survival of stem and progenitor cells in tissue regeneration and  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="156728" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; expansion."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58150-5"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Complications can include pneumonia and encephalitis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyone who was exposed and starts to develop symptoms should immediately call their doctor, an urgent care center or emergency department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles cases in the United States this year already have surpassed 2024 numbers, with outbreaks reported in at least five states. A &lt;a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2025/02/26/measles-outbreak-texas-death/"&gt;child in Texas died from measles&lt;/a&gt; in February, marking the first pediatric death since 2003. The last adult death from measles in the U.S. was in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The outbreak in Texas &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-outbreak-texas-new-mexico-vaccine-rfk-d5444b3397ac7c4034e63becc219aa33"&gt;has grown to 400 cases&lt;/a&gt;. Other states with outbreaks — defined as three or more cases — include New Mexico, Kansas, Ohio and Oklahoma. Since February, two unvaccinated people have died from measles-related causes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new outbreaks confirm health experts’ fears that the virus will take hold in other U.S. communities with low vaccination rates and that the spread could stretch on for a year. The World Health Organization said this week cases in Mexico are linked to the Texas outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles is both extremely contagious and highly preventable with a vaccine, Colorado state epidemiologist Dr. Rachel Herlihy said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The MMR vaccine provides excellent protection and helps prevent outbreaks like the one we are seeing globally,” she said. “We urge Coloradans to review their vaccination status and take steps to protect themselves, their families and their communities.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vaccine may also prevent infection if given within 72 hours of being exposed, according to state officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Associated Press contributed to this report.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://myaccount.denverpost.com/dp/preference"&gt;Sign up for our weekly newsletter to get health news sent straight to your inbox.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Experts say many of the estimated million people living with this condition are "ghosts in the system", whose lives are being torn apart by poorly managed extreme suicidal lows or manic, erratic highs.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Emma was diagnosed with bipolar disorder in her early 30s, after experiencing a mental health crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;When she was 32 weeks pregnant, her grandmother died unexpectedly, sending her into a "deep low". "I felt awful, but the perinatal team wouldn't take me on," she says. "They said my symptoms weren't that serious." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;When Emma gave birth, the extreme lows of her pregnancy were replaced by an unexpected high. She felt amazing in the days after her baby was born - but she didn't sleep and her behaviour became increasingly erratic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;A few weeks later, her mood flipped again. When her baby was three weeks old, Emma took an overdose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;It took a week in hospital for her liver function to return. But even after that, she was in and out of hospital for a year before finally being diagnosed with bipolar disorder, and medicated correctly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"If I had the correct care, and been listened to during my pregnancy or even earlier, I could have avoided taking that overdose - 100%," she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;It wasn't Emma's first experience of poor mental health - she'd spent her teens seeing doctors and receiving different antidepressants. No one had ever suggested she might have bipolar disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 bdPeAJ"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-8353772e-0 iUqqeb"&gt;Emma was diagnosed with bipolar disorder in her early 30s, after experiencing a mental health crisis&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Experts have told the BBC how most people living with bipolar disorder in the UK are "undertreated, undiagnosed and left to try and survive in a system that has failed them".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The majority who, like Emma, are eventually diagnosed with bipolar disorder, are incorrectly prescribed antidepressants initially, which makes their symptoms worse rather than better. Experts also say there is a lack of continuity of care from GPs through to psychiatrists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Their warning comes as data exclusively shared with the BBC suggests the cost of the condition in the UK is now an estimated £9.6bn a year. That equates to more than £300 per taxpayer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;This breakdown includes NHS costs, such as GP services, psychiatrist appointments and visits to A&amp;amp;E and hospital admissions. It also includes economic costs, such as lost days at work and the need for family and friends to take time off to provide informal care. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;But it does not include welfare payments for those out of work, or costs for police services dealing with people in crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eeiVGB"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-518485e5-0 DkKTF"&gt;Highly treatable&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"This nearly £10bn figure is actually quite conservative," says Prof Judit Simon, from the Medical University of Vienna, who worked with the BBC to generate the number.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"If this is a government that really wants to try and bring down the welfare bill, then bipolar disorder should be its absolute priority, the target disorder to actually move the dial."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The data suggests up to 372,000 people with bipolar disorder are currently out of work and claiming benefits in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;For a treatable disease, this number could be slashed if the correct care was on offer, say experts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Prof Guy Goodwin, emeritus professor of psychiatry at University of Oxford, says: "If you want to cut the costs of a disease, you need to reduce hospital admissions and emergency care. If you don't focus on cutting hospital admissions then you waste money."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;According to the Royal College of Psychiatrists (RCP), bipolar disorder is a manageable condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Dr Trudi Seneviratne, registrar at the RCP and a commissioner on the Bipolar Commission, says it is "completely treatable" with a combination of medication, talking therapies and lifestyle factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"But there are many, many people who are suffering in silence with lower levels of symptoms because there isn't a good clinical care pathway for them in the UK."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;She says if care for bipolar disorder was fit for purpose, it would cut "the cost to society" as well as reducing "the human suffering this disease unnecessarily causes".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;It is this sense of waste - with people who could be leading a good life but aren't - that angers experts most, who say it is a neglected diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Prof Allan Young, from Imperial College, says: "Bipolar is common, complex and costly - but it is so often unrecognised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"People know it is there but somehow people are just not being cared for correctly."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 bdPeAJ"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-8353772e-0 iUqqeb"&gt;Rosie had been dealing with mental health issues since childhood, but it was only after being in crisis that her condition was recognised.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;This lack of correct care is what Rosie says resulted in her being arrested at Stansted Airport for jumping the security barriers during a manic episode in her early 20s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"I was utterly delusional," she says. Following her arrest, Rosie was taken to A&amp;amp;E and locked in a room. She waited there for more than 12 hours while a bed at a specialist mental health unit was found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Like Emma, Rosie had been dealing with mental health issues since childhood, but it was only after being in crisis that her condition was recognised. This particular period of psychotic mania had been triggered by a relationship breakdown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;She was sectioned and hospitalised for three months, after which she finally began finding a combination of medications that worked for her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Now 29, Rosie says she still has high and low periods, but adds that she is far more stable and is able to work part time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"I was failed," she says. "I'm told my symptoms were a textbook case for bipolar lows and highs – energetic, grandiose language, erratic – but no one even considered this diagnosis for me until I was sectioned."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eeiVGB"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-518485e5-0 DkKTF"&gt;Costs could be halved &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The Maudsley Hospital, in South London, has an intensive specialist care programme for its sickest, most regularly relapsing bipolar patients. The service aims to try and stop patients hitting crisis point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Similar to services offered in other European nations, the hospital provides group sessions for patients and their families. The classes help patients to understand when an episode might be starting and then contact the service once they spot early warning signs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;They can then attend an outpatient clinic and adjust medications. The relatively cheap programme has seen re-admission rates to hospital fall by 80% as intervention takes place before a crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Prof Young says costs associated with bipolar disorder could be halved with more specialist care programmes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"Undoubtedly, specialist treatment could contribute to getting lots of people back into work. And we know that work is very good for helping people recover from episodes of mental ill health."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;However, many experts say patients still face a postcode lottery about whether they can see a psychiatrist at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Carolyn Chew-Graham, a GP and professor of general practice research at Keele University, says those who are acutely unwell will be picked up quickly by crisis teams but those with "less florid manic episodes" can miss out on referral to specialists for diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"There's a high threshold of referral," Prof Chew Graham says. "People really have to be quite unwell before they are seen in specialist services". She says GPs may be reluctant to refer patients - even if they strongly suspect they have bipolar disorder - for fear they will be rejected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"GPs may think I won't even consider bipolar because if I mention it to the patient and then I can't get them seen, I am a bit stuck".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Prof Young says bipolar patients need long-term specialist care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"But that's the frustration here - even though there is strong evidence that specialist care improves the outcomes for the patient, and costs the state less, there are still so few bipolar specialist facilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"It's a tragedy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;An NHS spokesperson said bipolar disorder could often take time to diagnose because it affected everyone differently and the symptoms were similar to other mental health conditions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"NHS staff are working incredibly hard to get people diagnosed and reduce waiting times for care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"Staff are treating a million more people than they were six years ago and are working to transform services alongside this demand – this includes strengthening community services, trialling new 24/7 open access mental health centres and rolling out mental health crisis lines."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;If anything in this article makes you concerned please consult your GP. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;&lt;i id="if-you've-been-affected-by-the-issues-in-this-story,-help-and-support-is-available-via" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt;If you've been affected by the issues in this story, help and support is available via &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/actionline/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;&lt;i id="bbc-action-line." class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt;BBC Action Line.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="embed-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 jVHuOl"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Apr 2025 01:18:44 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWkFVX3lxTE9IdWd3ajQ4SHhobHNzNGVKTF8tUGNia2FWRTJTZzR3MWpiZlVEbnRPdUd0OXFkRE14MHQ3blRJM3hWcXBMTGgwWGdPU1VGeTFVVU1xVjhBaEFHUdIBX0FVX3lxTE5pRjF4WnNFSkI4akpJQWFvSGpoYmloRWticzlfamFiS2UxV3l4MS1WTGdXSl93bmg0STh2N0xLdU5oaXNHZ0E1S0FMSnd1XzlFdFVLb3UwSDExNmlqazNj</guid></item><item><title>African Man Working In The U.S. Apologizes To Americans He Made Fun Of For Taking Mental Health Days - YourTango</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipAFBVV95cUxPTzZybHpHZTdsNzFfUkpINUpTWjhqSEhua0w1V3JmQUxJb0FIaGhFU1FUcnM5Q2hCVkNfcG96R05ISFZ5aVdwWlZXcVFYZklWZjZySHdlVnlMTV9fSUZHaUh2RnlmbGF1d1BWUTlrZUlsd3J5VEJsYUQzNGx6SUU5cGk2ZkhWUkt1R1owdW5aeW9xTkYyZk5sdndKZTRBblhoU1dJLQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Corporate America is exhausting, and burnout is incredibly common. In fact, &lt;a href="https://moodle.com/us/news/ai-for-workplace-training-in-america/" rel="nofollow"&gt;2025 research from Moodle&lt;/a&gt; found that 66% of American employees are experiencing burnout, which is exactly why mental health days are so prevalent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet it seems that those outside of this country don't quite understand the need for mental health days. One African man admitted that he fell into that camp. He didn't get why Americans needed to take time away from work to maintain their mental health — until he began working in the U.S. himself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The African man working in the U.S. apologized to Americans he made fun of for taking mental health days.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a heartfelt admission, the Zambian man, &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@bigsam.14_two" rel="nofollow"&gt;known online as "Big Sam,"&lt;/a&gt; apologized to Americans he previously mocked for taking mental health days. He confessed that he used to think Americans complained a lot, but since moving to America and working in the country, he gained a new understanding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I’ve been asking for some mental health days off," Sam said, laughing. "Like, I need some mental health time off. They were not lying."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/self/burnout-red-flags-job-consuming-life"&gt;4 Burnout Red Flags Your Job Is Dangerously Consuming Your Whole Life&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;America's 'hustle culture' is often exhausting. &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sam quickly discovered that the constant "hustle culture" that American society promotes is unsustainable. Many corporate environments are fast-paced and come with high, often unreasonable, expectations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is also a competitive culture prominent in many U.S. workplaces. Employees may find themselves vying for promotions, raises, or opportunities to stand out. This competitive environment can drive high performance, but it also leads to stress and poor mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.osha.gov/workplace-stress" rel="nofollow"&gt;The Occupational Safety and Health Administration reports&lt;/a&gt; that approximately 83% of U.S. workers suffer from work-related stress, with 54% claiming that work stress affects their home life. Moreover, workplace stress has been reported to cause 120,000 deaths in the U.S. each year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="player-wrapper-outer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/career/employees-under-30-lose-one-day-work-week-due-mental-health-issues"&gt;Prolonged stress and untreated mental health problems&lt;/a&gt; can lead to serious physical health issues, including high blood pressure, heart disease, and sleep disorders. By taking time for mental health, employees can avoid these long-term health complications, leading to better overall well-being. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/self/asian-immigrant-defends-americans-stereotype-lazy"&gt;Asian Immigrant In The U.S. Defends Americans From The Stereotype That They Have Life On ‘Easy Mode’ — ‘Americans Are Not Lazy’&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;When done correctly, mental health days can be incredibly beneficial.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;By taking time off in the form of a mental health day, you give your body a chance to recover, re-energize, and restore mental clarity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/recharge-with-planned-mental-health-day" rel="nofollow"&gt;Writing for the Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt;, Angela Theisen, L.C.S.W., discussed mental health days, defining them as "limited time away from your usual responsibilities with the intention of recharging and rejuvenating your mental health."

"Be intentional about the activities you do during a mental health day to get the full benefits and improve your health."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She suggested unplugging from social media, spending time outside, getting active, and doing something creative. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/career/career-expert-shares-types-people-unlikely-make-it-corporate"&gt;Career Expert Shares The 4 Types Of People Who Are Unlikely To 'Make It' In A Corporate Environment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sylvia Ojeda is an author who has over a decade of experience writing novels and screenplays.

&lt;p&gt;A groundbreaking male birth control pill is advancing through clinical trials, marking a major step toward expanding contraceptive options. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers from the University of Minnesota College of Pharmacy, in collaboration with Columbia University and YourChoice Therapeutics, have developed YCT-529—a hormone-free oral contraceptive designed for men.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Unlike traditional contraceptives that rely on hormonal changes, YCT-529 works by inhibiting sperm production. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="body-content true    body-medium-medium  t-text-text-secondary"&gt;&lt;div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The drug has already completed its first phase of human clinical trials and is now undergoing further safety and efficacy testing. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If approved, it could provide an alternative to the limited birth control options like condoms and vasectomies currently available to men. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-breakthrough-findings-from-preclinical-trials"&gt;Breakthrough findings from preclinical trials&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Preclinical testing has shown highly promising results for YCT-529. In male mice, the drug prevented pregnancy with 99% effectiveness within just four weeks of use. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In male non-human primates, it significantly reduced sperm counts within two weeks of administration.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Crucially, the research demonstrated that YCT-529’s effects are reversible. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Male mice regained fertility within six weeks of stopping the drug, while non-human primates fully recovered sperm production within 10 to 15 weeks. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Additionally, no side effects were observed in either group, reinforcing its potential as a safe contraceptive option.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="body-content true    body-medium-medium  t-text-text-secondary"&gt;&lt;div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“A safe and effective male pill will provide more options to couples for birth control,” said Gunda Georg, the corresponding author of the study and a professor in the College of Pharmacy where the drug molecule was developed. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It will allow a more equitable sharing of responsibility for family planning and provide reproductive autonomy for men.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-progressing-towards-human-clinical-trials"&gt;Progressing towards human clinical trials&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Following the success of preclinical studies, YCT-529 has entered human clinical trials. The first phase, conducted by YourChoice Therapeutics in 2024, was completed successfully. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The drug is now in a second clinical trial, focusing on further evaluating its safety and effectiveness in humans.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This study laid the groundwork for human clinical trials of YCT-529, which are progressing efficiently,” said Nadja Mannowetz, lead author, chief science officer, and co-founder of YourChoice Therapeutics. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="body-content true    body-medium-medium  t-text-text-secondary"&gt;&lt;div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“With the unintentional pregnancy rate at nearly 50% in the U.S. and globally, we need more contraceptive options, particularly for men.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-expanding-contraceptive-options-for-men"&gt;Expanding contraceptive options for men&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite the FDA approving over 20 types of birth control, men currently have only two primary choices—condoms or vasectomies. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The introduction of a male contraceptive pill could revolutionize family planning. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By giving men an effective, hormone-free option, couples would have more balanced choices when it comes to &lt;a href="https://interestingengineering.com/science/novel-fertility-drug-improves-pregnancy" target="_blank" rel="dofollow"&gt;pregnancy&lt;/a&gt; prevention. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This could reduce the burden placed on &lt;a href="https://interestingengineering.com/health/ai-women-health-gender" target="_blank" rel="dofollow"&gt;women&lt;/a&gt;, who often bear the primary responsibility for contraception.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Additionally, a male birth control pill would be particularly beneficial for those who cannot use female hormonal contraceptives due to health conditions or side effects.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, YCT-529 could change that by providing men with a reliable, reversible, and hormone-free alternative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="body-content true    body-medium-medium  t-text-text-secondary"&gt;&lt;div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With clinical trials moving forward, researchers are optimistic that YCT-529 could soon enter the market. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If successful, it will not only expand birth control options but also promote greater shared responsibility in family planning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Interesting Engineering</author><pubDate>Mon, 31 Mar 2025 23:33:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiigFBVV95cUxNOHpUcGpSYzVRWjBKR0t5UUQ5cFhWSE5LekFxN2JXc3NnNmJNS3JTUDNWTENfdE5LSXZOaUxScU5UWmFzdHd6OEI5ekxrbC1adlRVU1QwNmxKOEMwUTU4VVc3YkhoUGdNekVJbFBrcGJydVRSODMyMGdob1NmbXNKeHJuZXNMdGItZkE</guid></item><item><title>SS strikes again - Daily Kos</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid0FVX3lxTE9KNjNmUzFCaVk0bUtPLUlhcE55NXlsT1JrbFptb2dvOW1zNldXdGFsWTlLNlBKUGRraTFVUmRFTHJaTFpBVnN2N2JaeEVfd2JzREpZZlBVQ2JmeDFOSkhiR1pDT01rLWFOR3hDM1hzdFJfOVdjUlVr?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="story__text"&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;My adult daughter gets a whopping $889 a month for SSD. She had to claim disability before ever being able to hold down a job after getting her Masters degree, in European Policies at Bath University, UK. She has a B.S. degree in Poly Sci and Spanish. She wanted to work in Europe at the EU. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My daughter’s SSD diagnosis: OCD at 9 years old. Crohn’s disease (25” removed). Gastroparesis — paralyzed stomach. Those two did not allow her to work and we filed for SSD when she was 22. To get her approved at age 22 for SSD it took two years. Two denials and us hiring a lawyer. A judge finally approved her for SSD and she got a little over $700 to live on. She didn’t qualify for food stamps, etc. due to us making too much money at the time of filing and her living with us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Added diagnosis at later times: &lt;a href="https://www.ninds.nih.gov/health-information/disorders/postural-tachycardia-syndrome-pots" target="_blank" title=""&gt;POTS&lt;/a&gt; — Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome. Sinus Tachycardia. hypermobile Ehler’s Danlos Syndrome (hEDS); a connective tissue disorder. We think the hEDS skipped a generation or two to get to her. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (hEDS) is a heritable connective tissue disorder that causes generalized joint hypermobility, joint instability, and chronic pain. hEDS is also associated with a variety of other symptoms and related conditions that affect many different areas of the body&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many with hEDS are wheel chair bound but we are lucky that she is mobile and doesn’t need me to care for her in any way — yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She cannot have over $1500 at any time in her bank account or she’s fined. In &lt;strong&gt;May, 2024&lt;/strong&gt;, hubby forgot to pull out some of the funds so that the automatic deposit wouldn’t go over the $1500. Oooops. SS deposited her $860 and for two days she had over $1500 in her account by $27.00. She got a letter in July, 2024 stating that due to being over the amount in her account in May, she would have a deduction for those two months of over $100 from her next couple of SSD payments, to balance out the account. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She’s allowed one car. She sold the one she had and got an EV. (We’re trying to do our part here folks.) SS saw TWO CARS on her account. She had to call twice and give lots of documentation that &lt;u&gt;THEIR deposit&lt;/u&gt; caused the overage and she only had one car. Resolved. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every five years she has to prove that she &lt;em&gt;continues to be disabled&lt;/em&gt;. One time, one asshole said she could use her arms so could work. She filed a complaint and, literally, 15 minutes before us driving an hour and a half to the main SS office in Modesto for the appointment, the agent there called and said he approved her SSD. The ups and downs this causes can be very difficult for her to deal with. She will be 40 years old this year and each year we watch her body slowly, very slowly, deteriorate. Many people with an episode with hEDS (she has had one with the sinus tachycardia) has a life expectancy of 45. We shall see.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My 74 year old husband is lucky to be able to work part-time, temporary for the City he worked with before. I also work full-time at 73 years old, as a professional long-arm quilter. We still get out PERS through our previous jobs and our social security by not overworking. We have worked hard for our SS and continue to work hard to support our daughter. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We pay an extra $1800 a month for insurance for our daughter due to her seeing specialists at Stanford. We still pay cash to other medical folks that help her. Counseling, physical therapy, etc. We lay out between $3 — $4000 a month to care of her (car, medical, food, etc.) Due to her hEDS, she had no connective tissue in her left jaw and had to have major jaw surgery. We paid $67,000 out of pocket due to insurance saying it was elective! The misaligned jaw caused migraine headaches, face, jaw, shoulder, neck pain. Plus it had to be done to help her chew FFS. But insurance kept saying it was plastic surgery and elective. Insurance paid for anesthesia, hospital though. Thank you! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How can people perpetrate fraud in Social Security? Within two days they know if our daughter has over $1500 in her account! Then…..deduct funds after that until it’s “balanced.”   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She just got a new letter today. Is it a form letter all SSD folks are getting? It states that she was notified “before” that there was an issue with her account and she was going to be discounted $121 a month. Not why? Not how long? Nothing. There was no notification before except last year and that was resolved. She will be contacting our local SS office, which for now, is still open for business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is this part of the changes Musk is trying to put through? It’s already hard enough to get SSD for the small amount of support it affords our daughter.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is our current situation. The fight to get what we have paid for through our own hard work can sometimes be overwhelming. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Folks, we are all going to be impacted by this administration, negatively, in some way or another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="is-empty-p"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

That said, there are a few things to know before you start stirring this seed into anything and everything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Below, the experts in the Good Housekeeping Test Kitchen and Good Housekeeping Institute Nutrition Labs share their top tips for using these seeds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What are chia seeds?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;These small, oval-shaped seeds come from the &lt;em&gt;Salvia hispanica &lt;/em&gt;plant, a member of the mint family. Native to Central and South America, these seeds have been cultivated for centuries and today can be found pretty much anywhere in the United States (Trader Joe's, Aldi, Amazon, you name it).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chia seeds nutrition (1 ounce, dry), &lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/170554/nutrients" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:per the;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;per the &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/170554/nutrients" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:USDA;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;USDA&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;140 calories&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;9g total fat&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;12g total carbohydrates&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;10g dietary fiber&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;5g protein&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What are the best ways to eat chia seeds?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's important to note that when soaked, chia seeds absorb liquid and turn into a gel-like consistency. This will affect the texture of whatever you're stirring chia seeds into — whether that be smoothies, puddings, homemade jams or something else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stir it into oatmeal&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because such a small amount packs such a nutritional punch, adding a spoonful of chia seeds into something you &lt;em&gt;already &lt;/em&gt;eat on the regular — like oatmeal — is a no-brainer. Food producer &lt;a href="https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/author/254692/tina-martinez/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Tina Martinez;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Tina Martinez&lt;/a&gt; always stirs 1 tablespoon of chia seeds into her oatmeal before heating in the microwave. “I love the consistency of just having some chia seeds, but not all chia seeds (as is the case of a chia pudding)." Not a fan of hot oatmeal? You can also mix chia seeds into overnight oats as you meal prep a few jars to stash in the fridge for the week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Make a chia pudding&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can't talk about what to do with chia seeds without bringing up chia pudding. "Chia pudding is so thick and creamy because of the way the seeds interact and plump up when combined with liquid," explains Chief Food Director &lt;a href="https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/author/11320/kate-merker/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Kate Merker;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Kate Merker&lt;/a&gt;. Depending on what else you add to the equation, this dish can be enjoyed as a breakfast, snack or fun dessert. No matter &lt;em&gt;when&lt;/em&gt; you eat it, know it'll probably help you stay satiated. "I had chia pudding while I was traveling, and it kept me full, so now I make it at home," says Kitchen Appliances Lab Director &lt;a href="https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/author/223025/nicole-papantoniou/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Nicole Papantoniou;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Nicole Papantoniou&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blend into smoothies &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Papantoniou also recommends adding some chia seeds to your smoothie. "Don't add too many, though, because the seeds can change the texture and make the drink jiggly," she warns. You should be good with adding just a tablespoon to your favorite smoothie recipe to start. That's the amount we used in our &lt;a href="https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/food-recipes/a38684144/make-ahead-smoothies-recipe/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Berry, Chia and Mint Smoothie;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Berry, Chia and Mint Smoothie&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make a jam&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is where chia seeds' ability to absorb liquid and plump up &lt;em&gt;really &lt;/em&gt;comes into play in the best way possible. Combining chia seeds with muddled berries and maple syrup results in a naturally thickened (quick!) jam — no need for additional pectin or gelatin. "I'll use it when I'm cooking down just plain frozen fruit for a jam," says Deputy Editor &lt;a href="https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/author/226537/sarah-wharton/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Sarah Gregory;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Sarah Gregory&lt;/a&gt;. She then will spread the jam on toast, stir into oatmeal or even layer into a breakfast oat bar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Boost your energy bites&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you usually DIY these nutrient-dense snacks to stash in your fridge or freezer, stir some chia seeds into your next batch.

They will contribute crunch to whatever you sprinkle 'em on. That can include yogurt or smoothie bowls, with a handful of granola, as well as salads. Papantoniou loves to sprinkle some on top of bananas with peanut butter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How should you store chia seeds?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the recommendation is to store chia seeds in a cool, dark place (read: your pantry), only half of the food team stores them there. The other half keeps theirs in the freezer, which can help prolong their shelf life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can you eat &lt;em&gt;too &lt;/em&gt;many chia seeds?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In short, yes. "Chia seeds are little nutritional powerhouses, but you can get too much of a good thing. Eating them in large amounts may lead to digestive distress since they are very high in fiber," says Sassos. Be sure to drink plenty of water to help the fiber properly digest, and introduce them gradually into your diet. This really applies to any high-fiber food, since you need to allow your digestive system some time to adjust to the higher fiber content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 31 Mar 2025 23:14:27 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiZ0FVX3lxTE9mS0RlTlZHREt3OFNhX3BYU0tEVkNaT2hoeUxrc0NmYm8zRU5NT3d6NndoWXBOM1FEOW9BTXZMQ01IRjFuX0U3TEF6M1VwWno4emI5ejAxTmJFb2JQSTF5ekJSdTdveUk</guid></item><item><title>This Woman Had No Idea She Had A Life-Threatening Health Issue Until A Preventative MRI Screening - BuzzFeed</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijAFBVV95cUxPazlaZzc3ZENPX1ZuRzBZdjZ4bkdfOWZLbG83SmduVVVKUGJsS3JyaUl2R1V0VGg0RjZNU3BtR3RtMUltdThaS1B0cXowNDFWSkRvRTJwNk1vd0hWckZIazd2bXpMenMwN0tsZmdpZ2VoREgxVnNBTnk0by11MTAyNnh5anUxMVlCOWFRUw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="subbuzz buzz-width--standard__subbuzz buzz-type--list__subbuzz subbuzz-text

      &lt;span class="js-subbuzz__title-text"&gt;Prenuvo's scans are elective, meaning they are not covered by insurance. However, Prenuvo &lt;a href="https://prenuvo.com/pricing" target="_blank"&gt;said on its website&lt;/a&gt; some people "have been able to get full or partial reimbursement." Prices can range anywhere from $999 for a Torso Scan to $2,499 for a Whole Body Scan to $4,499 for an Enhanced Screening in New York City (some of the prices are dependent on location).&lt;/span&gt;
    
  &lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the US, MRIs can cost, on average, $400 to $12,000, &lt;a href="https://www.goodrx.com/health-topic/diagnostics/how-much-does-an-mri-cost" target="_blank"&gt;according&lt;/a&gt; to GoodRx. Some portion of MRIs could be covered by insurance, but that depends on the type of insurance, whether or not the MRI provider is in or out-of-network, if there are additional medications needed with the procedure, and if it's considered medically necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

Then she shook her head and added, "No."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Sarah received her results four days later. "The only issue with how I got the results is that they came at 8:30 p.m., and I had nobody to call," she said. "They schedule your nurse practitioner phone call within, like, 24–48 hours...so I just went into a full-blown panic attack when I got my results and ended up in the emergency room because I needed a doctor to tell me what this meant."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span&gt; @sarblackburn / Via &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@sarblackburn/video/7463201078146993454" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:tiktok.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;tiktok.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;A spokesperson from Prenuvo told BuzzFeed, "At Prenuvo, patient care and wellbeing are our highest priorities.

It can be life-threatening, especially if you're pregnant. Like other aneurysms, a splenic artery aneurysm is dangerous because it can rupture (break open) or dissect (tear).

You may need to take preventive antibiotics or get additional vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span&gt;"So yeah. That is how my health anxiety started," Sarah continued. "It was a really dark and hard two months where I was spiraling and freaking out and seeing a lot of doctors, and pretty much treating my body like glass because I had no idea about this, and literally felt like a ticking time bomb was found inside my body."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Sarah later got a CT scan and discovered there were actually not one, but &lt;i&gt;two&lt;/i&gt; splenic aneurysms inside her splenic artery. "So, anyways...now I am getting my spleen removed, and I will be starting the journey of living life without a spleen, which I think is going to be okay and it's going to be better than having to live in fear of having a ruptured aneurysm — but not what I was expecting," she said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Sarah said friends have asked her whether she regrets getting the scan or not. "It changes often," she said. "But I feel grateful. I'm happy that I know about this and had the chance to decide what I wanted to do moving forward. But I've also had people say, 'Oh, I have health anxiety, I want to go do this.'"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"For the people that already have existing health anxiety, I truly don't know if I can recommend it because I was just like a normal anxious girlie before this, and now, I'm a normal anxious girlie with debilitating health anxiety that I'm trying to overcome," she continued. "But I will say, I'm pretty proud of myself for the way that I overcame this. And...yeah. Two months ago was a very different story."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Some commenters in the medical field told Sarah just how lucky she was to have found this condition early. "My jaw dropped reading splenic aneurysm. I've only experienced 3 patients come in the ED [Emergency Department] with a ruptured aneurysm and all three didn't make it," said one commenter.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Another said, "Provider here. Count your lucky stars-you definitely have a reason to still be here!

"I hope one day this can be covered by insurance (or better yet covered by free healthcare) so that everyone can have preventative care," someone said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Another said, "I don't understand why every insurance cannot provide 1 full body scan to every person.

&lt;p&gt;The health department is investigating after an active tuberculosis case was identified at a Waukegan High School campus, which is prompting enhanced cleaning and precautions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Waukegan Community Unit School District 60 Superintendent Theresa Plascencia sent a letter to part of the Waukegan High School Brookside campus about the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plascencia said an &lt;span&gt;active tuberculosis case has been identified within the Brookside campus school. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The district said they are working closely with the Lake County Health Department to follow all recommended protocols to “ensure the safety and well-being” of students and staff.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students and staff identified as close contacts have already been notified with recommended actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“To respect their privacy, we will not be sharing any additional details,” Plascencia said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The high school is undergoing recommended cleaning procedures as a precaution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;School operations continued as usual on Monday with continued cleaning and COVID-era air filtration enhancements in place, Plascencia said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Tuberculosis &lt;/span&gt;is spread through the air from one person to another. The disease germs are emitted into the air when a person with active &lt;span&gt;tuberculosis &lt;/span&gt;disease of the lungs or throat coughs, speaks or sings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People with active &lt;span&gt;tuberculosis &lt;/span&gt;disease are most likely to spread &lt;span&gt;tuberculosis &lt;/span&gt;germs to people they spend time with every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Active &lt;span&gt;tuberculosis &lt;/span&gt;can make a person very ill, Plascencia said in the letter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If not treated, it can lead to serious health complications. Only people with active TB disease can spread the germ to others. Those with ‘latent’ TB have the germ in the body but cannot spread it to others. Both active and latent TB are treatable,” Plascencia said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone who experiences symptoms associated with tuberculosis, such as a persistent cough lasting three weeks or longer, coughing up blood, pain with breathing or coughing, chest pain, fatigue, loss of appetite, unexplained weight loss, fever, chills or night sweats, is asked to contact their healthcare provider or the Lake County Health Department &lt;span&gt;tuberculosis &lt;/span&gt;clinic at 847-377-8700.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The school district is hosting a virtual town hall at 6 p.m. on Tuesday with the Lake County Health Department to answer questions students and parents have.&lt;/p&gt;

Your red eyes and runny noses don’t deceive you — seasonal allergies are getting worse, a miserable reality for nearly &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/pressroom/nchs_press_releases/2022/20220126.htm"&gt;one in three US adults and one in four children&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Why? Sneezing and sniffles are some of the &lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/epub/10.1073/pnas.2013284118"&gt;sirens of climate change&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, because of warming, pollen is now a nearly year-round menace in some parts of the US. Pollen, the main seasonal allergy trigger, is emerging earlier in the year, in higher concentrations, and lasting longer year after year. “In the springtime, the first pollen allergens are from trees, and that is starting 20 days earlier than it did 30 years ago,” said &lt;a href="https://aafa.org/about-aafa/senior-staff/"&gt;Kenneth Mendez&lt;/a&gt;, CEO of AAFA. Rising concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere are directly inducing plants to produce more pollen while extending the temperature conditions that trigger pollen production in plants. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“We hear all the time, ‘I’ve never had allergies before and now I suddenly feel like I have allergies,’ or ‘I feel like my allergies are getting a lot worse’ and that’s because the allergic load is that much higher because of climate change,” Mendez said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;For most people, seasonal allergies are an unpleasant nuisance. But with millions feeling &lt;em&gt;blergh&lt;/em&gt; at the same time, it adds up to a huge economic burden in lost productivity. Asthma, allergic rhinitis — the condition you probably know of as hay fever — and related allergy conditions &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14737167.2020.1819793#d1e333"&gt;cost the economy billions of dollars&lt;/a&gt; each year in lost work days, medications, and doctor’s visits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;There are also people for whom pollen is a more serious problem and can lead to dangerous complications or exacerbate other health issues. One study found that tree pollen allergies lead to &lt;a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2018GH000153"&gt;25,000 to 50,000 emergency room visits&lt;/a&gt; per year, two-thirds from people under the age of 18.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Over time, as pollen counts increase, more people with a higher sensitivity threshold are finding out the hard way that these tiny grains are a hazard. Other people are also finding out that doors and windows can’t protect them as some of the tiniest pollen grains seep in. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“If the trendlines continue, I think more people are going to feel miserable from allergies,” Mendez said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="how-we-keep-making-allergies-worse-for-ourselves" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;How we keep making allergies worse for ourselves&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The problem for allergy sufferers is that their body’s defense mechanisms sometimes overreact to something benign. Usually, it leads to mild, easily treatable symptoms. But allergens can also trigger more serious complications like &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/21461-allergic-asthma"&gt;asthma attacks&lt;/a&gt;, causing wheezing, chest tightness, and shortness of breath. In rare cases, they &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000844.htm"&gt;can lead to anaphylaxis&lt;/a&gt;, a whole-body reaction where the airways can swell shut and blood pressure drops to dangerously low levels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The vast majority of pollen allergies are more annoying than dangerous, but seasonal pollen is so ubiquitous that it’s almost impossible to avoid, sneaking indoors through vents, window seals, on clothing, and in pet fur. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Some people are more sensitive than others, but the relentless, growing exposure can add up to misery even for those with mild allergies. Pollen grains range in size from &lt;a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2020.1191"&gt;100 down to less than 10 microns&lt;/a&gt;, allowing them to penetrate deep into the lungs and irritate airways. Many types of plants release pollen as part of their reproductive cycle. Generally, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6934246/"&gt;trees spread pollen in the spring&lt;/a&gt;, grasses over the summer, and ragweed in the autumn. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--block-placement _80slsf1 _80slsf0 duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_1agbrixj"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--media--caption xptnl10"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup xkp0cg2 xptnl12"&gt;Airborne cloud of pine pollen from male pine cones in Arizona.&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;cite class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup xkp0cg2 xptnl11"&gt;Wild Horizons/Universal Images Group via Getty Images&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;However, the historical pollen timing patterns have already shifted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Tree pollen is wafting off of branches earlier in the season almost every year. Some grass species have seen their &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-28764-0"&gt;pollen release days delayed by almost a month&lt;/a&gt; while their overall season has grown longer. As a result, grass pollen increasingly overlaps with the &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/climate-indicators/climate-change-indicators-ragweed-pollen-season"&gt;ragweed pollen season&lt;/a&gt;, which itself has been extended by more than three weeks in some parts of the country since 1995. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;There are two key mechanisms driving this trend, both induced by humanity’s appetite for fossil fuels. Increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere from burning coal, oil, and natural gas &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7346998/"&gt;directly induce many plant species to produce more pollen&lt;/a&gt;. Carbon dioxide can make plants grow bigger and faster, and &lt;a href="https://extension.okstate.edu/fact-sheets/greenhouse-carbon-dioxide-supplementation.html"&gt;produce more flowers&lt;/a&gt;, which leads to more pollen. More pollen leads to more seeds, which means even more plants spraying pollen the next season. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Higher levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere are also warming the planet and changing the climate. In general, that means &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/climate-indicators/climate-change-indicators-seasonal-temperature"&gt;warmer, shorter winters&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.climatehubs.usda.gov/hubs/northeast/topic/climate-warming-brings-earlier-spring"&gt;earlier springs&lt;/a&gt;, which leads to longer growing seasons for plants. These trends will continue as global average temperatures go up, making allergies a significant public health burden. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Some parts of the country, such as Texas, are on track to see &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/allergy/articles/10.3389/falgy.2022.959594/full"&gt;pollen counts almost double&lt;/a&gt; by 2050 compared to 2000. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="its-not-just-pollen-you-have-to-worry-about" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;It’s not just pollen you have to worry about&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;For many people, allergies are an added complication on top of other health and environmental conditions. Air pollution from ozone, particulates, sulfur, and nitrogen compounds can cause their own breathing problems, but when they intersect with allergies, they can &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8638356/"&gt;make symptoms even worse&lt;/a&gt;. Pollution from roads can make pollen from nearby plants &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1398-9995.2012.02846.x"&gt;more potent at triggering allergic reactions&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10176314/"&gt;Smoke from wildfires&lt;/a&gt; can also exacerbate allergies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Cities may not offer much refuge. Changes to the landscape like urbanization can create a &lt;a href="https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ecs2.2512"&gt;more favorable habitat&lt;/a&gt; for plants like ragweed. City centers also tend to warm up faster than their rural surroundings and experience higher concentrations of air pollutants, compounding the effects of allergies. These factors are especially potent in low-income and underserved communities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Pollen isn’t the only allergen changing with the climate either. Rising temperatures and precipitation in some areas are &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-92178-z"&gt;increasing the number and duration of allergenic mold spores&lt;/a&gt;. Extreme weather further worsens the problem, as the damage and destruction create conditions for more mold. That was evident in New Orleans last year as storms like &lt;a href="http://v"&gt;Hurricane Francine&lt;/a&gt; soaked the city. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“When these storms come through, they create so much damage over the landscape of the state. Some communities have resources to immediately move in and repair roofs and patch windows, and then we have a lot of folks that simply don’t have those resources. With leaking roofs, you have mold growth indoors,” said &lt;a href="https://www.ochsner.org/doctors/john-clifford-carlson"&gt;John Carlson&lt;/a&gt;, who leads the high-risk allergy division at the Ochsner health system in New Orleans. “Because it’s so warm here, we can grow mold year round as long as there’s moisture.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;High winds from storms can also whip up dust, which can then trigger asthma. Additionally, there’s a phenomenon called &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6512777/"&gt;thunderstorm asthma&lt;/a&gt;, where the weather conditions can &lt;a href="https://www.lung.org/blog/can-a-thunderstorm-trigger-asthma"&gt;rupture pollen grains&lt;/a&gt; into smaller, more allergenic fragments, triggering asthma attacks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;It’s not clear whether the overall number of people with seasonal allergies is increasing. The US may be approaching a plateau in the number of people who are susceptible to pollen, Carlson said. At the same time, there are other conditions that can present with allergy-like symptoms, and at high enough concentrations, even people without allergies will wheeze. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“In New Orleans, we have a ton of oak pollen — I mean, just so much oak pollen in the air — and you commonly have a lot of people who don’t have oak pollen allergy nevertheless with itchy eyes and the sneezing from just the irritant effect of the particles,” Carlson said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The good news is that there are ways to contain the worst effects of seasonal allergies. For people with a history of bothersome seasonal allergies, seeing an allergist and finding out what their specific triggers are and what medicines work is key. It may make sense to start taking medications like nose sprays or over-the-counter allergy drugs before pollen ramps up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“We generally say to have your medications in your system close to two weeks ahead of time because it takes some time to build up,” Mendez said. For people who don’t know if they have allergies but are concerned about the threat, pay attention to your symptoms and see an allergist if you do start to experience irritated eyes and airways. There are also more aggressive interventions for people with severe allergies who don’t respond to other medicines like desensitization therapy, also known as &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/25194-allergy-shots"&gt;allergy shots&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Some of the same measures for avoiding air pollution also work for pollen. Pay attention to pollen forecasts in your local area. Avoid being outside and close doors and windows during high pollen release times, particularly in the morning. Leave your coat and shoes outside or locked away before you settle down at home. Wipe down your dog after a walk. Use a HEPA air filter in your living spaces. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 lg8ac5a xkp0cg1"&gt;Over the long term, it’s prudent to curb emissions of heat-trapping gasses that worsen climate change and allergies. For now, keep the tissues close. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Vox</author><pubDate>Mon, 31 Mar 2025 21:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihwFBVV95cUxNUGZ6THMzOHQ5aTNWYmtCd1BnNi1KMzB1Y2VVaUQ4OXRtTUVZTm4yeU1nSGlIZHJMZ2RnbXFqaExhQ2pJdDlhWGsyRjBWcEstdWRFQzFwNDZ3a1VIWlg0U0h5SEd5ZjRBS1ZFRVZqVjZiLTZXUHhfSDBsOWpSUmI2cnliaVRPMUU</guid></item><item><title>Costly bill hangs over Kansas City man’s head after eerie encounter with bat - KCTV</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirgFBVV95cUxQclhOblFraFRJaTJBck11NmFBc1FoZDd0V1FpU3J6b0tGRVpjeHYxaUhyT3ExeE4wRTRoLUNrRFlHcnM2b2tSa0FZazlVSzlMSmsyM3hTTWpfY19oRDdmT1l0OTBoV3JUQjBCTzloNm5mTnFwbkk3QW5lclBtbUpPaGVGVnRnbzNkZy1TaXRmeUhnXzh4bThoWVp6ZFpqSzJGZ3RKR2Niemt4WEpIX2c?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body | article w-100"&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;KANSAS CITY, Mo. (KCTV) - As bats awaken from hibernation, one local man had a close encounter that was more than creepy — it was costly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Moving day cannot come soon enough for Simon Manzo and his roommate Finnigan Bagby. The two are packing up their South Kansas City apartment after Manzo woke up to a bat crawling on his bare chest. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;“I’m freaking out because I usually sleep shirtless, so the thing had actual physical contact with me,” Manzo said. “I was not mentally prepared for this in the slightest.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Manzo cornered the animal, managed to secure it inside a container and released it back outside. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="w-100"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;“It’s very likely it could’ve slipped through one of the vents and gotten into Simon’s room or could’ve gotten under the door,” Bagby said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;An inspection from &lt;a href="https://www.kcmo.gov/city-hall/departments/health/healthy-homes-rental-inspection-program" target="_self" rel="" title="https://www.kcmo.gov/city-hall/departments/health/healthy-homes-rental-inspection-program"&gt;Kansas City’s Healthy Homes program&lt;/a&gt; found potential entry points, including a fireplace in the unit and exterior holes in the building’s basement. A city spokesperson noted this was the first-of-its-kind complaint at the complex, which is why KCTV5 is not naming it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;While Manzo did not see any bite marks on his body, he went to the hospital worried about the potential for rabies — a deadly virus spread through animal bites. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;“The doctor told me you either get the vaccines or risk the 20/80 chance and possibly die in two months,” Manzo recalled. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="w-100"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;He refused to risk it and took the vaccines. But it later cost the uninsured California native $14,000. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;“I almost dropped my phone because I’ve never seen a number that big,” Manzo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;“$14,000. Girl, that’s crazy,” Bagby replied. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Shelly Colatskie, a bat ecologist for the &lt;a href="https://mdc.mo.gov/" target="_self" rel="" title="https://mdc.mo.gov/"&gt;Missouri Department of Conservation&lt;/a&gt;, identified the flying mammal in Manzo’s room as a big brown bat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="w-100"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;“They’re harmless to humans,” Colatskie said. “Now, there’s always going to be those accidental encounters.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;The big brown bat is one of 16 species across the Show Me State, according to Colatskie. It’s also one of the most common in the Kansas City region, along with the evening and eastern red bats. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;“They’re coming out of hibernation right now and could be moving from their winter site to their summer site,” Colatskie explained. “And so, they can find the tiniest cracks and crevices to get through.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Colatskie said less than half of one percent of bats carry rabies. However, she said Manzo did the right thing given he had direct contact with the animal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="w-100"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;“If you have any kind of encounter like that, it’s always best to be safe and go to the doctor,” she added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Looking back, Manzo wishes he’d also called animal services, which could have tested the bat for rabies, potentially saving him thousands of dollars. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;A spokesperson for the complex told KCTV5 they found “nothing in regard to a bat – and immediately corrected separate issues” listed in the Healthy Homes inspection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;What should you do if you encounter a bat inside your home. KC Pet Project offers the following tips:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="w-100"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="list | article-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Call animal services &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Do not touch or hit the bat. If it is flying, wait until it lands somewhere. Open windows or doors to help it go back outside. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Always wear thick gloves when trying to move a bat. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Put any children and/or animals in a separate room. Close off other entrances to the house so the bat cannot leave the room. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;If the bat is grounded, secure the bat by placing a box or container over the bat. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;If the bat is hanging; place a box/container over the bat and use a piece of cardboard to trap the bat in the box or container. Turn the box or container right side up and secure the cardboard as a lid. Make sure there are small air holes in the lid/box. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;To learn more about bats in Missouri, &lt;a href="https://mdc.mo.gov/wildlife/nuisance-problem-species/bat-control" target="_self" rel="" title="https://mdc.mo.gov/wildlife/nuisance-problem-species/bat-control"&gt;click here&lt;/a&gt;.

health officials urge vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KNOX COUNTY, Ohio — Just last week, the Ohio Department of Health announced that there was a confirmed &lt;a href="https://www.10tv.com/health" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;measles case&lt;/a&gt; in Knox County. Now, two more cases have been confirmed in the county.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ODH said the initial case in Knox County was from a visitor to the county who exposed others in Knox and nearby counties. The two additional cases were found in international travelers.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Knox County Public Health, the individuals with measles are isolated and their symptoms are being monitored.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The county health department has been working with the individuals since contact tracing began and they have been in quarantine.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Director Bruce Vanderhoff also announced last week that there was a measles outbreak in Ashtabula County. ODH and Ashtabula County have identified 10 measles cases. Nine of the cases are &lt;a href="https://www.10tv.com/article/news/local/ohio/ohio-first-measles-case-2025-ashtabula-county/530-9f8dfb61-d0f1-48c0-ab90-916ba69e2b5e" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" title="https://www.10tv.com/article/news/local/ohio/ohio-first-measles-case-2025-ashtabula-county/530-9f8dfb61-d0f1-48c0-ab90-916ba69e2b5e"&gt;linked to an adult man&lt;/a&gt; reported last week as the state's first measles case of the year.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This disease can be very serious, even deadly, but it is almost entirely avoidable by being properly vaccinated. Measles is especially dangerous for young children, so I strongly urge all parents across Ohio to make sure your children are vaccinated. It is a crucial layer of protection that can save lives," Vanderhoff said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Medical professionals warn we may begin to see more cases of measles in the next few weeks, as this is typically the time it takes for the virus to manifest symptoms after exposure. Symptoms usually start to appear about 13 to 14 days following infection.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you return from vacation and start to feel unwell shortly thereafter, it's possible that you may have been exposed to the virus.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;p class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What are the symptoms?&lt;/h3&gt;                    &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measles first infects the respiratory tract, then spreads throughout the body, causing a high fever, runny nose, cough, red, watery eyes and a rash.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rash generally appears three to five days after the first symptoms, beginning as flat red spots on the face and then spreading downward to the neck, trunk, arms, legs and feet. When the rash appears, the fever may spike over 104 degrees Fahrenheit, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most kids will recover from measles, but infection can lead to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/signs-symptoms/index.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" title="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/signs-symptoms/index.html"&gt;dangerous complications&lt;/a&gt; such as pneumonia, blindness, brain swelling and death.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    &lt;p class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How to prevent measles?&lt;/h3&gt;                    &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CDC says the best way to protect yourself is with the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine. Two doses of the vaccine are about 97% effect at preventing measles. One dose is about 93% effective.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Columbus Public Health Commissioner Mysheika Roberts said everyone 12 months and older should get their first dose of the MMR vaccine and the second dose between 4 and 6 years old.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ODH is working with health departments in Ashtabula and Knox counties to follow up on potential exposures and to share opportunities for vaccination.

Studies show that replaying memories before sleep, experiencing novel events, and feeling positive emotions can all strengthen autobiographical memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apps like &lt;em&gt;HippoCamera&lt;/em&gt; reveal that even dreaming about past events improves recall, while diverse daily experiences enhance the vividness of surrounding memories. These findings are helping scientists understand how memory works outside the lab and offer insights into boosting memory in everyday life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sleep Strengthens Memory:&lt;/strong&gt; Memories reviewed before sleep or dreamt about are more vivid and easier to recall.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Novelty Boosts Recall:&lt;/strong&gt; Experiencing something new enhances memory for both novel and routine events.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Smartphone Science:&lt;/strong&gt; Real-world memory tracking via smartphone apps provides rich, naturalistic data.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Cognitive Neuroscience Society&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A memory is not a straight line from one point to another, even if we sometimes think of them like linear stories. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This key insight that cognitive neuroscientists have known for many years is now guiding a new type of research—to explore not only how memories evolve over time but also how they can be strengthened or changed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assisting researchers with this new exploration is a powerful tool: smartphones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108312"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/sleep-emotion-memory-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/sleep-emotion-memory-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/sleep-emotion-memory-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/sleep-emotion-memory-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/sleep-emotion-memory-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/sleep-emotion-memory-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/sleep-emotion-memory-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/sleep-emotion-memory-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain and a woman on a cell phone." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/sleep-emotion-memory-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/sleep-emotion-memory-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/sleep-emotion-memory-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/sleep-emotion-memory-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/sleep-emotion-memory-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/sleep-emotion-memory-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/sleep-emotion-memory-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;For example, if you dream about a dinner party from the night before, does that influence your memory for that event? Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Smartphones are an incredible tool for understanding patterns of feelings, behavior, and experiences in daily life, and how different types of everyday events stay with us in memory,” says Elizabeth Goldfarb of Yale University, who is chairing a session at the annual meeting of the Cognitive Neuroscience Society (CNS) about the use of smartphones in capturing naturalistic data about memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Real experiences have so much more salience and self-relevance than anything I can generate in the lab, and being able to quantify how people remember those events is very exciting.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers will be sharing new smartphone-based studies that suggest how a range of actions people take—from trying something new, to replaying memories before sleep, to feeling positive emotions—can help them build stronger and more detailed memories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These talks examine both how researchers can use these data to capture how factors like emotion, novelty, and dreams transform memories, and suggest ways that people can strengthen their own memories,” Goldfarb says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Memory replay and sleep&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morgan Barense’s current work using smartphones to capture real-time data on memory, sleep, and dreams was inspired by a serendipitous discovery in a study that wasn’t designed to look at sleep and memory at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We found that the timing of when someone first reviews material relative to sleep had an enormous effect on how well they later remembered it,” says Barense of the University of Toronto, who will be presenting new work at the CNS meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The effect was so striking that I initially didn’t believe it. That discovery made me realize that sleep is something all memory scientists should be paying close attention to.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now working on studies designed by graduate student Nelly Matorina, Barense and her team are investigating a fundamental question using a smartphone app they developed that is called  HippoCamera: How does a single night of sleep influence our memory for the events that occurred the day before? For example, if you dream about a dinner party from the night before, does that influence your memory for that event?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using HippoCamera, participants recorded two events per day—one in the morning and one in the evening—over two weeks. The researchers then tested their memories after 12-hour delays that either included a night of sleep or a day spent awake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their pre-press results showed that “memories following sleep were more vivid, felt temporally closer, and were easier to recall, suggesting that a single night of sleep helps preserve the richness of autobiographical memory,” Barense says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also asked participants to record their dreams upon waking and indicate whether they were related to events captured with HippoCamera the previous evening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Interestingly, memories that were dreamt about were also rated as feeling temporally closer and were more likely to be recalled from a first-person perspective,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to these short-term effects, the team tested the same memories one year later to ask how they changed over time, including the connection to the memories’ locations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our pattern of results suggests that the link between an event and its location may initially weaken after a night’s sleep to allow for memory reorganization, but over the long term, a year later, our memory is strongly connected to where it took place,” Matorina says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Real-world data collection introduces variability that is difficult to control, and tracking sleep and memory over time requires careful methodological design,” Barense says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“However, these challenges are also what make smartphone-based research so promising—it allows us to move beyond artificial settings and study memory as it naturally unfolds in daily life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By illuminating the crucial role of sleep and dreaming in memory, Barense and her team hope to gain windows into memory plasticity—better understanding the connection between sleep and our waking experiences and laying the groundwork for new ways to boost memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In future work, in collaboration with Ken Paller and his lab at Northwestern University, her team will investigate if it is possible to enhance real-world memory retention during sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They will be integrating HippoCamera with at-home targeted memory reactivation, which works by reintroducing memory-related cues—such as sounds associated with an event—during specific sleep stages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While our previous work has shown that HippoCamera strengthens autobiographical memory in older adults, we believe that incorporating sleep-based memory reactivation will further amplify its benefits,” Barense says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Memory vividness and novelty&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lila Davachi’s smartphone-based work on memory was motivated by the cognitive and emotional impacts of the pandemic that came up in almost every conversation she and the research team had during the COVID-19 shutdown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The lab had already published several papers on the impact of context representations on associative memory and here we all were sitting in our homes, meeting on Zoom, with very little change in our contexts,” says Davachi of Columbia University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was natural to wonder how this was going to impact our long-term memories and, perhaps by consequence, our mental health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adapting a well-validated data collection method from social psychology, Davachi and her team ran a “daily diary” study that sampled real-world experiences using a smartphone app.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They asked study participants to report daily events over a two-week period, and then after a two-week delay, the researchers asked them to recall the autobiographical experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On each day and for each event, participants were asked to categorize each event as “novel,” “routine,” or “periodic.” as well as answer several other questions about the events and their days. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using artificial intelligence (AI) to help analyze the large number of subjective events recorded, the team found that novel autobiographical events were later reported with greater vividness and detail compared to both routine and periodic events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Perhaps more exciting, we found that routine and periodic events that happened on the same day as a novel event were also better remembered than routine and periodic events that took place on days with less novelty,” Davachi explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This suggests a penumbra-like effect of novelty.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That novelty improves memory for not only a novel event but also for adjacent events throughout the day suggests that “experiential diversity” is an important factor for forming lasting memories—and it’s something that people might be able to control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work, Davachi says, is bringing researchers closer to understanding how and if laboratory studies of memory and their findings translate to real-world autobiographical experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Being able to sample and record data from individuals in the real world, along with the use of AI-based large language models to help us analyze large amounts of complex data, is a solid stepping stone,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Memory emotions and alcohol&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For all memory studies, a major challenge is quantifying memory accuracy, says Goldfarb of Yale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If we are asking someone to tell us about an event that happened years ago, we can measure whether they tell us the same details consistently, but we don’t know if those details are ‘correct’ because we were not there when the event occurred,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By using smartphone technology, we can effectively be there with the participant while the event is happening.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Goldfarb’s work, these techniques are opening doors to answering new questions, including how people remember stressful or emotional events. In one study she will be presenting at the CNS conference, Goldfarb and her team are looking at memories and emotions in the context of substance abuse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Memory is important for addiction, as, for example, someone can’t relapse in a place where they used to drink if they have no memory of drinking there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Yet we know very little about what people remember about their time drinking that drives this behavior,” she explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With smartphones, the researchers can now share what they remember about their real experiences with alcohol and compare that to previous lab-based studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re uncovering some similarities with what we measure in the lab, which is great for establishing ecological validity,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But by measuring the memories that could directly inform real-life substance use, they are also capturing new data, such as how memories for positive and negative experiences are organized differently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are seeing that people are more likely to link different parts of a positive event together in memory,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As a researcher, the effects of real emotions are so much stronger than what we can create in the lab.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taken together, Goldfarb says, the research being presented at CNS 2025—about novelty, replay, and emotion—are a leap forward in helping people build stronger and more detailed memories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this sleep, emotion, and memory research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cogneurosociety.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Lisa M.P.

		&lt;p&gt;CASPER, Wyo. — Cat food is being recalled in Wyoming, due to potentially containing H5N1, also known as “bird flu.”

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s according to a release from Laramie County Public Health, which stated that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has recalled Savage Cat Food Large Chicken Boxes 84 oz. and Small Chicken Boxes 21 oz. due to possible contamination of H5N1.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These specific products have a “Better If Used By” date of 11/15/2026.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The boxes were distributed in Wyoming, as well as Colorado and Nebraska,” the release states. “People who fed cats the product should watch for possible symptoms of bird flu. Symptoms can include fever, sluggishness, low appetite, reddened or inflamed eyes, discharge from eyes and nose, difficulty breathing, and neurological signs, such as stiff body movements, seizure, lack of coordination, and blindness.” 

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The release notes that if a person’s cat shows any of those signs after eating the recalled product, that person should immediately contact their veterinarian.  If a person does, in fact, have the recalled product, they are asked to return it to the retailer they got it from for proper disposal and a refund. 

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, humans can become ill if the virus gets into their eyes, nose or mouth.

The study found that people with higher PTSD symptoms were more likely to fear strong emotions, which led to less constructive and more conflict-driven communication styles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These emotional fears contribute to patterns like demand-withdraw behavior, where one partner pressures and the other retreats, reinforcing both relationship strain and PTSD symptoms. Researchers emphasize that addressing fear of emotions alongside PTSD symptoms may improve communication and support recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Emotional Fear Link:&lt;/strong&gt; PTSD symptoms are associated with fear of strong emotions, impacting communication.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Destructive Patterns:&lt;/strong&gt; Fear of emotions increases demand-withdraw dynamics in couples.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Treatment Opportunity:&lt;/strong&gt; Addressing both PTSD and emotional fears can improve relationships and healing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Penn State&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms often have trouble communicating and resolving relationship difficulties with their romantic partners, according to previous research by Steffany Fredman, associate professor of human development and family studies at Penn State, and others. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a new study, Fredman and others have found that some of these problems may stem from people’s fear of their emotions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108308"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/ptsd-emotion-relationships-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/ptsd-emotion-relationships-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/ptsd-emotion-relationships-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/ptsd-emotion-relationships-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/ptsd-emotion-relationships-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/ptsd-emotion-relationships-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/ptsd-emotion-relationships-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/ptsd-emotion-relationships-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a couple on chairs facing each other." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/ptsd-emotion-relationships-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/ptsd-emotion-relationships-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/ptsd-emotion-relationships-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/ptsd-emotion-relationships-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/ptsd-emotion-relationships-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/ptsd-emotion-relationships-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/ptsd-emotion-relationships-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The current study extended this prior work by demonstrating that individuals’ PTSD symptoms may predispose them to catastrophic thoughts about feeling strong emotions and that such thoughts may be why couples in which one or both partners have elevated PTSD symptoms tend to have a hard time communicating constructively. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers collected data from 64 opposite-sex couples in which both members of the couple had experienced a traumatic life event. The researchers analyzed PTSD symptom data from each member of the couple about perceived negative consequences if they feel strong emotions and how they and their partner tend to communicate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results published in &lt;em&gt;Behaviour Research and Therapy&lt;/em&gt; demonstrated that people with higher levels of PTSD symptoms experienced greater fear of their emotions, which was associated with less constructive communication and more unproductive communication with their partners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In this study, we were trying to understand why people with PTSD symptoms have trouble resolving relationship difficulties with their romantic partners,” Fredman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Generally speaking, people with PTSD view themselves and other people negatively, and the resulting mistrust, anger, avoidance, withdrawal and emotional numbing put strain on their romantic relationships. Experiencing your feelings, trusting people and connecting with others are all important ingredients for healing from PTSD.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PTSD can create a vicious cycle, according to Fredman. Behavior triggered by PTSD symptoms such as aggression, avoidance, withdrawal and numbing may strain relationships, and relationship discord can maintain PTSD symptoms. This cycle continues unless something changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fredman co-developed couple-based treatment for PTSD to disrupt this cycle. Individuals with PTSD often experience emotions as dangerous and a trigger — or a trauma reminder — because strong emotions were felt during or after their trauma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since romantic relationships evoke many strong emotions, people may experience emotionally evocative interactions with their partners as threatening and can engage in behaviors to neutralize this perceived threat, such as becoming aggressive and/or withdrawing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When one or both partners develop unhealthy coping skills, strained romantic relationships can reinforce the symptoms of PTSD. On the other hand, relationships in which people can both express themselves and listen can promote recovery from PTSD, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the current study, the researchers recruited people with a broad range of PTSD symptoms and symptom severity. Studying people with a broad range of severity allowed the research team to understand the ways that more or less severe symptoms were likely to affect communication in a relationship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers interviewed participants about their PTSD symptoms and asked participants whether they feared their emotions. They also asked whether they typically communicate constructively — which involves collaborative problem solving, listening, suggesting compromises and expressing one’s feelings; whether they demand while their partner withdraws; and whether their partner demands while they withdraw when relationship issues arise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In demand/withdraw communication, one partner complains, nags or otherwise tries to demand a response from their partner. The other partner responds by withdrawing and avoiding the interaction. Typically, Fredman said, the more one person withdraws, the more the other partner demands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This type of communication does not facilitate problem solving and often leaves issues unresolved. Unproductive and unresolved conflict can maintain PTSD symptoms by reinforcing perceptions of interpersonal threat and negative views of oneself and the other partner, Fredman continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study participants who reported higher levels of PTSD symptoms were more likely to report fear of their emotions. Additionally, those who reported greater fear of their emotions were less likely to report constructive communication and were more likely to report that they demand while their partner withdraws and that their partner demands while they withdraw.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study is the first to identify that fear of emotions has interpersonal consequences, according to Fredman, meaning the fear influences how people interact with one another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When we only looked at PTSD symptoms and communication without considering a person’s fear of their emotions, there were relatively few direct connections we could identify,” Fredman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When we looked at the connections between PTSD symptoms and fear of emotions and then examined the connections between fear of emotions and communication styles, the connections became clear. This suggests that fear of emotions is an important influence on the communication style of couples where one or both people have PTSD symptoms.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior work by Fredman and colleagues demonstrated that individuals with elevated PTSD symptoms had difficulties regulating their own emotional arousal during laboratory-based conversations with their partners about their relationships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More specifically, they responded to their own emotional arousal and the emotional arousal communicated through their partner’s voice in a manner consistent with emotional arousal serving as a trauma cue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The current study extended this prior work by demonstrating that individuals’ PTSD symptoms may predispose them to catastrophic thoughts about feeling strong emotions and that such thoughts may be why couples in which one or both partners have elevated PTSD symptoms tend to have a hard time communicating constructively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Other research we conducted has shown that couple therapy can effectively reduce PTSD symptoms and improve relationship communication, even in just a single weekend,” Fredman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This latest study reveals more nuance about how PTSD symptoms, fear of emotions and communication difficulties are connected and why they should be treated at the same time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jeesun Lee, graduate student in human development and family studies at Penn State; Yunying Le, who earned her doctorate in human development and family studies in 2019 and worked as a postdoctoral fellow at Penn State and is now research assistant professor at University of Denver; Emily Taverna, who earned her doctorate in 2023 psychology at Penn State and is now Advanced Fellow in Women’s Health at the Women’s Health Sciences Division of the National Center for PTSD; and Amy Marshall, professor at Virginia Tech, also contributed to this research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;The National Center for Advancing Translational Science, the Karl R.

Using sleep studies and brain imaging data from 270 participants, researchers found that poor sleep architecture was linked to brain atrophy over time—particularly in the inferior parietal region, an area affected early in Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These associations held even after accounting for factors like age, heart health, and lifestyle habits.

An estimated 6.7 million Americans aged 65 and older are living with Alzheimer’s disease, and this number is projected to double by 2060, pending medical developments to prevent, slow or cure the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study involved an analysis of data from 270 participants who had a median age of 61 years. Fifty-three percent were female, and all participants were white. Individuals were excluded from the analysis if they previously had a stroke or probable dementia or other significant brain pathology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research utilized polysomnography to assess baseline sleep architecture. Advanced brain imaging techniques were used to measure brain volumes 13 to 17 years later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the authors, the study demonstrates an important association between sleep and long-term brain health, and it highlights potential opportunities to reduce the risk of Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Sleep architecture may be a modifiable risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias, posing the opportunity to explore interventions to reduce risk or delay Alzheimer’s onset,” said Cho.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers emphasized that further investigation is needed to fully understand the causal relationships between sleep architecture and Alzheimer’s disease progression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this sleep and Alzheimer’s disease research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#8be6eeefe2eacbeaeaf8e6a5e4f9ec" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Thomas Heffron&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://aasm.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;AASM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Thomas Heffron – AASM&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.5664/jcsm.11630" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Lower slow wave sleep and rapid eye movement sleep are associated with brain atrophy of AD-vulnerable regions&lt;/a&gt;” by Gawon Cho et al. &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lower slow wave sleep and rapid eye movement sleep are associated with brain atrophy of AD-vulnerable regions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="d1e188"&gt;Study Objectives:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sleep deficiency is associated with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathogenesis. We examined the association of sleep architecture with anatomical features observed in AD: (1) atrophy of hippocampus, entorhinal, inferior parietal, parahippocampal, precuneus, and cuneus regions (“AD-vulnerable regions”) and (2) cerebral microbleeds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="d1e195"&gt;Methods:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 270 participants of the Atherosclerosis Risk in the Communities Study, we examined the association of baseline sleep architecture with anatomical features identified on brain MRI 13∼17 years later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sleep architecture was quantified as the proportion of slow wave sleep (SWS), proportion of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, and arousals index using polysomnography.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outcomes included (1) volumetric measurements of each AD-vulnerable region and (2) the presence of any cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) and that of lobar CMBs, which are more specifically associated with AD. We analyzed the association of each sleep predictor with each MRI outcome, adjusting for covariates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="d1e202"&gt;Results:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Median age was 61, 53% female, 100% were White, and 47% had 16+ years of education. Mmedian times in SWS and REM were 17.4% and 21.5%, respectively. Having less SWS was associated with smaller volumes of the inferior parietal region (β=-44.18 mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; per -1 percentage point [PP] of SWS, [95%CI=-76.62, -11.74]) and cuneus (β=-11.98 [=-20.92, -3.04] mm&lt;sup&gt;3 &lt;/sup&gt;per -1 PP of SWS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having less REM was associated with smaller volumes of the inferior parietal region (β=-75.54 [-129.36, -21.72] mm&lt;sup&gt;3 &lt;/sup&gt;per 1 PP of REM) and precuneus (β=-31.92 [-63.78,-0.06] mm&lt;sup&gt;3 &lt;/sup&gt;per 1 PP of REM).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After FDR adjustments, lower SWS and REM were associated with significantly smaller inferior parietal region volumes.

&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8x8rny3007626qf6iig1vdd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As preventable infections like measles threaten to become endemic again in the US, researchers whose government grants were recently terminated are warning about the consequences of throttling studies looking at ways to increase vaccination.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8x8twqj00042e6bbou61a6i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Among more than 1,600 grant cancellations announced by the US Department of Health and Human Service since January 20, roughly 300 have been related to vaccines, making the area one of the largest focal points for funding cuts by the agency.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8x8twqj00052e6b90gxrkq9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In a &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/10.1001/jama.2025.4725?guestAccessKey=e4feddab-a05a-4e17-ba74-9220b602a7dd&amp;amp;utm_source=for_the_media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;amp;utm_term=033125" target="_blank"&gt;viewpoint published Monday&lt;/a&gt; in the journal JAMA, three pediatricians wrote about the letters they and their colleagues recently received terminating grants to&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;research vaccine uptake, and they warned that “the lives of individuals in the US are at stake” if the government continues to undermine immunization.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8x8twqj00062e6bkprod8yy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “This was a broad swath of work that was terminated, all focused on trying to understand the needs of individuals and communities regarding vaccines,” Dr. Douglas Opel, a pediatrician at the University of Washington and one of the paper’s authors, told CNN.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8x8twqj00072e6b0uods3js@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Opel was part of a grant looking at ways to increase vaccine confidence in Alaska Native and American Indian communities.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8x8twqj00082e6bpg1iglmo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The letter he and others received said, “It is the policy of [the National Institutes of Health] not to prioritize research activities that focuses gaining scientific knowledge on why individuals are hesitant to be vaccinated and/or explore ways to improve vaccine interest and commitment.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8x8twqj00092e6bcesokl6k@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The authors point out that this is an “astonishing about-face” for the agency, whose immediate past director, Dr. Francis Collins, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/05/us/politics/francis-collins-nih.html" target="_blank"&gt;had expressed regret&lt;/a&gt; that he and other top public health officials had underestimated vaccine hesitancy during the Covid-19 pandemic.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8x8twqj000a2e6b0kj8rzsw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The change in policy at NIH also runs contrary to views expressed by international health and security agencies. In 2019, the World Health Organization &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/spotlight/ten-threats-to-global-health-in-2019" target="_blank"&gt;recognized&lt;/a&gt; vaccine hesitancy as one of the top 10 threats to global health. The Center for Strategic and International Studies, a US think tank, &lt;a href="https://www.csis.org/analysis/why-vaccine-confidence-matters-national-security" target="_blank"&gt;has also stressed&lt;/a&gt; that vaccine confidence is essential for national security.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8x8twqj000b2e6bdp6cewrp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The authors of the JAMA paper say the loss of this critical support couldn’t have come at a worse time. A &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0264410X24005966?via%3Dihub" target="_blank"&gt;recent study&lt;/a&gt; estimated that 1 in 5 parents in the US are hesitant about vaccines, just as vaccine-preventable infections such as measles and whooping cough are surging again.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8x8twqj000c2e6bdtcogb93@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It really makes no logical sense,” said co-author Dr. Sean O’Leary, a pediatrician at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8x8twqj000d2e6buwrebp4b@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We think of measles as the canary in the coal mine of vaccine-preventable diseases, because it’s so contagious that it’s the first one when you see immunization coverage in general drop. It’s the first one you’re going to see pop up.” he said – and other infections won’t be far behind.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8x8twqj000e2e6bq9cxi616@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The US is also coming out of its worst flu season in more than a decade, with more than half a million hospitalizations and 23,000 deaths to date. Experts attribute some of that severity to decreasing flu vaccination across all age groups.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8xcvucd00022e6btnc13oct@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            HHS did not respond to a request for comment on the viewpoint.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8xc4wd600002e6b419bcb2l@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As a measles outbreak grows in Texas, HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. wrote in an &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/robert-f-kennedy-jr-measles-outbreak-call-action-all-us" target="_blank"&gt;opinion piece on Fox News&lt;/a&gt; this month that parents should consult with health care providers “to understand their options to get the MMR vaccine” for their children.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8xcx1s500042e6b594dno5d@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy did not explicitly recommend the vaccine but acknowledged that it can protect individuals and contribute to community immunity.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8xdr26000023b6mmrgw56o9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The decision to vaccinate is a personal one,” he wrote.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8x8twqj000f2e6bh4890t1u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The sudden loss of research funding isn’t just disruptive, the viewpoint’s authors said, it’s also wasteful.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8x8twqj000g2e6bbya721l7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Co-author Dr. Melissa Stockwell, a pediatrician and chief of the Division of Child and Adolescent Health at Columbia University, was studying the effectiveness of text reminders to increase flu and Covid vaccines for kids. The researchers had enrolled pediatrics practices and conducted a pilot last fall. They were going to run the campaign again this fall, to see which messages resonated and were effective, but now won’t get the chance.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8x8twqj000h2e6b227rcmrb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “They basically have invested nearly a million dollars already, and now we’re not going to be able to look at the results,” Stockwell said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8x8twqj000i2e6bujs5pwnu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “What made it particularly devastating was that it wasn’t only my grant, but it was this community of researchers across the country. … It was all happening to us simultaneously,”&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt; she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8xdtcz400043b6mdnhs0ck0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Stockwell worries what that will mean for the health of children.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8x8twqj000k2e6bbgvmw6ip@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We’re trying to make sure families have the information that they need to make health decisions for their children,” she added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8x8twqj000l2e6brp2y89mm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Taken in total, the vaccine grant cancellations signal “an endorsement of&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;an approach to deprioritize science, no matter how fundamental that science is to the health of individuals in the US,” the viewpoint’s authors wrote.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8x8twqj000m2e6b0zko6hsu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The grant termination letters stress that “NIH is obligated to carefully steward grant awards to ensure taxpayer dollars are used in ways that benefit the American people.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8x8twqj000n2e6btr1udwqs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But any short-term savings on research related to vaccines is likely to cost the US money in the long run, experts say.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8x8twqj000o2e6b8if3d7aa@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Vaccines are the one of the most cost-effective public health interventions, preventing the direct costs of caring for people in the hospital as well as increasing productivity and longevity. Every dollar spent on vaccines for kids saves roughly 10, according to the pro-vaccine nonprofit Vaccinate Your Family.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8x8twqj000p2e6brkn0qyoh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For the NIH to no longer be supporting them is chilling, Opel said. “It’s just absolutely unequivocal how important and beneficial vaccines are to the American public.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

(She struggles to speak for long periods due to her treatment.) “I had general tiredness.”Riehle visited her primary care doctor and a dentist to understand why she was experiencing such terrible pain. Finally, an ear, nose and throat doctor biopsied her tongue and figured out what caused her headaches — Stage 4 tongue cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“It wasn’t until I saw a specialist that I found out what I was facing,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;Headaches and tongue discoloration &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;When the headaches started, Riehle visited her medical providers. She first saw her dentist.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“She noticed some discoloration on my tongue but never discussed what it might be,” she says. “My primary care physician also examined me when I came in for my original complaints but also never alluded to any major problems.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;When she met with her primary care physician, they suggested that she visit an otolaryngologist. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“He thought maybe the pains were symptoms of my TMJ,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;TMJ, the temporomandibular joint that connects the jaw to the skull, can cause disorders that can lead to pain in the face, head, jaw and ears, according to &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/tmj/symptoms-causes/syc-20350941" target="_blank"&gt;Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;But when the ENT doctor examined Riehle, they noticed something unusual on her tongue and instead performed a punch biopsy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;In March 2024, the results of the biopsy returned, and Riehle learned she had Stage 4 squamous cell carcinoma in her tongue. The diagnosis felt devastating. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“It (feels) extremely lonely having a cancer most people my age don’t get,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Doctors provided her with two treatment options — surgery that would remove her tongue, or radiation and chemotherapy. She opted for the latter. Riehle started with radiation five days a week with weekly chemotherapy. Two months after finishing treatment, she experienced a new symptom.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“I started having terrible shooting pains across my forehead and neck,” she says. “I assumed they were delayed reactions to the radiation.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii styles_portrait__NEQhG"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-03/Beth-Riehle-tongue-cancer-mc-250331-04-597f8f.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-03/Beth-Riehle-tongue-cancer-mc-250331-04-597f8f.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-03/Beth-Riehle-tongue-cancer-mc-250331-04-597f8f.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-03/Beth-Riehle-tongue-cancer-mc-250331-04-597f8f.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-03/Beth-Riehle-tongue-cancer-mc-250331-04-597f8f.jpg" alt="Beth Riehle tongue cancer"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;After undergoing radiation and chemotherapy for Stage 4 tongue cancer, Beth Riehle thought she was cancer free. Sadly, two months later doctors found a new tumor, which was a recurrence of her cancer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;Courtesy Beth Riehle &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;In September 2024, she visited an emergency room and doctors admitted her to the hospital. She also underwent a CT scan to check that the cancer was gone. Days later, doctors shared some more upsetting news. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“They told me my cancer was ‘treatment resistant,’” Riehle says. “I had a recurrence and a second tumor.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Riehle began treatment at MD Anderson Cancer Center. Doctors recommended that she undergo the surgery to remove the tumor and most of her tongue, a procedure that’s called a glossectomy. She felt worried about the surgery and what life after would be like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“Doctors told me I’d have a 50/50 chance of speaking again,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The same day that she learned she needed surgery, her fiancé, Donald, proposed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“He made what was the worst day of my life also one of the most memorable,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;Tongue cancer in young women&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Tongue cancer has long been associated with older men who smoke, chew tobacco and drink alcohol. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“It is unusual for someone who’s young, less than 40 years of age without the traditional risk factors to develop a tongue cancer like this,” Dr. Karen Choi, a head and neck surgeon at MD Anderson Cancer Center and one of Riehle’s doctors, tells TODAY.com. “Although oral cavity cancer typically affects the older male population, we are actually seeing a rise of this type of cancer in young patients.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;More people under 45, especially woman, are being diagnosed with tongue cancer, and experts are unsure why. The type of cancer Riehle has is not associated with &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/disease/cancer-vaccine-hpv-rcna195393" target="_blank"&gt;HPV&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“These patients don’t necessarily have those risk factors that we associate with that type of cancer,” Choi says. “We don’t really know what that is. We just know the incidence has been increasing over the last several decades.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Choi adds that knowing the signs of tongue cancer and seeking care can lead to an earlier diagnosis. Symptoms of tongue cancer include: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="break-above body-ul body-list-el"&gt;&lt;li&gt;An ulcer that lasts more than two weeks  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pain in the same spot when eating and drinking&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;An ulcer that bleeds&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Many people visit a dentist first. If the dentist rules out dental problems and the symptoms persist, Choi says to follow up with your primary care doctor, who can make a referral to an ENT or oral surgeon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Treatment for tongue cancer can include radiation, chemotherapy and surgery. The earlier the cancer is found, the better the outlook. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii styles_portrait__NEQhG"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-03/Beth-Riehle-tongue-cancer-mc-250331-02-9e454f.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-03/Beth-Riehle-tongue-cancer-mc-250331-02-9e454f.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-03/Beth-Riehle-tongue-cancer-mc-250331-02-9e454f.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-03/Beth-Riehle-tongue-cancer-mc-250331-02-9e454f.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-03/Beth-Riehle-tongue-cancer-mc-250331-02-9e454f.jpg" alt="Beth Riehle tongue cancer"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;Beth Riehle has undergo radiation, chemotherapy and surgery to treat her Stage 4 tongue cancer. She's now looking forward to visiting Hawaii with her fiance and planning their wedding.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;Courtesy Beth Riehle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“If you have an early stage cancer, meaning cancer that is small, has not spread to the lymph nodes in the neck, generally prognosis is good,” Choi says. “The larger the tumor is, or if the cancer has started to spread to the lymph nodes in the neck, then prognosis does go down.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;‘A powerful experience’ &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;At the end of November 2024, Riehle underwent a 12-hour- glossectomy. Doctors removed 80% of her tongue and 75 lymph nodes from her neck and created a “flap” in her mouth, using some of a muscle from her leg. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Prior to surgery, she had a feeding tube placed because eating was too painful from so much radiation to her head and neck. During surgery, doctors also gave her a tracheotomy to help her breathe. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“There’s so much swelling ... in the back of the throat. Putting a tracheotomy tube allows us to bypass that swelling so she can breathe comfortably,” Choi explains. “Once the swelling resolves and goes down enough that it’s not blocking off the airway from the mouth and nose pathway, the trach can be removed.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Riehle remembers "doing so well after surgery. It was the first time I had been cancer-free in almost a year, so my body was really receptive to recovery," she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;But the additional 30 radiation sessions and living without her full tongue have taken a toll.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;While Riehle felt pleasantly surprised the first time she spoke after surgery, she struggles to open her mouth due to tightness in her jaw muscles, a condition called trismus, common in people being treated for head and neck cancers, the &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/24086-trismus" target="_blank"&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt; notes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“I have mouth sores and mucositis, which is when you overproduce thick secretions. It’s difficult to swallow and talk,” she adds. “I’m exhausted, if I’m being honest."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Riehle also attends speech therapy to improve her ability swallow, speak and open her mouth. Her goal one day is to be able to put a prosthetic in her mouth to make her speech clearer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“(Your tongue) is such an integral part of life — food, air communication,” she says. “I’ve had to re-learn how to do just about everything your mouth functions for.”  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;She feels pleased to learn that, despite the pain and uncertainty of what’s she’s been through in the past year, she’s still herself. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“I’ve learned that given the circumstances, I can still manage to laugh and make others laugh,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;As part of her recovery, Riehle began posting “fit checks” on social media.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“I wanted to use &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@isthisriehlelife" target="_blank"&gt;TikTok&lt;/a&gt; to track my progress as far as my speech,” she says. “I also thought that by putting my experience out there, I might be able to help someone else my age or someone going through my experience in the way I wished for when I was first diagnosed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;At the end of February, Riehle finished radiation and had her trach removed. Sometimes, she marvels at what she's been through. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“I never in a million years thought I would be strong enough,” she says. “There’s a deep sense of bravery and the ability to overcome the adversity inside us.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Riehle found a group called &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/disease/rise-tongue-cancer-young-women-rcna96249?search=Young%20Tongues" target="_blank"&gt;Young Tongues&lt;/a&gt;, which offers support to young people with tongue cancer, and she’s received encouragement after going viral on social media. Finding community helps and motivates her to share her story to be there for others. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“I’ve had people who have undergone the same surgery as me find me and show appreciation for giving a voice to a group of people who aren’t necessarily represented,” she says. “It’s been a powerful experience and an important reminder of vulnerability’s place in our lives.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>TODAY.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 31 Mar 2025 19:05:48 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihwFBVV95cUxNS2xLYS1JS3hfNzVfSzNXZVdfbUlVaGsyY0dCLUFfWHM1ZWh1TE9qN1dhYkExd2JtVy1jUThHd1BDeU1hMlZPSmtTWVhaRFdyZWtnWEpyYm1YMlZmaHREczFYUERnY2syOGpNUHE4RjBXcDBzMEduQ1VGVktCcDgxSkh5RXFuYVXSAVRBVV95cUxOU0RFd2RGeERHVUxjOXExS1htYVZEV2pxNzVPdE1EcXcxOThLOVYzc2VBbkVOcF9lZlVQRWl6eGhlc0x4MmRlbFh5djBLakZhWHU3SnI</guid></item><item><title>What to know about vitamin A's toxic risks after RFK Jr. promotes it for measles - Axios</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiAFBVV95cUxQcmwtbWg3NUVocmdWaF92SC1MU0RoaURBUHdVVWVCUE1qbXVqekdtVldXWmJoX25KZVpiUERLLVFJUTlJcnRQemhxT1pEczFmbFZzaVEyaGFtRG01NzNGX3JpLXR6RHd4eVBXOVEwVFh5RUlyQmtiMUZjOVRPN1hRUUNNeFlIVlVY?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Axios</author><pubDate>Mon, 31 Mar 2025 19:02:31 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiAFBVV95cUxQcmwtbWg3NUVocmdWaF92SC1MU0RoaURBUHdVVWVCUE1qbXVqekdtVldXWmJoX25KZVpiUERLLVFJUTlJcnRQemhxT1pEczFmbFZzaVEyaGFtRG01NzNGX3JpLXR6RHd4eVBXOVEwVFh5RUlyQmtiMUZjOVRPN1hRUUNNeFlIVlVY</guid></item><item><title>I'm a doctor... and your sleeping position reveals a lot about your health - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqAFBVV95cUxQSzRJdE1WeUZiN3E1RnhtS0lLMnZ1dUFFd3M0V0lUTmt0aERlLTE5RHZETi1sZWFtWTRpdEVTeVdvRVYxbmhudTBLRGVWZEJqVUtVbUpUY0NSTE00dG1pa2ZEenZsRnNKRzdoTnpHaFJHSUNrUHFIN3B0WVpBcEJZcXFmOHVaQy02cVhtY28za1JMeUU3cjZ0MWlUWVhGNXhha3JIdG80SjfSAa4BQVVfeXFMTUloNmVWY1J4MkVWbnNWQTU0eFpPY1Rhd21NTFhVYUYxZ0MyYzhXNHZ6YlM0YURaQ19ibjdOc0Q1cGRqLTJUZEx5RFpBWjZzZmxDUlNfck1qajdPNThOZUFrYWk0dzBzRGJFWnRSWTdfSnpFNFNjNHQ3NURBVjRLYV8wa04temd2d1ZRcF9UZTZrYUVudXdQUl9ZZUxaNktuZk84cTktTVQyT1dqem9n?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A professional psychologist has revealed the five most common sleeping positions that suggest you may be under high stress. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Kyle Osbourne, a clinical psychologist at Ancora Psychiatric Hospital in Philadelphia, said &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/femail/article-14495773/why-waking-middle-night-diet-stress.html"&gt;stress and sleep quality are closely linked&lt;/a&gt;, with stress impacting sleep and poor sleep exacerbating stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When you are under stress, your body releases cortisol, a critical hormone in managing your body’s reaction to stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In addition to controlling our sleep-wake cycle, cortisol helps us regulate our metabolism and reduce inflammation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Prolonged, elevated cortisol levels or chronic stress can disrupt these processes, leading to inflammation, chronic pain, anxiety, &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/depression/index.html" id="mol-9c1ab490-0e4a-11f0-b85f-af5a12500c95" class=""&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt; and even the progression of Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This link between sleep and stress can also interfere with the production of melatonin, a hormone that helps your body sleep properly. Low amounts of melatonin can lead to sleep disorders such as insomnia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts note that the sleeping on your side is the best position but when under stress, you may contort yourself into positions such as the Flamingo or Mountain Climber. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;Below, DailyMail.com details the common sleeping positions Dr Osbourne says are clear indicators of the body and mind being in stress: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;This link between sleep and stress can also interfere with the production of melatonin, a hormone that helps your body sleep properly and lead to sleep disorders such as insomnia&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;The Mummy &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Similarly to a mummy in a burial shroud, this style refers to lying flat on the back with the legs extended straight out and the arms crossed over the chest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While the mummy style of sleeping can help reduce snoring, sleep apnea and improve spinal alignment, sleeping stiffly with your arms crossed over your chest can also indicate you're feeling anxious, defensive or frustrated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Your arm position may also show a yearning for comfort or a subconscious attempt to protect oneself, potentially suggesting underlying stress or anxiety. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;The Tree-Climber&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Also known as the spread-out position, the tree-climber involves lying on your stomach with your arms extended up at 90 degrees and one of your legs pulled upward also at 90 degrees. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At times, underlying stress can cause muscle tension, making it difficult to find a comfortable sleeping position and forcing a person to resort to sleeping on their stomach. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, this can worsen previous health conditions such as snoring, sleep apnea aggravation, back or neck pain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Kyle Osbourne, a clinical psychologist at Ancora Psychiatric Hospital, Philadelphia, recently noted that stress and sleep quality are closely linked, with stress impacting sleep and poor sleep exacerbating stress&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Michael Breus, a clinical psychologist explained to &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/sleep-newzzz/201903/your-sleep-position-affects-much-more-than-you-think#:~:text=What%20are%20the%20downsides%20of,lead%20to%20less%20restful%20sleep."&gt;Psychology Today&lt;/a&gt;: 'Stomach sleeping can be hard on your back and neck, causing additional pain and discomfort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'That's because when you're stretched out on your stomach, it's practically impossible to keep your spine and neck aligned and not under pressure. Your neck is turned at a 90-degree angle from the rest of your body and elevated by your pillow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'That's a recipe for neck pain and strain. Sleeping on your stomach causes a pronounced curve in your spine - it's sort of like sleeping in a back bend all night - which puts pressure on your lower back and can cause pain and stiffness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Stomach sleeping also pushes your face into your pillow, which can lead to more wrinkles and signs of aging.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Furthermore, sleeping with your arms at angle that leaves them above your head can lead to numbness or tingling in your hands or arms due to pressure on nerves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Pillow Stacker &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While having all your favorite pillows under your neck may give you comfort and help your acid reflux, it can cause stress, fatigue and mental health issues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lifting your head too much or using too many pillows can lead to neck ache, which can affect sleep quality and cause discomfort. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A poor night's sleep increases fatigue and a lack of energy, which can cause irritability and affect your mental health in the long run. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, a prolonged lack of sleep can also lead to a range of health issues, including increased risk of obesity, diabetes, heart disease as well as impaired immune function and cognitive decline. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Research suggests that sleeping with just one pillow is best as it raises the head only slightly so that both the head and neck are aligned. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;As of 2025, about 70 percent of Americans say they usually sleep on their sides, 19 percent on their backs and 12 percent on their stomachs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;The Fetal position&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The baby, or fetal sleep position, is where a person sleeps on their side with their legs curled up and their arms either hugged around them or kept close to the chest - mimicking the position of a fetus in the womb. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While the posture can improve blood circulation, it may indicate sensitivity and anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;When faced with extreme stress, our bodies naturally resort to the 'self-soothing' fetal position, much like an infant would - suggesting that person may be unconsciously  self-soothing themselves. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;According to&lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.wellandgood.com/lifestyle/what-does-your-sleeping-position-mean-mental-health"&gt; Dr Aarti Grover&lt;/a&gt;, Medical Director for the Center for Sleep at Tufts Medical Center: 'Sleeping in the fetal position has been associated with people who have anxiety and need comfort.' &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, the position can also cause knee pain as the ligaments around the knees and hips become inflamed due to the constant flexion occurring at those joints. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Prolonged, elevated cortisol levels or chronic stress can disrupt these processes, leading to inflammation, chronic pain, anxiety, depression and even the progression of Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;The Flamingo &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This sleeping position is when a person sleeps on their back with one leg bent and pulled towards the body while the other remains straight - how a flamingo sleeps in the wild.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;While some people find this position comfortable and relaxing as it can help with spinal alignment and reduce pressure on certain areas, others believe it is a sign of heightened stress or nervous system activity.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;However, there is limited scientific evidence to support this claim. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Apart from this, sleeping on your back can potentially lead to snoring and sleep apnea. At times, it may also cause acid reflux. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr. Lois Krahn, a Mayo Clinic sleep specialist explained: 'I know many people find it to be comfortable, because they're not putting weight on their joints. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'Sleeping on the back means that your tongue and jaw can fall down and crowd your airway. And many people snore more on their back.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

The virus is typically transmitted through the saliva of an infected animal via bites and open wounds, such as scratches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/can-you-transplant-an-organ-more-than-once" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/can-you-transplant-an-organ-more-than-once"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can you transplant an organ more than once?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rabies is almost always fatal once symptoms appear. The time it takes from exposure to symptoms appearing varies from weeks to months, but symptoms usually occur sooner &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/hcp/suspected-human-rabies/index.html" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/hcp/suspected-human-rabies/index.html" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;when the wound is closer to the brain&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Symptoms initially resemble the flu (fever, headache, weakness) but progress to neurological issues such as confusion, hallucinations, paralysis, hydrophobia (fear of water), and eventually coma and death. Fewer than 20 people have ever survived rabies after symptoms presented, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Around 10 people die from rabies in the U.S. each year, the CDC estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/php/protecting-public-health/index.html" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/php/protecting-public-health/index.html" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;According to the CDC&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the vast majority of U.S. rabies cases are a result of exposure to bats, raccoons, skunks and foxes.

In a statement, the CDC said that the organ donor was exposed to rabies from a wild animal in Idaho five weeks before they died and their organ was transplanted, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://abcnews.go.com/Health/michigan-resident-dies-rabies-after-undergoing-organ-transplant/story?id=120217114" target="_blank" data-url="https://abcnews.go.com/Health/michigan-resident-dies-rabies-after-undergoing-organ-transplant/story?id=120217114" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;ABC News&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reports. The donor had not died with "traditional rabies symptoms," and they had not sought out medical help or notified public health officials after their exposure to the animal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After an animal bite, rabies can be prevented with post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP). This includes immediately washing the wound with soap and water for at &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/when-to-seek-care/index.html" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/when-to-seek-care/index.html" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;least 15 minutes&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/hcp/prevention-recommendations/post-exposure-prophylaxis.html" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/hcp/prevention-recommendations/post-exposure-prophylaxis.html" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;receiving four or five doses&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of the rabies vaccine over the course of 14 days after the bite. The vaccine helps the immune system produce antibodies against the rabies virus. If the person has never been vaccinated against rabies, they will also receive rabies immune globulin (RIG) on the day of the bite, which provides immediate passive immunity while the vaccine triggers the body's own immune response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/php/protecting-public-health/index.html" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/php/protecting-public-health/index.html" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;800,000 people&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; receive rabies-related medical care from local or state health departments around the U.S. every year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several cases of rabies being contracted from a transplanted organ have been reported in the past. A 2005 study in the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa043018" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa043018" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reported that four recipients of kidneys, a liver, and piece of an artery died as a result of the donor having contracted rabies from a bat, and a 2020 study in the journal &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://journals.lww.com/transplantjournal/fulltext/2020/09003/rabies_acquired_through_kidney_transplantation_in.558.aspx" target="_blank" data-url="https://journals.lww.com/transplantjournal/fulltext/2020/09003/rabies_acquired_through_kidney_transplantation_in.558.aspx" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Transplantation&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; revealed that a 5-year-old girl and another recipient died of rabies after a kidney transplant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="other-organ-recipients-saved-3"&gt;Other organ recipients saved&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In addition to the organ donor's kidney, doctors implanted corneal grafts from the donor's eyes into three different patients in three states," the latest CDC statement read. "Based on the concerning symptoms of the kidney recipient who died, CDC worked with Missouri health officials to intercept a fourth corneal graft before it could be implanted into a Missouri resident."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of the patients who had received transplants of the donor's corneal tissue have since been given rabies post-exposure prophylaxis shots and are in good health, the CDC says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cases like this are still extremely rare and should not discourage patients from receiving life-saving organ transplants, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.uofmhealth.org/profile/1185/daniel-richard-kaul-md" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.uofmhealth.org/profile/1185/daniel-richard-kaul-md" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dr. Daniel Kaul&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a clinical professor at the University of Michigan's Infectious Disease Clinic who was not involved in the treatment, told local broadcaster &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oc15JRLBnFM" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oc15JRLBnFM" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;WOOD TV8&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

However, donors are excluded if they report having rabies or show any visible symptoms of rabies infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The MDHHS noted that all health care providers and anyone else exposed to the Michigan transplant patient have been assessed for rabies exposure and given PEP if necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

However, how &lt;em&gt;many&lt;/em&gt; calories you burn on a given walk depends on a few factors, like your pace and terrain, and other aspects of your lifestyle, such as your nutrition, says Andres Padilla, CPT, a certified personal trainer, USATF Level 1-certified run coach, and board-certified exercise physiologist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meet the experts:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://ap3personaltraining.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Andres Padilla;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Andres Padilla&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, CPT, is a certified personal trainer, USATF Level 1-certified run coach, and board-certified exercise physiologist in Corona, California. &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/kristinaturnure/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Kristina Turnure;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Kristina Turnure&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, CPFT, an ACSM-certified personal trainer and exercise physiologist in Columbus, Ohio. &lt;a href="https://studioksl.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Katrina Scott;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Katrina Scott&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, CPT, a NASM-certified personal trainer and founder of fitness app Studio KSL.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, there’s a general range of calories you might burn while walking 10,000 steps. Ahead, learn that number—and how to burn more calories for an even better workout and higher chance of reaping weight loss benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How many calories does 10,000 steps burn?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walking 10,000 steps can burn anywhere from 300 to 600 calories, says Padilla. So, “it's definitely a good benchmark or baseline" when it comes to overall health and fitness, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where you fall in that range—and whether it’s enough to achieve weight loss goals—depends on these factors, say Padilla and Kristina Turnure, CPFT, an ACSM-certified personal trainer and exercise physiologist:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gender&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Age&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Height&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weight&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heart rate&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall activity level&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pace&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Incline&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Resistance level&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Terrain&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cadence&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;And, of course, you’ll also want to pay attention to your diet if you want to lose weight. One way to achieve weight loss goals is by eating in a &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/weight-loss/a35116575/what-is-calorie-deficit/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:caloric deficit;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;caloric deficit&lt;/a&gt;, or taking in fewer calories than you burn, Turnure explains. So, you might not necessarily need to walk 10,000 steps to lose weight—you may see weight loss results at 8,000 steps if you’re in a calorie deficit, while someone else may have to walk 12,000-plus steps to achieve that deficit, Turnure says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How To Calculate How Many Calories Your Body Burns When Walking 10,000 Steps&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Want to get really technical? To calculate calories burned during an activity, you’ll first need to know your Metabolic Equivalent of Task (MET): a measurement of how much energy an activity requires compared to resting, says Katrina Scott, CPT, a NASM-certified personal trainer. "Activities with higher MET values burn more calories because they require more energy," Scott explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can find your MET by using &lt;a href="https://www.convertcalculator.com/tools/met-calculator/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:this calculator;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;this calculator&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. (BTW, the experts recommend using a &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/g24738992/best-fitness-trackers/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:fitness tracker;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;fitness tracker&lt;/a&gt; or heart rate monitor anyway because they can usually provide more personalized calorie estimations, taking into account your gender, age, height, weight, heart rate, body composition, overall activity level, and more.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, try this equation: Calories burned = 0.0175 × MET × weight (kg) × time (minutes), Scott says. So, if someone weighs 130 lbs (59 kg) and walks for 60 minutes at a moderate pace of 3.3 METs, their calories burned = 0.0175 × 3.3 × 59 × 60 = 204 calories. If they walk at a brisk pace of 5.0 METs, their calories burned = 0.0175 × 5.0 × 59 × 60 = 310 calories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How To Burn More Calories While Walking&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want to lose weight, Turnure first recommends getting your daily step goal up to 8,000 to 10,000 steps for six days per week, combined with &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a42803758/beginner-workout-plan/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:strength training;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;strength training&lt;/a&gt; three to four times per week. Scott recommends also adding in stability and mobility work through stretching and yoga each week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to eating, try to consume &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/food/g45014531/this-is-what-30-grams-of-protein-looks-like/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:25 to 30 grams of protein;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;25 to 30 grams of protein&lt;/a&gt; per meal to ensure you feel full and satisfied throughout the day. Of course, if you have serious weight loss goals, you're probably best off consulting with a registered dietitian to ensure you're eating in a way that will help you lose fat effectively, says Turnure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for getting more bang from your buck during your actual walk, Scott recommends playing around with the following factors:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pace And Cadence&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;You'll burn more calories faster if you're &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a63117532/guide-to-power-walking/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:power-walking;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;power-walking&lt;/a&gt; at a brisk pace versus leisurely strolling to your favorite coffee shop or running errands. And your cadence, or how many steps you walk per minute, is directly correlated to how fast or how intensely you're walking. Turnure and Scott recommend aiming for 100 to 130 steps per minute to ensure you're walking at a brisk pace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Incline&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you've ever cranked up the &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a63250201/incline-walking-vs-stair-stepper-burn/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:incline on a treadmill;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;incline on a treadmill&lt;/a&gt; or just walked up a steep hill, it's probably felt like a challenge, even if you work out most days of the week. So, Turnure recommends upping your treadmill incline five to 10 percent to increase the intensity and burn more cals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Terrain&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to hills, walking on sand or through technical trails (like in the forest, or areas with uneven ground) will also engage more muscles and contribute to calorie burn, Turnure says. "If you have to think about things like your footing and stepping, you're going to burn more calories compared to walking with no incline on a treadmill, where you don't have to think much," Padilla adds. In addition to playing with the treadmill incline, Turnure recommends exploring different terrains once a week for 30 to 45 minutes to burn more calories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Weighted Vest&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Courtesy&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link athena-button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07RPSJT7Q?tag=syn-yahoo-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5Bartid%7C2140.a.64340517%5Bsrc%7Cyahoo-us" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:$50.99 at amazon.com;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;$50.99 at amazon.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resistance Level&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adding resistance like weighted gear also ups the intensity. Turnure advises walking with a &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/g29641621/best-weighted-vest/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:vest;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;vest&lt;/a&gt; that weighs five to 10 percent of your body weight to boost your calorie burn for extra resistance.

Ultimately, though, your walk will need to be paired with a healthy diet and proper level of intensity to be successful for weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 31 Mar 2025 18:11:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiekFVX3lxTE9YMTZaOHNNVGN1eHA3emdYTVBRRHhEaUFvcnFfT0JuZmxfTnpaTVB6QllYYXBfWmlHVEUyNXdUVHR3V1NObEYxb0tlbzVWVklRMUl5MVBiV0R6QVl6LTRCbjFSZUxQaVF0N2U3VEcwRmowdElfT0lEUGFB</guid></item><item><title>How to keep your memory sharp as you age - The Washington Post</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipAFBVV95cUxOaS1XZjM0ZkJIUUpHcWR1MlFZVXBMaWdyMUlyTGd0RWtnb0x0MXMteW1MVk1zYU1ycGRvdzNZeVNCdzF5TUdGRXBuWWVONTJSNGh6NXNUZmZCb3Z0RGZ5QWdrN1cwcjFRNXlsY3kybkFoYlk0b0ZRZEQwaXJ3R2pXZU1HbGxibmtONzFUaG9UdnQwMXoxZ05VMmxPaWlmQmFvQnJscg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="meteredContent grid-center"&gt;&lt;div class="teaser-content"&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="PMQS3XFXV5GJ5NRCVUYJGU2PTE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Consumer Reports&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt; has no financial relationship with any advertisers on this site.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="JG7SVDLACJH2FBMD7TVAG5V4OQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;With age, our brains change just as much as our bodies do — even if the shift isn’t always as noticeable. Brain volume decreases, for example, and neural connections may weaken.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-subscribe-cta" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="IDGD7BX4SZELPNI7QBW2IVUU3Y" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;These physical changes help explain the mental shifts that often come with aging, making it harder to recall a word or learn a new task. The risk of developing dementia — an umbrella term that includes Alzheimer’s disease, vascular dementia and more — rises with age, too. But there are simple habits that can reduce your risk of memory loss and dementia — and slow cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="2IMLNJTAYJECZP4KGP5YFRSF6Y" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“Think about risks and protective factors on a seesaw,” says Joel Salinas, a clinical assistant professor of neurology at the NYU Grossman School of Medicine in New York City. “Your risk on one side and things that protect you against that risk” on the other. Even if you have a significant family history of dementia, for example, “there’s just so much you can do on the protective side of the seesaw to balance it out.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="LUQUS6ZDQBCHFIHBFA23ZGKTJE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Nearly half of all dementia cases worldwide could be delayed or prevented altogether by making lifestyle and environmental changes, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(24)01296-0/abstract" target="_blank"&gt;2024 report published in the journal the Lancet&lt;/a&gt;. These same practices — which include regular physical activity, a balanced diet, stress management and good sleep — can help slow the cognitive symptoms that come with normal aging. And recent research highlights other ways you can reduce your risk of dementia and promote healthy brain aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h3 class="wpds-c-iLVUUd wpds-c-iLVUUd-bALvEi-isCenteredLayout-false" data-qa="article-header" data-contentid="CNHP5QS53JECXBLQCBATAFHKNQ" data-apitype="header" level="2" id="CNHP5QS53JECXBLQCBATAFHKNQ"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Key activities&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="C42XBRMFLBFWBPTHH5UJSJQBIM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Exercise regularly.&lt;/b&gt; Staying active enhances cognitive fitness in addition to physical fitness. People who engage in regular exercise have larger brain volumes than those who don’t. And a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9163715/" target="_blank"&gt;2022 review of 58 studies&lt;/a&gt; found that physical activity was linked to a decreased risk of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="WQ7NTHVXNJDGLFNH3GMZLDXZHM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“Even mild to moderate activity has an effect,” says Lon Schneider, a professor of psychiatry, neurology, and gerontology at the Keck School of Medicine and Leonard Davis School of Gerontology of the University of Southern California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="WK23S3PSRJFXVLUFUHSVLN6E5M" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“Of all my patients, those who have very structured and consistent exercise routines are the ones who tend to do the best,” Salinas says.

But a growing body of evidence shows that as the severity of hearing loss increases, the risk of developing dementia also rises.

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;In a study &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41588-025-02134-0" target="_blank"&gt;published today&lt;/a&gt; (31 March) in &lt;i&gt;Nature Genetics&lt;/i&gt;, the research team showed that the effect of smoking combined with other factors—such as the consumption of &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/alcohol/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;alcohol&lt;/a&gt;—could more than double the damaging effect on DNA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every year, around 750,000 new cases of head and neck cancer are diagnosed globally, with about 70% of these cases linked to preventable risk factors such as smoking. While previous research has associated alcohol with these cancers, alcohol in the absence of other risk factors is only responsible for around 4% of cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, when smoking is combined with drinking alcohol, it appears to make the DNA damage from alcohol much worse, increasing the harm by about 2.5 times compared to alcohol alone. Until now, it's not been clear exactly how the consumption of tobacco and alcohol leads to head and neck cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team behind the study is made up of scientists from five institutes, including the Wellcome Sanger Institute and the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our study maps the specific molecular scars left by &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/tobacco+smoke/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;tobacco smoke&lt;/a&gt; in head and neck cancers. By uncovering these unique patterns of DNA damage, we are not just identifying the key factors that lead to cancer formation but also unlocking possibilities for prevention which could help reduce head and neck cancer incidence around the globe," says Dr. Laura Torrens Fontanals.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;"Each cancer holds an archaeological trace—a record written in its DNA—of what originally caused it. Sequencing the whole genomes of cancers gives us a powerful lens to look for these archaeological traces, which we see as distinct patterns of damage in the genome. These &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/mutational+signatures/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;mutational signatures&lt;/a&gt; reveal both known and unknown causes of the cancer and help uncover the lifestyle factors and exposures that lead to varying cancer incidents across the globe," says Professor Sir Mike Stratton.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers, known as the Cancer Grand Challenges Mutographs team, looked at tumor samples from 265 head and neck cancer cases diagnosed in eight countries across Europe and South America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They focused on finding the "fingerprints" of tobacco-related DNA damage within these tumor samples and found six distinct patterns—several of which were previously unknown—and found that these patterns were more prevalent in countries with higher smoking rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study also found that the extent of tobacco-induced DNA damage varies depending on the specific location within the head and neck. This suggests that different tissues may respond uniquely to the harmful effects of tobacco.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to tobacco and alcohol, the study also looked at ultraviolet (UV) light. While UV light exposure is already a known risk factor for cancers on the lips, the researchers found that it might also contribute to DNA damage in the internal lining of the mouth and saw that smoking and exposure to UV together could further enhance this damage.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;p&gt;This highlights the way in which multiple environmental factors can interact and compound head and neck cancer risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings deepen understanding of the mechanisms driving head and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/neck+cancer/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;neck cancer&lt;/a&gt;, providing crucial insights into how tobacco smoke, alcohol, and UV light contribute to DNA damage. By pinpointing the exact patterns of this damage, scientists are now better equipped to explore targeted interventions—whether by blocking or repairing damage before cancer fully develops or by refining treatment approaches for those already diagnosed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"These findings represent a significant advance in our understanding of how everyday exposures—like smoking and drinking—contribute to cancer development. Not only does this research underscore the critical need for prevention, it also lays the groundwork for developing tailored therapies that address the specific genetic alterations caused by these risk factors," says Dr. David Scott.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She added: 'It can be missed as a potential ADHD symptom because it looks like intentional laziness and lack of motivation.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The ADHD Centre says chronic procrastination can lead to problems in the workplace and at home, and it can also take an emotional toll, with feelings of shame, guilt or frustration stemming from not being able to complete simple tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While it can be difficult for people with ADHD to start a task, O'Shea says once they do start, they can often find themselves hyperfocusing on it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She explains: 'Hyperfocus is a symptom that can easily be missed because it looks like the person is only motivated to do certain activities. It's sometimes mistaken as selfishness and overzealousness.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Attention Deficit Association says that hyperfocus likely happens due to the way the ADHD brain is wired.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It notes: 'A deficiency in dopamine, a chemical messenger of the brain, changes how the ADHD brain perceives reward and manages attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'As a result, managing your attention can be more difficult, making it easier to slip into hyperfocus.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another lesser-known symptom of undiagnosed ADHD is an out-of-control shopping habit. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts say impulsive spending could be another sign of ADHD as the disorder impacts impulse control. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Studies have indicated that, on average, ADHD-related impulse spending costs individuals around $2,000 per year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Mareen Dennis, a psychological practitioner with the University of Kentucky Department of Psychiatry, says some of the things people with ADHD can do to prevent impulse spending include using cash only in stores and deleting card and other payment information from online stores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Running late all the time could be another subtle indicator you have ADHD, as the condition makes it trickier to keep track of time and focus on getting ready within a certain time frame. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Explaining how 'time blindness' might present itself, O'Shea says: 'You might know the exact time of an appointment, but leave the house at that time rather than in advance to give yourself room to travel there, park and sign yourself in.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If you suddenly find yourself flying into a rage over a small thing, the experts say this too could be a symptom of ADHD, as the condition makes it difficult to regulate emotions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The experts highlight that ADHD is often linked to abnormal eating patterns because of the inability to plan time well and keep focused on tasks (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This, O'Shea notes, is related to the difficulties that can come with managing attention and directing energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Regarding the extreme ADHD emotional mood swings, the Attention Deficit Association says: 'Imagine if traffic lights skipped yellow and went straight from green to red without warning - driving under these conditions would be very stressful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'If you have ADHD, handling your emotions might feel a bit like this. You may be calm and happy one moment. Then, without any warning, a small trigger can flip your emotions from green to red.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Forgetting to eat isn't just because the workday is busy, it could also be a sign of ADHD. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The experts highlight ADHD is often linked to abnormal eating patterns because of the inability to plan time well and keep focused on tasks.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, binge eating - when you uncontrollably eat a large amount of food in a short amount of time - is most commonly associated with the condition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Duke University estimates about 30 percent of adults with binge eating disorder, also have a history of ADHD. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Roberto Olivardia, a clinical psychologist who specializes in the treatment of ADHD and eating disorders, says many individuals with the condition are on a 'see food diet... If they see it, they eat it.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To overcome this, he suggests portioning meals in advance and practicing mindfulness while eating so you know when to stop when full.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sleep disorders are also linked to ADHD, and the Sleep Foundation reveals that children with the neurological condition are also more likely to experience nightmares. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They say that ADHD-related sleep problems such as insomnia may be 'a side effect of impaired arousal, alertness, and regulation circuits in the brain'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Although some studies have suggested that these problems can also be 'traced to a delayed circadian rhythm with a later onset of melatonin production (the sleep hormone).'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;On a similar theme, constant restlessness or fidgeting is something experts say to watch out for. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;O'Shea added: 'Adults [with ADHD] are more likely to show restlessness through having to get up and pace around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'They might not be able to sit through a movie without talking or getting out their phone.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The restlessness caused by ADHD might also make it more difficult to make decisions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While some decisions might be impulsive, others might need more time to process.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Touching on why this happens, O'Shea says: 'This is a result of controlling attention well enough to sort through the pros and cons of a decision and remember what you were thinking.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Moving to the final subtle sign, the experts say it is important to reflect on how you communicate with others, as this could be an indicator of your brain health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Due to increased impulsivity and a lack of ability to regulate emotions, ADHD can make communicating difficult. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Patients might have difficulties focusing on conversations, actively listening, staying on topic and remembering details discussed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They might also cause offense by interrupting others, speaking before thinking and making regretful statements as their emotions get the better of them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If you're diagnosed with ADHD, the condition can be managed to decrease the severity of symptoms. Many people use medication to help deal with the side effects, with the recommended drugs including stimulants and non-stimulants. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Healthcare providers often prescribe antidepressants, as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 31 Mar 2025 17:34:25 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilwFBVV95cUxQSXNLSjJ5LUdleWR0M3BSUC02cllab0J5NDlER1hjWWd1U3pOMkZpVzVJTlFKOXRkdjkzczQ4eWE3U2xFU051ZV84SnBiV0lWY1RiWlo0OWFEVVlHaUQ0WjluY0Z4SE4xWXJFQWE1Tkg0NXo2QjJ5OWVMSU1wT3pmWE1fSDhRM2hMOGVwS05jM3VZWk84bUtv0gGcAUFVX3lxTE5JNFpFODZkV1o4NzlrT1AtRlcwY3pKUVNxVk1SOVpUeVBjaDdreWd2LWoyQnVKbTNqRGlodnlNbG45MVRaZ2RtTERnbkxaTlNnM3diZmo3eXNldXJQTlRmdDlYNFZJNGJIb3dyZ1BtMVhmMjZQWUM1VmJxaVJhTXVJMTRDc0RMS0djZjd1NThQSWxJaEdRaUFSVkdOaQ</guid></item><item><title>NAD Supplements Promise to Improve Energy, Metabolism, and Longevity.

Think of NAD+ as the builder of energy, and NADH as the transporter, ensuring cells get the power they need. Both work together to keep everything running smoothly.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="benefits" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the benefits of NAD?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because it’s a vital part of how your DNA works, NAD has a variety of different and useful functions in the body. A couple of the main ones are energy levels, metabolism support, skin health, &lt;a href="https://www.gq.com/story/boost-your-immunity" target="_blank"&gt;immune system&lt;/a&gt; and DNA repair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But how exactly does that all work? As Dr. Rishi Mandavia, managing director at &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.drtatiana.co.uk/" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.drtatiana.co.uk/"}' href="https://www.drtatiana.co.uk/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Doctors Tatiana + Rishi Advanced Aesthetics&lt;/a&gt;, says it’s all about energy conversion. “NAD plays a big role in your metabolism, which is how your body turns food into energy. It helps with key processes that produce ATP [adenosine triphosphate], the energy your cells need to function. Without enough NAD, your body's ability to create energy slows down, making it harder for your cells to do their jobs.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NAD can also be an anti-aging boost as well. “NAD is linked to anti-aging because it helps repair cells, protect against damage and support healthy function in things like DNA repair and mitochondrial health,” says Mandavia. “Since NAD+ levels naturally decline as we age, keeping those levels higher might help slow some signs of aging—though more research is needed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s more: NAD can also have an effect on “&lt;a href="https://www.gq.com/story/how-to-deal-with-stress" target="_blank"&gt;managing stress&lt;/a&gt;, immune function and regulating your body's internal clock, or circadian rhythms,” says Mandavia. “It also helps control how genes are expressed, which can impact overall health and longevity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="take" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can you take a NAD supplement?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s where it gets a tiny bit more complicated. NAD supplements can be delivered in both an oral form (usually as a tablet, but also a powder) as well as an intravenous or intramuscular injection. The benefits of correct supplement taking should include higher energy levels, boosted metabolism, better stress management and &lt;a href="https://www.gq.com/story/how-to-sleep-better-according-to-sleep-experts" target="_blank"&gt;improved sleep&lt;/a&gt;, among other things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But health professionals have differing opinions on what is the most effective, if effective at all, way to take NAD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Harpal Bains, a longevity doctor and the medical director at &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.harpalclinic.co.uk/" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.harpalclinic.co.uk/"}' href="https://www.harpalclinic.co.uk/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Harpal Clinic&lt;/a&gt; (which &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.harpalclinic.co.uk/iv-drips/nad-iv-drip/" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.harpalclinic.co.uk/iv-drips/nad-iv-drip/"}' href="https://www.harpalclinic.co.uk/iv-drips/nad-iv-drip/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;offers NAD+ IV drips&lt;/a&gt;), says IV is more effective than oral supplements, as “NAD+ supplements in oral form are unstable and have poor bioavailability, as it has to bypass your gut acid and enzymes to reach your cells. When taken by injection or intravenously, bioavailability is much better and most people can feel its effects straight away, especially with intravenous NAD+ infusions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mandavia’s opinion is that there is not enough evidence to support the effectiveness of NAD intravenous injections, saying: “There is currently a paucity of evidence to support NAD injections or intravenous infusions. This may be because NAD is an unstable molecule that does not survive long in a solution. Furthermore, NAD+ itself does not easily cross the cell membrane due to its large and charged structure. However, cells can take up precursors of NAD+, such as nicotinamide or nicotinic acid, which can then be converted into NAD+ inside the cell.” Those precursors are usually what are found within supplements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>GQ</author><pubDate>Mon, 31 Mar 2025 17:09:46 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiTEFVX3lxTFBLOVplMXFwd3k4N2haMU5uQmxMeXhNM2pfOV9Db3NNNkt3NFBaSTJmZXUzY0dzNUFTakV2bVhKTFpzQlNnOE9pTGRHVzE</guid></item><item><title>Faced with measles, Texas healthcare workers confront ‘information warfare’ - Al Jazeera</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="wysiwyg css-mkhf1y"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In her work at hospitals or in-home healthcare, Parker explained she has often talked to patients about the importance of vaccines. Some listen. Many don’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Parker has seen plenty of misinformation and disinformation over the years, she said the COVID-19 pandemic made matters worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There was a petri dish there just waiting for that mess to proliferate,” she said in reference to vaccine scepticism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“And then the right wind came along, and it blew those spores all over the place: the spores of ignorance and misinformation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rekha Lakshmanan observed something similar. She is the chief strategic officer for The Immunization Partnership, a Houston-based nonprofit that aims to eradicate preventable diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She argued that Texas has long been a site of vaccine misinformation. But the pandemic “made the nation catch up with Texas”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;False rumours flooded the internet, warning that vaccines could alter DNA or render people infertile. Some conspiracy theories even posited that the vaccine could be used for implanting chips into patients’ bodies for surveillance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not all vaccine sceptics believe the misinformation. The way Lakshmanan sees it, vaccine hesitancy falls on a continuum. At the far end, there are those who cannot be convinced to get a vaccine, regardless of the data you present. Unfortunately, she said, that’s the loudest group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, others can be convinced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You have to take a step back and see that there’s a bigger part of that continuum that’s parents, and they just have questions,” Lakshmanan said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She explained that parents are often sifting through reams of misinformation, trying to understand what is real and what isn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, the anti-vaccine organisation Children’s Health Defense recently published a website that bore a striking resemblance to materials published by the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But its site was riddled with disinformation about vaccines. Kennedy, who served as a leader at Children’s Health Defense before joining the government, ultimately ordered the organisation to take the site down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The challenge with misinformation is that it could look legit,” Lakshmanan said, “which is why we have to approach these conversations with empathy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That includes arguments about “parents’ rights”, which she says is entirely misleading. Anti-vaccine leaders like Kennedy have accused the government of forcing vaccination on parents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No one has ever said we should take away parents’ rights,” Lakshmanan told Al Jazeera. “It’s a red herring.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Al Jazeera</author><pubDate>Mon, 31 Mar 2025 16:41:23 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitAFBVV95cUxPd0szMW94WGoyWm9oaVMxbUlId1ktaGRHTzRvUzBhQTBYWEtTeUhLNnBFRE9MNXVIRTBZNmR1NmF2OVpDSkZuaFJoeFc3S2lXN0R4ZFFITk9qWVViU01GMVZ2cktOSWhQRzh5S3l6MENfM3Q1dVMybFpOVlNzRzNGRFZ1Qm9hUmtyOFhral9aWExVYjdHWXZhTUdKM29MQ3FPR0V0VExTVmQxLV8yRFR0SkRuVmXSAboBQVVfeXFMTUNGaE5pVVMxeEYwbWh6dnZfTlBiQmppOTRHVzExWkVIczI1WEw4cXlvenNjY0ZXcWMyMHpET3J0cFE5QmxYNl8yc0JNbnZORlQyUVN4RTh3RjBhUVMycUhua1hkQ2w4THZRN3hvaTBsU3YwNTlpRG5iOWlYSTVFX3MxNHNBd3FYVlhRejE0VHI3SFZwVlJpeTBkTktER1ZJNUp0ZGpCenEwZnlobnVQU2tGSUVRMFdQel9n</guid></item><item><title>‘Worst fears are coming true’ about Trump cabinet member (Hint: It’s not Hegseth) - NJ.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMitwFBVV95cUxPOXdmeGk0QlFmMFpnVHFUT3RfR1lMbE1PSC04RWhpMk5kMHR4dnhxQUo1UFZJMXJoS09ZTVpOQVgzWl9RNUgyLVJoc2RVcGJjYzhwVzU4V2RPY0xQTFhVRE5CU3RtM2ZxNnlYS3VHenFMc0xmYVUtR1JNLWFIRE9oXzdWQjZDMFJNbVdKX3FyQ2RwQzMtdmlxNHlqUGhRcmhNUlBIMHA2V0NVN0tYQjlLc21wRU1pU3PSAcsBQVVfeXFMTkdVdkVlTGp6aDAxWW8tMmhObHFuSUV3LU5Qdmh4alc1NlF5elNOSUYwWC0wUVNJUVhKYWZ2U0dwS1ZLc3B3UVZ3dF9pUXZtNGhTS19BU0NxZzh6dE9NM0djTUxuVG9jbTZqOEhJMFpBRHhubmZQS2JibHNtcFlxdnZwclVqLXlUdG5wbDhKc3BJM3lNU2lVRVdqczNRaVlabjgycVZQT3BnWnlXVC1laEZoVFN5YkZXazJRcS1vQzRlbFctTm1mRVpZck0?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__image-wrapper"&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source media="(max-width: 500px)" srcset="https://www.nj.com/resizer/v2/RL54TUBPCFFLZMA55DH42R6IWQ.jpg?auth=a7fb9dbd7e532d333049d254af3a3e3e282e82ec7126a5d5286e679ddb649ded&amp;amp;width=500&amp;amp;quality=90 500w"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="https://www.nj.com/resizer/v2/RL54TUBPCFFLZMA55DH42R6IWQ.jpg?auth=a7fb9dbd7e532d333049d254af3a3e3e282e82ec7126a5d5286e679ddb649ded&amp;amp;width=800&amp;amp;quality=90 800w"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source srcset="https://www.nj.com/resizer/v2/RL54TUBPCFFLZMA55DH42R6IWQ.jpg?auth=a7fb9dbd7e532d333049d254af3a3e3e282e82ec7126a5d5286e679ddb649ded&amp;amp;width=1280&amp;amp;quality=90 1280w"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.nj.com/resizer/v2/RL54TUBPCFFLZMA55DH42R6IWQ.jpg?auth=a7fb9dbd7e532d333049d254af3a3e3e282e82ec7126a5d5286e679ddb649ded&amp;amp;width=500&amp;amp;quality=90" sizes="50vw" fetchpriority="high" loading="eager" alt="HHS Kennedy West Virginia" decoding="async" class="article__image-content"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="article__image-caption"&gt;&lt;p class="article__mm-image-caption-text"&gt;Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F.
