Kennedy Jr. acknowledged that the MMR vaccine prevents the spread of that virus. But later that day, he posted photos of himself with anti-vaccine doctors, calling them “extraordinary healers” and promoting unproven treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-subscribe-cta" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="2FZTBW5IHFFZ7AYLLZQL7DPLZE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In a television interview three days later, Kennedy, the nation’s top health official, encouraged vaccination for measles. In the same conversation, he cast doubt on whether one of the children had actually died of measles-related complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="23ALZADMBRAVLGXMGNBL23QZSQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;And in an interview with Phil McGraw&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;at the end of April, Kennedy said of the measles vaccine: “HHS continues to recommend that vaccine. But there are problems with the vaccine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="BQC5KWIJZRCQBDNIZORHO4ICWU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;With the nation in the grip of the deadliest measles outbreak in decades, Kennedy is equivocating with a worried U.S. public, health experts said. His mixed message appeals to vaccine believers and skeptics, muddying public health instructions at a time when clarity is essential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="NIX7RLM62BHDZGA4OFY3VW7DYA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Elevated&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;from &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/01/28/rfk-jr-disparaged-vaccines-dozens-times-recent-years-misled-race/"&gt;longtime anti-vaccine activist&lt;/a&gt; to guardian of the nation’s health, Kennedy is trying to appeal to both sides: the public, which largely supports vaccination, and the anti-vaccine hard-liners who helped propel his rise. His “doublespeak,” as public health experts and academics who follow the anti-vaccine movement&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;call it, gives him cover with both groups, allowing him to court public opinion while still assuaging his anti-vaccine base.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="0E7NKXWG8H71KDGKN3Y8PTW6HW" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;At least half of adults are uncertain whether to believe&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;false claims about measles, its vaccine and its treatment, according to &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/health-information-and-trust/poll-finding/kff-tracking-poll-on-health-information-and-trust-the-publics-views-on-measles-outbreaks-and-misinformation/"&gt;an April poll by the health-care think tank KFF&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="WWUVUYTV3BDCJOEIYKQD3AF2RA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“It’s confusing, and maybe that’s part of the strategy,” said Bruce Gellin, who oversaw HHS’s vaccine program in the Bush and Obama administrations. Gellin noted that confusion could lead parents to opt out of vaccination — exactly what health officials don’t want in an outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="BRIRXHHJ3REKFFEJGQDO4XZRSY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In a statement about vaccination, HHS said: “Secretary Kennedy’s HHS has pledged radical transparency to the American public.

Medical experts say they are safe, effective and considered one of the best tools for protecting public health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="IFZYVUE7FZC5HF75FFDKV6QUQM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;When asked about the unproven treatments Kennedy had promoted, an HHS spokesperson said Kennedy will be enlisting the scientific community and the department to “activate a scientific process to treat a host of diseases, including measles, with single or multiple existing drugs in combination with vitamins and other modalities.” It is unclear what that will entail, but Kennedy has &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/01/22/rfk-alternative-medicine-supplements/"&gt;long advocated&lt;/a&gt; the use of vitamins and supplements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="NDJP3S7ETBAKZCS7AD4TLKKEMY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Kennedy is scheduled to appear Wednesday before the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, where he is expected to face questions on his vaccine policies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="OGQTAZSSFNAUHON7QXTFYU5EIE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The outbreak in Texas has spread across the state and beyond, including a significant uptick of cases in El Paso. Experts worry the United States this year will record the largest number of cases since measles was declared eliminated a quarter-century ago. A recent study showed that if U.S. vaccination rates continue to decline, the nation could &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/04/24/measles-cases-deaths-vaccine-rates-rfk-jr/"&gt;face millions&lt;/a&gt; of cases over the next 25 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="VDYEPAQZJJGCDI6ODHC56RMTJA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Once an outbreak begins, health officials have only a short time to convince the U.S. public that vaccination is the proven way to save lives, said Chrissie Juliano, executive director of the Big Cities Health Coalition. The MMR vaccine — which protects against measles, mumps and rubella — is safe and effective, public health experts say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="KOPUHMVEJFB27PU4XYGVTECN2M" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“The public’s confused, and local and state health officials on the ground are really having to carry a whole lot of water without having … all that backup that they’re used to,” Juliano said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="XR6EC2ADK5GIXLIPB2XDBDJOO4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Some vaccine skeptics say they are also frustrated about Kennedy’s mixed messaging because he has not gone far enough to condemn immunization. But they are urging followers to stick with him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="N7FUTIC4INAKHAKCWTTBZ22534" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;After Kennedy’s social media post encouraging vaccination, the chief executive of the anti-vaccine group Kennedy founded said in a video message posted to X: “What he says does not speak for Children’s Health Defense in any way at this point.” But, Mary Holland said, “we have to respect the role that he’s in.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="TOYCFE7BUZHU7C2BWCQXWOFCGE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In an interview, Holland said she didn’t believe Kennedy considered his statement sufficient. “I don’t think he probably thinks that’s the whole story. So we have gone out with additional information,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="BOSFCC3OWREVXARVO2VMHFP3RI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;On the day&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;she posted that message, her group reached out to its subscribers: “HHS Secretary Robert F.

HHS has&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/04/08/trump-measles-vaccine-rfk-jr-response/"&gt;largely silenced&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;during the outbreak. And HHS has appointed a &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/03/25/vaccine-skeptic-hhs-rfk-immunization-autism/"&gt;vaccine skeptic&lt;/a&gt; to investigate the debunked link between vaccination and autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="4LYBVAUVYZHEFGRRVTBSKIJ5LQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The fact that anti-vaccine activists still count Kennedy as an ally shouldn’t be a surprise, said Dorit Reiss, a professor at the University of California College of the Law at San Francisco, whose research focuses on&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;public health law and anti-vaccine forces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="OANC7E6O5VGWTCVEQVSBKY6VBI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“Our health and human services secretary has been anti-vaccine for 20 years and has been the secretary for two months,” she said in April. “He’s still an anti-vaccine activist.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="DVA7FI6EGVACBIUJ56FYCFR5NQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In response, HHS said, “Secretary Kennedy is not anti-vaccine — he is pro-safety, pro-transparency, and pro-accountability.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="B5Z7L6CNBBALTDQMXKRKP6OLFE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Following the second child’s death in Texas, Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-Louisiana), leader of the Senate health committee, called on “&lt;a href="https://x.com/SenBillCassidy/status/1908903799701303633"&gt;top health officials&lt;/a&gt;” to promote vaccination. Shortly thereafter, Kennedy wrote in an &lt;a href="https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1908967854394982414"&gt;X post&lt;/a&gt; that “the most effective way to prevent the spread of measles is the MMR vaccine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="YSEHXBJ65NAAROTKVOXIKR3KGM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Hours later in a separate X post, he went on to praise the work of two local doctors who have criticized measles vaccination, and their treatment of measles patients with unproven therapies — budesonide and clarithromycin. Neither has &lt;a href="https://www.aap.org/en/news-room/fact-checked/fact-checked-budesonide-and-clarithromycin-unproven-and-risky/?srsltid=AfmBOop53YvHFGlaqvrj5SAVXnYgtlaVL2r9AKtEJxaAEnJyWBmT813X"&gt;been proved effective&lt;/a&gt; as measles treatments and both could have serious side effects, medical experts have said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="HLMMGFWGZREHVIUZ276JKKSVJA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The media “don’t notice how he de-emphasizes [vaccination] by just burying it in with a bunch of the other stuff about vitamin A, steroids, better diet, etc.,” said David Gorski, managing editor of Science-Based Medicine, a website run primarily by physicians that debunks medical misinformation. “It’s like they’ve learned nothing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="TSMSAQVLRNHIXOK2FGKROR3X7M" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Between those two statements, Kennedy drew headlines that portrayed him as a supporter of vaccines, including “Kennedy announces support for measles vaccine amid outbreak” in &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/04/06/kennedy-support-measles-vaccine-outbreak-00276021"&gt;Politico&lt;/a&gt; and “RFK Jr. makes new push for vaccine after 2nd child dies of measles” on &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/video/rfk-jr-vaccine-is-most-effective-way-to-prevent-measles-spread-236693061564"&gt;Today.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="HATBXVY8111NK1C3DZMD55JEW0" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;After a &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/04/10/rfk-jr-personal-responsibility-health-care-donuts-smoking/"&gt;CBS News interview&lt;/a&gt; released a few days later, Kennedy received similar coverage. An initial clip highlighted Kennedy saying he “&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/rfk-jr-measles-vaccine/"&gt;encourages&lt;/a&gt;” vaccination — but &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/rfk-jr-measles-vaccine/"&gt;left out the context&lt;/a&gt; of his saying he was unsure whether the second child’s death was due to measles. Kennedy also falsely stated again that vaccines are not properly safety-tested, &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/02/11/rfk-jr-vaccine-testing-concerns/?itid=ap_laurenweber_5"&gt;a claim he has made repeatedly&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ZIMALSZAPRESPJAG4OELH4FCYA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In the interview with McGraw, better known as Dr. Phil, Kennedy claimed that one of his top three priorities is “making sure the vaccines are safe.” He said, erroneously, that the mumps portion and the combination MMR vaccine were never safety-tested. Medical experts said the MMR vaccine has been monitored for decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="6QEP6HISXFFTXPWK4PWZIAQIHA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In response to questions about these claims, HHS said Kennedy would &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/04/30/rfk-jr-vaccine-testing/"&gt;institute placebo testing&lt;/a&gt; for all “new vaccines,” but it did not fully clarify what that would mean.

More than a &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2275444"&gt;dozen&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa021134"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; in peer-reviewed top journals in recent decades have rejected this link.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="X38NGWRVTX5P95RHQ6BRZZ6ZB4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;When Kennedy talks, he “mixes a blend of fact and fiction, and since he is the highest health official in the country, that’s dangerous,” said Tom Frieden, CDC director under President Barack Obama and president and chief executive of the nonprofit Resolve to Save Lives. “Health advice is best provided by doctors who are deeply experienced with the facts about vaccines, and anything that undermines trust in measles and other vaccines undermines the health and safety of our kids.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="TUWUSPZNEZHGZHICHVJVCGML2I" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;When it comes to news about measles, Kennedy allies have released information to develop a narrative around the illness before others can debunk it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="QG43PPTXGZAWZACGM674PHOTHY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;On April 5, controversial scientist Robert Malone &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2025/04/16/texas-measles-misinformation-vaccines/"&gt;was the first&lt;/a&gt; to write that “Another Texas Child Dies a Tragic Death After Recovering from Measles.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="NL3JMDE33VHWVLB2SO74QZUP6A" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;According to Malone, medical mismanagement was to blame.

Malone previously sued The Post, alleging defamation over the newspaper’s reporting on his advocacy against the coronavirus vaccine.

              &lt;p&gt;Moderna’s mRNA-based flu and covid-19 vaccine could provide the best of both worlds—if it’s actually ever approved by the Food and Drug Administration.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This week, scientists at Moderna &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2833668"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; data from a Phase III trial testing the company’s combination vaccine, codenamed mRNA-1083. Individuals given mRNA-1083 appeared to generate the same or even greater immune response compared to those given separate vaccines, the researchers found. But the FDA’s recent policy change on vaccine approvals, orchestrated by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr, could imperil the development of this and other future vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The trial involved 8,000 people split into two age groups: those between the ages of 50 and 64, and those over 65. People were randomly given mRNA-1083 (plus a placebo) or two already approved flu and covid-19 vaccines.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The vaccine seemed effective across both age groups, with mRNA-1083 participants showing at least the same level of humoral immune response (antibody-based) to circulating flu and covid-19 strains as participants who were given the separate vaccines. On average, this response was actually higher to the flu strains in particular among those given mRNA-1083. The experimental vaccine also appeared to be safe and well-tolerated, as the authors &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2833668"&gt;explained&lt;/a&gt; in their paper, published Wednesday in JAMA.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The study results are certainly encouraging, and typically they would pave the way toward a surefire FDA approval. But the political situation has changed for the worse. The Department of Health and Human Services &lt;a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Health/rfk-jr-calls-new-vaccines-undergo-placebo-controlled/story?id=121412127"&gt;recently mandated&lt;/a&gt; an overhaul of the vaccine approval process, one that will require all new vaccines to undergo placebo-controlled trials to receive approval.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While many experimental vaccines today are placebo-tested (including the original covid-19 vaccines), it’s unclear whether this order will also apply to vaccines that can be compared to existing vaccines, like the combination mRNA-1083 vaccine, or to vaccines that have to be regularly updated to match fast-evolving viruses like the flu and covid-19.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some vaccine experts have said that these changes &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/05/01/nx-s1-5383172/rfk-jr-placebo-vaccine-testing-studies#:~:text=Offit%2C%20Hotez%20and,an%20ethical%20trial.%22"&gt;are unnecessary and potentially unethical&lt;/a&gt;, since it could leave some people vulnerable to an infection that already has a vaccine. The new rule also might delay the availability of upcoming seasonal vaccines, particularly the &lt;a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/01/health/hhs-universal-flu-coronavirus-vaccine-initiative"&gt;current covid-19 shots&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A potentially important wrinkle for the mRNA-1083 vaccine is that no mRNA-based vaccine for the flu is currently approved. That reality could very well be all that the FDA needs to demand further placebo-controlled trials. RFK Jr. and other recent Trump appointees have also been highly skeptical of mRNA-based vaccines in general, despite no strong evidence that these vaccines are significantly less safe than other types. Kennedy, who has a &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/rfk-jr-made-a-million-dollars-from-his-anti-vax-work-that-he-previously-claimed-was-unpaid-2000550692"&gt;long history of supporting&lt;/a&gt; the anti-vaccination movement, has even &lt;a href="https://www.poynter.org/fact-checking/2021/robert-f-kennedy-jr-said-the-covid-19-vaccine-is-the-deadliest-vaccine-ever-made-thats-not-true/"&gt;wrongly declared&lt;/a&gt; that the mRNA covid-19 vaccine was the “deadliest vaccine ever made.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Moderna &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/moderna-beats-wall-street-estimates-first-quarter-profit-sales-2025-05-01/#:~:text=Moderna%20said%20on%20Thursday%20it%20now%20does%20not%20expect%20regulatory%20approval%20for%20its%20combination%20flu/COVID%2D19%20shot%20until%202026%2C%20after%20the%20FDA%20said%20it%20required%20late%2Dstage%20data%20demonstrating%20the%20shot%27s%20efficacy%20against%20the%20flu."&gt;stated&lt;/a&gt; last week it doesn’t expect its mRNA-1083 vaccine to be approved before 2026, following the FDA’s request for late-stage data showing the vaccine’s effectiveness against flu specifically. But it’s worth wondering if even that timeline is now in jeopardy under the current public health regime.&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

More than eight drinks per week for women and 15 drinks per week for men is also considered excessive drinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Generally, it’s accepted that women should not have more than one alcoholic drink a day and men should not have more than two, Kim said.

This means moderating foods that are full of saturated fats, sugar and salt, Wang said. (Additionally, Kim pointed out that there is a relationship between salt intake and high blood pressure, which, as we now know, is another stroke risk factor.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to what you &lt;em&gt;should &lt;/em&gt;eat, Kim points to the work of author and journalist &lt;a href="https://michaelpollan.com/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Michael Pollan" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="681cf820e4b02fbba8e793ba" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://michaelpollan.com/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="14"&gt;Michael Pollan&lt;/a&gt;. This advice is “eat food, mostly plants, not too much,” Wang said. This means having a diet that’s rich in fruits and veggies with some meat added in. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dismiss Necessary Treatment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since strokes are so common in this country (and this world), it’s important that you’re aware of the signs and get treated as soon as possible. Available stroke treatments work better the sooner they’re done, Kim said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Because many strokes aren’t painful, and the symptoms of stroke vary so much, it’s important to recognize symptoms of stroke,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;And, there’s a useful acronym to help people remember the signs — and that &lt;a href="https://www.stroke.org/en/help-and-support/resource-library/fast-materials" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="acronym is FAST" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="681cf820e4b02fbba8e793ba" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.stroke.org/en/help-and-support/resource-library/fast-materials" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="15"&gt;acronym is FAST&lt;/a&gt;, Kim said.

Shortly after, in December 2024, he received an email telling him he had melanoma. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Captain Jason Chambers is known for being at the helm of luxury yachts on the reality TV show Below Deck Down Under&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Chambers underwent two procedures to remove the sun spot from his ribs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Chambers was stunned, but was traveling to promote his Bravo reality show &lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;Below Deck Down Under&lt;/span&gt; so he scrambled to try and get a doctors appointment for when he returned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, he was discouraged by how challenging it was, telling DailyMail.com: 'It's such a long wait to get in to a dermatologist, which is a sad thing.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Eventually he was able to get an appointment with a doctor in Sydney - but the challenges didn't end there. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While doctors in Bali removed the spot, Australian physicians weren't satisfied with some details in the report, which didn't include what stage melanoma Chambers had or what margins the skin cancer showed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While they estimated stage 2, which meant Chambers would have to undergo a more invasive procedure to remove muscle around the spot on his ribs, doctors told him if he could get the biopsy shipped to Australia, they could give him a more precise diagnosis and prognosis.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, this required weeks of logistical planning and red tape to cut through, which worried Chambers, and he began doing his own research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He told this website: 'As that period went on, I started researching and [questioned] how was I so naïve? How did I not just see a dermatologist every year prior?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'That process was just so upsetting.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Melanoma kills more than 8,300 Americans each year, according to the Melanoma Research Foundation (MRF), but about 90 percent of cases are considered to be preventable through vigilance about sun safety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Melanoma Institute of Australia reports 95 percent of melanomas are caused by overexposure to UV radiation from the sun, but if caught early, 90 percent of cases can be cured by surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Melanoma is also the second most common cancer in Australian men and kills about 1,300 people overall per year in the country. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The superyacht captain said doctors told him there is only a  five percent chance his melanoma will return&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;In an interview with DailyMail.com Chambers showed off his melanoma scar, which he described as being the size of a pinky finger&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;On Christmas Eve, Chambers finally had answers. Australian doctors said the team in Bali had gotten good margins. All they had to do was remove a little bit more near the original site but there was only a five percent chance of his melanoma returning. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Then, he would be due for follow ups every few months. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Chambers said his scar is about the size of his pinky finger and his first follow up is in just a few weeks, and he has pledged to get checks annually going forward. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After his diagnosis the yacht captain took to social media to talk about his ordeal, which he said led to a flurry of people sharing similar stories. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Moved by what he was hearing, Chambers was inspired and is now using his platform to raise awareness. He will even be the emcee for the Melanoma Research Foundation's annual &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://us.givergy.com/MRFNYGala25/?controller=home"&gt;gala&lt;/a&gt; in New York City in October. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said: 'I think my social media - I haven't been trying to sell things - my social media is only used for a few pillars, which is education, sustainability and my health, and I work with a few foundations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'When MRF reached out to me and asked if I would participate, it's within my pillars and it's very hard to find a foundation that's got so much substance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'They asked me to be a special guest. I don't know how special I am, but it's actually quite humbling. I'm getting little goose bumps now.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Chambers told DailyMail.com after he posted about his melanoma diagnosis on social media, people reached out to him to share similar stories&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Above is a picture of the spot on Chambers' ribs that turned out to be melanoma&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The average lifetime risk of developing melanoma is about three percent - or one in 33 people - but the risk increases if a person has a family history of the disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Chambers did not have a family history.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Rates of new melanomas vary - in people younger than 50, they've been stable among women and have declined by about one percent per year in men since early the 2000s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The five-year survival rate for melanoma is 94 percent, but that drops to 35 percent for melanomas that have spread and could be even lower depending on far the cancer has progressed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now, Chambers told this website he is following the Australian mantra of 'slip, slop, slap.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He explained: 'I'm staying out of the sun. Slip, slop, slap we call it in Australia - we slip on a hat, slop on some sunscreen and slap on a shirt.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And he is more aware now, he added, wishing he could go back and tell himself to cover up, wear sunscreen and limit his daily sun exposure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He told DailyMail.com: 'Skin cancer is happening... it is going to happen to you if you are overexposed. So minimize [time in the sun], protect yourself, put some sunglasses on every time you go out. There's one thing we know, putting on a long sleeve shirt, putting on a hat and putting some sunglasses on is only going to do you well. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'So I wish I could tell myself... still go about your life but look after yourself.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And the thing he hopes comes out of his journey and his advocacy - making skin checks and dermatologist appointments more accessible. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Chambers said: 'It was very difficult to get a booking... and I was a little bit anxious during that period to get more information. I would love nothing more than to have skin checks available to the people that need it and can't afford it&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It's an easy thing to do. It's a quick scan. It shouldn't have to be hundreds of dollars and a wait for three weeks when you're looking at some skin cancers that can actually wipe you out in six months. It's a huge thing. So let's just have that.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Annual full-body skin checks are recommended to spot skin cancer early, but people can perform self-checks periodically at home and visit a dermatologist sooner if they find anything suspicious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;When conducting a self-exam, people should be on the look out for the ABCDEs of skin cancer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When conducting a self-check, people should be on the look out for the ABCDEs of skin cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A is for asymmetry: Is the mole symmetrical all the way around? Melanomas are often uneven and have different sized and shaped halves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;B is for border: Does the mole have clear borders? Melanomas are more likely to have irregular or jagged edges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;C is for color: Is the color the same throughout the mole? Melanomas are more likely to have multiple shades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;D is for diameter: How big is the mole? Typically they should be the size of the end of a pencil and melanomas tend to be larger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lastly, E is for evolving: Has the mole changed over time? Most benign moles stay the same year-to-year, but melanomas can grow in size and shape and change colors over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Sun, 11 May 2025 05:38:06 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiowFBVV95cUxPV1VpT3piWXJPMjNSbjJ1UDVzdmc3MzRpcHBybzhfVmdhVWpVRERsQi1ZRlpkMjB5blVlNmNpcXByWTFVU3RyYWhBa1c4TWVYLXU1UFBlSjhzN3RkNDhfVkJ2aklNUmYxYVVZX3V4SlBXNFp6R2lrTno3dkhBTUNLbzFlOFQyVVFvR0l4bC12aTlra1lybFdwWC1aZERERVFTY0Fn0gGoAUFVX3lxTFBVOFhFYnUtblR5RkxOeDcxajd1UWhxVDE3bXh2ODJ5VWpSWHNMakFyeDJSYlFSWmp6NDZ0ODdkeC1JUmZUOXFFcDQ4Um1nY0U1STJNaER3Vl8xaDAtWkx3YldabTN5SWw1R25lYTBiOTFYa01hbDlub2JCNG41TjVQYVo2ZzM0MW55WDM1a0ZUYW5JYzZpcnhJbmNOVGRDNlN6czM4aHhIWQ</guid></item><item><title>维生素D ：每天应该摄入多少才能保持健康-印度时报 | Vitamin D: How much should be consumed daily to stay healthy - Times of India</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi8AFBVV95cUxNMnd0MWxHY1U3NzNOc21UQWlWVEs5NUwxX0x4YjU1andlLWtYUndQMGVVVy1lWGRXdVRBbGJJMTJEcnFRVnBudE9MOVpyMzZBalNWY19ueEhod3ZGQzJqcXYycURPa0NHWVY0cW5oUGRZbV9XcVN4Q0NVZEU0d2JLcFprSU5aWlpSWkVZbjhETEJ6R3pUcmo4aExPaEZJUlRCNG5SczdWeUs0M1hEaG9fS3JrQnRwQmlFTnUzRE05VlFuWGdTWDdrSVdpekpXNUV1U0M1YXNJWnFWMXp4ZnZYeVEwY3piVEcyZlZlRGlzaEQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;div class="MwN2O"&gt;&lt;div class="vdo_embedd"&gt; &lt;div class="T22zO"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your mom is right (as always)! Getting a morning dose of sunshine is beneficial for your health. That’s one way of getting &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/vitamin-d" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;vitamin D&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;naturally. Vitamin D, also known as the ‘sunshine vitamin’, plays a critical role in bone health, immune function, and overall well-being. Vitamin D deficiency is a major global public health problem affecting approximately 1 billion people.Nearly 50% of some populations experience vitamin D insufficiency. A deficiency can result in various health concerns, most notably rickets in children and osteoporosis in adults. While you can get vitamin D from sunlight and your diet, you may need&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/6-important-supplements-that-people-should-start-taking-in-their-30s-to-live-a-long-and-healthy-life/articleshow/120826074.cms" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;supplementation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; in case of deficiency. Understanding the right dosage depending on age, lifestyle, and individual health needs is important. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before we delve into the dosage, let’s take a look at why vitamin D is important for health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;What is vitamin D?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin D is a fat-soluble nutrient essential for maintaining healthy bones, supporting immune function, and promoting overall well-being. It mainly exists in two forms: Vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol), derived from plant sources and fortified foods, and Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol), produced by the skin when exposed to sunlight and found in animal-based foods such as salmon, cod, and egg yolks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin D helps the body absorb calcium, promotes strong bones, and prevents conditions like osteoporosis. It also supports immune system function and potentially reduces the risk of infections and chronic diseases, such as autoimmune diseases and certain cancers. Emerging studies also hint at vitamin D's role in influencing mood, cardiovascular health, and muscle function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div data-type="in_view" class="  "&gt;&lt;div class="EEW3_ timeline_pollWrapper_as " data-scrollga="scroll#poll_view"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="hLnAH"&gt;Poll&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="KEEGr"&gt;Do you believe getting sunlight is essential for maintaining good health?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;What are the natural sources of vitamin D?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The body can create vitamin D from direct sunlight on the skin when outdoors. To prevent vitamin D deficiency, aim to get about 15 to 20 minutes of sunshine &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3068797/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;daily,&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; with over 40% of skin exposed. Other sources of food include oily fish such as salmon, sardines, herring, and mackerel, red meat, liver (not suitable for pregnant women), egg yolks, and fortified foods such as some fat spreads and breakfast cereals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Prince Harry BLASTED For ‘Deadly’ Claims About Royal Family – Friends OUTRAGED Over King Charles Health Reveal&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;How much vitamin D do you need?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The amount of vitamin D you need each day depends on your age. Children from age 1, adults, pregnant and breastfeeding women need 10 micrograms (mcg) of vitamin D a day. Infants up to the age of 1 year require 8.5 to 10 micrograms of vitamin D a day. Adults over 70 require 20 micrograms to support bone health. To know if you have a vitamin D deficiency, you can consult your healthcare provider, who would run blood tests that measure levels of storage vitamin D.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Sun, 11 May 2025 05:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi8AFBVV95cUxNMnd0MWxHY1U3NzNOc21UQWlWVEs5NUwxX0x4YjU1andlLWtYUndQMGVVVy1lWGRXdVRBbGJJMTJEcnFRVnBudE9MOVpyMzZBalNWY19ueEhod3ZGQzJqcXYycURPa0NHWVY0cW5oUGRZbV9XcVN4Q0NVZEU0d2JLcFprSU5aWlpSWkVZbjhETEJ6R3pUcmo4aExPaEZJUlRCNG5SczdWeUs0M1hEaG9fS3JrQnRwQmlFTnUzRE05VlFuWGdTWDdrSVdpekpXNUV1U0M1YXNJWnFWMXp4ZnZYeVEwY3piVEcyZlZlRGlzaEQ</guid></item><item><title>“我减了那么多体重，我丈夫认为我患有绝症” ：为什么人们对服用Ozempic撒谎？ -《卫报》 | ‘I lost so much weight, my husband thought I was terminally ill’: why do people lie about taking Ozempic? - The Guardian</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirgFBVV95cUxOQS1Ra2t2c3BOZm0zenJLQlBSb2tLNlpkYV93SV84UUs0Wm5aTzU1TGVPcExWUEg1VHBYeW14WnVGZ21Za3FxcV83em5jLUhSdmJNaHNrVG5TbTBxNG4wRjQwUWpYWWc5WDllNmNDX3ZXazhyVzlhSjBheHpBdUZ6UVFQbmlJTHdUc0c0b19jWFVZRFJNczlCQzNVajRoaFNadFhLWVkyV3QwOFFOZWc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body-commercial-selector article-body-viewer-selector dcr-11jq3zt"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-15rw6c2"&gt;E&lt;/span&gt;very Friday night, Claire, a 50-year-old woman in Berkshire, waits until her husband and son have gone to bed. When she is sure the house is quiet, she tiptoes out to her garage, and over to a tin tucked away in the corner. It is chilly out there, but she doesn’t mind; that’s the point. Inside the tin, away from the prying eyes of her family, is a vial of the GLP-1 medication Mounjaro, which needs to be kept at about 8C. Claire has been taking it without them knowing for several months. “It would have been harder to get away with in summer,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;As weight-loss medications have become more and more popular, lots of people in the public eye have been dramatically changing shape, walking the red carpets or hosting TV shows in bodies half the size they once were. But as the jabs have become cheaper and more readily available, so, too, have ordinary people been disappearing before our eyes. And many are choosing not to disclose just how this weight loss is happening. Like Claire, these “secret jabbers” are keeping it private even from their closest family and friends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SignInGateSelector" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"contentType":"Article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","tags":[{"id":"lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","type":"Keyword","title":"Life and style"},{"id":"society/obesity","type":"Keyword","title":"Obesity"},{"id":"tone/features","type":"Tone","title":"Features"},{"id":"society/society","type":"Keyword","title":"Society"},{"id":"society/health","type":"Keyword","title":"Health"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/health-and-wellbeing","type":"Keyword","title":"Health &amp;amp; wellbeing"},{"id":"science/drugs","type":"Keyword","title":"Drugs"},{"id":"society/mental-health","type":"Keyword","title":"Mental health"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/diets-dieting","type":"Keyword","title":"Diets and dieting"},{"id":"type/article","type":"Type","title":"Article"},{"id":"profile/imogen-west-knights","type":"Contributor","title":"Imogen West-Knights","twitterHandle":"ImogenWK","bylineImageUrl":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/uploads/2023/04/18/Imogen_West-Knights.jpg?width=300&amp;amp;quality=85&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;s=dedebf864eb3746c84962e71c1d8777a","bylineLargeImageUrl":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/uploads/2023/04/18/Imogen_West-Knights.png?width=300&amp;amp;quality=85&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;s=cea49d83b6d59a7effd588f938555f32"},{"id":"publication/theguardian","type":"Publication","title":"The Guardian"},{"id":"theguardian/saturday","type":"NewspaperBook","title":"Saturday"},{"id":"theguardian/saturday/features","type":"NewspaperBookSection","title":"Features"},{"id":"tracking/commissioningdesk/saturday-magazine","type":"Tracking","title":"Saturday Magazine"}],"isPaidContent":false,"isPreview":false,"host":"https://www.theguardian.com","pageId":"lifeandstyle/2025/may/11/weight-loss-drugs-why-do-people-lie-about-taking-ozempic","idUrl":"https://profile.theguardian.com","switches":{"lightbox":true,"externalVideoEmbeds":true,"personaliseSignInGateAfterCheckout":true,"abSignInGateMainVariant":true,"prebidAppnexusUkRow":true,"prebidMagnite":true,"commercialMetrics":true,"prebidTrustx":true,"scAdFreeBanner":false,"adaptiveSite":true,"prebidPermutiveAudience":true,"compareVariantDecision":false,"enableSentryReporting":true,"lazyLoadContainers":true,"ampArticleSwitch":false,"remarketing":true,"articleEndSlot":true,"keyEventsCarousel":true,"registerWithPhone":false,"darkModeWeb":true,"targeting":true,"remoteHeader":true,"slotBodyEnd":true,"ampPrebidOzone":false,"extendedMostPopularFronts":true,"emailInlineInFooter":true,"showNewPrivacyWordingOnEmailSignupEmbeds":true,"prebidAnalytics":true,"extendedMostPopular":true,"ampContentAbTesting":false,"prebidCriteo":true,"abPrebidId5":false,"imrWorldwide":true,"acast":true,"twitterUwt":true,"abAuxiaSignInGate":true,"prebidAppnexusInvcode":true,"ampPrebidPubmatic":false,"a9HeaderBidding":true,"prebidAppnexus":true,"europeBetaFrontTest2":true,"enableDiscussionSwitch":true,"prebidXaxis":true,"stickyVideos":true,"interactiveFullHeaderSwitch":true,"discussionAllPageSize":true,"prebidUserSync":true,"audioOnwardJourneySwitch":true,"brazeTaylorReport":false,"callouts":true,"sentinelLogger":true,"geoMostPopular":true,"weAreHiring":false,"relatedContent":true,"thirdPartyEmbedTracking":true,"prebidOzone":true,"ampLiveblogSwitch":false,"ampAmazon":false,"prebidAdYouLike":true,"mostViewedFronts":true,"abA9BidResponseWinner":true,"optOutAdvertising":true,"abSignInGateMainControl":true,"googleSearch":true,"brazeSwitch":true,"prebidKargo":true,"consentManagement":true,"idProfileNavigation":true,"confiantAdVerification":true,"discussionAllowAnonymousRecommendsSwitch":false,"absoluteServerTimes":false,"permutive":true,"comscore":true,"ampPrebidCriteo":false,"prebidTheTradeDesk":true,"newsletterOnwards":false,"youtubeIma":true,"webFonts":true,"liveBlogTopSponsorship":true,"lineItemJobs":true,"ophan":true,"crosswordSvgThumbnails":true,"prebidTriplelift":true,"prebidPubmatic":true,"serverShareCounts":false,"autoRefresh":true,"enhanceTweets":true,"prebidIndexExchange":true,"prebidOpenx":true,"prebidHeaderBidding":true,"idCookieRefresh":true,"discussionPageSize":true,"smartAppBanner":false,"historyTags":true,"brazeContentCards":true,"remoteBanner":true,"emailSignupRecaptcha":true,"prebidSmart":true,"shouldLoadGoogletag":true,"inizio":true,"europeBetaFront":true,"prebidBidCache":true},"contributionsServiceUrl":"https://contributions.guardianapis.com","editionId":"US"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;All over social media, accounts and posts are cropping up focusing on the experience of being on GLP-1 injections (the clinical name for&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;weight-loss drugs such as Ozempic, Mounjaro and Wegovy), but keeping it hidden. There are Reddit sub-chats where secret jabbers share their tips, such as where to stash the medication to keep up the ruse and also keep it cool. People describe hiding it inside a mascara box in their makeup fridge, in a wine cooler, at the back of the salad drawer, inside a bottle of a protein drink they know no one else in their family is interested in trying. Users also share the lies they have told to disguise being on the medication – new gym routines, a dislike for dessert – and bond over the complications that arise from their nearest and dearest not knowing why they’re suddenly dropping weight. “My husband started to think I was terminally ill,” one TikTok commenter confesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Why are people so keen to hide their weight-loss medication? Why go to such lengths to keep something so seemingly inconsequential so private? I talked to some secret jabbers, in strictest anonymity, to find out what’s behind their choice to keep stumm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="dcr-z9ge1j"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-15rw6c2"&gt;C&lt;/span&gt;laire started to notice a few years ago that her weight was making it more and more difficult for her to move around. When she decided to start GLP-1 injections, she told her osteopath and a small handful of close friends, but not her husband. “It wasn’t fear of his reaction,” she says, “but I’m an extremely private person when it comes to my thought processes. And for me, this one ran really deep.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;She got her jabs from a private online pharmacy. In the early weeks, the tin in the garage was good enough cover for her secret. But it eventually became untenable to keep her medication under wraps because Claire’s husband does most of their cooking. “I haven’t been hungry since mid-November,” she says, “so my husband was cooking the same stuff and I was starting to struggle to eat it. I got away with it for about six weeks with comments like, ‘Yeah, I’m not very hungry tonight’, so he started to serve up a bit less. But even then I was leaving half a meal, which was already two-thirds of the size of what he’d been serving me before.” It was the food waste that got to him, Claire says. “He was quite frustrated. He said, ‘I don’t know what you’re doing. You seem to be trying to eat less or something.’ And there was no getting around it once it was obvious.” She decided to come clean. “I was like, well, since you ask, I have been on this weight-loss medication for the last month and a half … ”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-nyoej5"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 22 14" class="dcr-scql1j"&gt;&lt;path d="M5.255 0h4.75c-.572 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941H0C.792 9.104 2.44 4.53 5.255 0Zm11.061 0H21c-.506 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941h-8.686c.902-4.837 2.485-9.411 5.3-13.941Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;blockquote class="dcr-zzndwp"&gt;We would never berate anyone for giving up smoking, but do we call it cheating if they use nicotine tabs?&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;He took it well. “He was surprised, I think, and bemused. Ultimately, the words that came out were, ‘Oh, well, that makes sense. Why didn’t you tell me?’ Once it was out there, it was a non-event.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Eliza, also 50, has been on Mounjaro for seven months. She lives in North Yorkshire, works for a large charity and has a beloved cat who walks across her keyboard while we chat.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;She’s had a hard few years. Her brother and her mum both died, and grief on top of menopause meant that she went from always feeling as if she was a little heavier than she would like to a more sustained kind of weight gain. Initially, she didn’t tell anybody she was going on GLP-1s, although she has recently confided in one friend also taking Mounjaro. Neither of them have told their husbands. “I was at their house having dinner recently and her husband was like, ‘Oh, you ladies are looking very slim.’ I’m finding it slightly problematic now,” she admits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Eliza thought her husband probably wouldn’t understand why she wanted to go down the GLP-1 route, because he’s such an “eat less and move around more kind of guy”. She doesn’t actively hide the medication from him, though; she just keeps it in the fridge and knows he won’t notice. “It’s amazing how unobservant people are,” she says. This isn’t the first time she has hidden a weight-loss management attempt from her husband. “I went to Turkey and had a gastric balloon, and I didn’t tell anyone, not even him,” she says. “I just pretended that I was going to London for a meeting and then popped off to Turkey. It’s actually quite wild,” she says, almost surprised at herself. The gastric balloon didn’t work, so she turned to weight-loss injections. She gets them from an online pharmacy, for £160 a month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="84c21128-2fd9-42fc-974d-c460866d6ef2" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-1tx6u99"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt; &lt;/span&gt; Illustration: Fran Pulido/The Guardian&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Moira, 55, in&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;the Cotswolds, started taking Mounjaro in October and also hasn’t told anybody, including her husband. “Over the past few years, I’ve gone through lots of different treatments, with menopause, HRT and patches and stuff, so he’s used to seeing things come into the house but not really asking many questions,” she says. He and her mum have both commented on her new shape. “They’ve noticed, but they’ve not really put two and three together to make four or five or seven,” as she puts it.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;“Now I’ve got to this point, I can’t really come clean,” she says. Moira has lost 10kg (22lb).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Cameron, a retired opera enthusiast in central London, is single, but made a decision early on in his GLP-1 journey that he wouldn’t be telling his closest friend, or his parents. “Even as a 58-year-old man, my parents’ opinion matters, because it makes life easier if they’re not being ignorant, judgmental and shortsighted,” he says. He worries that they’d say it’s dangerous, or “they would be judgmentally dismissive. They’d be like, ‘Well, you’re not doing it &lt;em&gt;properly&lt;/em&gt;.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;This idea of “doing it properly” is a pervasive one. For decades, people have had the idea that weight loss must involve hard work: consistent, difficult exercise and sacrificing pleasures such as delicious meals. The willpower involved is seen as admirable; the idea – which has been debunked by research into obesity – is that anyone can have a slim body, if they only try hard enough. By contrast, using injections to lose weight is perceived as easy, even “lazy”, and unworthy of the praise that gets lavished on people who are seen to have changed their bodies through sacrifice alone. Perhaps this is why people are keeping their jabs to themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Cameron doesn’t lie about it per se, but he’s come close. He is using Mounjaro, rather than the similarly popular Wegovy. “My sister-in-law asked me. She said, ‘You’re not taking Wegovy, are you?’ And I said, ‘No, I wouldn’t even consider it.’ Because I’m not, and I wouldn’t. If she had asked me the right question, I would have said, ‘Absolutely I am’ but I only have to answer the question she asked,” he says with a wry smile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="566f316b-8f65-4a34-b91f-558fb64946cd" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":16,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"‘Plot twist - I’m still a fat person!’: meet the people proving you can be fit at any size","elementId":"566f316b-8f65-4a34-b91f-558fb64946cd","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/mar/29/im-still-a-fat-person-meet-the-people-proving-you-can-be-fit-at-any-size"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":10,"display":0,"theme":4}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Gail Bohin, a clinical psychologist for the NHS’s specialist weight management service in Gloucestershire, says this idea that people on GLP-1s are “cheating” is widespread. “It’s all tied up with a bigger picture of living in a weight stigmatising culture, because people are seen as personally responsible for gaining weight, and then the association of that is: it’s your fault that you became diabetic, or that your joints are playing up. People use phrases such as ‘soft options’ or ‘easy get-out’ about GLP-1s, which just shows the underlying attitude that it is completely within your control to fix this and you should just try harder.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“At the end of the day, I have dieted,” Jasmine says. “I’m just not getting that interference of being hungry all the time.” In her mid-60s, she has been on Mounjaro for almost a year and kept it secret from everybody except her husband, despite significant visible weight loss. “You can’t lose this much weight without people wanting to know what you’ve been doing,” she says. No one has asked her outright if she’s on GLP-1s, and she’s not sure what she’d say if they did. “I would have problems lying,” she says. “I could do it if I was on The Traitors, but that’s a game and this is my life.” So far, she’s been saying that she’s radically changed her diet – but not that GLP-1s are the reason.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Secret-jabbers all fear judgment, and other people’s opinions colouring their own view of whether the drug suits their needs. “I come from a family who are very opinionated,” Moira says. “My husband and mum can be critical without realising, and that can prevent you from making good choices about changing your life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="dcr-z9ge1j"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-15rw6c2"&gt;P&lt;/span&gt;aulo is in his 30s, in a job that brings him into contact with the fashion world, where GLP-1 is a hot topic these days. He has been on Wegovy for six months and decided early on that he wanted to tell as many people as possible what he was doing. “I almost want to get it out of the way before someone says something mean about it. Like, ‘Oh God, how lazy are people who take Ozempic?’ I’ve already had someone refuse to talk to me, because he says he was so disappointed that I was taking it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;It’s reactions like this that made Jasmine want to keep her Mounjaro use a secret. She stayed with some family friends recently, one of whom had been taking Ozempic. “Everyone was being quite derogatory about the fact that she had resorted to medication to help her lose weight,” she says. “Behind her back they would say she shouldn’t really be taking it. Yet to her face, everyone was saying, ‘Oh wow, you look fab.’ So I began to pick up on the fact that there was this duality in how people responded to you when you were taking it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;This word “resort” comes up again and again. There is an element of shame for some people, embarrassment that they have had to somehow stoop to taking medication for weight loss instead of achieving it by “natural” means such as exercise and dieting. If not ashamed about the drug itself, some users feel ashamed about being overweight in the first place. “I think: why can’t my willpower do it?” Jasmine says. “But then I know that I’ve been using willpower and it hasn’t worked.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-nyoej5"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 22 14" class="dcr-scql1j"&gt;&lt;path d="M5.255 0h4.75c-.572 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941H0C.792 9.104 2.44 4.53 5.255 0Zm11.061 0H21c-.506 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941h-8.686c.902-4.837 2.485-9.411 5.3-13.941Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;blockquote class="dcr-zzndwp"&gt;With diets, all you do is think about food: what to cook, how to prepare it. And the one thing you want to do is to stop thinking about food&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;For Eliza, it’s not shame about the jab. “I feel ashamed about being fat,” she says. “Because that is the literal point of fat shaming: that if you don’t look like &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/naomi-campbell" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Naomi Campbell&lt;/a&gt;, you are some kind of bad person. So I told nobody.” But as she has visibly lost more weight, she has found the “web expanding”, as she puts it, of people she is having to deceive about the reason. Over Christmas, her husband asked her outright whether she was using weight-loss injections and she told him no. “Now, all of a sudden, people are definitely noticing, so that has been very awkward and difficult, because I just didn’t know what to say. I’ve been kind of fudging it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The dominant cultural narrative seems to be that we want people with bigger bodies to suffer in some way if they want to lose weight, Paulo says. “Society hates fat people so much that there is this real belief that they should be punished in the process of shedding their weight. Like, you should be in the gym every day sweating away and kind of crying the fat off.” He thinks there is something of a cultural panic going on about Ozempic, because it has allowed some significantly overweight people to choose to lose that weight without “hard work”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“We view people who are overweight as having failed at something,” Claire says, “that if only they’d been a little bit stronger their whole life, they’d be able to overcome it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="dcr-z9ge1j"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-15rw6c2"&gt;D&lt;/span&gt;r Julia Mueller, a researcher at the University of Cambridge who specialises in the psychosocial determinants of obesity and weight management, tells me she’s “really saddened” to hear that people feel they need to keep their injections secret. “But not at all surprised. The narrative around these weight-loss medications, on social media, in general media, even from some healthcare professionals, has often been very stigmatising: that it’s an easy way out, a quick fix.” She worries that the secrecy puts an extra psychological pressure on those trying to lose weight: “I think anyone who’s ever kept a secret, especially from someone they’re close to, knows it’s difficult and requires effort.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The secret jabbers tell me they’re happy on the drugs, and about the life-changing difference it has made thus far. People speak about their lifelong inability to turn off the voice in their head, often referred to as “food noise”, that was constantly asking what they would eat next and whether it would be OK to eat it. GLP-1s, everyone says, have finally turned off that voice. “It’s one of the biggest ironies there is in the whole weight and diet industry,” Jasmine says. “I’m a veteran of Slimming World and Weight Watchers, and all you do is think about food. What can I cook? How can I prepare this food? When you go shopping, you’re constantly looking at labels. And the one thing you want to do is to stop thinking about food.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="b56d3265-16d2-4c1e-9372-2b74ea0641ab" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":31,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"The end of WeightWatchers?

But I was 30. I couldn’t sustain my weight coming out of a car and I fell on to the road. I thought: this is getting out of hand.” He was then diagnosed with pre-diabetes. Since being on Wegovy, he has done a cardiovascular test which showed that his risk of heart failure has more than halved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Cameron tells a similar story. “I don’t feel out of breath walking up and down two flights of stairs. It used to be I would walk five minutes, I’d be soaked through. That’s not the case now. All of my bloods are better, my liver function is better, my body fat is down.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Two of the people I speak to use the analogy of quitting smoking to counter the idea that taking a drug to help lose weight for medical reasons is in some way a cop-out. “We would never berate anyone for giving up smoking, but do we call it cheating if they use nicotine tabs?” Claire says. “For me, it’s a direct parallel.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Perhaps it’s no surprise that people choose to keep their use of GLP-1 medication secret, given the sensitivity of weight as a subject. It should be none of our business whether someone else chooses to take weight loss medication or doesn’t, exercises or doesn’t, eats more or less, weighs more or less.

&lt;p&gt;There are two ways to approach your first marathon: the smart way and the hard way. Six years ago, personal trainer James Stirling—better known as &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://londonfitnessguy.com/" target="_blank" data-url="https://londonfitnessguy.com/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;London Fitness Guy&lt;/a&gt;—chose the hard way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When I trained—or, more accurately, didn't train as well as I should have—for the London Marathon in 2019 that’s when I first suffered with knee pain,” he tells &lt;em&gt;Fit&amp;amp;Well&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For me, it has always been a case of overuse and I think that is the most common cause of knee pain. It’s doing mileage your body is not adapted to or running too fast too soon.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That wake-up call prompted Stirling to train as a running coach so that he, and his clients, wouldn’t repeat the same mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, having just completed the Berlin Half Marathon—one of six races in the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.superhalfs.com/en/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.superhalfs.com/en/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;SuperHalfs series&lt;/a&gt; he plans to complete over the next two years—Stirling says he’s taking a far more patient, comprehensive and long-term approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are the four changes he made to prevent knee pain and run injury-free.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-1-strength-train"&gt;&lt;span&gt;1. Strength train&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Introducing running-specific strength training has been the biggest game changer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-ngpAK9yKXXo4iKTHzi2gsX" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-ngpAK9yKXXo4iKTHzi2gsX slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Start your week with achievable workout ideas, health tips and wellbeing advice in your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Strength training a lot more according to running has definitely helped,” says Stirling. Instead of biceps curls and crunches, Stirling has tailored his workouts to build his body’s ability to withstand the repetitive impact and unilateral demands of running.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’ve been implementing a lot more single-leg work, plyometrics and running-specific moves,” says Stirling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A typical workout during a block of running training will almost always include some variation on lunges to work one side of the body at a time, calf raises to strengthen the critical &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.physio-pedia.com/Soleus" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.physio-pedia.com/Soleus" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;soleus muscle&lt;/a&gt; of the lower leg, and pogo hops to create resilience through the feet, ankles and knees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-2-start-training-early"&gt;&lt;span&gt;2. Start training early &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;You need time on your side when training for a race. “Most injuries seem to occur when people are racing towards a deadline of race day without giving themselves enough time to prepare,” says Stirling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I actually haven't had knee pain in any of my recent runs, which is great, but it’s because my training is now patient.” It’s typically recommended to give yourself at least 12 weeks to train for a half marathon, for example, but if you’re completely new to running you should give yourself an even longer runway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Giving yourself a wide timescale that allows you to train patiently will hopefully help you avoid unnecessary injury,” Stirling says. “Paired with strength training, that’s a real winning combination.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-3-build-gradually"&gt;&lt;span&gt;3. Build gradually &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stirling also swears by the 10% rule: increase your total running mileage by no more than 10% per week. Think of it like incrementally increasing the weight you lift in the gym or number of reps you perform during home workouts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If tracking your weekly mileage across all your runs is too complicated, Stirling says you can apply this rule to your longest run.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you build the weekly mileage of your longest run by a maximum of 10% each week it should help to prevent overuse and reduce the risk of injury, while providing enough of a challenge to improve your fitness week on week,” says Stirling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-4-go-slow"&gt;&lt;span&gt;4. Go slow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lastly, Stirling spends a lot more time doing zone 2 training—training at 60 to 70% of his maximum heart rate—especially during the longest run of his week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zone 2 training can improve aerobic fitness, helping faster runs feel easier. This slower pace will also reduce the impact on your joints and stress on your cardiovascular system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I always encourage running clients to think about every training session as a stress on the body,” says Stirling. “If you run three times over the course of a week and each one is high stress, the body is going to struggle to adapt.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, Stirling says, you must include easy runs in your week. “The stress on the body of the easy session is significantly less than if you're doing high-speed intervals multiple times. It’s about balancing that stress efficiently to avoid injury.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want to stay injury-free, slow and steady wins the race. Think tortoise, not hare.&lt;/p&gt;

This progressive disorder leads to gradual damage in the brain, which ultimately affects motor control and cognition, as noted by the National Health Service (NHS). In the UK alone, approximately 145,000 people are living with Parkinson's disease, according to Parkinson's UK, a charity dedicated to the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="top2brdiv"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers found that those living within a mile of golf courses have 126% higher risk of developing Parkinson's disease than those who live more than six miles away, according to a new study published in the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2833716" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read on to know more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What does the study say?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recent research has revealed a concerning link between living in close proximity to golf courses and an increased risk of developing Parkinson’s disease. Specifically, individuals residing within a mile of a golf course may see their risk of this debilitating neurodegenerative disorder more than double. Researchers from the Barrow Neurological Institute in Arizona conducted a comprehensive analysis of health records from residents near 139 golf courses located in southern Minnesota and western Wisconsin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data from 711 municipal wells provided by the Minnesota Geospatial Information Office was also used to determine the correlation between proximity and prevalence of cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the study, 450 incident cases from 1991 to 2015 were identified in Olmsted County, Minnesota.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The odds of PD were relatively constant within close proximity to a golf course and decreased linearly as distance increased; individuals living farther from a golf course had reduced odds of PD, decreasing relative to the distance from the nearest golf course," the study explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous studies have already linked chemicals found in pesticides including paraquat and rotenone to neurodegeneration, according to the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Brittany Krzyzanowski, one of the authors of the study published in the journal &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40338549/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;JAMA Network Open&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, emphasized the potential role of pesticides utilized to maintain golf courses in this heightened risk. She stated, “These findings suggest that pesticides applied to golf courses may play a role in the incidence of Parkinson’s disease for nearby residents.” The researchers advocate for public health initiatives aimed at minimizing both groundwater contamination and airborne pesticide exposure from golf course maintenance to mitigate the risk of Parkinson’s disease in adjacent neighborhoods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What are the findings?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study's findings are particularly striking: individuals living within a mile of these courses have a 126% elevated chance of being diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease in comparison to those who live more than six miles away. The research revealed a consistent trend, indicating that the likelihood of developing the disease diminishes by 13% for every additional mile of distance from the golf course, suggesting a clear, linear relationship between proximity to golf courses and Parkinson's risk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Areas that shared drinking water supplies with water used near golf courses were the most greatly impacted, the study shows. Researchers believe this shows that the pesticides used on golf courses could contribute to the number of Parkinson's cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study further revealed alarming statistics regarding drinking water sources; individuals who receive their water from areas near a golf course are nearly twice as likely to develop Parkinson's disease compared to those whose water sources are unaffected by such proximity. Certain pesticides, notably paraquat and rotenone, have been associated with the onset of Parkinson-like neurodegeneration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to tackle:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As per the Parkinson's Foundation, cases have been higher in areas such as the Rust Belt, which includes parts of the Midwest. Cases are also high in Southern California, Southeastern Texas, Central Pennsylvania, and Florida, according to the foundation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="last8brdiv"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the context of pesticide regulation, it is important to note that both the UK and EU have stringent controls in place, including a ban on paraquat due to its significant health and environmental concerns. Dr. Katherine Fletcher, Research Lead at Parkinson's UK, noted that, for most individuals in the UK, the risk of pesticide exposure leading to Parkinson’s is “extremely low.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="last7brdiv"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="last6brdiv"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the findings of this study buttress the association between pesticide exposure and Parkinson’s disease, Dr. Fletcher cautioned that the underlying causes of the condition are complex and multifaceted, likely involving a combination of genetic predispositions and environmental influences. Numerous investigations have sought to determine the extent to which pesticide exposure may elevate the risk of Parkinson’s across various populations globally, producing mixed results overall. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="last5brdiv"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="last4brdiv"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She remarked, “While this study supports the association between pesticides and Parkinson's, it is somewhat simplistic and does not fully account for other potential exposure routes, such as occupational pesticide contact, nor does it consider genetic factors that may predispose individuals to the condition.” The study opens up further dialogue about the broader implications of pesticide use and public health, particularly in the context of environmental safety and community health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="last3brdiv"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="last2brdiv"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="last1brdiv"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Sun, 11 May 2025 02:29:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi-gFBVV95cUxPdTlmTEhwRlY1aktGMDNwRUxtWHBwNC1fbnVKU3RrUEY0WldYdjNlTVF4OFAwY3VYTnJUNUExamhfSW15UzFDeFV5RU5ucUhDTnV5cE1XQ2dKc1N4YmZDdVZqbGxYUVcxV2pGM0pVbjMwRlYzRTF5d3AzWmxxaWZWN09TZm1kMW1hdDZlWF9qR3lPU2tqWkEzSVhOSUZGMXNXOTVadGd2bDJMb0RiMi1BS0Q1czYwTExVelMydFV2LW9rZ1NEUTF3SzZ3ZFJqdzBUUXRpNXpBSVByX0JPN0hvdkk1SnY1RWN4TTFmU0drbnlmWlMwTzJBODVn0gH_AUFVX3lxTE9XRnJWOFNfQXFBeFdldVhLZTVfSDBndHd1ZUtxckNDcVFNRzNyVU5sT1ZTaWdNcy1xdldaRnFOWVUtdWRONi1vX0NrS29GNUIwVmZZYm1lWWZTMXF0N3ZvV3NPaHRQaG0zcFJZeWFqY29oUlBsekFRaVMweTNSNEJFZW1qRlEzMGk2cFFZNW8wSnRnZ05OWHBSUXpKX2xCTDZjOXdOc0J3dllJNGFKQ3l0d0V4UUlBWUR1ZDVHRFo2d05XeGpSZC1PTUJtODJzSWFJaWJvM0RtdDUxUG1xVHU0N2ZnX00tZ21OUHBMVDhjODFGekd4Tmd0Zm9NVEN6SQ</guid></item><item><title>住在高尔夫球场附近会导致帕金森氏症吗？新研究揭示了-印度时报 | Can living near golf courses give you Parkinson's?

Numerous investigations have sought to determine the extent to which pesticide exposure may elevate the risk of Parkinson’s across various populations globally, producing mixed results overall. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="69"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;She remarked, “While this study supports the association between &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/pesticides-and-parkinsons" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;pesticides and Parkinson's&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, it is somewhat simplistic and does not fully account for other potential exposure routes, such as occupational pesticide contact, nor does it consider genetic factors that may predispose individuals to the condition.” The study opens up further dialogue about the broader implications of pesticide use and public health, particularly in the context of environmental safety and community health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="73"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Reduced risk of Alzheimer's disease linked to target protein for diabetes, as per a study&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="75"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Sun, 11 May 2025 02:29:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi-gFBVV95cUxPdTlmTEhwRlY1aktGMDNwRUxtWHBwNC1fbnVKU3RrUEY0WldYdjNlTVF4OFAwY3VYTnJUNUExamhfSW15UzFDeFV5RU5ucUhDTnV5cE1XQ2dKc1N4YmZDdVZqbGxYUVcxV2pGM0pVbjMwRlYzRTF5d3AzWmxxaWZWN09TZm1kMW1hdDZlWF9qR3lPU2tqWkEzSVhOSUZGMXNXOTVadGd2bDJMb0RiMi1BS0Q1czYwTExVelMydFV2LW9rZ1NEUTF3SzZ3ZFJqdzBUUXRpNXpBSVByX0JPN0hvdkk1SnY1RWN4TTFmU0drbnlmWlMwTzJBODVn</guid></item><item><title>新研究揭示了比间歇性禁食更容易的替代方案- ScienceAlert | New Study Reveals an Easier Alternative to Intermittent Fasting - ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilwFBVV95cUxOakk5QUhYdkt3UWxrZGwtZ1dCRmpLelFjSWJIWGpQcG10X3VGQnJuRlFkN2xrVXZUZDE4YnhGY2RqOFBSOEllSE1GRHVBR1hhS0hrN0RlZnJJSHU1V0RsODMzc1daczkzRGw4RTl3dEJqLWlfc0lkS3VPRFYzUjBLT04wSTJ6X3hDNXVzMjJQM0VwbnFCZHRF?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Intermittent fasting is not only a &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0314685"&gt;useful tool for weight loss&lt;/a&gt;, it's also shown to have &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/oby.22065"&gt;many benefits for metabolic health&lt;/a&gt; – independent of weight loss. Yet many people may find intermittent fasting to be a challenge, especially if following the 5:2 version of the diet where calories are severely restricted two days a week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00394-025-03646-5"&gt;my latest study&lt;/a&gt; shows that you don't need to severely restrict your calories to get the metabolic benefits of intermittent fasting. Even just restricting the number of carbs you eat twice a week may be enough to improve your metabolic health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intermittent fasting appears to be so beneficial for health because of the way it alters our metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a meal, our body enters the postprandial state. While in this state, our metabolism pushes our cells to use carbohydrates for immediate energy, while storing some of these carbs as well as fat for later use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But after several hours without food, in the postabsorptive "fasted" state, our metabolism switches to using some of our fat stores for energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this regard, intermittent fasting ensures a better balance between the sources it uses for energy. This leads to &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/edrv/article/39/4/489/4982126?login=true"&gt;improved metabolic flexibility&lt;/a&gt;, which is linked with &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0026049518302294?via%253Dihub"&gt;better cardiometabolic health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, this means lower risk of cardiovascular disease, insulin resistance and type 2  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="160617" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My colleagues and I previously ran a study to demonstrate the &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26819200/"&gt;effects of a fast&lt;/a&gt; on the body. We observed that following a day of both total fasting or severe calorie restriction (eating around only 25 percent of each person's daily calorie requirements), the body was better at clearing and burning the fat of a full English breakfast the next day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fasting shifted the body from using carbs to using fat. This effect carried on both during the fast and the next day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29508693/"&gt;Our research&lt;/a&gt; has also compared the effects of intermittent fasting to a calorie-matched or calorie-restricted diet. Both groups followed the diet until they lost 5 percent of their body weight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite both groups losing the same 5 percent of body weight, and at the same rate, the intermittent fasting group had greater improvements in their metabolic handling, similar to what we saw in the previous trial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/oby.22345"&gt;Other researchers&lt;/a&gt; who have compared the effects of the 5:2 variant of the intermittent fasting diet to a calorie-matched, calorie-restricted diet have also found fasting is beneficial for metabolic health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_160624" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-160624" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/IllustratedExamplesOfCarbohydrateRichFoods.jpg" alt="illustration of donut, pasta, rice, potatoes, banana and other carbohydrate rich foods" class="wp-image-160624 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/IllustratedExamplesOfCarbohydrateRichFoods.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/IllustratedExamplesOfCarbohydrateRichFoods-466x415.jpg 466w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/IllustratedExamplesOfCarbohydrateRichFoods-600x535.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-160624" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Examples of carbohydrate-rich foods. (Elena Shlyuykova/iStock/Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Metabolic health benefits&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;But why exactly is intermittent fasting &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34589208/"&gt;so beneficial for metabolic health&lt;/a&gt;? This is a question I sought to answer in &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00394-025-03646-5"&gt;my latest study&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For people who follow the 5:2 intermittent fasting diet, typical fasting days are, by their nature, very low in calories – equating to only a few hundred calories per day. Because people are consuming so few calories on fasting days, it also means they're consuming very few carbohydrates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the postprandial state is governed by carbohydrate availability, this begged the question as to whether it's the calorie restriction or the carbohydrate restriction that's creating the metabolic effect when intermittent fasting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We recruited 12 overweight and obese participants. Participants were first given a very low-carb diet one day. Another day, they were given a severely calorie-restricted diet (around 75 percent fewer calories than they'd normally eat).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After each fasting day, we gave them a high-fat, high-sugar meal (similar to an English breakfast) to see how easily their bodies burned fat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we found was that the shift to fat burning and improved fat handling of the high-calorie meal were near identical following both the traditional calorie-restricted "fast" day and the low-carb day. In other words, restricting carbs can elicit the same favourable metabolic effects as fasting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_160626" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-160626" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/ExampleOfLowCarbMealEggSalad-e1746674085190.jpg" alt="Salad with egg, tomatoes, avocado and greens" class="size-full wp-image-160626" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-160626" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In our study, restricting carbs had the same favorable metabolic effects as fasting. (d3sign/Moment/Getty Images)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;It will be important now for more studies to be conducted using a larger cohort of participants to confirm these findings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such findings may help us address some of the practical problems we face with intermittent fasting and traditional low-carb diets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For intermittent fasting diets, severe calorie restriction on fasting days can increase the &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41430-018-0370-0"&gt;risk of nutritional deficiencies&lt;/a&gt; if not careful. It can similarly be a trigger for &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34191688/"&gt;disordered eating&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strict carb restriction can also be &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0273422"&gt;challenging to adhere to long-term&lt;/a&gt;, and may lead to an &lt;a href="https://eating-disorders.org.uk/carbohydrate-phobia-go-enjoy-your-toast/"&gt;unhealthy fear of carbs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other limitation of both intermittent fasting and continuous carb restriction is that weight loss is a likely outcome. Hence these approaches are not universally beneficial for those who need to improve their health without losing weight or those looking to &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21677272/"&gt;maintain their weight&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are now testing the feasibility of an intermittent carb restriction diet, or a low-carb 5:2. So instead of restricting calories two days a week, you would restrict the number of carbs you consume twice a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If this is proven to be beneficial, it would offer the benefits of fasting without restricting calories on "fast" days.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/254752/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

&lt;span class="accordion__title"&gt;​​Is it OK to mix and match meals if there is one I do not like?&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_1-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, if there’s a meal you don’t like, feel free to repeat a different recipe in this plan or browse more of our healthy &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipes/18314/cuisines-regions/mediterranean/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Mediterranean diet recipes&lt;/a&gt; for additional inspiration. Because we created this meal plan with weight loss in mind, we set the calories at 1,500 calories per day and prioritized recipes high in protein and fiber that avoid added sugar. If you’re making a swap, you may want to select a recipe with a similar nutrition profile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;span class="accordion__title"&gt;Can I eat the same breakfast or lunch every day?&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_2-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can eat the same breakfast or lunch every day if it’s easier for your routine. Breakfast options span about 300 to 350 calories. Most lunches are about 350 calories, with the exception of the sandwich on Day 1 that’s quite a bit higher at 534 calories. If you’re opting to eat that sandwich daily while also monitoring calories or other nutrients, you may want to adjust a snack or two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;span class="accordion__title"&gt;Why is there not a modification for 1,200 calories?&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_3-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We no longer provide modifications for 1,200-calorie days in our meal plans. The 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans suggests that limiting calories to 1,200 per day is too low for most people to meet their nutritional needs, plus it’s unsustainable for long-term health and well-being.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="accordion__title"&gt;What’s the difference between added and natural sugars?&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

Added sugar can go by several different names, including maple syrup, agave, high-fructose corn syrup, corn sugar and more. Added sugars have little nutritional value compared to other types of foods. Naturally occurring sugars are those found naturally in foods, such as fruits, vegetables and unsweetened dairy. Natural sugars don’t pose the same health risks as added sugars because these foods are also rich in nutrients like vitamins, minerals, protein and fiber.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_173-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/2058981/ultimate-mediterranean-diet-shopping-list/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt; emphasizes a high intake of fruits and vegetables, lean proteins, plant-based proteins, whole grains, fish, nuts and other healthy fats. It limits excess added sugars and ultra-processed foods, such as refined grains, sugar-sweetened beverages and packaged sweets. This healthy eating style is consistently praised for its health benefits and flexibility. While it emphasizes nutrient-rich foods, it doesn’t eliminate single food groups, which makes it easy to follow and more sustainable long-term. Following the Mediterranean diet is linked with a reduced risk of developing certain cancers, heart disease, type 2 diabetes and obesity.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The Mediterranean diet helps support healthy aging by reducing inflammation and prevent the onset of age-related healthy conditions.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; In this seven-day meal plan, we incorporate the principles of the Mediterranean diet while mapping out a reduced-calorie plan that emphasizes protein and fiber. These two nutrients can help you feel full, which may facilitate weight loss.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Each day provides at least 82 grams of protein and 30 grams of fiber.&lt;br&gt;

loss, according to new research. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study presented at the European Congress on &lt;a href="/topic/obesity"&gt;Obesity&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="/topic/malaga"&gt;Malaga&lt;/a&gt; found that overweight and obese individuals who adopted this time-restricted eating pattern successfully lost weight and maintained their reduced weight over time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the research is yet to be peer-reviewed, the findings suggest that this strategy could be an effective tool for those struggling with weight management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="article-im-prompt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lead author Dr Alba Camacho-Cardenosa, from the University of Granada in Spain, said: “Our study found that restricting the eating window to eight hours at any time of the day for three months can result in significant &lt;a href="/topic/weight-loss"&gt;weight loss&lt;/a&gt; for at least a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These benefits can be attributed to the 16-hour fasting window rather than the time of eating.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-ii" class="sc-looa6c-0 hzcAyL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A previous randomised controlled trial by the same researchers published in the journal Nature Medicine found that restricting eating to eight hours per day decreased &lt;a href="/topic/body-weight"&gt;body weight&lt;/a&gt;

The problem is highest among those aged 55 to 64, with 73.5 per cent affected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/business-money/companies/article/weightwatchers-files-bankruptcy-ozempic-demand-qkpt5hw9t" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;WeightWatchers files for bankruptcy as Ozempic hits demand&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;The drug researchers pooled data from 36 different studies in 19 countries examining the link between mental health and GLP-1 drugs. Half of the studies involved people with severe mental illnesses, including bipolar and schizophrenia, while the rest examined the mood of adults without existing mental health problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;The drugs “had a beneficial effect on mental health in adults with and without mental disorders” and were found to improve outcomes in people with schizophrenia and depression, said the scientists’ report, published in the journal Psychoneuroendocrinology to coincide with the conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;For adults without mental health problems, the weekly injections improved mood, wellbeing and quality of life measures more than insulin and other anti-diabetic drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Until now, there has been mixed evidence of the impact of anti-obesity drugs on mental health, with some anecdotal reports from doctors and patients warning of a link to suicidal thoughts and self-harm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;But the new study found no link with suicide or a worsening of mental state among those taking the drugs. Doctors said this could provide reassurance to adults with mental illnesses who take the slimming drugs to battle weight gain, which itself is a common side effect of mood-altering drugs including antidepressants and antipsychotics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Breit, the lead author, said: “These results are particularly important for people with severe mental disorders who are three times more likely to be living with obesity than the general population.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Drugs such as Ozempic, made by the Danish pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk, can be used to “safely address the burden of obesity in people with mental illness”, said Breit, who added that more data was needed to establish their long-term efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;The review looked at four medications: semaglutide, liraglutide, exenatide, and dulaglutide. All these drugs mimic the action of the GLP-1 hormone, which is released by the gut after eating and makes people feel full. They were initially developed for treating type 2 diabetes, with semaglutide — or Ozempic — the first to be introduced in 2018. Semaglutide was then licensed for weight loss under the brand name &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/uk/healthcare/article/wegovy-ozempic-how-work-weight-loss-jab-injections-q0fdr3nj8" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;Wegovy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Since then, the drugs have been found to treat other conditions including &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/article/how-to-protect-your-heart-the-cardiologists-guide-p09dcrh9d" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt; and kidney disease, and cut levels of inflammation in the body regardless of whether or not people lose weight. Scientists believe they could be an option for multiple health conditions linked to inflammation, including cancer, arthritis, Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="last-paragraph" class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;For the study, scientists only tracked people who were taking the drugs to tackle obesity or type 2 diabetes. The drugs have not yet been tested among people of a healthy weight. In the UK, Wegovy is licensed only for patients who are classed as obese, or those who are classed as overweight but also at risk of a heart attack or stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p

We need to see more investment into finding treatments, whether that’s new medications or other forms of clinical support, which improve mental illness without troubling side-effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Weight loss injections should only be used on prescription and in conjunction with medical advice, and particular consideration must be given around people at risk of eating disorders.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Sat, 10 May 2025 22:01:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirgFBVV95cUxOQ3JWTjNVbDJoQ0JsUnNpQ2RBMFZWZ1B6YnZrTzFEaV9jZi12ZmRSMG1xbEQ1T1d2VnF3Y19yZWZmOHBGZTd2XzZWVnc0SFRycy1rd3ppVmlQVHlESjNhb1R5eDRBX0NOeWpLZEFYMkwzRnVDYUplNTJVQzViZWNJQU5mOVRxbHlscHlzcV9UWllLRHZkbUVqS0ItOENNd05rV0l2RVFfbUMzbDBxenc</guid></item><item><title>妈妈表现出奇怪的症状后，把1岁的孩子赶到急诊室。他的“改变生活”的诊断震惊了她（独家） -雅虎 | Mom Rushed 1-Year-Old to the ER After He Showed Odd Symptoms.

It was there that Bain was diagnosed with a bilateral hearing infection and sent home with a few antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The toddler's symptoms, however, suddenly worsened on the ride home. “He could not stop vomiting, but was drinking all the water/breastmilk he could get, was very short of breath with labored breathing, and eventually just had no energy to keep his head up,” Brandon tells PEOPLE exclusively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;What followed was a frantic trip to the emergency room, where fear gave way to shock as her son faced a diagnosis that would reshape their lives overnight.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;On Aug. 16, 2024, Bain was &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@marleebrandon/video/7499519805716712735" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:diagnosed with type 1 diabetes;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;diagnosed with type 1 diabetes&lt;/a&gt;. A visit to the emergency room revealed he was suffering from diabetic ketoacidosis – a life-threatening condition that resulted in the family being airlifted to a local state children's hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“I immediately went into shock,” the young mother recalls. “When you are taking your infant son to an ER because he is sick, you are assuming something like strep throat, RSV, COVID. I never expected such a life-changing diagnosis at that moment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Bain remained in the ICU for three days as they corrected his sugars and closed his gap. In the meantime, Brandon and her husband, Chandler, spent several days on a specialized education floor –  learning how to care for Bain’s new medical needs with confidence and clarity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“When I was in the med-helicopter with him in the back heading to the ICU, I think I finally just accepted that this is our new life,” she shares. “I will ultimately do anything to raise awareness and advocate for him.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Marlee gives her husband credit for managing their son’s diabetes in those first difficult weeks. It took her time to find the strength, held back by the heartbreak of knowing she’d have to cause her child pain to keep him alive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/accounts/login/?next=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.instagram.com%2Fchaneyfairphoto%2F&amp;amp;is_from_rle" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Chaney Fair Photo;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Chaney Fair Photo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bain Brandon was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes at just 12-months-old&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In hindsight, Marlee now realizes that Bain had been showing clear signs of type 1 diabetes – such as excessive urination, increased thirst, and noticeable weight loss – but as a new mother, she had assumed the changes were just part of normal growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“It is normal and wanted for infants/young toddlers to drink water, have wet diapers,” she says. “He was transitioning from a crawling baby to walking while also getting taller, so I assumed he is losing weight because of being more mobile.” It was tough for her to see the signs, especially since she and her husband have no immediate family with a history of type 1 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“On my husband's side of the family, he has 2nd, 3rd, and 4th cousins with T1D,” she reveals. “I get lots of questions about me having gestational diabetes when I was pregnant with Bain, and the answer is no. Bain's T1D was triggered by an illness, but he did have a family history of autoimmune as well.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The day Bain was diagnosed, Marlee quit her job at an outpatient pediatric therapy clinic as a speech language pathologist. “As much as people say ‘your son can have a normal life,’ it truly just is not possible,” she emphasizes. “I cannot send him to a daycare and trust that they take care of his T1D like I can.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Her life now revolves around managing Bain’s condition. She and her husband constantly monitor his Dexcom readings, count carbs for every meal and snack, and do their best to give their son a joyful, carefree childhood. “T1D burnout is real and it's because it truly takes every amount of energy you have to be a pancreas for your child,” she shares. “No two days are the same.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Never miss a story — sign up for&lt;a href="https://people.com/people-news-daily-newsletter-sign-up-8692701" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk: PEOPLE's free daily newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt; PEOPLE's free daily newsletter&lt;/a&gt; to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Like any parents of a one-year-old, they juggle the usual routines, but with added steps like pump and sensor site changes and timing meals around insulin. “He has worn a Dexcom since discharge from his inpatient stay at diagnosis. It is a lifesaver, truly,” Marlee reveals. “They are not perfect by any means, but just the mental stability it helps you have as parents…is top notch.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Marlee admits it will be difficult for her to release certain responsibilities to someone else as her son gets older. “I worry about him aging and going to school where someone will have to take care of him,” she tells PEOPLE. “It just is hard to let go of control when it's your child's life in their hands.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Using her training as a speech language pathologist, Marlee is handing over strength and knowledge to her son about his condition from a young age. In a viral TikTok, she is seen &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@marleebrandon/video/7497683078324817182" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:discussing type 1 diabetes with Bain;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;discussing type 1 diabetes with Bain&lt;/a&gt; as a way to promote early awareness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://people.com/egg-donor-defends-unique-bond-with-biological-daughter-exclusive-11703360" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Egg Donor Defends Unique Bond with Biological Daughter — and Why Little Girl Calls Her Mommy (Exclusive);elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Egg Donor Defends Unique Bond with Biological Daughter — and Why Little Girl Calls Her Mommy (Exclusive)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“I know the foundations of language, so I know what works and what does not. I have always talked to him about everything, trying to grow his receptive and expressive language,” she explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“So many people think babies ‘can't learn’ and ‘can't understand,' but it shows that they can learn and understand complex topics. Talk on their level, communicate using simple words and phrases, talk a lot and about everything. This will change his perception of this disease since he can understand &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; it is.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Marlee wants her son to grow up unafraid of his diabetes and aware of what managing it involves. She and her husband made it a priority to help him feel safe and comfortable during site changes or finger pricks. Like any parent, she hopes he'll grow into a confident, self-sufficient adult — one who lives a long, healthy life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;By sharing Bain’s journey, Marlee and her son have not only received love and support but also a great amount of knowledge through the T1D community. “There are so many creators that showcase their life with T1D, show things they have learned that medical professionals just don't teach you,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;By welcoming new perspectives and meeting new people, Marlee feels less alone and isolated. “Everyone on TikTok truly ‘just gets it’ and that always helps me after a bad night of… stubborn high blood sugar that we can not get down.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://people.com/todder-rushed-to-the-hospital-diagnosed-with-type-1-diabetes-exclusive-11726632" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:People;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;People&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Sat, 10 May 2025 21:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidEFVX3lxTE84WVpid1RPTFhCbXB0TW93bmptV3NEdk5lMnJiUUs5SndXeWpiemFOdUJFdXJWbS1qVS1sMnlhd3NldXd3R3JSR0lMSmtjVU9xQWZMNU8tQ2ZQUUczTExjVFBlZ3p3cFVKMnFpM0FWQ3Zrem13</guid></item><item><title>美国麻疹病例刚刚达到1000例。RFK Jr.仍然没有认真对待。- HuffPost | Measles Cases In The U.S. Just Hit 1,000.

Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. still isn’t taking it seriously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deadly and fast-spreading outbreak that first started in western Texas in January has spread to at least 31 states, with 1,001 cases in total reported, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="according to Friday data" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="681f8e4be4b0108bb6b70ed3" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="0"&gt;according to Friday data&lt;/a&gt; from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Texas currently has the most cases at 709. Three unvaccinated people have died, including two school-aged children from Texas. Data from the CDC shows that 96% of cases in the U.S. came from people who are unvaccinated or whose vaccination status is unknown. More than 120 people have been hospitalized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the onslaught continues, Kennedy ― an anti-vaccine conspiracy theorist who now heads the nation’s top health agency ― has routinely downplayed the deadly spread, including &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/rfk-jr-measles-treatments_n_6815381de4b08215e5f697bc?zp" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="promoting a range of unproven treatments." data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="681f8e4be4b0108bb6b70ed3" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="6815381de4b08215e5f697bc" data-vars-target-content-type="buzz" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="1"&gt;promoting a range of unproven treatments.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the death of a 6-year-old boy in February, Kennedy &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/rfk-jr-dismisses-measles-outbreak_n_67bf5519e4b053f9e3997f53" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="said the child’s death was “not unusual.”" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="681f8e4be4b0108bb6b70ed3" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="67bf5519e4b053f9e3997f53" data-vars-target-content-type="buzz" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="2"&gt;said the child’s death was “not unusual.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have measles outbreaks every year,” he said at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;FILE -A sign is seen outside of Seminole Hospital District offering measles testing, Feb. 21, 2025, in Seminole, Texas.

&lt;p&gt;The country’s measles outbreak has surpassed 1,000 cases for the first time in 30 years, the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention &lt;/a&gt;revealed this week.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The data, which is based on confirmed measles cases reported to CDC, show that the disease has now hit 1,001 people in a total of 31 states — a sharp uptick from the 285 reported cases in all of 2024.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In 2025 alone, there have been a total of 14 outbreaks, which is categorized as 3 or more related cases — and 93% of the 1,001 cases were from these outbreaks. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Three people have died from the disease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two were unvaccinated, but healthy, school-aged children in Texas — which is where the majority of total cases have been confirmed — and one was an adult in New Mexico, &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/05/09/nx-s1-5393762/measles-math-what-to-know-about-1-001-measles-cases-across-the-country#:~:text=3%20deaths,was%20diagnosed%20with%20measles%20posthumously." target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;according to NPR&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;The extremely contagious viral illness is spread when an infected person coughs and sneezes, and is marked by symptoms of high fever, runny nose, cough, red and watery eyes and a rash, &lt;a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/measles" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;according to Johns Hopkins Medicine&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It is so contagious that about 9 out of 10 people who come near a person with measles and are not protected by vaccination will also become infected,” the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/downloads/measles-factsheet-outbreak-508.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;CDC warns on its website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If more than 95% percent of people in a community have gotten the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine, most will be protected from contracting the measles due to herd immunity. Out of the 1,001 patients with the disease, 96% were unvaccinated or had an unknown vaccination status.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Vaccination numbers are down amongst US kindergarteners, decreasing from 95.2% during the 2019–2020 school year to 92.7% during 2023–2024, according to the&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html#cdc_data_surveillance_section_7-mmr-vaccine-coverage-for-kindergarteners-by-school-year-2009%e2%80%932024" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt; CDC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Children under the age of 5 account for around one-third of the 1,001 cases in the country, the latest data show. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Department of Health &amp;amp; Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/kids-health/health-secretary-rfk-jr-measles-vaccine-falsely-claims-wanes-rcna200636" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;told CBS News&lt;/a&gt; the disease won’t ever disappear, since the vaccine’ effectiveness diminishes over time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We’re always going to have measles, no matter what happens, as the vaccine wanes very quickly,”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia,  disagreed, telling&lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/kids-health/health-secretary-rfk-jr-measles-vaccine-falsely-claims-wanes-rcna200636" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt; NBC&lt;/a&gt;, “We eliminated measles from this country. That could never happen if immunity waned.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The HSS &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/05/09/measles-hits-1000-cases-for-the-second-time-in-30-years-00337905" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;told Politico&lt;/a&gt; that Kennedy is taking the jump in cases seriously.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Secretary Kennedy has responded to the current measles outbreak with urgency and clarity. He has publicly emphasized that vaccines remain the most effective way to prevent measles,” an HSS spokesperson told the outlet.&lt;/p&gt;

The strongest predictor was condom use at first sex—adolescents who used a condom during their first sexual experience were more likely to continue using them in the future. Contrary to expectations, knowledge about safer sex was not associated with condom use. The findings were published in&lt;em&gt; JAMA Pediatrics&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adolescence, typically defined as the period between ages 10 and 19, is a stage of rapid physical, emotional, and cognitive development. It is marked by puberty, identity exploration, and growing independence. This period plays a critical role in shaping social skills, decision-making abilities, and long-term behavioral patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is also a time when many individuals begin engaging in sexual activity. While sex can be an important part of emotional intimacy and overall well-being, it also carries the risk of sexually transmitted infections if not practiced safely. Research has shown that adolescents are more likely than adults to experience unintended pregnancies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study author Laura Widman and her colleagues set out to identify the factors linked to condom use among adolescents. Although condoms are a simple and effective way to reduce the risk of sexually transmitted infections and unintended pregnancy, only 52% of sexually active high school students reported using a condom during their last sexual encounter, according to previous studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers conducted a systematic review of the scientific literature. They searched databases including Medline, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and Communication Source using keywords related to adolescents, condom use, and various potential predictors of condom use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They looked for studies conducted on U.S. adolescents with an average age under 19 and no participants older than 24. To be included, studies also had to report on condom use behaviors, be published in English after January 2000, and examine associations between condom use and at least one of 36 potential correlates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The search initially yielded 1,597 articles. After review, 249 studies met the inclusion criteria. Together, these studies represented a total of 251,713 participants, with an average age of 16.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From these studies, the researchers identified 23 factors that were associated with adolescent condom use. The most consistent and strongest correlate was condom use at first sex. Adolescents who used a condom during their first sexual encounter were significantly more likely to use them in later sexual experiences. Intentions to use condoms and communication with partners about condom use were also strongly associated with actual condom use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, knowledge about safer sex—a core component of most sex education programs—was not associated with condom use. This finding challenges the common assumption that increasing awareness alone will lead to safer sexual behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This systematic review and meta-analysis identified the strongest and weakest correlates of adolescent condom use across nearly 25 years of research. These results can be used to refine sexual behavior theory and guide more targeted evidence-based intervention efforts for adolescents,” the study authors concluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study sheds light on the factors associated with condom use by adolescents. However, it should be noted that condom use depends on many factors and is a habit that can easily change. Because of this, results of future studies might not be the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper, “&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/10.1001/jamapediatrics.2024.5594?utm_campaign=articlePDF%26utm_medium=articlePDFlink%26utm_source=articlePDF%26utm_content=jamapediatrics.2024.5594"&gt;Identifying the Strongest Correlates of Condom Use Among US Adolescents A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,&lt;/a&gt;” was authored by Laura Widman, Reina Evans-Paulson, Anne J.

   &lt;p&gt;The Food and Drug administration has approved the U.S.'s first at-home alternative to the Pap smear, a procedure generations of women have dreaded and often found painful.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The new device by &lt;a href="https://www.getteal.com/news/fda-approves-teal-healths-teal-wand-tm---the-first-and-only-at-home-self-collection-device-for-cervical-cancer-screening-introducing-a-comfortable-alternative-to-in-person-screening" target="_blank"&gt;Teal Health&lt;/a&gt; will offer a "much preferred experience," the company said in its announcement, and also aims to increase screening rates by making the procedure more convenient.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Traditionally, gynecologists have inserted a cold metal speculum deep into a woman's vagina to scrape cells from the cervix. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The Teal Wand — "built with empathy," the company said — uses a swab to collect a vaginal sample. Women will then mail the sample to a lab that will screen for HPV (human papillomavirus), the virus that causes nearly all cervical cancers. A growing body of research has found &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2018/07/03/625696664/for-women-over-30-there-may-be-a-better-choice-than-the-pap-smear" target="_blank"&gt;HPV testing&lt;/a&gt; to be highly accurate.&lt;/p&gt;   
   
   

   &lt;p&gt;The FDA approval Friday follows a &lt;a href="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/63d5330e6841081487be0bd6/681d6148758c5c1fe0c81f2e_Teal-Health-SELF-CERV-Report-May92025-sml.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;U.S.-based study&lt;/a&gt; that found at-home screening was just as effective as that done in a doctor's office. The study also found women overwhelmingly preferred self–screening at home, and said they'd be more likely to stay up to date with cervical cancer screenings that way.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Every year, about &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/cervical-cancer/about/key-statistics.html" target="_blank"&gt;13,000 cases&lt;/a&gt; of cervical cancer are diagnosed, and more than 4,000 women die from the disease. Rates are down dramatically since &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2015/04/30/398872421/the-great-success-and-enduring-dilemma-of-cervical-cancer-screening" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Georgios Papanicolaou&lt;/a&gt; published a 1943 paper on how to use the Pap smear for screening, and it then became common.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But about a &lt;a href="https://odphp.health.gov/healthypeople/objectives-and-data/browse-objectives/cancer/increase-proportion-females-who-get-screened-cervical-cancer-c-09" target="_blank"&gt;quarter of women&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S. are behind on such screenings, and medical experts say reducing that is key to the ultimate goal of eliminating cervical cancer. There's also a &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/cervical-cancer/about/key-statistics.html" target="_blank"&gt;racial gap&lt;/a&gt;, with Black and Native American women far more likely to die from cervical cancer than white women. The &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goats-and-soda/2024/09/12/g-s1-21283/cervical-cancer-hpv-vaccine" target="_blank"&gt;HPV vaccine&lt;/a&gt; for teen and preteen girls, introduced in 2007, has also led to a global push to tackle the disease that way.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;At-home cervical cancer screenings are already available in several other countries, including &lt;a href="https://www.health.gov.au/self-collection-for-the-cervical-screening-test" target="_blank"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/europe/news/item/08-09-2022-hpv-self-sampling-in-sweden-leading-to-faster-elimination-of-cervical-cancer" target="_blank"&gt;Sweden&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Teal Health says its self-testing device will be available starting next month, in California first and then expanding. It will be by prescription, through a telehealth service, for women 25-65 years old who are "at average risk." The company says it's working with insurance companies to provide coverage.&lt;/p&gt;

The diet also included supplemental vitamins believed to boost cognition. "Those interventions were coupled with 30 minutes of aerobic exercise daily and strength training three times a week... to boost social support, subjects and spouses participated in an hourlong support group three times a week led by a mental health professional."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the study had favorable results, it has been viewed under scrutiny by other academics due to its conflicting results with a study from June of 2024 that found patients who switch to a healthier lifestyle could lower their risk of the disease but could not reverse its effects. That study was also very small, so many scientists agreed that a larger study needs to be done to find which result is more accurate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, since the study implemented so many lifestyle changes it's hard to pinpoint exactly which one was the most helpful, or if they were all necessary to help the patient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the issues with the study, senior study author Rudolph Tanzi said that the results are "shocking."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"To get significant results on these cognitive tests in just 20 weeks, in just 50 patients, only altering lifestyle, to be very honest was just shocking to me, but shocking because it says maybe this matters," Tanzi said. "But I'm the first to say that it’s a small study. It was only 20 weeks, so let’s not jump to any conclusions. But boy, what a great start."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WKRC</author><pubDate>Sat, 10 May 2025 16:48:54 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikAJBVV95cUxPbUpQUHlQcWlfb1M3YWRVOTZTbUFhRFdHM0NHLUpuVnkzSlpubzFMNlRKVlFOZ0ZxY2RiU0E1N0pZT1BDRHJjOWkxNnB0V3dNWHRPTmNBbmhlNzFSQXNUWUJKSFd1ZERmQ09QcUZsbS1QSng5enUtNVJ0dFliV2NoNVlqWS1rS0VHRjJ3RHNaRHI5c3Y1bWQ5YnN5TUNKT19WTUVPMXBDc2ZOWWdCZVllVF9DVlgxZzRrazlQQzRhOHhFQlVUWUlvb1ZyWDFwUktzeEtPOXRfQmk1eHloeFpFdUk0SkFkOVUzcUc4Y0g5dkxmdFNhZkY2cU5JNmxma3Q2RzVGSV9KVUJ6VWd3TVJNMw</guid></item><item><title>蛋白质发现只需一剂即可提高寿命、肌肉和脑力- Earth.com | Protein discovered that boosts lifespan, muscle, and brain power with just one dose - Earth.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqwFBVV95cUxQNjBnZjNqVGNIT09iSUNvTUg5T19ZYmhQUTRPZmFiYVNNUl9DbjV5czB3UVE4eklLMGZFYUhWdVQwUmVDV0Z4N2VrODFLX3dnSnpIQVU4Yk9kVC1LQjhxSzhVcm5hdmstdmY5NmRuNVl4ZThVUndSamc2ZGZvR2RJUU9DcGRJNWJRSlVFV1UxOWlsRGlxOHNBSi1uaUtxNmc4emJoZnhrT0RfZTQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page_content__AwOj6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people worry about the gradual loss of stamina, strength, and mental sharpness that comes with aging. Scientists have been exploring new ideas to tackle these concerns and increase not just our years but also our quality of life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An international team has been testing a special approach that raises levels of a natural protein in the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their research was led by Professor Miguel Chillón at the Institute of Neurosciences of the Autonomous University of Barcelona (&lt;a href="https://web.ub.edu/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;UB&lt;/a&gt;), and it shines a light on what might someday help people stay healthier for a &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/organ-aging-can-predict-diseases-decades-in-advance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;longer period&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-protein-s-kl-and-its-role-in-aging"&gt;Protein s-KL and its role in aging&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The protein at the center of this work is &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41581-018-0078-3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Klotho&lt;/a&gt;, and the form used in the experiments is the &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26599613/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;secreted version&lt;/a&gt; known as s-KL. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some studies suggest that Klotho may influence a wide range of biological processes by managing signals that affect inflammation and cell aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The name Klotho first appeared in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/36285" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;scientific journals&lt;/a&gt; in the late 1990s, when experiments showed that a deficiency of this protein made mice look older and more frail at younger ages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have been working with the Klotho protein for some time, due to its therapeutic &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/how-old-are-you-really-new-tool-measures-aging-from-the-inside-out/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;potential&lt;/a&gt; for treating neurodegenerative diseases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this study, we wanted to see whether s-KL could also be beneficial for healthy aging by examining a broad range of factors,” explained Professor Chillón.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-differences-between-males-and-females"&gt;Differences between males and females&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The effects of s-KL weren’t the same for male and female mice. Males showed clearer gains in lifespan and muscle strength, while females responded more strongly in measures of bone structure, especially when treated earlier in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These sex-based differences might be tied to how male and female bodies process viral vectors or express the s-KL protein. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hormonal factors could also play a role, suggesting future human trials may need sex-specific &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/curiosity-might-help-you-stay-sharp-as-you-age/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;strategies&lt;/a&gt; to get the best results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-aging-improvements-with-s-kl-protein"&gt;Aging improvements with s-KL protein&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers noticed that mice given s-KL retained better muscle tissue composition, with less of the scarring often linked to older age. They also had stronger performance in tasks that tested endurance and coordination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weakened bones can be a big danger in older adults, so it was intriguing that s-KL seemed to keep the inner bone structure more intact. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This finding aligns with earlier &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16436465/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;observations&lt;/a&gt; that Klotho influences mineral balance in bone and may reduce the chances of fractures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-timing-may-matter"&gt;Why timing may matter&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mice treated at 12 months old showed more pronounced improvements in longevity and physical health than those treated at 6 months. One reason could be that the aging mice produced higher levels of the s-KL protein after treatment, which may have amplified its &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/human-bodies-begin-breaking-down-two-very-precise-ages/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;effects&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This finding raises an important question: Could middle age be a better window for intervention than early adulthood? If so, the timing of s-KL therapy in humans could be just as critical as the treatment itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-signs-of-brain-support"&gt;Signs of brain support&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aside from the physical improvements, the investigators measured changes in the hippocampus, a region crucial for memory and cognitive ability. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They detected heightened markers of &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4563705/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;adult neurogenesis&lt;/a&gt;, which is the process by which new neurons form in mature brains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was also evidence that key immune cells in the brain might be working in a more balanced way. This could help remove cellular waste and reduce the chronic inflammation tied to age-related brain diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers used gene therapy vectors that prompted cells to produce s-KL over an extended period. These vectors included genetic instructions, and once inside the mice, the cells took over production of the protein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The approach was designed to boost s-KL levels in both the brain and other areas of the body. This helped ensure that many of the organs linked to muscle, bone, and memory got the extra support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-s-kl-protein-and-human-aging"&gt;s-KL protein and human aging?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although this study was done in mice, the results open the door to potential &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/defying-time-three-ways-to-slow-biological-aging/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;therapies&lt;/a&gt; for humans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Age-related decline in mobility, memory, and bone strength all contribute to lower independence and quality of life in older adults. A treatment that addresses these together could shift how we think about aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many current drugs only target one issue at a time, like &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/outdoor-exercise-amplifies-physical-and-mental-health-benefits/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;osteoporosis&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/your-sleep-may-predict-memory-loss-years-in-advance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;memory loss&lt;/a&gt;. But the effects of s-KL span across systems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This points toward the possibility of a more unified strategy to aging – one that works with the body’s existing repair mechanisms rather than replacing them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-s-next-for-s-kl-protein-research"&gt;What’s next for s-KL protein research?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we can find a viable delivery method, s-KL could make a significant contribution to improving people’s quality of life and helping to build the healthiest society possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists continue to explore whether direct protein administration or refined gene-based aging options might work best for humans. They plan to keep studying how s-KL weaves into different biological pathways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/molecular-therapy-family/molecular-therapy/fulltext/S1525-0016(25)00120-0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Molecular Therapy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Sat, 10 May 2025 16:39:07 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqwFBVV95cUxQNjBnZjNqVGNIT09iSUNvTUg5T19ZYmhQUTRPZmFiYVNNUl9DbjV5czB3UVE4eklLMGZFYUhWdVQwUmVDV0Z4N2VrODFLX3dnSnpIQVU4Yk9kVC1LQjhxSzhVcm5hdmstdmY5NmRuNVl4ZThVUndSamc2ZGZvR2RJUU9DcGRJNWJRSlVFV1UxOWlsRGlxOHNBSi1uaUtxNmc4emJoZnhrT0RfZTQ</guid></item><item><title>Ozempic上的人开始不喜欢肉类和油炸食品。我们开始了解其中的原因。- Live Science | People on Ozempic start disliking meat and fried foods.

&lt;p&gt;For most of her life, Alyssa Fraser took comfort in cooking. Fraser, a former food reporter from Minnesota, used to relish the process of whipping up her favorite chicken and vegetable recipe or batches of pasta. But after she started taking the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/new-antiobesity-drugs-help-people-shed-dozens-of-pounds-but-they-must-be-taken-for-a-lifetime/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/new-antiobesity-drugs-help-people-shed-dozens-of-pounds-but-they-must-be-taken-for-a-lifetime/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;popular weight-loss medication Wegovy&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, her culinary interests seemed to disappear because she became disinterested in food — and certain types of food became particularly off-putting. Many savory meals lost their appeal, and some proteins began to taste too much like the "barnyard" the animal came from, she says. Even her favorite wine, which usually tasted crisp and citrusy, seemed weirdly "vegetal."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similar to Fraser, other users of Wegovy (known in its generic form as semaglutide), along with those of &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/whats-the-secret-behind-ozempics-sweeping-health-benefits/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/whats-the-secret-behind-ozempics-sweeping-health-benefits/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Ozempic&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (a form of semaglutide used to treat type 2 diabetes), &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/mounjaro-and-ozempic-arent-the-same-heres-how-weight-loss-drugs-compare/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/mounjaro-and-ozempic-arent-the-same-heres-how-weight-loss-drugs-compare/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Zepbound&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (known generically as tirzepatide) and other medications broadly called glucagonlike peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists, have described peculiar changes in the way food tastes. GLP-1 drugs — initially designed to help treat type 2 diabetes by triggering insulin release — can cause weight loss by making people feel full faster. But some people report that in addition to an increase in satiety, they experience changes in their preferences for specific foods — they find meats suddenly repulsive, fried foods too heavy and savory snacks unappealing. On &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WegovyWeightLoss/comments/1jl3n8d/has_wegovy_changed_what_you_eat_question_from/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.reddit.com/r/WegovyWeightLoss/comments/1jl3n8d/has_wegovy_changed_what_you_eat_question_from/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;online forums&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and in &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/14791641251318309" target="_blank" data-url="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/14791641251318309" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;scientific surveys&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, some people have expressed a general loss of interest in food overall — a few have even said that the drugs have redefined food as a necessity rather than a joy for them. These accounts may even be captured in &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5073929" target="_blank" data-url="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5073929" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;grocery store data&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that suggest people on GLP-1 medications spend less on food, especially calorie-dense and processed items.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some preliminary evidence suggests &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28266779/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28266779/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;changes in food preferences might play a role in weight loss&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but it's not clear how much such changes contribute to that result compared with the medications' effect on satiety. And research on the phenomenon has mostly involved animal models or small studies of humans. Experts, however, are starting to gain some clues as to how common these apparent shifts in food preference and taste really are among users and what might be behind them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/medicine-drugs/ozempic-in-a-pill-new-oral-drug-may-work-as-well-as-ozempic-style-injectables" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/medicine-drugs/ozempic-in-a-pill-new-oral-drug-may-work-as-well-as-ozempic-style-injectables"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ozempic in a pill? New oral drug may work as well as Ozempic-style injectables&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0950329325000825%23bb0070" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0950329325000825%23bb0070" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;recent study&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; published in &lt;em&gt;Food Quality and Preference &lt;/em&gt;found that people on GLP-1 medications reported reaching for processed foods, as well as refined grains and beef, less often. They also said they were drinking less soda and other sweetened drinks and increasing their intake of fruit, leafy greens and water. Further, they reported consuming about 700 fewer calories per day. These findings rely on self-reported data, however, which can sometimes be unreliable, says Brandon McFadden, a professor in food policy economics at the University of Arkansas and co-author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, although GLP-1 users reported eating fewer calorie-dense foods, most people didn't necessarily lose all desire for them. This is because &lt;em&gt;liking&lt;/em&gt; a food is &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-sugar-and-fat-trick-the-brain-into-wanting-more-food/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-sugar-and-fat-trick-the-brain-into-wanting-more-food/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;different from &lt;/u&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;wanting&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;u&gt; it&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, says John Blundell, an emeritus professor in psychobiology at the University of Leeds in England, who was not involved in the recent paper. A person might not find a food particularly tasty (in other words, they might not enjoy the specific sensory experience of consuming it) but still have a strong behavioral drive to eat it. GLP-1 medications seem to involve the reverse: people still like certain foods but have less of an immediate urge to eat them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002934325000592" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002934325000592" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;drugs mimic a hormone called GLP-1&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which the gut naturally secretes in response to food and which binds to the hormone's receptors around the body — including in brain areas involved in appetite regulation and in &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/ozempic-quiets-food-noise-in-the-brain-but-how/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/ozempic-quiets-food-noise-in-the-brain-but-how/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;reward pathways that reduce the pleasure response to food&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Researchers have found that this is the primary way the drugs cause people to lose weight, and some think it might be involved in altered food preferences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-zqguRcyM69TiK3RptGioAL" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-zqguRcyM69TiK3RptGioAL slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Desires for specific foods can change depending on whether a person is generally hungry or full. For example, when you're hungry, you're more likely to want meaty, high-protein or sometimes high-fat foods rather than sweet ones, Blundell explains. "When you become full, the reverse happens," he says: a big piece of meat or a high-fat food becomes aversive — but you might feel like you have a so-called second stomach for dessert. One plausible explanation for this, Blundell says, could be that GLP-1 drugs' satiating effect simply makes such end-of-meal preferences kick in. It's also possible that some aspects of the drugs' compounds could directly act on specific food preferences through some other biological mechanism. "But it hasn't been demonstrated," says Blundell, who is working with a food company to develop foods that are more palatable for people on GLP-1 medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blundell led a small study, published in 2017, that found people taking semaglutide not only reduced their overall daily food intake but also &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://dom-pubs.pericles-prod.literatumonline.com/doi/10.1111/dom.12932" target="_blank" data-url="https://dom-pubs.pericles-prod.literatumonline.com/doi/10.1111/dom.12932" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;preferred and consumed fewer high-fat and savory foods&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Previous research that he published in 2007 showed that &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17655972/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17655972/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;being full also diminishes similar cravings&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But satiety alone may not fully explain the shift in eating preferences. Emerging evidence and anecdotal user accounts suggest changes to the body's taste mechanisms could also play a role. Some users describe flavors becoming stronger or unpleasant while on the medications, though individual experiences seem to vary: Siobhan, a Los Angeles–based writer, who has been taking Wegovy since 2021 and withheld her last name for privacy, says she still finds fatty foods such as French fries appealing — but her favorite food, panang curry, has become too bitter. "I've been eating that curry for 20 years," Siobhan says&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; "It just didn't taste right anymore." Two-year Wegovy user Sarah Streby says she can no longer stomach eggs or broccoli, and her love for spicy food has waned — causing her to change how she cooks for her family. "Now everyone's complaining the food is too mild because [I] can't handle the spice," she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At press time, Novo Nordisk, the manufacturer of Wegovy and Ozempic, had not responded to a request for comment from&lt;em&gt; Scientific American.&lt;/em&gt; A spokesperson for Eli Lilly, which makes the weight-loss drug Zepbound, told &lt;em&gt;Scientific American&lt;/em&gt; in an e-mail, "We do not have data to share concerning changes in food taste or preference among individuals taking GLP-1 medications." The spokesperson added that known side effects are listed on the medication's labels and that anyone experiencing those side effects should contact their health care provider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists have found GLP-1 receptors &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7830704/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7830704/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;in human taste buds&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which hints at a possible explanation for alterations in taste, but findings remain mixed. &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21600942/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21600942/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Some past research&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25619950/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25619950/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;has found&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that people with a higher body weight tend to perceive flavors less intensely, and &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://academic.oup.com/nutritionreviews/article/82/6/831/7240120" target="_blank" data-url="https://academic.oup.com/nutritionreviews/article/82/6/831/7240120" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;some evidence suggests&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; this may &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2019/2978026" target="_blank" data-url="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2019/2978026" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;prompt people to eat more&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in an attempt to &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.597704/full" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.597704/full" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;get a bigger sensory reward&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. In the case of sweet foods, people with a higher body weight also &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://academic.oup.com/chemse/article-abstract/41/2/169/2365940" target="_blank" data-url="https://academic.oup.com/chemse/article-abstract/41/2/169/2365940" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;may be less able to perceive&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; a high sugar content, though findings on this &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9807659/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9807659/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;have been contradictory&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. A small study presented at the Endocrine Society's 2024 annual conference found that &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11453302/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11453302/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;women taking semaglutide were more sensitive to taste&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; compared with those on a placebo. Brain scans showed increased activity in a region involved in processing sensory rewards when participants tasted something sweet, suggesting that semaglutide may heighten taste perception and make certain foods less appealing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But another study published in March in &lt;em&gt;Physiology &amp;amp; Behavior &lt;/em&gt;seems to suggest the opposite. It found that 46 people taking these medications &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S003193842400341X" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S003193842400341X" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;experienced a reduced sensitivity to all five basic tastes&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — sweet, sour, salty, bitter and brothy (or umami) — compared with people in a control group. Past studies in mice linked the activation of GLP-1 receptors to alterations in sweet taste perception, but researchers were surprised to see that the effect in humans was broader than anticipated, says Richard Doty, director of the Smell and Taste Center at the University of Pennsylvania and co-author of the March paper. Previous research that linked GLP-1 medications to alterations in taste has mostly looked at diabetic populations, Doty says, adding that "the focus has always been on sugar, and so people haven't looked at the other sensory systems any great detail." He suspects the GLP-1 receptors found in taste buds are behind the March findings, "but we really don't know; there needs to be more research on that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For some, the drugs' effects on satiety and taste are welcome changes that make it easier to eat less. But for others, it's more complicated. "Not only am I not cooking or really taking an interest in food — if I want it, it's sweets," Fraser says. "And even then, if it's super sweet, I'll take a bite or two, and I'm like, I gotta put it down."

&lt;p&gt;“So often, people don’t age well because they’re not upfront about what their needs are,” said &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/robyn-golden-2466315/" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7874738" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Robyn Golden&lt;/a&gt;, the associate vice president of social work and community health at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago. “How do we make it OK for people to say, ‘This is what I need, I’m feeling lonely, I need someone to go out with on a Tuesday night.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rampant ageism makes it easy for people to feel like a burden or invisible, Golden said, which can encourage silent suffering. But it’s important to push against that and let folks know when you’re having a tough time. So if you’re someone who can share your thoughts and needs with your family and friends, that’s a good sign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What’s more, if you’re struggling with depression and anxiety, it’s important to let your doctor know. There’s often a false belief that anxiety or depression after a certain age is more “normal,” but Golden said this is not true.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Depression can be treated at any age, and not just with medication, with counseling, with group interventions, you name it. So, I think that’s part of how you age well, being open to being able to say, ‘This is who I am, this is what I need,’” she explained.&lt;/p&gt;

These chemicals are &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/risk-prevention/chemicals/formaldehyde.html"&gt;known carcinogens&lt;/a&gt;, which means they &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="/life-style/health-and-families/acne-best-treatment-cancer-benzene-clearasil-b2510485.html"&gt;can cause cancer or help it grow.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was based on surveys filled out by 70 Black and Latina women in Los Angeles. Each time one of the women used a personal care product, they took a picture of the ingredient label and sent it to researchers via an app. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="article-im-prompt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fifty-three percent of the women used at least one personal care product that listed formaldehyde releasers on its label, the study found. These women also reported using many of these products daily or multiple times per week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The carcinogen was found in 58 percent of the haircare products reported, the study revealed. But women also reported using shampoo, lotions, body soap and eyelash glue that contain the carcinogen. Twelve of the lotions containing formaldehyde-releasing preservatives that the women reported using were from the same brand: Bath &amp;amp; Body Works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-ii" class="sc-looa6c-0 hzcAyL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 hCNBSR sc-482ou5-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 hXrpsW"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="3" class="sc-482ou5-0 gwYuPU"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/05/10/15/03/iStock-1059157466.jpg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/05/10/15/03/iStock-1059157466.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/05/10/15/03/iStock-1059157466.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="The study found that various products, including hair-straighteners, shampoos, lotions and eyelash glues, contain formaldehyde" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 QHifS inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-482ou5-1 eZtLil" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 fsbheq inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-65281"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 jEeRhv"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 kBlcBC kIlksO"&gt;The study found that various products, including hair-straighteners, shampoos, lotions and eyelash glues, contain formaldehyde&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 hAhJPR"&gt; (Getty Images)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Independent&lt;/em&gt; has contacted Bath &amp;amp; Body Works for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Formaldehyde &lt;a href="/news/health/formaldehyde-toxic-chemical-epa-warning-b2672869.html"&gt;presents an “unreasonable risk of injury to human health” in current practices&lt;/a&gt;, the Environmental Protection Agency said in January. Previous studies had already revealed the carcinogen is in products to help straighten hair or smooth curls, and it &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39020161/"&gt;poses a disproportionate risk to Black women&lt;/a&gt; and other women of color. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This week’s study is the first to demonstrate that the carcinogen is in a wide variety of products beyond hair straighteners, according to the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We found that this isn’t just about hair straighteners,” lead author Dr. Robin Dodson said in a &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.silentspring.org/news/formaldehyde-releasers-found-common-personal-care-products"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;. “These chemicals are in products we use all the time, all over our bodies.

We shouldn’t have to be chemists to figure out what kinds of products will make us sick.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="/topic/european-union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt; and ten U.S. states have banned or proposed a ban on formaldehyde. The &lt;a href="/topic/food-and-drug-administration"&gt;Food and Drug Administration&lt;/a&gt; even proposed a national ban on formaldehyde and formaldehyde-releasing chemicals in 2023, but it has yet to be enacted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-iii" class="sc-looa6c-0 hzcAyL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Dodson said the best solution would be ending the use of these chemicals in personal products altogether.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Ideally, companies shouldn’t be putting these chemicals in products in the first place,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Sat, 10 May 2025 16:27:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiowFBVV95cUxQMnozN1pZbC1OSVVRVlhBR0JyQzhOam51M0VCQ0lvSU5nU29WZmdJcF92LUpQRW1ZeFZnU1RtamRLTzV1SmJtRUxYTUZIZVlKZ2xPUTJSZTgyaFh2OHFLOHN6eHM1dVRldDltU1h2QnlFVnozaDRYZXVrUUtMNmxDUVdPQ2pKUEstdEpKcml1RE5JZmx1Slk0bzV2b0dMMC13Nktv</guid></item><item><title>“暗光子”光理论旨在推翻著名的双缝实验，颠覆量子物理学- Earth.com | 'Dark photon' theory of light aims to take down the famous double-slit experiment, upending quantum physics - Earth.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiuwFBVV95cUxPb0hNX2RyN3h6U0tKdDRlQ0RYRC0xa2dNb2lYeEdiOU1SMGhWNXlsOFFmY1daRHlrazU4aXBXZmNER01Zdnd5VUdFR1NweXgxNnkwSEJ4TS1OVVFqbFBqd3Vqc1Nuby1hQ29IMlR0Z3J4YnF2QmJrWU1BSmpXdjYxR183ZFBWakNJTjdwRU5tZEU5cVg1NjJDOFJhbEJJNE54MHMwWVVjUkUycTVyMS1QZ0xmNXBEb2VxcDJn?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page_content__AwOj6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For centuries, most scientists have shared the belief that light behaves as both a wave and a particle. This idea, then, became the central component to quantum theory, sprouting the field of science known as quantum mechanics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The double-slit experiment supported the idea, showing bright and dark bands that indicated wave-like interference. But now, a new study suggests that this experiment might not lock us into seeing light as a wave.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the experts, we can interpret those interference bands using quantum particles alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was led by Gerhard Rempe, the director of the &lt;a href="https://www.mpq.mpg.de/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Max Planck Institute&lt;/a&gt; for Quantum Optics. He teamed up with collaborators at &lt;a href="https://www.srinter.ufscar.br/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Federal University of São Carlos&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://ethz.ch/en.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;ETH Zurich&lt;/a&gt; for the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-modern-physics-and-our-view-of-light"&gt;Modern physics and our view of light&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1801, &lt;a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rstl.1802.0004" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Thomas Young&lt;/a&gt; introduced an experiment by shining light through two narrow openings to produce intersecting fringes on a screen. His findings led many to conclude that light must be a wave. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A century later, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/quantum-gates-teleported-a-leap-toward-scalable-computing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;quantum&lt;/a&gt; mechanics began to take shape, revealing that quantum particles like electrons could mimic wave-like light interference too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Albert Einstein’s work on the &lt;a href="https://www.scirp.org/reference/referencespapers?referenceid=1617833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;photoelectric effect&lt;/a&gt; showed that light travels in discrete packets called photons. &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/121580a0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Niels Bohr&lt;/a&gt; then elaborated on wave-particle duality, ushering in one of the cornerstones of modern physics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-dark-and-visible-photons"&gt;Dark and visible photons&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new &lt;a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.134.133603" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;approach&lt;/a&gt; from the research team explores the concept of bright and dark modes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In their view, interference patterns can emerge from combining “detectable” and “undetectable” photon states. These bright states interact with an observer, while dark &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/google-claims-commercial-quantum-computing-is-just-five-years-away/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;states&lt;/a&gt; remain hidden.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such hidden photons might linger at places where we would normally think the light cancels out. Observers who try to track the path of these photons alter the state, flipping what was dark into bright or vice versa. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From this perspective, the light pathways can be viewed as quantum superpositions, rather than purely classical wave interference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-quantum-particles-and-light-interference"&gt;Quantum particles and light interference &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In my humble opinion, our description is meaningful as it provides a &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/baffling-quantum-entanglement-statistics-puzzle-finally-solved-advanced-technologies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;quantum&lt;/a&gt; picture (with particles) of classical interference (with waves): maxima and minima result from entangled bright (that couple) and dark (that do not couple) particle states,” said Rempe.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Physicists once believed that any point of total destructive interference prevented light from interacting with matter. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the new framework, even a place with zero average electric field can host particles that standard measurement devices might miss. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The group emphasizes that these findings do not throw out past results but reveal a new layer of detail. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rempe said their model helps clarify parts of a long-standing debate – like which-path detection – that once involved major figures in science, including Newton, Maxwell, Einstein, Millikan, and others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-wave-only-theories-vs-dark-photons"&gt;Wave-only theories vs. dark photons&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/bridging-quantum-classical-physics-nanoparticle-entanglement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Classical physics&lt;/a&gt; can explain most everyday optical events. Yet certain experiments in quantum optics highlight outcomes that purely wave-based theories cannot handle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers have long known that Maxwell’s equations begin to fail in scenarios where single photons interact with atoms on tiny scales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This new framework places particles at the heart of interference. The wave-like fringes may just be statistical maps of how bright or dark these &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/new-form-of-quantum-entanglement-discovered-will-transform-next-gen-technology/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;quantum states&lt;/a&gt; are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measuring certain properties that push photons into detectable or undetectable modes can influence outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-measurement-changes-things"&gt;How measurement changes things&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any attempt to pinpoint a photon’s route through two slits runs into the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/impossibility-paradox-calculating-incalculable-quantum-realm-particles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;famous uncertainty principle&lt;/a&gt;. A quick look might destroy the fringe pattern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In these studies, measuring the photon is less about giving it a momentum kick and more about switching the dark state to a bright one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Decades of work in &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/new-quantum-states-found-in-crystal-layers-could-boost-computing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;quantum information&lt;/a&gt; science hinted that delicate systems can be “observed” without collapsing them entirely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new interpretation builds on that notion. If the observer couples to a photon hidden in a dark region, the state might become bright enough to be registered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-particle-based-light-interference"&gt;Particle-based light interference &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wave-particle duality is central in physics curricula around the world, teaching that &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/super-photons-fascinating-behavior-in-quantum-realm/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;light and matter&lt;/a&gt; can exhibit both wave-like and particle-like behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather than uprooting that duality, this theory nudges us to see interference in a purely particle-based explanation. It keeps the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/schrodingers-cat-put-into-silicon-chip-may-be-holy-grail-for-error-proof-quantum-computing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;quantum superposition&lt;/a&gt; principle at the core.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a philosophical level, some scientists suggest that we might shift our mental picture toward probabilities of bright and dark particles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, most institutions will continue to teach the wave framework as a useful approximation that works in many practical settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-are-dark-photons-important"&gt;Why are dark photons important?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The updated model might spark creative ways of detecting light in places once thought to be “voids.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Novel detectors could be devised to probe areas of destructive interference with &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/389928886_Atomic_and_Ionic_Systems" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;advanced atomic or ionic systems&lt;/a&gt;. These methods might eventually shape futuristic optical technologies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experimental physicists may also look for subtle traces of photons lurking in dark states. If those photons can be coaxed into bright states without disturbing other properties, entirely new measurement techniques might arise. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That prospect has captured attention because it challenges everyday views of how light interacts with sensors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-searching-for-light-s-true-nature"&gt;Searching for light’s true nature&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research prompts the question of what other fundamental assumptions may give way under quantum scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some researchers are already attempting to extend these quantum ideas about light to larger-scale experiments, including matter waves. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even aspects of gravitational wave detection might gain fresh insights from the concept of dark states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Critics point out that wave-based models still work splendidly at larger distances. This new quantum picture of light appears indispensable only when single particles and atoms come into play. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether it replaces or merely complements classical interpretations remains the next big debate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the journal &lt;a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.134.133603" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Physical Review Letters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Sat, 10 May 2025 16:24:06 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiuwFBVV95cUxPb0hNX2RyN3h6U0tKdDRlQ0RYRC0xa2dNb2lYeEdiOU1SMGhWNXlsOFFmY1daRHlrazU4aXBXZmNER01Zdnd5VUdFR1NweXgxNnkwSEJ4TS1OVVFqbFBqd3Vqc1Nuby1hQ29IMlR0Z3J4YnF2QmJrWU1BSmpXdjYxR183ZFBWakNJTjdwRU5tZEU5cVg1NjJDOFJhbEJJNE54MHMwWVVjUkUycTVyMS1QZ0xmNXBEb2VxcDJn</guid></item><item><title>研究发现，美国各州的预期寿命存在显著差异-新闻的光明面 | Study finds striking differences in life expectancy across U.S. states - The Brighter Side of News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirAFBVV95cUxOUTRVMW9VNWtOUkptLTduNXVKd0Nhc3JheHBULTVOcXByVDZlOHVYNXZTRG5FVzRxb0dqTm5pUDhyNzdQaWYwczB0SzdmUlBEaWVYQjlHT1VXOUZydEZHaGtKN0g3azJoRlJmZnN6Ymx2a2daWTVaQWVtMkVPalZTS0dwYmVZMGpCOFlybjhLTVBYN1pRNlppOTlBcGtnU1o3aF9XVnpaYUhjSU1p?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiBox-root css-a9h2n1" data-id="page-content" data-og-area="article-blocks"&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Life expectancy in the United States varies dramatically based on where someone lives. A groundbreaking study by researchers at the &lt;a href="https://ysph.yale.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Yale School of Public Health&lt;/a&gt; (YSPH) examined more than 179 million deaths from 1969 to 2020, revealing wide gaps in longevity among states and highlighting how local health policies shape lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For decades, Americans enjoyed steady gains in lifespan due to improved sanitation, tobacco control, medical care, and prevention of chronic diseases like heart disease and cancer. But these gains haven't been equal across the country. Some states have thrived, while others lagged behind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="geography_shapes_your_lifespan"&gt;Geography Shapes Your Lifespan&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, published in &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2833159" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;JAMA Network Open&lt;/a&gt;, used an innovative approach by tracking groups of people born around the same time—called birth cohorts—instead of looking at each year separately. This method paints a clearer picture of how different generations experience health over their lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Life Expectancy Study results for women.

Holford, the study's lead author and a professor at YSPH. "It shows the long-term impact of policies and social conditions affecting the life course."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="5" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;From 1900 to 2000, life expectancy improved significantly in the Northeast and West, especially in New York, California, and Washington, D.C. For instance, women in New York and California saw &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/health/scientists-discover-a-surprising-link-between-high-carb-diets-and-life-expectancy/"&gt;lifespan gains&lt;/a&gt; of over 20 years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="6" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In stark contrast, Southern states like Mississippi, Alabama, and Kentucky saw minimal increases, particularly among women—less than three years over the same century.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="7" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That's a staggering contrast," Holford noted. "Where you are born shouldn’t determine how long you live. But in America, it still does."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="why_policies_matter"&gt;Why Policies Matter&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="8" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found state policies significantly influenced these disparities. Progressive states often adopted measures early, such as tobacco control laws or broader access to healthcare, helping people live longer, healthier lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="9" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;California, for example, banned smoking in workplaces early in 1995. As a result, entire generations grew up without &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/helping-low-income-smokers-quit-the-power-of-a-small-incentive/"&gt;second-hand smoke&lt;/a&gt; exposure, and many adults quit smoking. This policy significantly improved life expectancy over decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="10" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Kentucky lagged in tobacco control, leading to higher smoking rates and increased mortality. Similar trends appeared in West Virginia, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Tennessee, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama, states that historically lacked aggressive health measures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Life Expectancy Study results for men.

"These trends in mortality and &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/life-expectancy-gains-are-slowing-despite-advances-in-healthcare/"&gt;life expectancy&lt;/a&gt; reflect not only each state’s policy environment but also their underlying demographics," Tam said. "It’s not surprising states with fewer improvements to life expectancy also have higher poverty rates."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="generational_health_differences"&gt;Generational Health Differences&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="12" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study's novel cohort approach also revealed how early life experiences shape health outcomes as people age. Early exposure to sanitation, &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/antibiotics-vaccinations-and-anti-inflammatory-drugs-found-to-lower-risk-of-dementia/"&gt;vaccinations&lt;/a&gt;, or tobacco control profoundly affects health later in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="13" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers measured how quickly death rates rise after age 35. Longer intervals between these increases indicate healthier aging. Again, regional differences were striking. New York and Florida showed healthier aging patterns, while Oklahoma and Iowa saw quicker mortality escalation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Period Life Expectancy at Birth for US Females by State and Calendar Year (1969, 1995, and 2020).

For example, raising the legal smoking age or improving childhood vaccinations has lasting health benefits throughout someone's lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="4" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="bridging_the_gap"&gt;Bridging the Gap&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="15" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today’s health disparities stem from decades of cumulative impacts—from &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/new-study-reveals-why-most-life-long-smokers-never-develop-lung-cancer/"&gt;tobacco use&lt;/a&gt; and healthcare access to environmental factors. Without proactive policy changes, these disparities might persist or even worsen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="16" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The disparities we see today are the result of decades of cumulative effects," Holford emphasized. "Without conscious policy changes, these gaps will likely persist or even widen."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="4" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Period Life Expectancy at Birth for US Males by State and Calendar Year (1969, 1995, and 2020).

Researchers hope these findings will motivate policy shifts to ensure healthier lives for &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/violence-changes-human-genes-for-generations-study-finds/"&gt;future generations&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="18" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This research highlights the importance of viewing health through a generational lens," Tam added.

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="23" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmah8fujc001h3b76mculryd7@published"&gt;My husband recently played a horrible prank on me. Several nights ago, we were in bed when he asked me to feel his testicles.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="52" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmah8x6fa002l3b76wb0jqvqx@published"&gt;He said he thought he felt a lump. A jolt of fear shot through me, and my heart immediately started racing, but I didn’t find anything. He kept encouraging me to continue. After 10 minutes, I told him I still wasn’t finding anything, and he replied, “Honey? Thanks a lot! That felt great!” and burst out laughing.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="58" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmah8ful5001i3b76y3f8jkgl@published"&gt;I was furious. The entire time, images of our two kids growing up without their dad were flashing through my mind because I thought he might have cancer! I spent the night in the guest room. The next morning, I told him he wasn’t getting laid for a month. My husband thinks I’m overreacting. Considering what he did, I think I’m being lenient. Thoughts?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="9" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmah8funk001j3b76pt7pps0w@published"&gt;—He Won’t Be Having a Ball for a While&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="123" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmah8fus4001l3b76ik15qxbq@published"&gt;I don’t blame you for reacting strongly. He scared you &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; made you feel on his balls for 10 minutes. That’s a lot of time to be down there, no matter how big they are. Spending the night in the guest room was a good way to underline your upset. Maybe an ensuing chilliness for a few days would work as well. No sex for a month does seem like a lot, but look, if you really don’t care and you think this is the best way to convey the message of, “Never do that again,” well, your body, your choice. But you might use the month to reflect: Why is it so easy for you to give up sex for a month?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="94" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmah8fuu2001m3b76hgen20oe@published"&gt;What I don’t like about using sex as a bargaining chip is that it assumes that your husband derives way more pleasure from it. Otherwise, depriving him would also mean depriving you, and why punish yourself? If that is, in fact, the state of things, well, I would pursue a more equitable arrangement. What are you not getting that you want? What could be done differently? Discussing this stuff could be useful, especially if you’re just taking for granted that your sex life is way more important to him than it is to you.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="90" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmah8d369000hehkxc561hof2@published"&gt;I’m a 30-year-old gay guy. After years of lots of really hot flings but no long-term relationships, I think my current boyfriend could be the one. He’s much more wholesome and innocent than the guys I’ve been with in the past, which I actually really like. Plus, the sex is great! We’ve been together for six months, and he recently took me on a trip to his home state to meet his family (parents and two siblings, plus some extended family). &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2022/06/boyfriends-brother-hookup-advice.html"&gt;Everything was going great until his brother showed up.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We found that this overuse is associated with a greater tendency to believe in and engage with misinformation,” said Dar Meshi, an associate professor and co-author of the study, which published today in the journal &lt;em&gt;PLOS One&lt;/em&gt; and was funded by MSU’s Trifecta Initiative. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meshi and his co-author, Maria D. Molina, both faculty members in the MSU College of Communication Arts and Sciences, conducted an online experiment in which 189 participants, age 18 to 26, were presented with 20 news stories formatted as social media posts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ten of the stories were real and ten were false, and the order of delivery was randomized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By assessing participants’ credibility judgment of these news posts; participants intentions to click, comment, like and share posts; and their degree of problematic social media use, Meshi and Molina found that the greater people’s symptoms of problematic social media use, the more likely they were to: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;believe fake news is true; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;interact with news posts regardless if they were real or fake; and &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;want to click on fake news posts. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fake or false news falls under two categories: misinformation if it is unintentionally distributed and disinformation if it is intentionally distributed to deceive people.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“False news has become a hotly debated and researched topic because of its availability to be shared and spread over social media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Over 60% of people in the U.S. read content on social media, and research has demonstrated that false news disseminates over social media at a greater rate than real news,” said Molina.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers believe their study is the first to look at how problematic social media use is involved with people’s trust in fake news by measuring their intended actions, like clicking, liking and sharing posts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the American Psychiatric Association doesn’t recognize problematic social media use as a clinical disorder, Meshi points out that it shares similarities with substance use and other behavioral addictive disorders. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People who display problematic social media use may feel bad if they can’t access it, and they might even return to it after trying to quit. This kind of behavior has been linked to job loss, poor grades and mental health issues,” Meshi said.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meshi and Molina hope their findings will help mental health professionals working with people who struggle with social media use, as well as others in the health care field. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Individuals with signs of problematic social media use may also be more susceptible to health-related misinformation, so clinicians specializing in different fields may benefit from awareness of their patients’ degree of social media use,” said Molina. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study’s findings could also help inform efforts from governmental agencies, organizations and social media companies to combat misinformation and disinformation.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By identifying people who are more likely to believe fake news, we can help reduce its spread,” Meshi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Researchers could work with social media companies to find ways to help these users and limit their exposure to fake news.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this misinformation and psychology research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#b2c6d7d9dbc2d3ded7f2dfc1c79cd7d6c7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Alex Tekip&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://msu.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Michigan State University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Alex Tekip – Michigan State University&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0321361" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Problematic social media use is associated with believing in and engaging with fake news&lt;/a&gt;” by Dar Meshi et al. &lt;em&gt;PLOS One&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Problematic social media use is associated with believing in and engaging with fake news&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Social media use is ubiquitous in our modern society, and some individuals display excessive, maladaptive use of these online platforms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This problematic social media use (PSMU) has been associated with greater impulsivity and risk-taking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, studies in healthy individuals have demonstrated that greater cognitive impulsivity is associated with a greater susceptibility to online “fake news.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Therefore, we hypothesized that PSMU would be associated with believing in and engaging with fake news.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To address this, we conducted an online, within-subject experiment in which participants (N=189; female=102, male=86, prefer not to disclose=1; mean age=19.8 years) completed a fake news task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This task presented participants with 20 news stories (10 real and 10 false, in random order) formatted as social media posts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We assessed participants’ credibility judgments of these news posts, as well as participants’ intentions to click, like, comment, and share these posts. We also assessed participants’ degree of PSMU and then related this measure to their performance in our task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We conducted a repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) with a mixed model approach, and it revealed that the greater one’s PSMU, the more one finds specifically false news credible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also found that the greater one’s PSMU, the greater one’s engagement with news posts, agnostic to the type of content (real or false).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, we found that the greater one’s PSMU, the greater one’s intent to click on specifically false news.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our research demonstrates that individuals who experience the most distress and impairment in daily functioning from social media use are also the most susceptible to false information posted on social media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We discuss the clinical implications of our findings.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Sat, 10 May 2025 15:37:49 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiekFVX3lxTE9VV1hKTHhiMWs3QTRUdkRsQXdSVktUQ3FscWVMaFNMYjVaeFhQUVpwbHQwams5dTgyTnRZWWY1NFg0UzFDSlBTUnFEWWR1djNvZy1Na3QycTZKbkZlMEFoMVdQbHd5SFE2VmtYY0VsNm52UkFzWEwyN0Zn</guid></item><item><title>科学家发现隐藏在普通视线中的阿尔茨海默氏症的隐藏原因- SciTechDaily | Scientists Discover Hidden Cause of Alzheimer’s Hiding in Plain Sight - SciTechDaily</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimgFBVV95cUxNZFJ1Y0pEYUxnLS15MTJBVXJfVFppMDBtM0RBaHMtcjVXU0tVSm9vamVveXR2SkFsVGl3RDRud3hLV01SWlhQaXdmc1czbWpCS1VCanZvWkRWUE1wQUVubmF2Q3M1czYyelBOeGxKTy1XQ1ZKOUFFNmhTT3Z4VlV2OER2Y3BHcmZTelJnNWZJU2lEZFpjR3JXbm93?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SciTechDaily</author><pubDate>Sat, 10 May 2025 15:12:50 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimgFBVV95cUxNZFJ1Y0pEYUxnLS15MTJBVXJfVFppMDBtM0RBaHMtcjVXU0tVSm9vamVveXR2SkFsVGl3RDRud3hLV01SWlhQaXdmc1czbWpCS1VCanZvWkRWUE1wQUVubmF2Q3M1czYyelBOeGxKTy1XQ1ZKOUFFNmhTT3Z4VlV2OER2Y3BHcmZTelJnNWZJU2lEZFpjR3JXbm93</guid></item><item><title>香槟真的能降低心脏骤停的风险吗？这就是《科学》。- ScienceAlert | Does Champagne Really Lower Risk of Sudden Cardiac Arrest?

			&lt;p&gt;"My only regret in life is that I didn't drink enough champagne," the English economist and philosopher John Maynard Keynes (1883–1946) is reported to have said. As it turns out, there may be a surprising ounce of truth to that quote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Picture this: a glass of champagne – bubbly, crisp and, for many, reserved for toasts and celebrations. Now imagine it being mentioned in the same sentence as a way to help prevent &lt;a href="https://www.bhf.org.uk/informationsupport/conditions/cardiac-arrest"&gt;sudden cardiac arrest&lt;/a&gt;: a condition where the heart abruptly stops beating, killing tens of thousands each year, often without warning. Sounds too good to be true, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, &lt;a href="https://onlinecjc.ca/article/S0828-282X(25)00171-0/fulltext"&gt;a Canadian study&lt;/a&gt; has uncovered a curious link. Using data from over half a million people in the health research database the &lt;a href="https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/"&gt;UK Biobank&lt;/a&gt;, researchers found that those who consumed moderate amounts of white wine or champagne had a lower risk of experiencing sudden cardiac arrest. Surprising, especially given the widely held belief &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/46/2/173/7920813?login=false#google_vignette"&gt;that red wine&lt;/a&gt;, not white, is what benefits the heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;p class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 youtube-iframe relative"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9JvI392Iep8?wmode=transparent&amp;amp;start=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;To rule out coincidence, the researchers double-checked their findings using genetic data – and the connection seemed to hold firm. This suggests there might be more to the story than chance alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study didn't stop at wine. It explored more than 100 lifestyle and environmental factors tied to sudden cardiac arrest, including diet, exercise, air pollution, emotional wellbeing, body composition and education levels – all of which have been independently associated with risk. The conclusion? Up to 63% of sudden cardiac arrest cases could potentially be prevented by addressing these risk factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among all the protective factors identified, a few stood out: fruit consumption, regular computer use (yes, really) and moderate drinking of white wine or champagne were all linked to a reduced risk of sudden cardiac arrest. Why? That remains uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One theory is that white wine contains antioxidants that may support heart health. Another possibility is that people who drink these types of beverages may also be more affluent and more likely to engage in other healthy behaviour, such as eating well, exercising regularly – and have access to better healthcare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But before you pop a cork in celebration, a word of caution: alcohol remains a complex and often contradictory player in heart health. Other large-scale studies suggest a &lt;a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/356/bmj.j909"&gt;U-shaped relationship&lt;/a&gt; between alcohol and cardiovascular disease. Non-drinkers may have a certain level of risk, moderate drinkers of one glass of wine a day &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7020057/"&gt;may see&lt;/a&gt; some benefit, but heavy drinking sharply increases the risk of high blood pressure, stroke and heart failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.hrthm.2021.10.022"&gt;One observational study&lt;/a&gt; involving over 400,000 participants even found that moderate drinking could raise the risk of &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/arrhythmia/"&gt;arrhythmias&lt;/a&gt;, which in some cases can lead to sudden death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So while champagne may offer a hopeful glimmer, it's no magic bullet. The study's broader message was clear: it's the overall lifestyle that matters most. Better sleep, regular physical activity and &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/why-heart-patients-have-trouble-sticking-to-a-healthy-diet-and-3-things-that-help-them-eat-better-239172"&gt;a balanced diet&lt;/a&gt; significantly reduced the risk of sudden cardiac arrest – and could prevent nearly one in five cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;p class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 youtube-iframe relative"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jdgYN1QgKng?wmode=transparent&amp;amp;start=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the flip side, obesity, high blood pressure and chronic stress were among the strongest risk factors, along with lower education levels and exposure to air pollution. These findings underscore that preventing sudden cardiac arrest isn't just about personal habits: it's also about the environments we live in and the policies that shape them. Cleaner air, better education and easier access to nutritious food could all play a role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sudden cardiac arrest is not entirely random. Many of the contributing factors are within our control. Managing stress, staying active, maintaining a healthy weight, getting quality sleep – and yes, perhaps enjoying the occasional glass of white wine – can all help. But the real power lies in stacking small, healthy choices over time. Prevention is rarely about a single change; it's about the cumulative effect of many.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in case you were wondering: Keynes suffered a series of heart attacks in 1946, beginning during negotiations for the &lt;a href="https://history.blog.gov.uk/2020/12/07/whats-the-context-signing-the-anglo-american-financial-agreement-6-december-1945/"&gt;Anglo-American loan&lt;/a&gt; in Savannah, Georgia. He described the process as "absolute hell". A few weeks after returning to his farmhouse in Firle, East Sussex, he died of a heart attack at the age of 62.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe he was right about drinking more champagne after all.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/255708/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

By tagging neurons with light-sensitive markers and recording their unique electrical signatures, researchers created a training library that allowed the AI to distinguish neuron types in both mice and monkeys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This breakthrough addresses a century-old challenge in neuroscience and opens the door to better understanding how different neurons contribute to behavior and disease. The tool could one day improve neural implants, help decode disorders like epilepsy, and refine how we study the brain in both animals and humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI Breakthrough:&lt;/strong&gt; A new algorithm distinguishes neuron types from electrical activity with high precision.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cross-Species Utility:&lt;/strong&gt; Validated in both mice and monkeys, with potential for human application.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Open Access:&lt;/strong&gt; The database and AI tool are freely available to the global research community.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;UCL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brains are made up of many different types of neurons (nerve cells in the brain), each of which are thought to play different roles in processing information. Scientists have long been able to use electrodes to record the activity of neurons by detecting the electrical ‘spikes’ that they generate while performing brain functions.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although recording spikes has proved invaluable for monitoring the activity of individual neurons deep in the brain, until now the method has been ‘blind’ to the type of neuron being recorded – making it impossible to identify how different neurons contribute to the brain’s overall operation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a new study, published in &lt;em&gt;Cell&lt;/em&gt;, the research team have overcome this problem by identifying the distinct ‘electrical signatures’ of different neuron types in the mouse brain, using brief pulses of blue light to trigger spikes in specific cell types (a method called optogenetics).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They created a library of the different electrical signatures for each type of neuron, which then allowed them to train an AI algorithm that can automatically recognise five different types of neurons with 95% accuracy without further need for genetic tools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The algorithm was also validated on brain recording data from monkeys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers say they have overcome a major hurdle in being able to use the technology to study neurological conditions such as epilepsy, but that there is still “a long way” to go before it can be used in practical applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Maxime Beau, co-first author of the study from the UCL Wolfson Institute for Biomedical Research, said: “For decades, neuroscientists have struggled with the fundamental problem of reliably identifying the many different types of neurons that are simultaneously active during behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our approach now enables us to identify neuron types with over 95% accuracy in mice and in monkeys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This advance will enable researchers to record brain circuits as they perform complex behaviours such as movement. Like logic gates on a computer chip, neurons in the brain are elementary computing units that come in several types.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our method provides a tool to identify many of the brain’s logic gates in action at the same time. Before, it could only be done one at a time, and at much greater cost.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors say the fact that the algorithm can be applied across different species gives it huge potential for being expanded to other animals and, eventually, to humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the short term, the new technique means that, instead of requiring complex genetic engineering to study the brain, researchers could use any normal animal to study what different neurons do and how they interact with one another to generate behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the ultimate aims is to be able to study neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders such as epilepsy, autism and dementia, many of which are thought to involve changes to the way different cell types in the brain interact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Beverley Clark a senior author of the study from UCL Wolfson Institute for Biomedical Research, said: “Just as many different instruments in an orchestra contribute to the sound of a symphony, the brain relies on many distinct neuron types to create the complex behaviour that humans and other animals exhibit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our work is analogous to learning the sound that each instrument makes and then teaching an algorithm to recognise the contribution of each of them to a symphony.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Being able to observe this ‘neural symphony’ of the brain in action has been a fundamental challenge in neuroscience for over 100 years, and we now have a method for reliably doing this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Although the technology is a long way from being able to be used to study neurological conditions such as epilepsy, we’ve now overcome a major hurdle to reaching that goal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, some recordings of living human brain activity have already been recorded in patients during surgery, and our technique could be used to study those recordings to better understand how our brains work, first in health and then in disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Improved understanding of how our brains work could pave the way for some ground-breaking advances in medical science, some of which are already on the horizon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Human brain-to-computer interfaces, or neural implants, are one such possibility. Ongoing research at the UCSF Weill Institute for Neurosciences, for example, has enabled a paralysed man to control a robotic arm using a neural implant for a record seven months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like the current study, this work was also informed by studying the electrical patterns in the brains of animals and using AI to automatically recognise these patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors say the new technique to differentiate neuron types could help to improve neural implants by more accurately recording which types of cells are involved in particular actions, so that the implant can more easily recognise specific signals and generate the appropriate response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Key to this technology is understanding how our brains work when they’re healthy, so that any damage can be compensated for. If a person had a stroke and part of their brain was damaged, for example, you would need to understand how that bit worked before you could consider designing an implant to replicate that functionality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Michael Häusser, a senior author of the study from UCL Division of Medicine and The University of Hong Kong, said: “This project came to life thanks to the convergence of three critical innovations: using molecular biology to successfully ‘tag’ different neuron types using light, developments in silicon probe recording technology, and of course the fast-paced improvements in deep learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Crucially, the synergy in our team was absolutely instrumental. The partner labs at UCL, Baylor, Duke and Bar Ilan University have all contributed critical pieces to the puzzle. Just like the brain, the whole is larger than the sum of its parts.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The database gathered by the team is freely available and the algorithm is open source, meaning scientists from across the world can use these resources for neurological research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;This research was funded by funding from Wellcome, National Institutes of Health (NIH), European Research Council (ERC), and the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this AI and neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Matt Midgley&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;UCL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Matt Midgley – UCL&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2025.01.041" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;A deep learning strategy to identify cell types across species from high-density extracellular recordings&lt;/a&gt;” by Beverley Clark et al. &lt;em&gt;Cell&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A deep learning strategy to identify cell types across species from high-density extracellular recordings&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;High-density probes allow electrophysiological recordings from many neurons simultaneously across entire brain circuits but fail to reveal cell type.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, we develop a strategy to identify cell types from extracellular recordings in awake animals and reveal the computational roles of neurons with distinct functional, molecular, and anatomical properties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We combine optogenetics and pharmacology using the cerebellum as a testbed to generate a curated ground-truth library of electrophysiological properties for Purkinje cells, molecular layer interneurons, Golgi cells, and mossy fibers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We train a semi-supervised deep learning classifier that predicts cell types with greater than 95% accuracy based on the waveform, discharge statistics, and layer of the recorded neuron.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The classifier’s predictions agree with expert classification on recordings using different probes, in different laboratories, from functionally distinct cerebellar regions, and across species.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our classifier extends the power of modern dynamical systems analyses by revealing the unique contributions of simultaneously recorded cell types during behavior.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Sat, 10 May 2025 14:59:06 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiX0FVX3lxTFBvM201Rm1iS0hQZk16cmtLNWNoMWtVSUtDRF9RQThwOTF6LUFMeVJzRF9YTmc2RkZ4QUU2RFZncU0zTVFzM25sMnRiSFFuSzZ5bThYVFVzLWQwdVIyWm1n</guid></item><item><title>Your Brain Maps Actions Like It Maps Space -神经科学新闻 | Your Brain Maps Actions Like It Maps Space - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibEFVX3lxTE9KcG5MTkZHblJWWUlhNWRQRkdJTzktZElCNlUzNEFQRjlkNXFGU2YtV1BiYk9seXlLd3dmM1lPM2hCVUFwTzdxVG5wZGgta28xbUhKZENZUG50bDY3RWxNS0ViV2o4NFdTUE1iNQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;A new study shows that the human brain organizes action-outcome associations in cognitive maps, much like how it maps physical space for navigation. These action maps are formed in the hippocampus and communicate with the motor system to support goal-directed behaviors and flexible decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using virtual reality tasks and fMRI, researchers observed that the brain represents similar actions closer together in this map-like structure, influencing how we perceive and choose between them. This challenges traditional views of memory systems, revealing that action planning is guided by interconnected neural networks that link memory, perception, and motor control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cognitive Action Maps:&lt;/strong&gt; The brain organizes actions and their outcomes using hippocampal maps.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Motor Integration:&lt;/strong&gt; These maps interact with the motor system to guide behavior and decision-making.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beyond Space:&lt;/strong&gt; The study expands the role of cognitive maps from spatial navigation to action planning.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Max Planck Institute&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How are the relations between different action plans organized and structured in the brain to support our rich behavioural repertoire? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Irina Barnaveli and Christian Doeller together with Simone Viganò and Daniel Reznik from the Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences and with Patrick Haggard from the Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, University College London, argue in their recent study that the brain organizes action-outcome associations in a cognitive map-like structure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109752"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-action-space-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-action-space-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-action-space-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-action-space-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-action-space-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-action-space-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-action-space-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-action-space-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-action-space-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-action-space-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-action-space-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-action-space-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-action-space-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-action-space-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-action-space-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Crucially, this cognitive map in the hippocampal system exchanges information with the motor system to relate multiple action plans to each other. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers further demonstrate in their study, published in &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;, that these cognitive maps, located in the hippocampal system, communicate with the motor system during action evaluation, suggesting that goal-directed action planning skills rely on multiple neural systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The human capacity to develop a diverse and highly complex repertoire of action plans is truly remarkable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of our behaviours are rooted in associations between actions and their outcomes, which we form and leverage flexibly. For instance, the same keypress action can lead to different outcomes depending on whether it’s performed on a computer keyboard, a radio, or another context.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We often have multiple alternative choices, so that action selection requires comparing across available action-outcomes, which is a non-trivial and taxing problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“How do we compare the many action plans stored in memory and select the most appropriate one?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We propose that these action-outcome associations could be organized in a cognitive map within the hippocampal system, potentially supporting efficient action selection within the rich human behavioural repertoire” explains Irina Barnaveli, first author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The hippocampus is a part of the brain involved in forming memories and navigating in space. Navigation relies heavily on the creation of maps of space. Our study suggests that we create similar maps for organizing and selecting action plans, linking perception to action.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the immersive virtual reality, participants performed a motor interaction task, in which they learned how to control the flying and catching of a virtual ball using different actions. Later, they compared learned actions while their brain activity was monitored using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientists found patterns of brain activity that are typically interpreted as signatures of ‘cognitive mapping’, suggesting that the brain abstracts and organizes action plans in a map-like representation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This map is also evident from participants’ behaviour: the closer the actions are within the hypothesised map, the more similar they are perceived by the participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crucially, this cognitive map in the hippocampal system exchanges information with the motor system to relate multiple action plans to each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The map-like representations might therefore represent how humans interact with their environment in a very general sense, well beyond the specific case of spatial navigation. By supporting action selection, cognitive maps could contribute to optimizing the acquisition and exploitation of a wide repertoire of action plans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This discovery further challenges the classical distinction between declarative and procedural memory, suggesting that goal-directed actions rely on multiple neural systems that integrate action generation, motor planning, and memory”, concludes Christian Doeller, last author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbs.mpg.de/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Bettina Hennebach&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbs.mpg.de/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Max Planck Institute&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Bettina Hennebach – Max Planck Institute&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-59153-y" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Hippocampal-entorhinal cognitive maps and cortical motor system represent action plans and their outcomes&lt;/a&gt;” by Irina Barnaveli et al. &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hippocampal-entorhinal cognitive maps and cortical motor system represent action plans and their outcomes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Efficiently interacting with the environment requires weighing and selecting among multiple alternative actions based on their associated outcomes. However, the neural mechanisms underlying these processes are still debated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We show that forming relations between arbitrary action-outcome associations involve building a cognitive map.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using an immersive virtual reality paradigm, participants learned 2D abstract motor action-outcome associations and later compared action combinations while their brain activity was monitored with fMRI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We observe a hexadirectional modulation of the activity in entorhinal cortex while participants compared different action plans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, hippocampal activity scales with the 2D similarity between outcomes of these action plans. Conversely, the supplementary motor area represents individual actions, showing a stronger response to overlapping action plans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crucially, the connectivity between hippocampus and supplementary motor area is modulated by the similarity between the action plans, suggesting their complementary roles in action evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings provide evidence for the role of cognitive maps in action selection, challenging classical models of memory taxonomy and its neural bases.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Sat, 10 May 2025 14:46:40 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibEFVX3lxTE9KcG5MTkZHblJWWUlhNWRQRkdJTzktZElCNlUzNEFQRjlkNXFGU2YtV1BiYk9seXlLd3dmM1lPM2hCVUFwTzdxVG5wZGgta28xbUhKZENZUG50bDY3RWxNS0ViV2o4NFdTUE1iNQ</guid></item><item><title>印度饮食指南：您只需1餐即可获得清晰的思维。以下是吃什么-印度斯坦时报（ Hindustan Times ） | Indian diet guide: You are just 1 meal away from mental clarity.

Berries, especially blueberries and blackberries, are bursting with anthocyanins, which have been linked to improved neural signaling.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="mt10 mb10 htEchoArticlePromo"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="predictorShow mb20" data-vars-predictor="true" data-vars-quiz="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="quizShow mb20" data-vars-minimized="false" data-vars-predictor="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="inlineIMG verticalImageClass"&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;img data-src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2023/06/12/900x1600/louis-hansel-MlPD-AzZYMg-unsplash_1686576030506_1686576037808.jpg" class="lazy" src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/550x309.jpg" alt="Eating foods like dark leafy greens or yellow and orange vegetables, which contain high levels of the plant compounds lutein and zeaxanthin, improves eye and brain health.(Unsplash)" title="Eating foods like dark leafy greens or yellow and orange vegetables, which contain high levels of the plant compounds lutein and zeaxanthin, improves eye and brain health.(Unsplash)"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;Eating foods like dark leafy greens or yellow and orange vegetables, which contain high levels of the plant compounds lutein and zeaxanthin, improves eye and brain health.(Unsplash)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Indian brain diet: Delicious, desi and doctor-approved&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're in India and looking for local alternatives, Charu Dua suggested, “Try amla (Indian gooseberry), jamun (Indian blackberry), and karonda (cranberry). These indigenous berries are rich in antioxidants and provide similar cognitive benefits. Amla, for example, is renowned for its high vitamin C content, which supports brain health, while jamun offers anthocyanins and has been traditionally used for managing blood sugar levels, further enhancing mental clarity.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;figure class="inlineIMG"&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;img data-src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/rf/image_size_630x354/HT/p2/2018/08/26/Pictures/_03b9ddba-a912-11e8-8937-8a80aaa2408c.jpg" class="lazy" src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/550x309.jpg" alt="Eat right to keep your brain from ageing and to prevent dementia and Alzheimer’s Disease.(Shutterstock)" title="Eat right to keep your brain from ageing and to prevent dementia and Alzheimer’s Disease.(Shutterstock)"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;Eat right to keep your brain from ageing and to prevent dementia and Alzheimer’s Disease.(Shutterstock)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the diet expert, turmeric, with its active compound curcumin, offers potent anti-inflammatory effects and has shown promise in reducing the risk of neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s. Charu Dua recommended, “Don’t overlook herbs either—sage and rosemary not only flavour your food but are also known to enhance concentration and alertness. Even small additions like walnuts, flaxseeds and pumpkin seeds deliver omega-3s and vitamin E, essential for brain health.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The idea is simple: think fresh, eat colourfully and your mind will thank you. Incorporating these plants into daily meals is a sustainable and delicious way to protect and sharpen your mental faculties as you age.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This article is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.

In a study involving over 6,000 patients, those with cancer had FaceAges about five years older than their chronological age, and higher FaceAges were linked to poorer survival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tool outperformed clinicians in predicting short-term life expectancy for patients receiving palliative radiotherapy, especially when integrated into their decision-making. These findings suggest that facial features could serve as powerful, non-invasive biomarkers for aging and disease, opening new doors in precision medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FaceAge AI:&lt;/strong&gt; Predicts biological age and survival using facial photos.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cancer Insight:&lt;/strong&gt; Patients with cancer appeared ~5 years older than their actual age.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clinical Boost:&lt;/strong&gt; FaceAge improved doctors’ predictions of life expectancy in palliative care.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Mass General&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eyes may be the window to the soul, but a person’s biological age could be reflected in their facial characteristics. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investigators from Mass General Brigham developed a deep learning algorithm called FaceAge that uses a photo of a person’s face to predict biological age and survival outcomes for patients with cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found that patients with cancer, on average, had a higher FaceAge than those without and appeared about five years older than their chronological age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109748"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/AI-face-aging-cancer-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/AI-face-aging-cancer-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/AI-face-aging-cancer-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/AI-face-aging-cancer-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/AI-face-aging-cancer-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/AI-face-aging-cancer-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/AI-face-aging-cancer-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/AI-face-aging-cancer-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a woman's face with a digital overlay." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/AI-face-aging-cancer-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/AI-face-aging-cancer-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/AI-face-aging-cancer-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/AI-face-aging-cancer-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/AI-face-aging-cancer-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/AI-face-aging-cancer-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/AI-face-aging-cancer-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Results showed that cancer patients appear significantly older than those without cancer, and their FaceAge, on average, was about five years older than their chronological age. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Older FaceAge predictions were associated with worse overall survival outcomes across multiple cancer types. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also found that FaceAge outperformed clinicians in predicting short-term life expectancies of patients receiving palliative radiotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their results are published in &lt;em&gt;The Lancet Digital Health&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We can use artificial intelligence (AI) to estimate a person’s biological age from face pictures, and our study shows that information can be clinically meaningful,” said co-senior and corresponding author Hugo Aerts, PhD, director of the Artificial Intelligence in Medicine (AIM) program at Mass General Brigham.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This work demonstrates that a photo like a simple selfie contains important information that could help to inform clinical decision-making and care plans for patients and clinicians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“How old someone looks compared to their chronological age really matters—individuals with FaceAges that are younger than their chronological ages do significantly better after cancer therapy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When patients walk into exam rooms, their appearance may give physicians clues about their overall health and vitality. Those intuitive assessments combined with a patient’s chronological age, in addition to many other biological measures, may help determine the best course of treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, like anyone, physicians may have biases about a person’s age that may influence them, fueling a need for more objective, predictive measures to inform care decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With that goal in mind, Mass General Brigham investigators leveraged deep learning and facial recognition technologies to train FaceAge. The tool was trained on 58,851 photos of presumed healthy individuals from public datasets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team tested the algorithm in a cohort of 6,196 cancer patients from two centers, using photographs routinely taken at the start of radiotherapy treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results showed that cancer patients appear significantly older than those without cancer, and their FaceAge, on average, was about five years older than their chronological age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the cancer patient cohort, older FaceAge was associated with worse survival outcomes, especially in individuals who appeared older than 85, even after adjusting for chronological age, sex, and cancer type.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Estimated survival time at the end of life is difficult to pin down but has important treatment implications in cancer care. The team asked 10 clinicians and researchers to predict short-term life expectancy from 100 photos of patients receiving palliative radiotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While there was a wide range in their performance, overall, the clinicians’ predictions were only slightly better than a coin flip, even after they were given clinical context, such as the patient’s chronological age and cancer status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet when clinicians were also provided with the patient’s FaceAge information, their predictions improved significantly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further research is needed before this technology could be considered for use in a real-world clinical setting. The research team is testing this technology to predict diseases, general health status, and lifespan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Follow-up studies include expanding this work across different hospitals, looking at patients in different stages of cancer, tracking FaceAge estimates over time, and testing its accuracy against plastic surgery and makeup data sets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This opens the door to a whole new realm of biomarker discovery from photographs, and its potential goes far beyond cancer care or predicting age,” said co-senior author Ray Mak, MD, a faculty member in the AIM program at Mass General Brigham.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As we increasingly think of different chronic diseases as diseases of aging, it becomes even more important to be able to accurately predict an individual’s aging trajectory. I hope we can ultimately use this technology as an early detection system in a variety of applications, within a strong regulatory and ethical framework, to help save lives.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Authorship:&lt;/strong&gt; Additional Mass General Brigham authors include Dennis Bontempi, Osbert Zalay, Danielle S.

In medicine, however, appearance is incorporated into medical judgements in a subjective and non-standardised way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this study, we aimed to develop and validate FaceAge, a deep learning system to estimate biological age from easily obtainable and low-cost face photographs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;FaceAge was trained on data from 58 851 presumed healthy individuals aged 60 years or older: 56 304 individuals from the IMDb–Wiki dataset (training) and 2547 from the UTKFace dataset (initial validation).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinical utility was evaluated on data from 6196 patients with cancer diagnoses from two institutions in the Netherlands and the USA: the MAASTRO, Harvard Thoracic, and Harvard Palliative cohorts FaceAge estimates in these cancer cohorts were compared with a non-cancerous reference cohort of 535 individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To assess the prognostic relevance of FaceAge, we performed Kaplan–Meier survival analysis and Cox modelling, adjusting for several clinical covariates. We also assessed the performance of FaceAge in patients with metastatic cancer receiving palliative treatment at the end of life by incorporating FaceAge into clinical prediction models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To evaluate whether FaceAge has the potential to be a biomarker for molecular ageing, we performed a gene-based analysis to assess its association with senescence genes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Findings&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;FaceAge showed significant independent prognostic performance in various cancer types and stages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking older was correlated with worse overall survival (after adjusting for covariates per-decade hazard ratio [HR] 1·151, p=0·013 in a pan-cancer cohort of n=4906; 1·148, p=0·011 in a thoracic cohort of n=573; and 1·117, p=0·021 in a palliative cohort of n=717).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We found that, on average, patients with cancer looked older than their chronological age (mean increase of 4·79 years with respect to non-cancerous reference cohort, p&amp;lt;0·0001).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We found that FaceAge can improve physicians’ survival predictions in patients with incurable cancer receiving palliative treatments (from area under the curve 0·74 [95% CI 0·70–0·78] to 0·8 [0·76–0·83]; p&amp;lt;0·0001), highlighting the clinical use of the algorithm to support end-of-life decision making.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FaceAge was also significantly associated with molecular mechanisms of senescence through gene analysis, whereas age was not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our results suggest that a deep learning model can estimate biological age from face photographs and thereby enhance survival prediction in patients with cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further research, including validation in larger cohorts, is needed to verify these findings in patients with cancer and to establish whether the findings extend to patients with other diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Subject to further testing and validation, approaches such as FaceAge could be used to translate a patient’s visual appearance into objective, quantitative, and clinically valuable measures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Funding&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;US National Institutes of Health and EU European Research Council.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Sat, 10 May 2025 14:24:38 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiZ0FVX3lxTE9pOWZURk1SYWNtcmxQVER2OHlPLTU4b01OdVp1azJKSGg4aDNHb2JZbzIzS2otejF6dGpHdVVDT0w1b3prcEx0NUZ2SVoxVFpNazdQTkZyQ1dZcGh4aXN3bmlSVmF4bVk</guid></item><item><title>秋葵和葫芦巴提取物在德克萨斯州新研究中安全去除水中的微塑料-好消息网络 | Okra and Fenugreek Extracts Safely Remove Microplastics From Water in New Texas Research - Good News Network</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMivgFBVV95cUxPdjBoR0NKNkNqZE1jeUg0a2w3YmFHZHU4b3U5cnFJSElqRXl2cng2Ym5DTkFvX3cwZThfaXBlcHdtdjlsMm9yQTk5MngyN3pfcHNMZWJjbnNZQVU0MGdmSTZxRjJ0QS1id1BaR0lmQ0lvbU9IakJ5ZC0tZHVQdEk1bHVrOE1ENDRXVF8xVUYxVkZmMkVuTm54bHFIZU81MnlOQkk2U1VWaTUzZ1FEamxFb3NwUUJZTTNGcndzYmdR?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="td-post-content"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The substances behind the slimy strings from okra and the gel from fenugreek seeds could trap microplastics better than a commonly used synthetic polymer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Texas researchers &lt;a href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/texas-researchers-use-ocra-to-remove-microplastics-from-wastewater/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;proposed in 2022&lt;/a&gt; using these sticky natural polymers to clean up water. Now, they’ve found that okra and/or fenugreek extracts attracted and removed up to 90% of microplastics from ocean water, freshwater, and groundwater.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With funding from the U.S. Department of Energy, Rajani Srinivasan and colleagues at Tarleton State University found that the plant-based polymers from okra, fenugreek, and tamarind stick to microplastics, clumping together and sinking for easy separation from water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this next stage of the research, they have optimized the process for okra and fenugreek extracts and tested results in a variety of types of water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To extract the sticky plant polymers, the team soaked sliced okra pods and blended fenugreek seeds in separate containers of water overnight. Then, researchers removed the dissolved extracts from each solution and dried them into powders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pgs-dpg-flex" data-pgs-partner-id="good-news-network"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analyses &lt;a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsomega.4c07476" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;published in&lt;/a&gt; the American Chemical Society journal showed that the powdered extracts contained polysaccharides, which are natural polymers. Initial tests in pure water spiked with microplastics showed that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One gram of either powder in a quart (one liter) of water trapped microplastics the most effectively.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dried okra and fenugreek extracts removed 67% and 93%, respectively, of the plastic in an hour.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A mixture of equal parts okra and fenugreek powder reached maximum removal efficiency (70%) within 30 minutes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The natural polymers performed significantly better than the synthetic, commercially available polyacrylamide polymer used in wastewater treatment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DID YOU KNOW:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a title="There’s a Surprisingly Easy Way to Remove Microplastics From Drinking Water: Boil it" href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/theres-a-surprisingly-easy-way-to-remove-microplastics-from-drinking-water-boil-it/" rel="bookmark"&gt;There’s a Surprisingly Easy Way to Remove Microplastics From Drinking Water: Boil it&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the researchers tested the plant extracts on real microplastic-polluted water. They collected samples from waterbodies around Texas and brought them to the lab. The plant extract removal efficiency changed depending on the original water source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okra worked best in ocean water (80%), fenugreek in groundwater (80-90%), and the 1:1 combination of okra and fenugreek in freshwater (77%).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers hypothesize that the natural polymers had different efficiencies because each water sample had different types, sizes and shapes of microplastics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polyacrylamide, which is currently used to remove contaminants during wastewater treatment, has low toxicity, but its precursor acrylamide is &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyacrylamide#Environmental_effects" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;considered toxic&lt;/a&gt;. Okra and fenugreek extracts could serve as biodegradable and nontoxic alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Utilizing these plant-based extracts in water treatment will remove microplastics and other pollutants without introducing additional toxic substances to the treated water,” said Srinivasan &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1082887" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;in a media release&lt;/a&gt;, “thus reducing long-term health risks to the population.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CHECK OUT&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a title="Plant-Based Filter Removes Up to 99.9% of Microplastics from Water" href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/plant-based-filter-removes-up-to-99-9-of-microplastics-from-water/" rel="bookmark"&gt;Plant-Based Sawdust Filter Removes Up to 99.9% of Microplastics from Water&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She had previously studied the use of food-grade plant extracts as non-toxic flocculants to remove textile-based pollutants from wastewater and thought, ‘Why not try microplastics?’&lt;/p&gt;
