Researchers found that the drug improves function in reward-related brain regions like the ventral tegmental area (VTA), which is key to motivation and pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ezogabine also reduced abnormal connectivity between reward centers and regions associated with negative thoughts, such as the posterior cingulate cortex. These findings suggest that potassium channel openers could offer a new, biology-based treatment strategy for depression and anhedonia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Mechanism:&lt;/strong&gt; Ezogabine targets KCNQ potassium channels to modulate brain activity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reward Circuitry:&lt;/strong&gt; It normalizes overactive dopamine-related brain areas in depressed patients.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cognitive Shift:&lt;/strong&gt; Reduces connectivity between reward and negative emotion networks, easing symptoms.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Mount Sinai Hospital&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A mechanism involving potassium channels in the brain that control brain cell activity could provide a new and fundamentally different way of treating depression symptoms in adults with major depressive disorder, according to two complementary papers published recently by researchers at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In two new research articles, published in &lt;em&gt;Biological Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Molecular Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;, the researchers provide new insights into how a drug called ezogabine may impact the brain to improve depression. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Depression is a devastating public health problem, and our understanding of what changes in the brain to cause the illness is still very limited,” says James Murrough, MD, PhD, Director of the Depression and Anxiety Center for Discovery and Treatment at Mount Sinai and senior author of both studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-110261"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/mdd-ion-channel-pharmacology-neurosicence.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/mdd-ion-channel-pharmacology-neurosicence-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/mdd-ion-channel-pharmacology-neurosicence-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/mdd-ion-channel-pharmacology-neurosicence-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/mdd-ion-channel-pharmacology-neurosicence-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/mdd-ion-channel-pharmacology-neurosicence-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/mdd-ion-channel-pharmacology-neurosicence-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/mdd-ion-channel-pharmacology-neurosicence.jpg" alt="This shows a head and a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/mdd-ion-channel-pharmacology-neurosicence.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/mdd-ion-channel-pharmacology-neurosicence-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/mdd-ion-channel-pharmacology-neurosicence-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/mdd-ion-channel-pharmacology-neurosicence-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/mdd-ion-channel-pharmacology-neurosicence-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/mdd-ion-channel-pharmacology-neurosicence-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/mdd-ion-channel-pharmacology-neurosicence-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The results, based on functional magnetic resonance imaging, showed an important role for KCNQ channel openers like ezogabine in normalizing hyperactivity of the VTA in people with both depression and anhedonia. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our work represents a major step in unraveling the potential role of a specific protein complex in the brain—the KCNQ channel—and how targeting it could eventually offer a significant new modality for treating depression.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ezogabine was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2011 as an anticonvulsant medication for partial-onset seizures in adults with epilepsy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous neuroscience research in mice, conducted by researchers at The Friedman Brain Institute at Mount Sinai, suggested that increasing KCNQ channel activity could also represent a new approach to treating depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Building on these findings, Dr. Murrough’s research team became the first to test the hypothesis in humans with depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That study, published in the &lt;em&gt;American Journal of Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt; in 2021, revealed ezogabine was associated with significant improvements in depression symptoms and the ability to experience pleasure (anhedonia) in patients who were treated with the drug compared to patients who received placebo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two new papers provide details from new analyses of the human brain imaging data collected from that initial clinical trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first of the two papers, published in &lt;em&gt;Molecular Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;, sheds light on the effects of ezogabine on a specific brain pathway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study examined the impact of ezogabine on the ventral tegmental area (VTA) of the brain, which is involved in the release of dopamine, a neurotransmitter essential for motivation, pleasure, and reinforcement of behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results, based on functional magnetic resonance imaging, showed an important role for KCNQ channel openers like ezogabine in normalizing hyperactivity of the VTA in people with both depression and anhedonia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Up to half of people with depression do not respond to first-line treatment, which may be due to the lack of interventions that directly affect the neurobiology underlying symptoms like anhedonia,” says Laurel S. Morris, PhD, Adjunct Professor of Psychiatry at the Icahn School of Medicine and first author of the paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By specifically targeting VTA activity and connectivity, ezogabine could open the door to decidedly improved outcomes for people who struggle daily with depression and anhedonia.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a second paper, published in &lt;em&gt;Biological Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;, research revealed that ezogabine was able to normalize connectivity between the brain’s key reward regions and larger-scale brain networks including the posterior cingulate cortex, which plays a key role in internally directed thought and negative emotions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patients who experienced greater improvement in their depression and anhedonia when treated with ezogabine showed decreased connectivity between brain reward regions and the cingulate cortex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, these two complementary studies suggest that KCNQ channel openers can potentially alleviate the specific known neurobiological changes that occur in animal models of depression as well as change the function of larger brain networks that might be uniquely used in humans to regulate thought processes such as rumination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These findings suggested to us that drugs targeting the KCNQ channel may trigger antidepressant effects by reducing interactions between the reward centers in the brain and those related to negative thinking and emotion,” Dr. Murrough explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This hypothesis will require confirmation in larger clinical trials.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Murrough is a named inventor on a pending patent application for the use of ezogabine and other KCNQ channel openers to treat depression and related disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this psychopharmacology and depression research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#84e1e8edfee5e6e1f0ecaae0ebf3e8edeae3c4e9ebf1eaf0f7edeae5edaaebf6e3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Elizabeth Dowling&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://mountsinai.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Mount Sinai Hospital&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Elizabeth Dowling – Mount Sinai Hospital&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41380-025-02957-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Effects of KCNQ potassium channel modulation on ventral tegmental area activity and connectivity in individuals with depression and anhedonia&lt;/a&gt;” by James Murrough et al. &lt;em&gt;Molecular Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biopsych.2025.02.897" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Effects of the KCNQ (Kv7) Channel Opener Ezogabine on Resting-State Functional Connectivity of Striatal Brain Reward Regions, Depression, and Anhedonia in Major Depressive Disorder: Results From a Randomized Controlled Trial&lt;/a&gt;” by James Murrough et al. &lt;em&gt;Biological Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Effects of KCNQ potassium channel modulation on ventral tegmental area activity and connectivity in individuals with depression and anhedonia&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Up to half of individuals with depression do not respond to first-line treatments, possibly due to a lack of treatment interventions informed by neurobiology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A novel therapeutic approach for depression has recently emerged from translational work targeting aberrant activity of ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine neurons via modulation of the KCNQ voltage-gated potassium channels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this study, individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD) with elevated anhedonia were randomized to five weeks of the KCNQ channel opener, ezogabine (up to 900 mg/day) or placebo. Participants completed functional MRI during a monetary anticipation task and resting-state at baseline and at end-of-treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The clinical results were reported previously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, we examined VTA activity during monetary anticipation and resting-state functional connectivity between the VTA and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (mesocortical pathway) and ventral striatum (mesolimbic pathway) at baseline and end-of-treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results indicated a significant drug-by-time interaction in VTA activation during anticipation (F&lt;sub&gt;(1,34)&lt;/sub&gt; = 4.36, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.044), where VTA activation was reduced from pre-to-post ezogabine, compared to placebo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mesocortical functional connectivity was also higher in depressed participants at baseline compared to a healthy control group (t&lt;sub&gt;(56)&lt;/sub&gt; = 2.68, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.01) and associated with VTA hyper-activity during task-based functional MRI at baseline (R = 0.352, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.033). Mesocortical connectivity was also reduced from pre-to-post ezogabine, compared to placebo (significant drug-by-time interaction, F&lt;sub&gt;(1,33)&lt;/sub&gt; = 4.317, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.046).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together this translational work is consistent with preclinical findings highlighting VTA hyper-activity in depression, and suggesting a mechanism of action for KCNQ channel openers in normalizing this hyper-activity in individuals with both depression and anhedonia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Effects of the KCNQ (Kv7) Channel Opener Ezogabine on Resting-State Functional Connectivity of Striatal Brain Reward Regions, Depression, and Anhedonia in Major Depressive Disorder: Results From a Randomized Controlled Trial&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a leading cause of disability worldwide, with available treatments often showing limited efficacy. Recent research suggests that targeting specific subtypes of depression and understanding the underlying brain mechanisms can improve treatment outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study investigates the potential of the potassium KCNQ (Kv7) channel opener ezogabine to modulate the resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) of the brain’s reward circuitry and alleviate depressive symptoms, including anhedonia, a core feature of MDD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial in individuals with MDD ages 18 to 65 years compared daily dosing with ezogabine (&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;=&lt;/em&gt; 19) with placebo (&lt;em&gt;n =&lt;/em&gt; 21) for 5 weeks. Functional magnetic resonance imaging assessed RSFC of the brain’s key reward regions (ventral caudate, nucleus accumbens) at baseline and posttreatment. Clinical symptoms were measured using the Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale (SHAPS), Montgomery–Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), and other clinical symptom scales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ezogabine significantly reduced RSFC between the reward seeds and the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC)/precuneus compared with placebo, which was associated with a reduction in depression severity. Improvements in anhedonia (SHAPS) and depressive symptoms (MADRS) with ezogabine compared with placebo were also associated with decreased connectivity between the reward seeds and mid/posterior cingulate regions (midcingulate cortex, PCC, precuneus).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings suggest that ezogabine’s antidepressant effects are mediated through modulation of striatal–mid/posterior cingulate connectivity, indicating a potential therapeutic mechanism for KCNQ-targeted drugs for MDD and anhedonia. Future studies should validate these results in larger trials.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 May 2025 12:57:27 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMif0FVX3lxTE1fYmc2Nzc2UkRTYXpjLTdYN25rSDRBcGdBYklIYlpPWFM4VEdqbDVPejdDWHVRbkhsR2FkU19xMG5aMlZtYVdsUnI1RzVxU2dRRjB2Mng1UVhsbnJPZjcydXhDV0k1YWdHMWYzX0FaZENHX2VZdWRoNHR3OTdvVkk</guid></item><item><title>CRISPR在需要的地方提供RNA修复神经元-神经科学新闻 | CRISPR Delivers RNA to Repair Neurons Right Where It’s Needed - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibEFVX3lxTE5tem8xaGEya05vQjdEQTRGWFhtS0VRV09lQm9kdWZjUzBkQVUyZlNJamVLZnBiSmhQeklDWmoxbXNPZjUtRXRfWW8waXFwTHhNdUdYM2JtMWdYWVIzLTk1bUVjeko0aVBkZjY3cw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;Researchers have developed a new CRISPR-based technology that transports RNA to exact locations within neurons, where it can trigger repair and regrowth, offering hope for treating neurological diseases and injuries. Unlike traditional CRISPR tools that edit DNA, this system repurposes CRISPR-Cas13 to act like a “mailman,” carrying RNA to damaged sites using built-in molecular zip codes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In lab tests, the technique, called CRISPR-TO, boosted neurite growth by up to 50% in just 24 hours, marking a major step forward in spatial RNA medicine. This breakthrough may enable safer, more effective RNA-based treatments for conditions like ALS, spinal cord injuries, and neurodegenerative disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CRISPR-TO System:&lt;/strong&gt; Cas13 delivers RNA to precise neural sites using molecular zip codes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enhanced Regrowth:&lt;/strong&gt; Promoted 50% greater neurite growth in injured neurons.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Class of Medicine:&lt;/strong&gt; Introduces “spatial RNA medicine” for targeted cellular repair.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Stanford&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When a neuron in our body gets damaged, segments of RNA produce proteins that can help repair the injury. But in neurological disorders such as ALS and spinal muscular atrophy, or following spinal cord injuries, the mechanisms for moving life-essential RNA to injured sites within the cell fail. As a result, RNA molecules can’t get to where they are needed and damage becomes permanent.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers at Stanford have developed a technology for transporting RNA to specific locations within a neuron, where it can repair and even regrow parts of the cell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-110257"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/CRISPR-neural-repair-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/CRISPR-neural-repair-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/CRISPR-neural-repair-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/CRISPR-neural-repair-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/CRISPR-neural-repair-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/CRISPR-neural-repair-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/CRISPR-neural-repair-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/CRISPR-neural-repair-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a neuron." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/CRISPR-neural-repair-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/CRISPR-neural-repair-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/CRISPR-neural-repair-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/CRISPR-neural-repair-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/CRISPR-neural-repair-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/CRISPR-neural-repair-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/CRISPR-neural-repair-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Typically, CRISPR is used to slice and edit genetic code, but in this case the researchers didn’t want to make any changes. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their work, supported by the National Institutes of Health, forms the foundation for a new class of therapeutics that the researchers are calling “spatial RNA medicine,” which they hope will lead to treatments for neurological diseases as well as traumatic injuries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For the first time, we’ve harnessed the power of CRISPR technology to create a precise spatial ‘zip code’ that delivers RNA molecules exactly where they’re needed within cells,” said Stanley Qi, an associate professor of bioengineering and senior author on the paper published May 21 in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Imagine being able to specifically target damaged sites within a neuron, repairing them, and promoting their regrowth – this is what our technology achieves.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A CRISPR-based mailman&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent years, researchers have realized that the distribution of RNA within a cell – where specific molecules are located – may be just as important as what they are capable of doing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An individual neuron can be over a meter long, and aging, injury, and mutations can all disrupt its ability to transport the tiny RNA over such a distance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Therapeutic RNA can’t help if it doesn’t get to where it’s needed,” Qi said. “We wanted to create a technology that could reliably move RNA to where it needs to function.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Qi and his colleagues used a version of the gene-editing tool CRISPR, called CRISPR-Cas13, to target individual pieces of RNA (unlike the more widely known CRISPR-Cas9, which targets DNA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Typically, CRISPR is used to slice and edit genetic code, but in this case the researchers didn’t want to make any changes. They simply wanted to move the existing RNA to a new place within the cell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Cas13 naturally acts like a pair of scissors, but we engineered it to act like a mailman instead,” Qi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Then we can tell it to carry the RNA from one precise location to another.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers paired Cas13 with specific localization signals that act as addresses, instructing the Cas13 where to deliver the RNA. Each location within the cell has its own address molecule, so the researchers can direct the RNA to various locations by adding different molecules to the cell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Qi and his colleagues used their technology, which they are calling CRISPR-TO, to screen dozens of pieces of RNA and see if any of them would help neurons to grow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They added CRISPR-TO to mouse brain neurons in a petri dish, where it carried the RNA molecules to the tips of neurites – fingerlike protrusions that form synapses and connect to other neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found several promising candidates, including one RNA molecule that increased neurite growth by as much as 50% over a 24-hour period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are discovering more RNA targets that could promote neurite outgrowth and regeneration,” said Mengting Han, a postdoctoral scholar in Qi’s lab and lead author on the paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’ve added a new tool to the CRISPR toolbox, using it to control RNA localization inside the cell. This has never been achieved before and, importantly, it opens new therapeutic directions for treating neurodegenerative diseases.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Safer, more effective RNA medicine&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers are using CRISPR-TO to screen additional RNA molecules to determine which ones will be most effective at repairing injured neurons in the brains of mice, as well as in human neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are at the beginning of understanding how spatial organization of RNA benefits brain repair,” Qi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We hope our technology will help people figure out which RNAs will be the biggest players for better therapeutics.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, the researchers are using CRISPR-TO to move endogenous RNAs – RNA molecules that are naturally produced within the cell. But it could also be used to provide precise control over RNA-based medicines, making them both safer and more efficient, Qi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This potential excites us tremendously,” Qi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s not enough for a molecule to just be in the cell. We need it to be in the right location at the right time. With our precise, programmable technology, you can target any RNA in any type of cell and bring it to the site of need in the body.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;This work was funded by the National Science Foundation, the National Institutes of Health, the National Center for Research Resources, the Stanford School of Medicine Dean’s Postdoctoral Fellowship, and the American Heart Association Postdoctoral Fellowship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this CRISPR and neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#0f6c6763606a6b66604f7c7b6e6169607d6b216a6b7a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Chloe Dionisio&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://stanford.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Stanford&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Chloe Dionisio – Stanford&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09041-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Clonal tracing with somatic epimutations reveals dynamics of blood ageing&lt;/a&gt;” by Stanley Qi et al. &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clonal tracing with somatic epimutations reveals dynamics of blood ageing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Current approaches used to track stem cell clones through differentiation require genetic engineering or rely on sparse somatic DNA variants, which limits their wide application.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here we discover that DNA methylation of a subset of CpG sites reflects cellular differentiation, whereas another subset undergoes stochastic epimutations and can serve as digital barcodes of clonal identity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We demonstrate that targeted single-cell profiling of DNA methylation at single-CpG resolution can accurately extract both layers of information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To that end, we develop EPI-Clone, a method for transgene-free lineage tracing at scale. Applied to mouse and human haematopoiesis, we capture hundreds of clonal differentiation trajectories across tens of individuals and 230,358 single cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In mouse ageing, we demonstrate that myeloid bias and low output of old haematopoietic stem cells are restricted to a small number of expanded clones, whereas many functionally young-like clones persist in old age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In human ageing, clones with and without known driver mutations of clonal haematopoieis are part of a spectrum of age-related clonal expansions that display similar lineage biases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EPI-Clone enables accurate and transgene-free single-cell lineage tracing on hematopoietic cell state landscapes at scale.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="63" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmayikq0v00293576hpqcm3bd@published"&gt;My mother grew up in a very Catholic family. So Catholic that my uncle joined the seminary right out of high school. He became a priest, but is able to make visits to see the family from time to time. We always have a big gathering where everyone gets together for Father’s Day, and this year, he will be able to make it.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="87" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmayikq2r002c3576w54vaexa@published"&gt;The thing is, my ex-husband and I have gotten divorced since the last time we saw my uncle. My mom begged me not to say anything to him about it, and I foolishly agreed. Big mistake. Now my mom wants me and my ex to pretend to still be married when we both attend the family gathering on Father’s Day, because she thinks it would crush my uncle to learn of our divorce. Is she asking too much, or should we just fake it for one afternoon?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="96" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmayikqbm002h3576v7gzfxo9@published"&gt;I too grew up in a Catholic family and seem to recall hearing a lot about how wrong it is to lie? Religion aside, your mother shouldn’t be demanding that you do so. Her request is less about holiness and more about saving face. Which feels rather misguided, since it’s not as though your uncle is unaware of the existence of divorce—and if by some chance he decides to take yours personally, that is definitely his problem, not yours. Neither you nor your ex should go along with your mother’s ruse if you don’t want to.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="114" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmayikqdo002i3576gsaq7ilb@published"&gt;Her demand does make me wonder if perhaps &lt;em&gt;she&lt;/em&gt; is the one who hasn’t fully adjusted to the fact of your divorce. There may not be much for you to do about that, even if it’s true, and it’s not as if you need any family member’s approval to do what’s right for you. I only point this out because &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt; your mother isn’t entirely okay with your situation, that has the potential to have a greater impact on your life than whatever your uncle—who you don’t see very often—might think about it. If you think that might be the case, you can decide whether a more pointed conversation with your mom is warranted.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="49" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmayikqq2002l35767cdipomw@published"&gt;My husband “Grant” has a 6-year-old daughter, “Charity,” from his previous marriage. The custody arrangement he has with his ex is such where she alternates spending 10-day stretches with her mother and with us. Charity is a very easygoing, fun kid to be around and we get along well.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="177" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmayikqs6002m3576bcmqyb7h@published"&gt;The problem is that Grant refuses to engage in any kind of sexual activity with me while his daughter is at our place. He claims that he is uncomfortable doing anything because he is afraid of the possibility she will hear it or walk in on us and report it to his ex, who is an extremely petty and vindictive person.&lt;br&gt;Before the current custody agreement was hammered out, she frequently thwarted Grant’s efforts to spend time with Charity, and my husband says he “doesn’t want to give her any potential ammo.” Charity’s bedroom is all the way down the hall, so I very much doubt she will hear anything. I have suggested locking the door in case she tries to come in. Grant is against that because she sometimes has nightmares and will come running to jump in bed with us. I want very much for us to have children of our own, and at this rate I don’t see how it will happen. What can I do to convince my husband how irrational his fears are?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="92" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmayikqyf002p3576ipchs6mm@published"&gt;You have already presented Grant with a very simple, sensible solution—locking your bedroom door—and he still isn’t willing. Could there be something else, apart from his daughter’s presence, that has him feeling reluctant? Is he perhaps less certain than you are about having a child, or might there currently be a mismatch in your libidos? I’m not trying to make any assumptions, but whether it’s merely the anxiety over his child or something else, your sex life is important and he should be willing to try to figure this out with you.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="142" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmayikr0d002q3576zqfsew6i@published"&gt;People manage to have sex despite young kids being in the house all the time. If Charity had a nightmare and needed you, it’s not hard to yell “just a second!”, throw some clothes on, and go unlock the door. I imagine you’ve also told Grant that you can be quieter on nights when she is staying with you. Even if his ex is looking for reasons to punish him, I doubt she’s living under the illusion that you two &lt;em&gt;don’t&lt;/em&gt; sleep together. (Also, I am not a lawyer, but I don’t think you can throw out a whole custody agreement because a child happens to do what many kids have done since time immemorial and walked in on their parents having sex. Which, again, does not &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to happen, because as you have pointed out, you can just lock the door!)&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="96" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmayikr2b002r35762rz1zuks@published"&gt;If both you and Grant were fine with your 10-days-on, 10-days-off routine, that would be one thing—but you’re not. So I think it’s worth talking with him about this hang-up and why he’s been so hesitant. Be as kind and patient as you can be, but be honest, too, and let him know that you aren’t happy with the total lack of intimacy when Charity is in the house and would like it to change. You two might also consider talking with a competent sex therapist who can help you address whatever may be going on.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="138" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmayikrc4002v3576d5sq64wp@published"&gt;Recently, I learned while having a conversation with a family friend who had been there that my niece had been christened two weeks ago. She said she hoped that my family was feeling better, because my sister had told everyone we weren’t present because we had the flu. When I called my sister and demanded an explanation, she said that while she loves us and doesn’t mind spending individual time with Annie, she “didn’t want the distraction” at her child’s christening. I told her that we would spare her and the rest of the family the trouble, because we weren’t going to bother with any future invitations. My parents and my brother have all been saying the same thing: They love Annie, but don’t want events “ruined” or “disrupted” and that “it can’t be all about your daughter.”&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="109" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmayikre2002w3576b58jzp75@published"&gt;My husband’s mother, “Susan,” lives several states away. She has MS and is increasingly unable to care for herself. A few days ago, I learned that a position in my company has become available in the state where she lives. Susan adores Annie and they are very close (they FaceTime every few days). Annie does have friends here and a good but not great support system at school. My husband is a freelance writer, so a move would not be disruptive for his career. Given my MIL’s growing need for help and the way my family continues to ostracize Annie, is requesting a transfer the right thing to do?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="40" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmayikrko002z3576cndfuxmb@published"&gt;I’m sorry your relatives have failed to include you and Annie in family celebrations. I have a disabled daughter, and my heart really hurt for you as I read your letter. I don’t blame you at all for being angry.&lt;/p&gt;

  



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="117" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmayikrn700303576m4maeff5@published"&gt;Moving, uprooting your lives, changing schools, and assuming responsibility for your mother-in-law’s care needs all represent major changes. You want to make the decision based on what is best for you and your husband and Annie. And whether you apply for a transfer or not, you’ll still have choices to make regarding your family. I did wonder whether you were thinking about this move in part to avoid doing so—as if your family members could just be out of sight, out of mind—but wherever you live, you will still have to deal with your feelings over how they’ve treated your daughter, and you’ll still have to decide whether or not to continue having a relationship with them.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="134" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmayikrq300313576k6yr43dt@published"&gt;I’m not saying this to give your family any sort of benefit of the doubt, but it’s unfortunately common for parents of disabled kids to have to do a fair bit of educating within their own families. It could be that further conversations with your family would help them better understand Annie, and how hurtful it is when they fail to include her. But I know that would be difficult labor on your part, and you might not be all that motivated to undertake it, especially when you don’t know that they will ever come around. Whatever you wind up choosing where your relatives are concerned, I hope that you and Annie continue to find meaningful friendships and community—the kind of love and support you deserve, even if your family refuses to provide it.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="98" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmayikrts00333576cvnvu6nt@published"&gt;Approximately a month ago I hired a young man from a pet store I frequent to housesit for a day. His prices were outrageous, but I agreed since my regular housesitter was out of town. He changed $100 per trip to my house which was required two times a day so he expected $200 for a whole day. For the record I have never been charged that much. I am disabled and about three days before I was supposed to leave I became quite ill and decided to cancel by text. &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2019/12/parenting-mulligans-care-and-feeding.html"&gt;He told me he charged a cancellation fee…&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For those struggling to get more healthy foods into their diet Dr Nye recommended opting for frozen options that can be easily added to a variety of meals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Frozen fruit and vegetables can be just as beneficial and often easier to add to meals to get that content in’, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another tip for a longer life offered by Dr Nye was to ensure you get the recommend seven to eight hours of sleep per night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Shorter than seven hours of sleep daily is linked to a 12 per cent increased risk of death, with those who sleep over eight hours being linked to a 30 per cent increased chance,' he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘It seems that having regular sleep patterns may be the key to getting the most benefit and potentially living longer’, the expert added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Studies show that prolonged sleep deficiency can put people at a higher risk for conditions like obesity, heart disease and Type 2 diabetes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Nye's final tip, knowing your family history for any conditions you should keep track of as well as attending routine health checks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the doctor, genetic factors, including disease risk, hormone balance and cell replacement rates, are believed to influence between 20 and 30 per cent of your lifespan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘About 40 per cent of life expectancy is inherited among generations, meaning you are more likely to live longer if your parents and grandparents did,’ he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Genetic testing, sometimes called genomic testing—which highlights changes in genes that can cause health problems—is mainly used to diagnose rare and inherited health conditions and some cancers. It can also help couples understand the risk of passing on a health condition to their children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, the NHS advises considering how the results could affect you and others in your family, as there is a chance that the test will provide information about your relatives that was not previously known.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Nye's advice comes as data suggests England' bulging waistlines have caused a &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14409773/England-life-expectancy-rankings-calculator-long-live.html"&gt;significant drop in average life expectancy&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After decades of progress, attempts to keep people living longer are beginning to fail, with people in England now living roughly nine months less than they did in 2011. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Separate data released by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) earlier this year suggested that a baby boy born in the UK in 2023 could expect to live on average to 86.7 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Girls still have a longer anticipated lifespan of 90 years, although the gap has been narrowing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As of the latest ONS data, for 2023, there are just over 16,000 centenarians—people who have lived over 100 years—living in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

In a series of experiments using animal models and human genetic data, researchers found that amlodipine reduced hyperactivity and impulsivity—key features of ADHD—while also demonstrating potential advantages over current stimulant medications. The findings suggest that this well-tolerated drug could serve as a foundation for a new type of non-stimulant treatment for the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ADHD is a common neurodevelopmental condition that typically emerges in childhood and can persist into adulthood. It is characterized by persistent symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity that interfere with daily life, academic achievement, work performance, and social relationships. ADHD affects an estimated 2 to 5 percent of the global population and is associated with a higher risk of other mental health problems, including mood and anxiety disorders, substance use, and even suicide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Current treatments for ADHD typically involve stimulant medications such as methylphenidate or amphetamines. These drugs can be effective for many people, but they are also associated with several drawbacks. Side effects like insomnia, appetite loss, headaches, and increased blood pressure are common. There is also a potential for misuse, especially in adolescents and young adults. Importantly, about 25 percent of individuals with ADHD do not experience adequate symptom relief from any available medication. These limitations have driven researchers to explore new therapeutic options that are both effective and better tolerated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers at 3Z Pharmaceuticals in Iceland sought to identify a non-stimulant medication that could offer an alternative for individuals who do not respond well to existing treatments. They focused on amlodipine, a widely used drug for treating high blood pressure, because it targets L-type calcium channels—proteins in the brain that help regulate electrical activity in neurons and are increasingly recognized as playing a role in neuropsychiatric disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers hypothesized that modulating these calcium channels could help alleviate the symptoms of ADHD. Their goal was to determine whether amlodipine, which already has a strong safety record, could be repurposed as a novel treatment for the disorder. Their strategy was to integrate findings across multiple experimental systems—including behavioral testing in rats and zebrafish, pharmacological and brain imaging studies, and human genetic analyses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“At 3Z, we developed a high-throughput behavioral screening platform for drug discovery, using genetically engineered zebrafish models,” explained corresponding author Karl Ægir Karlsson, the CEO of 3Z and a professor of neuroscience at Reykjavik University. “The platform is built to detect therapeutic effects across a wide range of neuropsychiatric disorders with a behavioral phenotype. ADHD was a natural fit: it’s highly prevalent, current medications have significant limitations — including adverse effects and a large non-responder group — and there’s a clear need for novel therapeutics.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Crucially, we also engineered a robust zebrafish model of ADHD that exhibits core behavioral symptoms like hyperactivity and impulsivity. These symptoms are reversed by existing ADHD medications, giving us a solid positive control and validating the model’s predictive power. With this in place, we were positioned to conduct an unbiased drug repurposing screen to identify compounds with improved efficacy or safety profiles.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the first part of the study, researchers tested five drug candidates in rats bred to exhibit ADHD-like hyperactivity. Among the options, only amlodipine consistently reduced hyperactive behaviors, particularly in female rats. These effects were observed after 30 days of treatment and were confirmed through objective measures such as distance traveled and time spent moving. Other compounds tested did not show significant effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To extend their findings to another species, Karlsson and his colleagues examined how amlodipine affected behavior in zebrafish with a genetic mutation linked to impulsivity and hyperactivity. Zebrafish are a useful model for studying brain function, as they share a large proportion of their genes with humans. In this experiment, the researchers used a behavioral task designed to measure impulsive actions. They found that amlodipine significantly reduced premature responses in the zebrafish, indicating improved impulse control. The results were comparable to those produced by methylphenidate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers then explored whether amlodipine could enter the brain and influence neural activity. They confirmed that the drug crosses the blood-brain barrier in both zebrafish and rats. In zebrafish, exposure to amlodipine reduced activation of a brain region involved in regulating attention and behavior, as indicated by a drop in the expression of a protein called c-Fos. These results suggest that the behavioral effects of amlodipine are likely due to its direct action on the brain, not just its effects on blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The magnitude and consistency of amlodipine’s behavioral effects in our ADHD model were unexpected, given the widespread assumption that the drug does not significantly cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB),” Karlsson told PsyPost. “This posed a challenge in interpreting our data: the effects were too robust to plausibly arise from peripheral mechanisms alone.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Applying Occam’s Razor, the most straightforward explanation was that amlodipine does in fact reach the brain. We confirmed this directly using unbound brain-to-plasma partition coefficient assays across multiple species, including zebrafish, mice, and rats. These assays demonstrated that amlodipine does cross the BBB, at levels consistent with central nervous system (CNS) activity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand how these findings might apply to humans, the researchers conducted genetic analyses using large datasets. One analysis used a technique called Mendelian randomization to explore whether genetic variations that affect calcium channels are linked to ADHD. The results showed a significant association between ADHD and several subunits of L-type calcium channels—the same ones targeted by amlodipine. This supports the idea that these channels may play a role in ADHD symptoms and could be a meaningful treatment target.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A second genetic analysis looked at data from the UK Biobank, a large-scale health database with genetic and health information from over 500,000 participants. Individuals with a higher genetic risk for ADHD were more likely to report mood swings and risk-taking behavior. However, among those taking amlodipine, these tendencies were less common, suggesting that the drug may help manage some core features of ADHD even outside of a clinical diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We identified amlodipine, a commonly prescribed calcium channel blocker for hypertension, as a candidate for repurposing in ADHD,” Karlsson said. “Our findings suggest that it targets a previously underappreciated mechanism in the brain relevant to attention and impulse control. This is significant because it shows how existing medications, already well-characterized in terms of safety and pharmacology, can be redirected to address unmet needs in psychiatric disorders — potentially reducing the time and cost of drug development.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers emphasize that while these findings are promising, amlodipine is not yet approved for ADHD treatment and further testing in clinical trials is necessary. Still, the drug’s long-standing safety record and widespread availability make it an appealing candidate for repurposing. Amlodipine is already approved by the Food and Drug Administration, is inexpensive, and has a low risk of drug interactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One strength of the study was its multi-pronged approach, which combined laboratory experiments with large-scale human genetic data. By showing consistent effects across species and methods, the researchers were able to build a compelling case for further investigation. The study also introduced a new way of using genetic tools to assess drug effects across multiple biological targets, an approach that could help accelerate drug discovery for other brain disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the research is not without limitations. The animal studies, while informative, do not fully capture the complexity of human ADHD, which involves a wide range of behavioral and cognitive symptoms. Additionally, the genetic analyses relied on self-reported symptoms and indirect measures of ADHD traits rather than formal diagnoses. Future clinical studies will be needed to determine whether the benefits of amlodipine extend to diagnosed individuals and how the drug compares to existing treatments in real-world settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While amlodipine shows promise in preclinical models, it is not currently suitable for use in ADHD in its marketed form,” Karlsson noted. “Further optimization through chemical modification is necessary to enhance CNS selectivity and ensure a favorable therapeutic index in the context of ADHD.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers are now preparing to launch a Phase II clinical trial to formally evaluate the safety and effectiveness of amlodipine for ADHD in humans. If successful, this effort could pave the way for a new class of non-stimulant treatments, offering hope to individuals who do not respond to or cannot tolerate current medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While the spotlight is on amlodipine and ADHD, this work also represents a proof-of-concept for a broader drug repurposing pipeline for CNS disorders,” Karlsson said. “Our approach combines unbiased screening in disease-relevant zebrafish models with human genetic validation to prioritize and de-risk candidates before clinical development. This dual strategy can accelerate the discovery of novel CNS therapeutics by leveraging known molecules in new ways — a particularly attractive proposition in an area where traditional drug development has often struggled.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41386-025-02062-x" target="_blank"&gt;Validation of L-type calcium channel blocker amlodipine as a novel ADHD treatment through cross-species analysis, drug-target Mendelian randomization, and clinical evidence from medical records&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Haraldur Þorsteinsson, Hannes A.

For instance, when you’re around someone you love, you will behave very differently than you would around someone you dislike. Likewise, your energy will affect the space around you differently, telling each person you are with someone you love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/being-in-love"&gt;Healthline writer Crystal Raypole noted&lt;/a&gt;, “It may not seem like it, but being in love is a somewhat scientific process. Falling in love involves a lot of hormones, which can supercharge your feelings and make them wildly fluctuate. When you’re around the person you love, increases in dopamine and norepinephrine lead to feelings of pleasure, giddiness, nervous excitement, and euphoria.” Because of this, a woman’s energy will change when she’s around the person she loves the most.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Here are 11 beautiful ways a woman’s energy changes around the person she loves most:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;1. She undergoes physical changes&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="media media--type-image media--view-mode-default"&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" src="/sites/default/files/image_blog/2025-05/beautiful-ways-womans-energy-changes-around-person-she-loves-most-undergoes-physical-changes.png" alt="woman who is undergoing physical changes" title="beautiful ways a woman's energy changes around the person she loves most she undergoes physical changes" class="img-fluid" typeof="foaf:Image" decoding="async"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-credit field--type-string field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;Yuganov Konstantin | Shutterstock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the first ways that a woman’s energy will change when she’s around the person she loves most is through a change in her physical energy. Things that should be inexplicable, like a faster heartbeat, increased sweating, or shakiness, can be linked to chemical changes in the body. When you’re around the person you love, you don’t stay the same, quite literally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assistant professor of human ecology at the University of Texas, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2010/HEALTH/02/12/love.heart.brain/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Timothy Loving, explained&lt;/a&gt;, “Part of the whole attraction process is strongly linked to physiological arousal as a whole. Typically, that’s going to start with things like increased heart rate, sweatiness, and so on.” Cardiac electrophysiologist &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2010/HEALTH/02/12/love.heart.brain/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Reginald Ho added&lt;/a&gt; that a rush of adrenaline makes someone’s heart beat faster when they see the person they love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hormonal changes occur in a woman’s body when she sees the person she loves the most. These can have a huge impact on her energy and change it in a beautiful way. A woman around the person she loves most will naturally act differently because she has no other choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/self/innocent-habits-that-destroy-womans-feminine-energy"&gt;11 Innocent Habits That Destroy A Woman’s Feminine Energy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;2. She feels nervous&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="media media--type-image media--view-mode-default"&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" src="/sites/default/files/image_blog/2025-05/beautiful-ways-womans-energy-changes-around-person-she-loves-most-feels-nervous.png" alt="woman who feels nervous" title="beautiful ways a woman's energy changes around the person she loves most she feels nervous" class="img-fluid" typeof="foaf:Image" decoding="async"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-credit field--type-string field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;fizkes | Shutterstock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another way a woman’s energy changes around the person she loves most is that she’ll get a bit nervous. The exact level of anxious energy she feels can differ depending on the person, but there’s a good chance she’ll feel some nerves around the person she loves. While some mistake this nervous energy for a general feeling of anxiety, it’s likely that she feels this way because of the person she loves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.verywellmind.com/do-their-nervous-habits-mean-they-like-me-8722041"&gt;VeryWell Mind writer Sian Ferguson explained&lt;/a&gt; that we all engage in nervous habits, but sometimes they can be a sign of something more. “Nervous habits are those little behaviors people tend to do without even realizing it — like fidgeting, avoiding eye contact, or shifting in their seat. They’re just our natural reactions to feeling uncomfortable or excited.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.verywellmind.com/do-their-nervous-habits-mean-they-like-me-8722041"&gt;Hannah Owens, LMSW, said&lt;/a&gt; that exhibiting these habits around the person you love is normal. “Feeling a romantic interest in somebody can be anxiety-inducing — you don’t know if they reciprocate the feelings, and you’re focused on making a good first impression, which can be nerve-wracking,” she said. In other words, a woman bringing some nervous energy to the room when she loves someone is normal and can indicate just how interested she is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/self/beautiful-traits-of-people-who-radiate-good-energy"&gt;11 Beautiful Traits Of People Who Radiate Good Energy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;3. She is connected to her partner’s emotions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="media media--type-image media--view-mode-default"&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" src="/sites/default/files/image_blog/2025-05/beautiful-ways-womans-energy-changes-around-person-she-loves-most-connected-partners-emotions.png" alt="woman who is connected to her partner's emotions" title="beautiful ways a woman's energy changes around the person she loves most she is connected to her partner’s emotions" class="img-fluid" typeof="foaf:Image" decoding="async"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-credit field--type-string field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;Rachata Teyparsit | Shutterstock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A woman in tune with her partner will be connected to their emotions. In fact, she may even absorb those emotions. A woman in love will naturally want to be as close to her partner as possible, even to the point of feeling their same emotions and understanding exactly how they feel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marriage and family therapist &lt;a href="https://psychcentral.com/blog/stop-absorbing-other-peoples-emotions"&gt;Amanda Turecek shared&lt;/a&gt; that this can be particularly prevalent for highly sensitive people (HSP). “Research seems to indicate that certain neurons — mirror neurons — act differently in the brains of HSP than in the brains of non-HSP,” she said. “Mirror neurons kick in to gear in our prefrontal cortex, our area of the brain that also controls things like morality and planning around consequences. They encourage us to imitate others and are more active in the brains of HSPs.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, highly sensitive people are more likely to imitate those around them. If a woman is an HSP, she may be more likely to absorb emotions from those around her, especially the person she loves most, as that is likely also who she admires the most. This leads to a deep connection and understanding of feelings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/self/phrases-brilliant-people-use-soften-energy-get-what-they-want"&gt;11 Phrases Brilliant People Use To Soften Their Energy To Get What They Want&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;4. She becomes more nurturing&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="media media--type-image media--view-mode-default"&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" src="/sites/default/files/image_blog/2025-05/beautiful-ways-womans-energy-changes-around-person-she-loves-most-becomes-more-nurturing.png" alt="woman who has become more nurturing" title="beautiful ways a woman's energy changes around the person she loves most she becomes more nurturing" class="img-fluid" typeof="foaf:Image" decoding="async"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-credit field--type-string field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;Prostock-studio | Shutterstock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A woman around the person she loves most may become more nurturing. Scientists have often debated whether women are more nurturing and compassionate than men, something Emma Seppala &lt;a href="https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/are_women_more_compassionate_than_men" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;discussed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/are_women_more_compassionate_than_men" rel="nofollow"&gt; in UC Berkeley’s Greater Good Magazine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seppala noted that women are often measured to have more oxytocin. “Women may at times have higher levels of oxytocin — sometimes called the ‘cuddle hormone’ or ‘love hormone’ because it is linked to bonding, social connection and monogamy,” she said. “It is produced in women during labor and lactation in women and is believed to trigger bonding and nurturing behaviors.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether women are more compassionate than men is still debatable, but based on explanations like these, women have plenty of reasons to be nurturing. Even setting levels of oxytocin aside, many women are nurturing around those they love. Being around the one they love most would surely bring out this reaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/self/early-clues-someone-energy-pure-poison"&gt;15 Early Clues Someone's Energy Is Pure Poison, According To Psychology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;5. She changes to become more like her partner&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="media media--type-image media--view-mode-default"&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" src="/sites/default/files/image_blog/2025-05/beautiful-ways-womans-energy-changes-around-person-she-loves-most-changes-become-more-like-her-partner.png" alt="woman who changed to become more like her partner" title="beautiful ways a woman's energy changes around the person she loves most she changes to become more like her partner" class="img-fluid" typeof="foaf:Image" decoding="async"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-credit field--type-string field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;AYO Production | Shutterstock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Changing to become more like your partner isn’t necessarily advisable, as everyone should strive to maintain their own autonomy and be their own person. That being said, many women who are in love will make what are sometimes subtle, difficult-to-notice changes to become more like their partners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/how-to-do-life/202109/are-you-becoming-more-like-your-partner"&gt;Marty Nemko, PhD, noted&lt;/a&gt; that becoming more like your partner is completely normal over time. In fact, it would probably be strange not to. He advocates taking inventory of oneself so you can determine whether or not those changes are things you feel like celebrating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over time, a woman’s energy will likely subtly shift to become closer to that of the person she loves the most. Because she spends so much time around that person and is so interested in them, she will naturally lean into their energy and adapt it for her own purposes. Sometimes these changes will be noticeable, and sometimes they’ll be so small you can’t pick them up without paying close attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/self/types-of-people-not-worth-your-time-or-energy-according-research"&gt;11 Types Of People That Are Not Worth Your Time Or Energy, According To Research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;6. She is more focused on her partner's wants and needs&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="media media--type-image media--view-mode-default"&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" src="/sites/default/files/image_blog/2025-05/beautiful-ways-womans-energy-changes-around-person-she-loves-most-more-focused-partner-what-they-want-need.png" alt="woman who is focused on her partner" title="beautiful ways a woman's energy changes around the person she loves most she is more focused on her partner and what they want and need" class="img-fluid" typeof="foaf:Image" decoding="async"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-credit field--type-string field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;Ground Picture | Shutterstock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a woman loves her partner, she is more in tune with them and what makes them happy. Based on their wants and needs, she will do the things she knows will keep them satisfied. Her energy will change because she will be focused almost solely on her partner, drowning out the noise of the world and keeping her attention where she feels it is most important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/fulfillment-at-any-age/202501/why-its-so-important-to-listen-to-your-partner"&gt;Susan Krauss Whitbourne, PhD, ABPP, cited&lt;/a&gt; a study from Florida State University, which found that “mindfulness in relationships is a key component of being able to take the perspective of your partner. This, in turn, makes partners more compassionate.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a woman is focused on her partner, she is more likely to be mindful of them and compassionate towards them. Putting what they want and need before what she wants and needs herself shifts her energy so that it is beautifully centered on her partner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/self/signs-someone-main-character-energy"&gt;7 Harsh Signs Someone Has Main Character Energy And You're Just An Extra, According To Research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;7.

Doing things like holding hands, hugging, and touching will bring two people closer together. Her energy will change as she feels closer to her partner, and she will feel loved and cherished.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An article published in &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7485933/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Social and Personality Psychology Compass&lt;/a&gt; noted that relationships affect one’s health for good and bad. “Positive aspects of close relationships, such as intimacy and social support, predict better health outcomes, including longer survival following a breast cancer diagnosis, and improved emotional well-being,” researchers noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a woman feels close to her partner, it will lead to better health outcomes for both. This will give a woman a brighter, lighter energy. As her physical energy changes, so will her emotional and spiritual energy. She will become a light for those around her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/love/subtle-ways-weak-man-drains-powerful-womans-energy-without-her-realizing"&gt;10 Subtle Ways A Weak Man Drains A Powerful Woman’s Energy Without Her Realizing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;8.

They will have a form of unspoken communication, like a secret language. For them, it just takes a look to know what the other person is thinking. Words are not required.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://online.utpb.edu/about-us/articles/communication/the-influence-of-nonverbal-communication-on-interpersonal-relationships/" rel="nofollow"&gt;The University of Texas Permian Basin said&lt;/a&gt;, “Nonverbal communication can make or break a relationship. A single glance can spark an argument, while a simple touch on the shoulder can mend wounded pride. And sometimes, the sting of words is easier to bear than the weight of crushing silence. There’s power in what goes unspoken.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A woman who can communicate with her partner without words will have a different energy around her. She feels more assured both in who she is and in her relationship. This confidence can be powerful and radiates to everyone around her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/self/ways-increase-aura-make-people-instantly-attracted-energy"&gt;11 Ways To Increase Your Aura And Make People Instantly Attracted To Your Energy &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;9.

It’s about establishing trust with another person and feeling safe enough to be open and vulnerable with them. To put it simply, emotional safety is feeling secure enough to truly express yourself with someone and show up as your most authentic self.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a woman is around the person she loves most, she will feel physically and emotionally safe. This sense of security will transform her energy into something more confident and ready for anything.

This emotional openness is essential in all healthy relationships, as it paves the way for deeper understanding and evokes the empathy necessary for healthy long-term relationships.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a woman feels she can be vulnerable with the person she loves the most, that vulnerable energy will transfer to her everyday life.

Her future will appear more exciting with her partner in the picture, and she will feel better about herself. This excitement will translate into her energy as she lights up the room and the world around her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This can feel similar to what some call “new relationship energy.” &lt;a href="https://www.verywellmind.com/new-relationship-energy-8679124"&gt;Psychotherapist Kristin Papa, LCSW, said&lt;/a&gt;, “New relationship energy usually refers to the intense excitement, euphoria, and almost electrical sensation typically experienced at the beginning of a romantic relationship.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New relationship energy causes excitement that shows in a woman’s energy. The great thing is Papa confirmed this feeling can last well after the “honeymoon phase” is over.

            The US Food and Drug Administration will now require Covid-19 vaccines from Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna to use expanded warning labels with more information about the risk of a rare heart condition after vaccination.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaym3zyi00083b6mdo0oyg8a@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The vaccines’ previous labels warned about the risk of a heart condition called myocarditis, inflammation of the heart muscle, and pericarditis, inflammation of the lining outside the heart, which the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccine-safety/vaccines/covid-19.html#:~:text=In%20rare%20cases%2C%20people%20have,EpiPen)%20and%20may%20require%20hospitalization." target="_blank"&gt;says is rare&lt;/a&gt; but possible after vaccination. The new labels will expand that warning to certain age groups.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaym3zyi00093b6mkkqs035y@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2822933" target="_blank"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; has consistently shown that the mRNA Covid-19 vaccines are safe and effective, and millions of people have gotten them without serious incident. Some studies have found that Covid-19 infection itself carries a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/covid/hcp/vaccine-considerations/safety-considerations.html#:~:text=Cases%20of%20myocarditis%20and%20pericarditis,BioNTech%29%20and%20myocarditis%20and%20pericarditis." target="_blank"&gt;higher&lt;/a&gt; risk of myocarditis or pericarditis than the vaccine does.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaym3zyi000a3b6mi96nli2t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The CDC last month &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/dNCVr9AvFB8" target="_blank"&gt;told its independent vaccine advisers &lt;/a&gt;that research showed Covid-19 vaccinations from 2020 through 2022 showed a statistically significant increased risk of myocarditis. The incidents were rare, however, and “there is no increased risk observed with the doses administered in subsequent years,” the agency said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaym3zyi000b3b6m0nw5zpjd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In the rare case that someone did develop heart inflammation after vaccination, the CDC &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/dNCVr9AvFB8" target="_blank"&gt;told the advisers&lt;/a&gt;, acute myocarditis typically resolves quickly.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaym3zyi000e3b6mhk8gwi1w@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The vaccines already carried warnings that the highest risk of these heart problems was observed in males between ages 18 and 24 for the Moderna vaccine and 12 to 17 for Pfizer’s; the new warnings for both vaccines will be for males age 16 to 25.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaym3zyi000c3b6mwj18n0hj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In letters to &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/186581/download?attachment" target="_blank"&gt;Pfizer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/186580/download?attachment" target="_blank"&gt;Moderna&lt;/a&gt; that were dated April 17 and are now posted online, the agency says analysis of commercial health insurance claims data shows that there were eight cases of myocarditis and/or pericarditis per million vaccine doses given to people ages 6 months through 64 years.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaym3zyi000d3b6miervdssd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Cases were more common among males ages 16 through 25 within seven days of vaccination, but they were still rare, with about 38 cases of myocarditis and/or pericarditis per million doses among this group.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            A spokesperson for the US Department of Health and Human Services said Wednesday that the move was intended to increase “radical transparency.” Neither Pfizer nor Moderna responded to requests&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;for comment.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            The vaccines were developed during the first Trump administration and underwent what &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccine-safety/vaccines/covid-19.html#:~:text=In%20rare%20cases%2C%20people%20have,EpiPen)%20and%20may%20require%20hospitalization." target="_blank"&gt;the CDC says&lt;/a&gt; was “the most intensive safety analysis in US history,” and the agency continues to monitor vaccine administration data for effectiveness and any potential problems.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime anti-vaccine activist, has &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/25/health/novavax-covid-vaccine-trial"&gt;falsely&lt;/a&gt; claimed that the Covid-19 vaccine was “the deadliest vaccine ever made.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaym3zyi000i3b6mmy0sy6ki@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In a US Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs subcommittee &lt;a href="https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/subcommittees/investigations/hearings/the-corruption-of-science-and-federal-health-agencies-how-health-officials-downplayed-and-hid-myocarditis-and-other-adverse-events-associated-with-the-covid-19-vaccines/" target="_blank"&gt;hearing&lt;/a&gt; on Wednesday,  Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wisconsin, claimed that the Biden administration downplayed the risks of the vaccine and delayed getting information about those risks to the public.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaym4jcp00003b6mxu3ahtkz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            One witness, Hawaii Gov. Josh Green, a family physician, said in his &lt;a href="https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/Hon.-Green-Testimony.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;testimony&lt;/a&gt; the US vaccine safety monitoring systems worked “exactly as intended” by detecting rare cases of myocarditis.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaymn9oj000e3b6mndo4jmv0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The data were made public, warnings were updated, and clinical guidance was revised accordingly,” Green said. “Despite this, some continue to promote misleading interpretations, unverified claims or anecdotes to suggest that vaccines are broadly unsafe.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaym3zyi000k3b6menjpd6w2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;

The vaccines are expected to be be available in the fall, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/20/health/covid-vaccine-fda-changes"&gt;but only&lt;/a&gt; for adults 65 and older and people with underlying conditions that put them at a higher risk for severe Covid-19 infection.

Most people will be exposed to HSV-1 in their lives and lots of people get &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/are-cold-sores-genetic-72344" target="_blank"&gt;cold sores&lt;/a&gt;, so this conclusion might sound alarming, but it’s important to understand what the paper is actually saying – and what it isn’t.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="piano-gate" id="piano-gate"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What was the study about and what did it show?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The newly published paper comes from an international team of researchers working at Gilead Sciences Inc., a US pharmaceutical company developing drugs for a number of different diseases, including HSV-1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study had a retrospective case-control design. Patients with a diagnosis of &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/tags/alzheimer-s-disease" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/a&gt; or Alzheimer’s disease-related dementia (ADRD) were matched with a control participant of the same age and sex, living in the same region, and with a similar health history except for one key difference: the controls had no history of neurological disorders. In total, 344,628 pairs were included.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of the people with Alzheimer’s or ADRD, it was found that 0.44 percent of them had been diagnosed with HSV-1. In the control group, it was 0.25 percent. These are both tiny fractions of the overall number of people, but the difference between these two figures was found to be significant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After adjusting for other health conditions that could play a role, the team concluded that those with Alzheimer’s disease/ADRD were 80 percent more likely to have been diagnosed with HSV-1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="piano-inline"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another finding was that those who had used an antiviral medication to treat their HSV-1 seemed to be somewhat protected and were 17 percent less likely to develop Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the topline findings focused on HSV-1, the team also looked at two similar viruses: HSV-2, the more common cause of genital &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/antiviral-chewing-gum-made-of-beans-could-help-stop-spread-of-herpes-and-flu-78716" target="_blank"&gt;herpes&lt;/a&gt;; and varicella zoster virus (VZV), the virus responsible for chickenpox and shingles. Both of these were also associated with an increased risk of Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What can be concluded from this study?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This kind of study can only show that two factors are linked in some way; it cannot show that one &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/if-correlation-does-not-mean-causation-how-do-scientists-prove-stuff-78590" target="_blank"&gt;causes&lt;/a&gt; the other. There are also limitations to the study – as with every research project – that must be accounted for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Despite the large sample size, this research has limitations partly due to only using health records and administrative claims data,” said Dr Sheona Scales, Director of Research at Alzheimer’s Research UK, in a statement to the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencemediacentre.org/expert-reaction-to-study-of-the-cold-sore-virus-herpes-simplex-1-and-risk-of-alzheimers/" target="_blank"&gt;Science Media Centre&lt;/a&gt;. “Most people infected with HSV-1 don’t have any symptoms so some infections might not have been recorded. Infections predating the information recorded are also not available.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other scientists have been more critical. Dr David Vickers, of the Cumming School of Medicine at the University of Calgary, commented, “This pharma-funded research exaggerates the role of HSV-1, failing to appreciate its absence in 99.56 percent of [Alzheimer’s disease] cases.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The study’s data source makes its findings ungeneralisable, and it overstates a minor infection as a ‘public health priority’ to justify unnecessary treatment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, a number of others, including Professor Tara Spires-Jones of the University of Edinburgh and Professor Cornelia van Duijn of the University of Oxford, praised the study for its careful methodological design, whilst acknowledging that this can’t be the end of the story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“More research is needed to understand the best way to protect our brains from Alzheimer’s disease as we age,” said Spires-Jones, adding that “it is important to note that HSV-1 infection, which is &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/pretty-much-everybody-s-got-herpes-31677" target="_blank"&gt;extremely common&lt;/a&gt; in the population, is by no means a guarantee that someone will develop Alzheimer’s.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;HSV-1 and Alzheimer's: What evidence do we already have?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is part of a much broader conversation and a growing body of evidence suggesting that HSV-1 and similar viruses can have a direct impact on the brain, which may include Alzheimer’s and other forms of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/how-the-cold-sore-virus-that-you-probably-have-silently-invades-the-human-brain-76636" target="_blank"&gt;2024 paper&lt;/a&gt; in the Journal of Virology used a mouse model to show that HSV-1 can enter the brain via both the brainstem and olfactory nerve, triggering an inflammatory response that can persist when the virus is no longer detectable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/rampant-herpes-virus-could-reach-the-brain-via-the-nose-sparking-behavior-changes-78448" target="_blank"&gt;Earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;, a team at the University of Illinois Chicago led a study that found HSV-1 particles can be shed in tears and can reach the nasal cavity that way, moving directly into the brain and potentially contributing to neurodegeneration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2076-393X/9/6/679" target="_blank"&gt;2021 paper&lt;/a&gt; in the journal Vaccines even went as far as to argue that the evidence for a “major role” for HSV-1 in Alzheimer’s disease was “overwhelming”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re not saying viruses explain everything. But they may be central to it. This is no longer a fringe theory – it’s the next phase of Alzheimer’s research, and we’re pursuing it,” said Dr Bryce Vissel, Director of the Centre for Neuroscience and Regenerative Medicine at St Vincent’s Hospital Sydney, in a comment to the &lt;a href="https://www.scimex.org/newsfeed/cold-sores-implicated-in-the-development-of-alzheimers-disease" target="_blank"&gt;Australian Science Media Centre&lt;/a&gt;. Vissel’s research group are also actively conducting studies in this area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though most of the experts agree that more research is needed to better understand what’s going on, some have pointed to the fact that this study seems to suggest that treating HSV-1 with antiviral medications could help combat the potential damage to the brain. They say doing more to treat and detect these infections, even while the research continues, may not be a bad thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“With many GPs and the population being unaware of the dementia related benefits of treating HSV infections and preventing VZV activation through vaccination, it is time to call for actions informing those working in primary care as well as the population at large,” said van Duijn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unless you were &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/antivaxxing-hot-spot-sees-largest-chickenpox-outbreak-in-decades-50626" target="_blank"&gt;vaccinated&lt;/a&gt;, chances are you were exposed to VZV as a kid; there are now vaccines available that prevent the virus reactivating later in life as &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/shingles/vaccines/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;shingles&lt;/a&gt;, and you can ask a healthcare professional about availability where you are. As for HSV-1 and 2, many people may be infected without ever having any symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you are worried about a cold sore or your general health, be sure to seek the appropriate help from a health professional,” recommends Dr Richard Oakley, Director of Research and Innovation at Alzheimer’s Society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new study is published in the journal &lt;a href="https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/15/5/e093946" target="_blank"&gt;BMJ Open&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>IFLScience</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 May 2025 00:55:09 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiuAFBVV95cUxQYkY2LWJGVmdrT3FFWGhqUVYwN2tkRUZ0NWhhQXFZQzBacDhvRDNCWkNON2VGWVlmY3Y3dWZDMEkwYlFqeVNrRTZiNmZ3bXoxb2JrZ3h5YTRlRW5iUlRQd0RiZUEzSDVQcFlNb2RNWVRiUjM3SFE3VlYyRkxmeW1tcUdNTmhBV1BaUHVZRDh6TWNVVk1NY20xSS1UUTVzZGw0Wld2anZDTXFZdzBzOUdTQVl3Z0sycFMw</guid></item><item><title>认知训练可以减少抑郁症和创伤后应激障碍患者的负面自我认知- PsyPost | Cognitive training may reduce negative self-perceptions in people with depression and PTSD - PsyPost</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMitgFBVV95cUxQazBqSmVDczI0TGFBTnlyT3dBc1poMHktaFZQUl9uTk4tdDZXQkp1X2dMYjctMnhoUEVLSVdTM0pNbnZjaTZYdXBoV0doZHFDeERxNi14TTVnSjNfM0FTZ3F5MVBEVWZIaHNvTXFEa0dILXpsc3RwODdGbUIxSjdyTDdfTG8yek1Pc3FlU2FmeUtLeVZSaXJzVElXWUFEUHBPZ3I2NXpjdTdLQ2JFdlF5c2Rnb19VUQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="content-inner "&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with depression and posttraumatic stress disorder tend to underestimate their cognitive abilities—a pattern that may worsen their mental health. A new study published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2025-18950-001" target="_blank"&gt;Neuropsychology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; provides evidence that this negative self-perception, known as metacognitive bias, is both common and severe in individuals with high levels of depressive and PTSD symptoms. The researchers also found that targeted or game-based cognitive training can improve these biases and may contribute to a reduction in symptom severity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Depression and PTSD are two of the most common mental health conditions, often marked by persistent negative thoughts and emotional distress. Depression is characterized by symptoms such as sadness, low energy, and loss of interest in daily activities, while PTSD can involve intrusive memories, avoidance of reminders, emotional numbness, and heightened arousal following exposure to traumatic events. Both conditions are known to distort how individuals perceive themselves and the world around them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent years, researchers have become increasingly interested in how metacognition—the ability to reflect on and evaluate one’s own thoughts and abilities—may influence mental health. One important aspect of metacognition is “metacognitive bias,” or the tendency to systematically overestimate or underestimate one’s own abilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While people in the general population often show a slight tendency to overestimate themselves, this study focused on the opposite problem: large-scale underestimation among individuals with depression and PTSD. The researchers wanted to examine how strongly these negative self-perceptions were related to symptoms and whether cognitive training could help reduce them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To explore these questions, researchers reanalyzed data from a randomized controlled trial known as the BRAVE study, which involved 84 participants, mostly military veterans, who had experienced mild traumatic brain injuries and reported cognitive difficulties. About three-quarters of the participants had either elevated depression, PTSD symptoms, or both.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The participants were randomly assigned to one of two 13-week training programs: a “targeted cognitive training” group that completed computerized exercises designed to improve attention, memory, and executive function, or an “entertainment training” group that played puzzle and board games like Tetris and Solitaire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before and after the training, participants completed a variety of assessments. Self-reported cognitive performance was measured using the Cognitive Failures Questionnaire, a validated 25-item scale that captures daily lapses in attention and memory. Objective cognitive performance was evaluated using a battery of tests measuring learning, memory, working memory, attention, and cognitive flexibility. By comparing self-perceived and actual performance, researchers calculated each participant’s metacognitive bias. Depression and PTSD symptoms were also measured using well-established clinical questionnaires.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the start of the study, the researchers found that people with elevated depression or PTSD symptoms significantly underestimated their cognitive abilities compared to their actual test scores. On average, participants with both conditions scored nearly 2.3 standard deviations below the norm in their self-assessments, despite relatively mild objective impairments. This discrepancy—referred to as a negative global metacognitive bias—was strongly linked to the severity of depression and PTSD symptoms. The researchers found no evidence that these negative biases were linked to specific types of cognitive impairment, suggesting that they reflect a broader pattern of self-doubt rather than performance in a particular area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the 13-week intervention period, participants in both the targeted and entertainment training groups showed notable improvements. Those who completed either program reported fewer cognitive problems, reduced depression symptoms, and improved metacognitive accuracy. Importantly, the size of the improvement in metacognitive bias was correlated with the reduction in both depression and PTSD symptoms. This relationship was especially strong in the entertainment training group, where participants who most improved their self-perception also experienced the greatest mental health benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, while both training programs improved self-reported cognition and metacognitive bias, only the targeted training group showed small, non-significant trends toward better objective cognitive performance. This suggests that the subjective feeling of improved cognitive ability—rather than actual test performance—may play a more important role in symptom improvement for people with depression and PTSD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers believe the performance feedback embedded in both training programs may be key to these improvements. In both training conditions, participants received feedback on their progress and were rewarded for correct performance, helping them to form more accurate beliefs about their cognitive abilities. This positive reinforcement may have helped counteract the negative thinking patterns common in depression and PTSD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three months after training ended, participants continued to report lower depression symptoms, and those in the entertainment group also maintained improvements in PTSD symptoms and metacognitive bias. These lasting effects suggest that cognitive training—especially when designed to be engaging and motivating—may have durable benefits for people struggling with self-doubt and negative thinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the study offers promising evidence, the authors note several limitations. The sample consisted primarily of military veterans with a history of mild traumatic brain injury, which may limit the generalizability of the findings to other groups. Additionally, the study did not include a no-treatment control group, making it difficult to rule out the influence of nonspecific effects such as time, attention, or participant expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future studies with larger, more diverse samples and more rigorous control conditions will be needed to confirm whether improvements in metacognitive bias can directly lead to reductions in depression and PTSD symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/doi/10.1037/neu0000967" target="_blank"&gt;Negative Global Metacognitive Biases Are Associated With Depressive and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Symptoms and Improve With Targeted or Game-Based Cognitive Training&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Sam Agnoli, Henry Mahncke, Sarah-Jane Grant, Zachary T.

                                &lt;div class="hsa-paywall"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Hawaii Department of Health said cases of pertussis are on the rise in the state, and is urging residents to keep up with recommended vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOH said, as of May 15, there have been 108 cases of pertussis reported, compared to 84 cases for all of 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Pertussis is a highly contagious respiratory disease spread through the air via the coughs or sneezes of an infected person,” said DOH in a news release. “Initially, the symptoms resemble a cold but can progress to intense coughing fits. In children, coughing fits can be followed by a deep breath that makes a whooping sound.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health complications from pertussis can be serious and even life-threatening, DOH said, especially for infants and young children who are not fully vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some potential complications include pneumonia, seizures, apnea (a pause in breathing), encephalopathy (a disease of the brain) and death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The most effective way to prevent pertussis is through vaccination with either the DTaP (diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis) or Tdap (tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis) vaccines,” said DOH. “Multiple doses are recommended for infants, children and adults.”&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, DOH said no further cases of measles have been reported in the state following the two confirmed in early April — one in a &lt;a href="https://www.staradvertiser.com/2025/04/08/breaking-news/hawaii-confirms-travel-related-measles-case-in-child-under-5/" target="_self" rel="noopener"&gt;child under age 5 &lt;/a&gt;and the other in an adult household member — related to international travel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOH has concluded there was no further community spread from those two cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health officials are concerned, however, of the growing number of cases on the mainland, which has now surpassed 1,000 across 30 states this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“DOH recommends continued vigilance and efforts to increase the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccination rate,” said the department. “High vaccination rates protect individuals and communities and prevent cases from becoming outbreaks.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vaccination rates for all routinely recommended vaccinations for school entry, including those for measles, pertussis, polio and chickenpox, have declined in Hawaii and nationally since 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOH strongly recommends that children and adults stay up-to-date with recommended vaccinations to prevent vaccine-preventable diseases. It also encourages residents to discuss concerns about vaccines with a trusted health care provider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A new study linked high-quality carbohydrate intake in midlife to healthier aging.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;High-quality carbs include those from whole grains, fruits, non-starchy vegetables and legumes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Those carbs were associated with better physical function and cognitive health decades later.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; What you eat in your 40s and 50s might help determine how well you age decades later. According to a new study published in &lt;em&gt;JAMA Network Open&lt;/em&gt;, women who consumed more &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7938733/healthiest-carbs-you-should-be-buying-according-to-a-dietitian/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;high-quality carbohydrates and fiber&lt;/a&gt; in midlife were significantly more likely to reach older adulthood with &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/polyphenols-reduce-cognitive-decline-11680121" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;good physical and cognitive function&lt;/a&gt;—and without major chronic illnesses.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The study supports what nutrition experts have long suspected: it’s not just about how many carbohydrates you eat, but which ones you choose. Carbs from &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7878282/complete-plant-based-diet-grocery-list/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;whole plant foods&lt;/a&gt; like fruits, vegetables, legumes and whole grains were linked to a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-diet-to-reach-70-study-11703981" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;higher likelihood of healthy aging&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile, diets high in refined &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8047875/what-are-refined-carbs/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;carbohydrates&lt;/a&gt; (think: cookies, white-flour pasta) had the opposite effect.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re looking for simple, sustainable ways to support your future health, this research makes a strong case for upgrading the quality of your carbs.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-was-this-study-conducted"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Was This Study Conducted? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Researchers from Tufts University and the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health conducted a prospective cohort study—a study that follows a group of people over time—using data from the well-known Nurses’ Health Study. This long-running study has followed more than 100,000 female nurses since 1976, collecting detailed information about their diets, lifestyles and health.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For this analysis, the researchers focused on more than 47,000 women who were under the age of 60 in 1984. Participants completed comprehensive food frequency questionnaires in 1984 and 1986, and researchers tracked their diets and health outcomes over the next 30-plus years. By 2016, the women were between ages 70 and 93.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Just under 8% of the women qualified as healthy agers. To define “healthy aging,” the researchers looked for women who met all of the following criteria: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;They were free from 11 major chronic diseases (including cancer, heart disease, and diabetes).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;They had no significant memory or physical impairments.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;They reported good mental health. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The researchers then analyzed the associations between different types of carbohydrate intake in midlife and the odds of meeting that definition of healthy aging decades later.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-did-the-study-find"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What Did the Study Find? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The biggest takeaway was simple: quality counts when it comes to carbs and aging.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Women who ate more high-quality carbohydrates—specifically those found in whole grains, fruits, vegetables and legumes—had significantly greater odds of aging in good health. Every 10% increase in calories from these types of carbs was associated with a higher likelihood of healthy aging.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Eating more &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/287742/10-amazing-health-benefits-of-eating-more-fiber/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;fiber-rich foods&lt;/a&gt; was also linked to better outcomes. The analysis found that consuming high-quality carbohydrates from whole grains, fruits, vegetables and legumes, as well as &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/small-changes-that-helped-me-eat-more-fiber-11734788" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;higher total dietary fiber&lt;/a&gt; during midlife, was associated with a 6% to 37% higher chance of healthy aging and improvements in various aspects of mental and physical health.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Meanwhile, diets high in refined carbohydrates—those from added sugars, white bread, and other processed grains—were linked to worse outcomes. Women who ate more refined carbs had a 13% lower likelihood of aging well. Starchy vegetables like potatoes and corn were also associated with poorer aging markers, particularly when consumed in large amounts.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The researchers also examined &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/low-glycemic-diet-vs-low-carb-diet-which-is-healthier-8559250" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;glycemic index (GI) and glycemic load (GL)&lt;/a&gt;, which reflect how much and how quickly a carbohydrate-rich food raises blood sugar. A higher GI and a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/carbs-with-more-fiber-than-brown-rice-8710406" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;higher carbohydrate-to-fiber ratio&lt;/a&gt; were both associated with significantly lower odds of healthy aging. Interestingly, GL was positively associated with healthy aging, but that association weakened when fiber intake was factored in—suggesting that fiber-rich foods were driving the benefit.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Finally, the researchers looked at what would happen if certain macronutrients were replaced with high-quality carbs. Replacing refined carbohydrates, fat or animal protein with high-quality carbs resulted in a 7% to 16% increase in the odds of healthy aging.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The good news is that the “high-quality carbs” linked to healthy aging are easy to find in your local grocery store—and likely already part of your diet. And if you want to add more of them to your noshing routine, we have some recipes and recommendations to help you on that front.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You can start by choosing &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8031247/healthy-whole-grains-to-eat-more-fiber/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;whole grains&lt;/a&gt; more often. Opt for &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/grain-bowl-recipes-to-make-forever-8604226" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;brown rice, quinoa, oats, bulgur or farro&lt;/a&gt; instead of white rice or refined pasta. Recipes like our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/280144/farro-salad-with-grilled-chicken/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;Farro Salad with Grilled Chicken&lt;/a&gt; or brown rice-packed &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/7934153/chicken-spinach-rice-casserole-with-sun-dried-tomato-cream-sauce/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;Chicken, Spinach and Rice Casserole&lt;/a&gt; make whole grains as tasty as they are nutritious.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; We also know that piling on the produce is a great choice for healthy carbs. Try adding an extra serving of vegetables or fruit to each meal. &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/274447/fresh-vs-canned-vs-frozen-which-is-better/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Frozen and canned options&lt;/a&gt; (without added sugar or salt) are great, affordable choices. &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8061834/healthiest-beans-to-eat/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Adding legumes&lt;/a&gt; to your routine can help, too. &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/eat-more-beans-with-these-recipes-11709540" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;Beans, lentils and chickpeas&lt;/a&gt; are budget-friendly, fiber-packed sources of plant-based carbs and protein. They’re the stars of delicious bites like our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/marry-me-lentils-11720903" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;Marry Me Lentils&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/chickpea-sweet-potato-grain-bowls-8703855" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="5"&gt;Chickpea &amp;amp; Sweet Potato Grain Bowls&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; And making some snacking changes could help you out, too—especially if you tend to opt for more processed, refined snacks. Try switching processed favorites like crackers and chips for options like &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/brain-healthy-high-fiber-snack-recipes-8639130" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;fresh fruit, roasted chickpeas or whole grain toast&lt;/a&gt; with nut butter. These small changes can build up over time, potentially helping to preserve your mental clarity, physical strength and overall well-being well into your later years.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-the-bottom-line"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_49-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; The Bottom Line &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_50-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A new study in &lt;em&gt;JAMA Network Open &lt;/em&gt;suggests that women who eat more high-quality carbs in midlife may experience better health as they age. Women who ate more fiber-rich foods and carbs from fruits, veggies and whole grains in midlife had better odds of staying healthy, active and sharp as they got older. This study adds to growing evidence that not all carbs are created equal—especially when it comes to aging well. Choosing more whole, plant-based carbs over refined ones could be a simple yet powerful strategy to support healthy aging.

Coating bed nets in the drug cocktail is the long-term aim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Sleeping under a bed net has been one of the most successful ways of preventing malaria as the main malaria-spreading mosquitoes hunt at night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Vaccines to protect children living in high-risk malaria areas are also recommended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Nets are both a physical barrier and also contain insecticides which kill mosquitoes that land on them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But mosquitoes have become resistant to insecticide in many countries so the chemicals no longer kill the insects as effectively as they used to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"We haven't really tried to directly kill parasites in the mosquito before this, because we were just killing the mosquito," says researcher Dr Alexandra Probst, from Harvard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;However, she says that approach is "no longer cutting it".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The researchers analysed malaria's DNA to find possible weak spots while it is infecting mosquitoes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;They took a large library of potential drugs and narrowed it down to a shortlist of 22. These were tested when female mosquitoes were given a blood-meal contaminated with malaria. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09039-2" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;In their article in Nature&lt;/a&gt;, the scientists describe two highly effective drugs that killed 100% of the parasites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The drugs were tested on material similar to bed nets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"Even if that mosquito survives contact with the bed net, the parasites within are killed and so it's still not transmitting malaria," said Dr Probst.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"I think this is a really exciting approach, because it's a totally new way of targeting mosquitoes themselves."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;She says the malaria parasite is less likely to become resistant to the drugs as there are billions of them in each infected person, but less than five in each mosquito. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The effect of the drugs lasts for a year on the nets, potentially making it a cheap and long-lasting alternative to insecticide, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;This approach has been proven in the laboratory. The next stage is already planned in Ethiopia to see if the anti-malarial bed nets are effective in the real world.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;It will take at least six years before all the studies are completed to know if this approach will work. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But the vision is to have bed nets treated with both anti-malaria drugs and insecticide so that if one approach doesn't work, then the other will. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 May 2025 23:10:41 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWkFVX3lxTE8ya2U1TUJKeHFRYUI1dEdjdThLY05lU045dDRZOHU5RjlGR1dIWGxpTVNMV1Y2elNMN0J0Ukp5ejdCWUNHU1htN0tpYlZGRmNyTVdiUVE3SEZTd9IBX0FVX3lxTE5vOXY1R1VzeHBzYXhrLXlSdHB5WTdFdGI0b2VJazFmM0xsUlN0c1ZKT0J5VVdMYUxXaGhzT1pITm9oaTRSQkhZQVNUOHFZUDJLMHI1RDZrSDhGQlNEekpF</guid></item><item><title>呼吁NHS为乳房密集的女性提供额外的癌症扫描- BBC | Call for NHS to give women with dense breasts extra cancer scans - BBC</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWkFVX3lxTE9ma3BheDJhRzBTZ1NxTmZIRklCRDZia0pKTlFMU2tId3piWVdLQThlU0ZoNDVfdEQ2RUo1bVRDcjdTeUxsSmE3WE01VVpIWHdSVTRkaVhrZHlxZ9IBX0FVX3lxTE92M1BzbTlhQkJCc0dDWTg0WEFYeUZsc1NKbHdyNTgweVhvQ0lXZDFVZmswSURKX2VFd3pGOTA2OUFETzdUZnZtandfcFI1YXFIeW9ZdVRwYVBhZ2Qtb3Jv?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article&gt;&lt;p data-component="headline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH"&gt;&lt;h1 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 dfvxux"&gt;Call for NHS to give women with dense breasts extra cancer scans&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 kVRMhO"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="hero-image" class="sc-4abb68ca-1 eOgpjw"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250508-105310-2a3fc0651-web-2.21.1-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-4abb68ca-0 itgEAh hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/5c4b/live/8fb5b0c0-3653-11f0-8555-1116719b8bf6.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/5c4b/live/8fb5b0c0-3653-11f0-8555-1116719b8bf6.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/5c4b/live/8fb5b0c0-3653-11f0-8555-1116719b8bf6.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/5c4b/live/8fb5b0c0-3653-11f0-8555-1116719b8bf6.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/5c4b/live/8fb5b0c0-3653-11f0-8555-1116719b8bf6.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/5c4b/live/8fb5b0c0-3653-11f0-8555-1116719b8bf6.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/5c4b/live/8fb5b0c0-3653-11f0-8555-1116719b8bf6.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/5c4b/live/8fb5b0c0-3653-11f0-8555-1116719b8bf6.jpg.webp" loading="eager" alt="Getty Images A woman goes for a mammogram.

One of these processes is maintaining a healthy pH, which is the balance between acid and base. The pH scale runs from 0 to 14, with 7 being neutral—anything below 7 is acidic, and anything above it is basic or alkaline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;For example, stomach (hydrochloric) acid needs to be very acidic for proper digestion. It ranks at about a 1, just above battery acid, but your blood pH should be at a neutral 7. And our bodies have amazing built-in mechanisms for regulating and maintaining blood pH. For example, if your body senses excessive levels of acid, your lungs and kidneys go to work to remedy the situation by expelling carbon dioxide through breathing and urinating. Or the pancreas will secrete bicarbonate, a compound that helps buffer acid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;While the body is designed to adjust to its environment to bring it back to center, there are some questions as to whether too much of certain foods might play a role in creating a more acidic environment, especially in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. This then lends to questioning whether a more acidic GI tract increases the risk of GI cancers, including liver, colorectal, gastric (stomach), pancreatic and esophageal cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Researchers in Korea observed that there is some evidence that people who eat a Western-style diet—one high in fat and sugar—create a more acidic environment in their bodies that is favorable for malignant cell growth. They took a closer look at this theory and recently published their findings in the &lt;em&gt;European Journal of Clinical Nutrition&lt;/em&gt;. Let’s break them down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/2059033/best-and-worst-foods-to-eat-for-gut-health/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Best Foods to Eat for Gut Health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Best Foods to Eat for Gut Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;How Was This Study Conducted?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Data was drawn from a long-term Korean study called the Cancer Screenee Cohort, which began in 2002. Almost 11,000 participants were used for this current study, about 64% of them female, with an average age at baseline of 53. Participants were followed on average for eight years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Participants had completed food frequency questionnaires, from which researchers calculated “dietary acid loads” using three different methods. Researchers determined the number of GI cancer cases using the 2020 Korea National Cancer Incidence Database, which records most instances of cancer in the country. In addition, they checked electronic medical records to catch any cases that might not have been recorded in the cancer incidence database.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Demographic information that would be adjusted for during statistical analyses included BMI (which was measured by trained staff), physical activity levels, education level, occupation, marital status, first-degree family history of cancer, smoking status and alcohol intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;What Did This Study Find?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Overall, researchers found that individuals who were diagnosed with GI cancer tended to have a more acidogenic diet than those without GI cancer. And as the dietary acid load score increased, so did the risk of GI cancer. This association was much stronger in males compared to females. For this study, researchers note red and processed meats as being the primary acidic foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Researchers aren’t sure why male participants had a higher risk of GI cancers than female participants, even when dietary acid load scores were similar, but offer a few possible explanations. First, they state that females tend to have better kidney function than males, thereby giving females a greater capacity for acid-base balance maintenance. They also state that there could be sex hormones involved, since estrogen tends to have a protective effect at the cellular level—which then raises the question for post-menopausal women. Lastly, in this analysis, the males tended to have higher acidic diets, including higher alcohol intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;It’s important to note a few limitations of this study. First, this study cannot determine causation. In other words, it cannot conclude that more acidic foods, which include red and processed meats, cause GI cancer. It can only suggest a strong association between the two. There may be other factors at work, as well, such as genetics or smoking and high alcohol intake, though these were adjusted for in the analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Researchers also note that they could not take supplement use into consideration as a confounder since there wasn’t enough information on that (certain supplements may raise or lower acid load). Finally, they note that the study population was relatively small, which may have reduced the statistical power of the analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/search?q=red+meat" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:https://www.eatingwell.com/search?q=red+meat;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;https://www.eatingwell.com/search?q=red+meat&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;How Does This Apply to Real Life?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;You’ve probably seen ads for &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7961286/what-is-alkaline-water-and-is-it-healthy-heres-what-dietitians-have-to-say/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:alkaline water;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;alkaline water&lt;/a&gt;, thanks to companies jumping on the idea that we can control the acid-base balance in our bodies. And though this study would certainly lean that direction, there is still so much we don’t yet know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;While our bodies are designed to constantly work to maintain internal stability, is it possible that they can go into acid overload from certain foods that end up hijacking the body’s biological systems? There is evidence that suggests yes, but don’t go investing in expensive bottled water just yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;These researchers suggest a simpler swap—red and processed meats for fruits and veggies, which tend to be more alkaline. Exceptions include citrus fruits and tomatoes, which rank from 2 and 4 on the pH scale. But this doesn’t mean you shouldn’t eat them. Citrus fruits and tomatoes offer loads of nutrition and health benefits, including immune support and antioxidants that calm inflammation. &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/fruits-to-lower-colon-cancer-risk-11716524" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Citrus fruits;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Citrus fruits&lt;/a&gt; are even connected with a lower rate of colon cancer—which raises the question about whether it’s really the acid load or something else about red and processed meats that might increase the GI cancer risk, since citrus fruits are more acidic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The key is to eat a variety of foods, including different types of plants—fruits, veggies, nuts, seeds, whole grains and legumes. This ensures you not only get the nutrients your body needs, but it also spreads out the pH levels among the plants you’re eating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Do a quick assessment of your eating pattern. Are you including a lot of red and processed meats? How about foods and beverages with high levels of added sugar? Where can you start rotating in more plants?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Eating habits, like other habits, are pathways in our brains. These pathways were forged somewhere in your past and became automatic. To start new habits, you need to make purposeful, intentional choices because otherwise, your brain will automatically choose the path of least resistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/sleep-and-longevity-8430567" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The #1 Habit You Should Start to Live Longer, According to Health Experts;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;The #1 Habit You Should Start to Live Longer, According to Health Experts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Habit change tends to be easier for people if they start small. Choose an area you’re likely to have success with, so that you can build on that success over time. For example, could you exchange one of your daily sodas or energy drinks for a flavored sparkling water (so you’re still getting the bubbles)? If you typically have that beverage for a mid-afternoon energy boost, could you instead have an energizing snack—like a handful of nuts and a piece of fruit—to accomplish the same thing? Or sometimes we just need to change our physiology for an energy boost, in which case, taking a quick break from your desk and walking a lap or two around your house or office space might do the trick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;These researchers also mention the Mediterranean diet as an eating pattern characterized by high fruit and vegetable intake and low or moderate meat intake. Because of this, the Mediterranean diet is associated with high levels of adiponectin, a compound known for its protective role against cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;If you’re ready to dive in and work on changing your overall eating pattern, we’ve got plenty of Mediterranean diet meal plans and recipes to choose from.

&lt;p class="block"&gt;According to the Sachem School District, 116 students and seven staff members were identified as having had prolonged contact with the infected student, and were offered tests on Monday at the school’s East Campus. Individuals who were tested received TB skin testing administered by the Suffolk County Health Department. Results from those tests typically take 48 hours to process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;So far, there have been no additional cases confirmed within the school community, but the investigation is ongoing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;Concerned parents are demanding more information and greater transparency from school and health officials. “What’s being done to ensure the safety of the kids when we, as parents or guardians, send them to school?” asked Janie Gallo, a Farmingville resident and parent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;Tuberculosis is a potentially serious bacterial infection that typically affects the lungs. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says TB spreads through the air when a person with active TB disease coughs, sneezes or talks. Symptoms may include a persistent cough, chest pain, fatigue and fever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;As of now, the New York State Department of Health reports there have been 16 confirmed TB cases in Suffolk County and 18 in neighboring Nassau County this year — numbers that are consistent with last year’s data for the same time period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;Health officials say those initially tested this week will need to undergo another round of testing in July, once the standard two-month TB incubation period has passed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>News 12 - Long Island</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 May 2025 22:07:30 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiwwFBVV95cUxOQ0VwbXBmQ0RXMC1kdUQ2TG91RzhSZk1XLU95REticnd1ZFc1ZThBNGlVSEN1RDFFNHRQOTdtYU1nOG96aXBzUXRoVEFlYzVjWEVHa2tUc3hnSHB2cGxWZDVZWU9lTHJjMExZcVZLTnpJVDZkRDlITGxfSl9FbWpmMmNrTFUwcFRCZkZUbkd0YjVOdkdLNE1JYzBPQlhzLWVlS1Y5Wm5nQWVoMDFsdGxlWnIxVkhtVVhfcThzbnM1eUFWMU0</guid></item><item><title>美国医学存在信任问题- BBC | American medicine has a trust problem - BBC</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqgFBVV95cUxOckdPU1cyRG1sWG93SXVrYnBmRG4tRUNqUWR2QlE5cmducUEzTDFtM0xTcktMa3BBblJDX21oZnc5NVVJZS1LOFdVei1PUUJuaFJwTC00S09vUUFMekFwYkp2Z0dEd2VpZDFJMENJSWUzUUZrY3BlbWN1MXpHMmUtQUZJc0t0R2pYOXR1UWJaSGVmelA5R3BaYjFNZ3dRcjE2MTFxSHhtMWx0dw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article&gt;&lt;p data-component="headline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH"&gt;&lt;h1 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 dfvxux"&gt;American medicine has a trust problem&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 kVRMhO"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="hero-image" class="sc-4abb68ca-1 eOgpjw"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250508-105310-2a3fc0651-web-2.21.1-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-4abb68ca-0 itgEAh hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0lchghr.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0lchghr.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0lchghr.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0lchghr.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0lchghr.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0lchghr.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0lchghr.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0lchghr.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0lchghr.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0lchghr.jpg.webp" loading="eager" alt="BBC BBC Special Correspondent Katty Kay is shown speaking to Dr Leana Wen via video call.

There's the anti-vaccine community, who often distrust both America's health agencies and the big pharmaceutical companies.

We are already seeing the single &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c984vjl0gp2o" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;largest measles outbreak in the US&lt;/a&gt; in the last 30 years. Measles has &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/history.html" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;been eliminated&lt;/a&gt; since 2000, but the US could lose its measles elimination status. We are seeing rising cases of things like whooping cough. If vaccination rates for other diseases fall, we could also see a return of rubella and &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20240229-why-dont-some-countries-vaccinate-against-chickenpox" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;chickenpox&lt;/a&gt; and even polio – things that would really have been unthinkable just several years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But if you have such distrust over vaccines, that also means that there's a distrust of authority, of science, of the scientific method, of what counts as science and how one does research. And that could have negative impacts on many other aspects of health, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;&lt;b id="kk:" class="sc-d16436d-0 jpoiOL"&gt;KK: &lt;/b&gt;Are there things that work for pulling people back into a position where they might have mistrusted medical authorities, but they can then say, 'OK, yes, I can trust authority. I can trust what science is telling me?'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;&lt;b id="lw:" class="sc-d16436d-0 jpoiOL"&gt;LW: &lt;/b&gt;The core aspect of being a physician is the one-on-one conversation with our patients, and it's in those one-on-one conversations that we see a lot of change, because we never approach these conversations with the assumption that 'I'm right and you're wrong' or that you must have listened to all these &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200522-what-we-can-learn-from-conspiracy-theories" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;conspiracy theories&lt;/a&gt;. We come to those conversations asking people what their thoughts are, what they have heard, why they believe one thing or another – and then we meet them where they are in those conversations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Often, that means that we have to overlook their opposition to vaccines, because we don't want to push them away so much. Then, they're now not willing to get treatment for their high blood pressure and diabetes, and then may go out and have a stroke. So, I think part of building that trust actually is knowing when to make the case and when not to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="quote-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-2b8ea91d-0 bgzaEJ"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-2b8ea91d-2 dYxeIv"&gt;It's not an option to get frustrated – Leana Wen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;&lt;b id="kk:" class="sc-d16436d-0 jpoiOL"&gt;KK: &lt;/b&gt;If you were talking to parents of a young child who didn't want to get their child vaccinated against measles, [who are] afraid of measles vaccine and what it might do to their child, what would you say to them, doctor?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;&lt;b id="lw:" class="sc-d16436d-0 jpoiOL"&gt;LW: &lt;/b&gt;I think I would start by asking them some more questions about what it is that they are afraid of. Are they afraid of all vaccines, or are they just afraid of this one? What exactly is the concern?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;On the other hand, if what they're concerned about is all vaccines, because they don't believe that measles is that serious, then I would point to the reality about measles: that yes, it's true that most people who get measles will have a mild case of it, but &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/index.html" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;one in five will have pneumonia&lt;/a&gt;. One in 20 will end up being hospitalised. One to three out of a thousand children with measles &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nfid.org/resource/frequently-asked-questions-about-measles/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;will die&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;So, I think it really depends on what those specific concerns are. But ultimately, the message is very straightforward: Vaccines are safe. They're effective. They're life-saving. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;&lt;b id="kk:" class="sc-d16436d-0 jpoiOL"&gt;KK: &lt;/b&gt;Do you think, in the environment we're living in, that it is sometimes impossible to persuade people because it's almost tribal? As somebody who is a scientist and a doctor, how personally frustrating is that?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;&lt;b id="lw:" class="sc-d16436d-0 jpoiOL"&gt;LW: &lt;/b&gt;I think back to what the individual conversations with patients will look like, because it's not an option to get frustrated. And you could say, 'OK, we're not going to touch this subject for the time being, because we're not going to make headway'. And again, I don't want to drive you, the patient, away from all the other recommendations that are important for your health. If you don't see me as the doctor, maybe you'll go to somebody else who will take offense to what you're saying about vaccines and then you won't get any medical treatment. That's not a good outcome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;I think it is reasonable to put aside certain differences and maybe try to approach it later and focus on areas of common ground. But I think that most of all, it's really important to not approach the individual who you don't agree with with scorn or scepticism or anger, because that's only going to elicit a defensive reaction. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;&lt;b id="kk:" class="sc-d16436d-0 jpoiOL"&gt;KK:&lt;/b&gt; In April, after two small children &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/texas-announces-second-death-measles-outbreak" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;died of measles&lt;/a&gt;, Health [and Human Services] Secretary Robert F Kennedy &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c99n18zlzg3o" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;endorsed the MMR vaccine&lt;/a&gt;, which prevents measles. He then got attacked online from people who are in the anti-vax camp who were very disappointed that he had come out and endorsed the vaccine. A day later, he posted a photograph of himself with a couple of doctors who are opposed to vaccines, to the MMR vaccines. And he called them extraordinary healers. And he also promoted some unproven treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;So, I'm quite confused about where the health secretary stands on vaccines. And I imagine if my kids were still young and I was at the stage where I was having to look at getting them vaccinated, I, as a parent, might be quite confused, as well. Are you clear about where the health secretary stands, particularly on the measles vaccine, given the outbreak of measles in the country at the moment? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;&lt;b id="lw:" class="sc-d16436d-0 jpoiOL"&gt;LW: &lt;/b&gt;Yes, I am very clear on where RFK Jr stands, although I think that your interpretation of it is very fair and also very correct. You are confused because he intends for it to be confusing, because he is trying to speak to two very, very different constituencies who have completely opposing goals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;On the one hand, RFK Jr is a well-known vaccine conspiracy theorist who, for dozens of years, founded and ran an &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0mzk2y41zvo" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;anti-vaccine organisation&lt;/a&gt;. He's seen as a champion by people who head up the anti-vaccine movements themselves. So, that is a core constituency that got him into this role and he has to placate them. So, he's said many things that are very harmful and untrue. Playing down, for example, the seriousness of the measles infection, talking about treatments that are not treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;To be clear, there is no specific antiviral that will cure measles. So, he talks about steroids and antibiotics and things that are not treatments for measles. In a way, that also plays down the seriousness of the disease – people mistakenly think that there is a treatment that there is not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;At the same time, he continues to spread doubt about the safety and effectiveness of the MMR vaccine. He has said in recent weeks that it causes just as much illness as measles itself. He has continued to promote the debunked allegation that the MMR vaccine is tied to autism. He's &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crkx3egk3ygo" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;announced research&lt;/a&gt; to study this conspiracy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;So, he's currently walking this line between trying to appease the anti-vaccine camp and trying to appease some people, including moderate Republicans, who are trying to get him to say things like, 'Well, the measles vaccine is a good thing'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;So, he's trying to say both of these things and that's why it comes out sounding confused, because that's, in fact, how he intends it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;&lt;i id='[in-a-statement-to-the-bbc,-vianca-n.-rodriguez-feliciano,-press-secretary-at-the-us-department-of-health-and-human-services,-said-that-the-department-is-committed-to-building-public-trust-in-science-and,-specifically,-"secretary-kennedy-is-not-anti-vaccine-–-he-is-pro-safety,-pro-transparency,-and-pro-accountability".' class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt;[In a statement to the BBC, Vianca N.

Can we be deploying &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/innovation/artificial-intelligence" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;artificial intelligence&lt;/a&gt; in a more thoughtful way?

Telomeres are protective caps on chromosomes that shorten with age and are associated with chronic diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over four years, those who took vitamin D experienced significantly less telomere shortening, equivalent to nearly three years of delayed aging, compared to those who took a placebo. These findings support vitamin D as a promising intervention to reduce age-related cellular decline, though more research is needed to confirm long-term benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anti-Aging Effect:&lt;/strong&gt; Vitamin D3 supplementation slowed telomere shortening over 4 years.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cellular Protection:&lt;/strong&gt; Participants retained the equivalent of 3 extra years of telomere health.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No Effect from Omega-3s:&lt;/strong&gt; Omega-3 supplementation did not significantly impact telomere length.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Mass General&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results from the VITAL randomized controlled trial reveal that vitamin D supplementation helps maintain telomeres, protective caps at the ends of chromosomes that shorten during aging and are linked to the development of certain diseases. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new report, which is published in &lt;em&gt;The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition&lt;/em&gt;, is based on data from a VITAL sub-study co-led by researchers at Mass General Brigham and the Medical College of Georgia, and supports a promising role in slowing a pathway for biological aging. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“VITAL is the first large-scale and long-term randomized trial to show that vitamin D supplements protect telomeres and preserve telomere length,” said co-author JoAnn Manson, MD, principal investigator of VITAL and chief of the Division of Preventive Medicine at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, a founding member of the Mass General Brigham healthcare system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is of particular interest because VITAL had also shown benefits of vitamin D in reducing inflammation and lowering risks of selected chronic diseases of aging, such as advanced cancer and autoimmune disease.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Telomeres are made of repeating sequences of DNA, or base pairs, that prevent chromosome ends from degrading or fusing with other chromosomes. Telomere shortening is a natural part of aging and is associated with an increased risk of various age-related diseases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few short-term, small-scale studies have suggested that vitamin D or omega 3 fatty acid supplementation may help support telomeres, but results have been inconsistent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;VITAL is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of vitamin D3 (2,000 IU/day) and omega 3 fatty acid (1 g/day) supplementation that tracked U.S. females aged 55 years and older and males aged 50 years and older for five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The VITAL Telomere sub-study included 1,054 of these participants, whose telomere length in white blood cells was assessed at baseline and at Year 2 and Year 4.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compared with taking placebo, taking vitamin D3 supplements significantly reduced telomere shortening over four years, preventing the equivalent of nearly three years of aging compared with placebo. Omega 3 fatty acid supplementation had no significant effect on telomere length throughout follow-up. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; “Our findings suggest that targeted vitamin D supplementation may be a promising strategy to counter a biological aging process, although further research is warranted,” said Haidong Zhu, PhD, first author of the report and a molecular geneticist at the Medical College of Georgia, Augusta University. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Authorship:&lt;/strong&gt; In addition to Manson, Mass General Brigham authors include Nancy R.

We hypothesized that vitamin D or n-3 FAs supplementation reduce leukocyte telomere length (LTL) attrition overtime by leveraging the VITamin D and OmegA-3 TriaL (VITAL) trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="sectitle0020"&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;VITAL is a large, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with a 2 x 2 factorial design of vitamin D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (2,000 IU/day) and marine n-3 FAs (1 g/day) supplements for 5 years among a representative sample of 25,871 US females ≥55 and males ≥50 years of age. The VITAL Telomere study (NCT04386577) included 1054 participants who were evaluated in person at the Harvard Clinical and Translational Science Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LTL was determined by the Absolute Human Telomere Length Quantification quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) method at baseline, Year 2, and Year 4. The pre-specified primary outcome measures were changes in LTL between baseline, Year 2 and Year 4. Analyses of intervention effect used mixed-effects linear regression models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="sectitle0025"&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;LTL was measured in a total of 2,571 samples from the 1031 participants at baseline, year 2, and year 4. Compared to placebo, vitamin D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; supplementation significantly decreased LTL attrition by 0.14 kilo base pairs (kb) (0.01, 0.27) over 4 years (p = 0.039).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall trend analysis showed that the vitamin D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; supplementation group had LTLs that were about 0.035 kb higher per year of follow-up compared to placebo group (0.002, 0.07, p=0.037).

These uniquely human folds appear to bring critical brain regions closer together, enhancing communication and cognitive function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an fMRI study, deeper tertiary sulci in the lateral prefrontal and parietal cortices were linked to stronger connections and better reasoning performance. The findings suggest that sulcal depth could serve as a potential biomarker for cognitive development or neurodevelopmental disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tertiary Sulci Role:&lt;/strong&gt; These small, late-developing brain folds are connected to reasoning ability.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enhanced Connectivity:&lt;/strong&gt; Deeper sulci may bring brain regions closer, boosting neural efficiency.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Developmental Marker:&lt;/strong&gt; Sulcal structure could help identify individual differences in cognition.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;UC Berkeley&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Many grooves and dimples on the surface of the brain are unique to humans, but they’re often dismissed as an uninteresting consequence of packing an unusually large brain into a too-small skull.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But neuroscientists are finding that these folds are not mere artifacts, like the puffy folds you get when forcing a sleeping bag into a stuff sack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The depths of some of the smallest of these grooves seem to be linked to increased interconnectedness in the brain and better reasoning ability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-110249"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/reasoning-neurodevelopment-sulci-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/reasoning-neurodevelopment-sulci-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/reasoning-neurodevelopment-sulci-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/reasoning-neurodevelopment-sulci-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/reasoning-neurodevelopment-sulci-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/reasoning-neurodevelopment-sulci-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/reasoning-neurodevelopment-sulci-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/reasoning-neurodevelopment-sulci-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/reasoning-neurodevelopment-sulci-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/reasoning-neurodevelopment-sulci-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/reasoning-neurodevelopment-sulci-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/reasoning-neurodevelopment-sulci-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/reasoning-neurodevelopment-sulci-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/reasoning-neurodevelopment-sulci-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/reasoning-neurodevelopment-sulci-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Weiner’s lab is creating a computer program to help researchers identify tertiary sulci in the human brain. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a study published May 19 in &lt;em&gt;The Journal of Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;, University of California, Berkeley, researchers show that in children and adolescents, the depths of some small grooves are correlated with increased connectivity between regions of the brain — the lateral prefrontal cortex and lateral parietal cortex — involved in reasoning and other high-level cognitive functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The grooves may actually bring those areas closer together in space, shortening the connections between them and speeding communications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The implication, the researchers say, is that variability in these small grooves, which are called tertiary sulci (pronounced sul’-sigh), may help explain individual differences in cognitive performance, and could serve as diagnostic indicators or biomarkers of reasoning ability or neurodevelopmental disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The impetus for this study was having seen that sulcal depth correlated with reasoning across children and adolescents,” said Silvia Bunge, professor of psychology and a member of UC Berkeley’s Helen Wills Neuroscience Institute (HWNI).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Given our previous findings, our former postdoctoral fellow Suvi Häkkinen aimed to test if sulcal depth was correlated with reasoning performance and to test if patterns of coordinated activity within a lateral prefrontal-parietal network could explain this relation between sulcal depth and reasoning.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We had explicit predictions about which tertiary sulci in the lateral prefrontal cortex would be functionally connected to tertiary sulci in the lateral parietal cortex, and that panned out,” added Kevin Weiner, UC Berkeley associate professor of psychology and of neuroscience and a member of HWNI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Prefrontal and parietal cortices aside, the hypothesis is that the formation of sulci leads to shortened distances between connected brain regions, which could lead to increased neural efficiency, and then, in turn, individual differences in improved cognition with translational applications.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The cortex is sort of haphazardly crunched up into the brain — that’s what I was always taught,” Bunge said. “Kevin came along and changed my mind about sulci.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The hills and valleys of the brain&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The brains of most animals, mammals included, have smooth surfaces. Primates have hills and valleys covering their cerebral cortex. While one group of primates, the New World monkeys called marmosets, have shallow, barely perceptible sulci, those of humans are deeply incised, with between 60% and 70% of the cortex buried in these folds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cortical folding patterns in humans also change with age, establishing their final structure late in prenatal development while becoming less prominent in old age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While sulci can change over development, getting deeper or shallower and developing thinner or thicker gray matter — probably in ways that depend on experience — our particular configuration of sulci is a stable individual difference: their size, shape, location and even, for a few sulci, whether they’re present or absent,” said Bunge, who studies abstract reasoning in young people, from 6 years of age through young adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The smallest grooves, many of which are uniquely human, are called tertiary sulci because they appear last in prenatal development and are never as deep as the major or primary sulci that are most evident on the cerebral surface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists have speculated that the tertiary sulci emerge in parts of the human brain that have expanded the most throughout evolution and have a protracted development, and that they are likely associated with aspects of cognition — reasoning, decision-making, planning and self-control — that develop over a protracted adolescence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But prior to this study, evidence was lacking for a connection between tertiary sulci and brain connectivity. The UC Berkeley study is one of few, all within the past few years, to provide such proof.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sulci linked to cognition&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weiner and Bunge said that, as undergraduates, they were never taught how to define tertiary sulci; they often examined scans of average brains that did not match any specific individual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weiner noticed this mismatch as an undergraduate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“At the time, all I knew was that I had some cortical squiggles that weren’t in the average brain atlases that we had in the lab. So the question I asked my mentors, Sabine Kastner and Charlie Gross, was: Do I have different structures that aren’t in our atlases or are structures missing from these atlases?” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That sent me down a 15-year rabbit hole studying one particular tertiary sulcus in the visual cortex.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That work showed that a specific sulcus, the mid-fusiform sulcus, varied in length from as small as 3 millimeters to as long as 7 centimeters in any given person. Moreover, the longer the sulcus, the better a person was at processing and recognizing human faces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“About 2% of individuals have developmental prosopagnosia, which means they can’t perceive faces, and they don’t have any brain damage,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That sulcus, especially in the right hemisphere, is shorter and shallower in those folks than in what we refer to as neurotypical controls.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Building on that rabbit hole, Bunge and Weiner wondered whether tertiary sulci in other regions of the brain, outside the visual processing units, also correlated with cognitive ability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Upon moving to UC Berkeley in 2018, Weiner began investigating the prefrontal cortex — located in the front of the brain behind the forehead — in collaboration with Bunge, who wanted to test whether sulci in this area would be linked to reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a 2021 paper, the two collaborated to define all the smaller sulci in the lateral prefrontal cortex and created a computer model that identified the tertiary sulci as contributing the most variation in reasoning ability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The model identified that there’s tertiary sulci in the lateral prefrontal cortex that are contributing to reasoning skills in kids,” Weiner said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Expanding on that work in the new study, Weiner, Bunge and their colleagues painstakingly catalogued the tertiary sulci in the lateral parietal cortex, located under and just behind the crown of the skull, and investigated its functional connections with the sulci of the lateral prefrontal cortex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For both studies, they studied 43 participants, 20 of them female, who ranged in age from 7 to 18. While in a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanner, the participants were given a reasoning task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers focused on the brain activity in 21 sulci they had identified in each hemisphere of the brain, and the functional connections between these sulci — including, for the first time, tertiary sulci.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across these individuals, greater depth for several of the sulci implicated in reasoning was associated with higher network centrality across the set of prefrontal and parietal sulci.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Experience affects sulci&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bunge pointed out that the association between depths of sulci and reasoning does not hold for all sulci, and that sulcal depth may change with experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Do we think that an individual’s capacity for reasoning is set in stone based on their cortical folding? No!,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Cognitive function depends on variability in a variety of anatomical and functional features and, importantly, we know that experience, like quality of schooling, plays a powerful role in shaping an individual’s cognitive trajectory, and that it is malleable, even in adulthood.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weiner’s lab is creating a computer program to help researchers identify tertiary sulci in the human brain. Most programs only identify about 35 sulci, but when tertiary sulci are included, there are over 100, he said, including new ones that their labs have uncovered together. They argue that sulci could serve as landmarks to compare brains between individuals, since brains vary so much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Dozens of brain maps have been proposed in just the last five years, but they disagree about the areas of associated regions in the cortex, and there are mismatches between areas at the group and individual level,” Weiner said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Examining network architecture based on individual sulcal morphology circumvents these disagreements and mismatches, with the opportunity to glean network-level insight from the local sulcal anatomy that is specific to a given individual.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aside from Bunge and Weiner, other UC Berkeley co-authors of the paper are former postdoctoral fellow Suvi Häkkinen, former graduate student Willa Voorhies, former undergraduates Ethan Willbrand and Jewelia Yao, and former visiting scholars Yi-Heng Tsai and Thomas Gagnant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;The work was supported by the National Institutes of Health through grants from the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (R21HD100858) and the National Institute of Mental Health (R01MH133637), and the National Science Foundation (CAREER Award 2042251).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this neuroscience and neurodevelopment research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#bac8d6c9dbd4dedfc8c9fad8dfc8d1dfd6dfc394dfdecf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Robert Sanders&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://berkeley.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;UC Berkeley&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Robert Sanders – UC Berkeley&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0726-24.2025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Anchoring functional connectivity to individual sulcal morphology yields insights in a pediatric study of reasoning&lt;/a&gt;” by Silvia Bunge et al. &lt;em&gt;Journal of Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anchoring functional connectivity to individual sulcal morphology yields insights in a pediatric study of reasoning&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A salient neuroanatomical feature of the human brain is its pronounced cortical folding, and there is mounting evidence that sulcal morphology is relevant to functional brain architecture and cognition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, our understanding of the relationships between sulcal anatomy, brain activity, and behavior is still in its infancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We previously found that the depth of three small, shallow sulci in lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) was linked to reasoning performance during development (Voorhies et al., 2021).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings beg the question: what is the linking mechanism between sulcal morphology and cognition?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, we investigated functional connectivity among sulci in LPFC and lateral parietal cortex (LPC) in participants from the same sample as our previous study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We leveraged manual parcellations (21 sulci/hemisphere, total of 1806) and functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) data from a reasoning task from 43 participants aged 7–18 years (20 female). We conducted clustering and classification analyses of individual-level functional connectivity among sulci.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Broadly, we found that 1) the connectivity patterns of individual sulci could be differentiated – and more accurately than rotated sulcal labels equated for size and shape; 2) sulcal connectivity did not consistently correspond with that of probabilistic labels or large-scale networks; 3) sulci clustered together into groups with similar patterns, not dictated by spatial proximity; and 4) across individuals, greater depth was associated with higher network centrality for several sulci under investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results illustrate how sulcal morphology can be relevant for functional connectivity, and provide proof of concept that using sulci to define an individual coordinate space for functional connectomes is a promising future direction.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 May 2025 21:38:40 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibEFVX3lxTE02dlhmYi1qNFpydTRBR3hNczhvWUx4WHJCLTdxS3RBVVE0SWV4akdiQkxnRnlqZFlrWmlaRHUtREVBa1V0WGpRN0NCSUJWSEd5bnF2WkluTHRCaW5Cd0JnYms2YTAyZVRNZVpIMA</guid></item><item><title>这种形式的中年痴呆症经常被误认为是抑郁症。现在，医生终于有了答案- AOL.com | This Form Of Midlife Dementia Is Often Mistaken For Depression.

The researchers compared those proteins to ones from 39 of the patients’ healthy relatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers discovered that patients with frontotemporal dementia had changes in the proteins that suggest they have problems with RNA regulation, which is required for the correct gene expression in the brain. (Gene expression can impact how your brain works.) These patients also had certain changes that impacted connections in their brains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These proteins could be the first markers for frontotemporal dementia that surface when people develop the disease, according to the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why are these proteins so important&lt;/strong&gt;?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a few reasons. First, "frontotemporal dementia can be caused by several very different types of brain pathology, making it very difficult to provide an accurate diagnosis to patients,” explains &lt;a href="https://memory.ucsf.edu/people/rowan-saloner" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Rowan Saloner;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Rowan Saloner&lt;/a&gt;, PhD, study co-author and professor in the UC San Francisco Memory and Aging Center. “Right now, we have no way to tell which pathology someone has while they’re alive, especially in non-inherited cases, which make up the majority of frontotemporal dementia.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But by IDing changes in spinal fluid protein, doctors can detect the disease and track its progression. “That will hopefully lead to more accurate diagnoses and personalized treatments,” Saloner says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s crucial, given that this form of dementia tends to be missed early on, says &lt;a href="https://www.providence.org/doctors/profile/203880-clifford-segil" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Clifford Segil,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Clifford Segil,&lt;/a&gt; DO, a neurologist at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, CA. But genetic testing could help give patients and their doctors a better sense of what might be behind their symptoms, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One thing to keep in mind: This study focused on people with an inherited or genetic form of frontotemporal dementia. “We do not know if genetic frontotemporal dementia and sporadic frontotemporal dementia just look the same in the end but have different paths to development,” says &lt;a href="https://neurology.msu.edu/directory/amit-sachdev" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Amit Sachdev,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Amit Sachdev,&lt;/a&gt; MD, MS, is the medical director in the Department of Neurology at Michigan State University. “If they have different paths, then this study has helped us learn about genetic frontotemporal dementia. That is useful but not as broadly applicable.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What else do we know about early-onset dementia?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early-onset dementias like frontotemporal dementia usually impact people in their 40s or 50s, Saloner says. “They can be difficult to diagnose, as early symptoms are often misattributed to stress or psychiatric disorders,” he says. “Compared to Alzheimer’s disease, which now has biomarkers and FDA-approved treatments, frontotemporal dementia remains behind.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Segil says that early-onset dementia should be considered “if someone loses the ability to talk or express themselves and other neurological conditions like a stroke, seizure, or infection have been ruled out.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, Sachdev says that more information is better with the disease. “It is important to know as much as possible about how these diseases arise,” he says. “It gives us something to work from in everyone else.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 May 2025 21:27:17 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMie0FVX3lxTE5EQ1ByUkx0dnhDemloUmlDb0lRVk9HdllIejVtWVdLYmpveWtiRDhWZ1A1ZXc3T3BYNDJTMEtqNnA5MXFMVi1wcUcwUkxIejZvLUYyRDJPTzNVRDROREs2V3U5OUpRdGVnUm1sTGMxZW5FQWZ6UHQyYkRiMA</guid></item><item><title>“我是一名肿瘤学家，这是我为预防癌症而在每顿饭中添加的食物” -雅虎 | 'I'm an Oncologist and This Is the Food I Add to Every Meal for Cancer Prevention' - Yahoo</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigAFBVV95cUxPcUxMRTdPY3F2dVpxSUtaYWY2Q3VLWVBsa1Q0YVRPRzV5LTJNLXRWdk40QVlQRFA4QXZYRlVWTTRqVjJVREIxeWdqYUJTMmlZZkVVSjlvSVhmSjVvWmRfbVJHZ0JpU3E4RXdoS1RMdWZDZzd5R3FOd2NHWkRZS05PQg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="" data-article-body="true"&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/activities/preventing-cancer" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:According to the World Health Organization;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;According to the World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt;, between 30% and 50% of cancer cases are preventable by having healthy diet and lifestyle habits in place.

These tiny powerhouses can lower chronic inflammation, protect your cells and even help regulate blood sugar and cholesterol,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/im-oncologist-dinner-swear-cancer-232500844.html" data-ylk="slk:'I'm an Oncologist and This Is the Dinner I Swear By for Cancer Prevention';elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;'I'm an Oncologist and This Is the Dinner I Swear By for Cancer Prevention'&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;What To Avoid Eating if You Want To Lower Your Risk of Cancer&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;All three doctors emphasize that it isn’t only what you eat that’s important when it comes to using diet to lower your risk of cancer; what you don’t eat is important too. They all say they minimize foods with excess sugar or anything ultra-processed. They also recommend minimizing alcohol consumption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“I live by the philosophy that every bite is a choice to fuel health or feed disease. That’s why I stick to a whole food, plant-only diet—no ultra-processed foods, no animal protein. Just vibrant, nourishing real plant food. As a 25-year stage IV cancer survivor, heart transplant recipient and marathon runner, I don’t take my energy or health for granted. My food choices are how I show up for this miraculous life,” explains Dr. Mussallem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;That said, Dr. Mussallem says this doesn’t mean eating only nutrient-rich foods all the time; food is about enjoyment too! “I always tell my patients: Aim to eat nearly perfectly at home. That way, when you're out and about, you can make thoughtful choices without guilt or stress,” she shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;There is such an abundance of polyphenol-containing plant-based foods that it’s easy to incorporate at least one into every single meal. As you prepare your meals, brainstorm ways you can add more plants to your plate.

We tapped longevity experts for five science-backed signs you’re &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/factors-to-live-longer-study-2025-11687778" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;aging well&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-does-healthy-aging-look-like"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What Does Healthy Aging Look Like? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “When someone is aging healthfully and with intentionality, you’ll often see it in their energy and attitude,” says Dr. Cristina Del Toro Badessa, MD, board-certified emergency medicine doctor. “They have the strength to enjoy daily activities, the curiosity to keep learning, and an optimistic outlook about the years ahead. Healthy aging looks like being intentional about the food we put in our bodies, a great exercise routine that involves strength, flexibility, and functional movement. It looks like great consolidated and &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/drinks-to-help-you-fall-asleep-faster-8716952" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;restful sleep&lt;/a&gt;, hormonal balance, stress management, and positive relationships.” 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; On the other hand, you might wonder whether genetics and other biological factors play a role in our longevity, but Dr. Badessa assures us that these factors are only a small part of the equation. “Research suggests our genes probably account for only about 20–30% of how we age, with the rest influenced by lifestyle and environment,” she says. “That means that your &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/simple-healthy-habits-11690833" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;daily habits&lt;/a&gt;, including your diet, activity level, sleep, stress management, and whether you smoke and drink, have a powerful impact on your aging trajectory.” That’s where epigenetics—or the study of how our behaviors and environment can change our gene expression—comes in.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; We know what you’re thinking: while that’s all well and good, how do you know if you’re aging well? What signs should you look out for to know that you're on the right path? We’ve got you covered.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Being able to move around easily, whether it’s taking daily walks, climbing stairs, or carrying groceries, is a classic sign of healthy aging,” Dr. Badessa says. “Good strength, balance, and endurance mean you can stay independent and continue doing the activities you love.” Prioritizing exercise and living an &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/health/fitness-exercise/sedentary-lifestyle-signs" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;active lifestyle&lt;/a&gt; has been shown time and time again to improve your lifestyle—including living a long and healthy one.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Staying active can also benefit those around you. “A strong, active body that keeps you moving with ease can manifest in being able to keep up with the grandkids or play tennis regularly without getting injured or tired easily,” Dr. Robbins adds.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

This mental sharpness improves lifestyle by allowing them to remain independent in managing their affairs, and it brings joy and fulfillment.” Maybe you do the Wordle every morning or play Scrabble on the weekends—either way, these &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/dopamine-boosting-hobbies-8787317" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;brain-boosting hobbies&lt;/a&gt; will pay off in the long run.

This type of resilience results in "less chronic stress on the body, better mental health, and a happier daily life,” Dr. Badessa says. “It also rubs off on others! Maintaining a hopeful, adaptive attitude helps keep social connections strong and reduces feelings of loneliness or depression.” Dr. Badessa notes that hormones are one factor that affects emotional resilience as you age, and working with a healthcare provider to keep your hormones in check may help you achieve a more positive attitude.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You don’t have to be a social butterfly in order to have strong social connections, but a supportive community goes a long way when it comes to healthy aging. “People who foster relationships through regular social activities, volunteering, or simply chatting with loved ones tend to have better emotional health,” Dr. Badessa says. “This social engagement provides a sense of belonging and support, which can improve mood and even correlate with a longer lifespan. It makes life more meaningful and helps buffer against stress or cognitive decline.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Thankfully, it’s never too late to start finding your community. Consider joining a local support group, volunteering in your community, or attending seniors' events that are specifically tailored towards making connections.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Studies show that a strong sense of purpose is linked to better health and longevity, so pursuing what you love actually helps you age better,” Dr. Badessa says. “This could be a hobby, a part-time job, caring for grandkids, gardening, or anything that gives [you] joy and routine. Having a reason to get up in the morning is immensely beneficial because it keeps you active, mentally stimulated, and emotionally satisfied.” The most important factor to consider is whether or not you’re truly passionate about it—but if it fuels you with a purpose, then it’s likely the right choice. “Together, these signs create a lifestyle filled with energy, clarity, connection, and confidence at every age,” Dr. Robbins adds. Plus, both of our longevity experts agreed on one thing: it’s never too late to improve your life.

While the tour may look a lot like Beyoncé’s Renaissance one, the singer has kept fans entertained by bringing out her nanny (of &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/2023/01/shakira-gerard-pique-jam.html"&gt;strawberry-jam cheating-scandal fame&lt;/a&gt;), singing all the deep cuts, and shaking her hips … truthfully. But as of this week, one small hiccup has emerged. On Tuesday, the New Jersey Department of Health &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/potential-measles-exposure-shakira-concert-metlife-rcna208216"&gt;issued&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a href="https://www.nj.gov/health/news/2025/approved/20250520a.shtml"&gt;warning&lt;/a&gt; about a potential &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/how-worried-should-we-be-about-measles-outbreak-spreading.html"&gt;measles exposure&lt;/a&gt; to the tens of thousands of concertgoers who schlepped across state lines to see the “Hips Don’t Lie” singer. According to a press release, the alert stems from one non–New Jersey resident who attended the concert while actively infected with measles. The NJ DOH did not specify what section the individual was seated in but is encouraging everyone who was present at Thursday night’s event to call a health-care provider regarding next steps. Officials say anyone who was exposed could start showing symptoms as late as June 6.&lt;/p&gt;

The most effective way to protect against the virus is with the MMR vaccine — a two-part dose that treats measles, mumps, and rubella. But with misinformation about vaccines on the rise, and with anti-vax evangelist &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/anti-vaxxers-upset-rfk-jr-mmr-vaccine.html"&gt;RFK Jr.&lt;/a&gt; serving as Trump’s Health secretary, the country has &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2025/05/09/measles-cases-2025-states-outbreak-map/83371830007/"&gt;surpassed&lt;/a&gt; more than 1,000 confirmed measles cases this year alone. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, that means we’re shaping up for the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html#cdc_data_surveillance_section_4-map-of-measles-cases-in-2024-2025"&gt;largest outbreak&lt;/a&gt; in the United States in nearly 25 years — scary enough to get RFK Jr. to &lt;a href="https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1908967854394982414"&gt;admit&lt;/a&gt; that, actually, people should get the MMR vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;

Anyone who has not been fully vaccinated or has not had measles in the past is suspected to be at risk. And for her own sake, let’s hope Shakira got her MMR vaccine: She’s got a world tour to finish up, after all.&lt;/p&gt;

Powered by AI-selected DNA “light switches,” the vectors can switch on therapeutic or research genes only in targeted cells, eliminating the need for transgenic animals and enabling fine-grained circuit mapping, activation, or silencing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Validated across multiple species and human surgical tissue, the toolkit reaches elusive cells implicated in disorders like ALS, epilepsy, and Parkinson’s disease. By focusing treatment on malfunctioning cells alone, these tools lay a foundation for next-generation brain gene therapies that address root causes rather than symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cell-Specific Vectors:&lt;/strong&gt; Dozens of AAVs precisely target excitatory, inhibitory, vascular, and spinal motor neurons.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI-Found Enhancers:&lt;/strong&gt; Machine-learning algorithms identify DNA switches that direct cell-type-specific gene expression.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ready for Researchers:&lt;/strong&gt; All vectors, SOPs, and guides are freely available via Addgene, accelerating global brain research.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;NIH&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Research teams funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) have created a versatile set of gene delivery systems that can reach different neural cell types in the human brain and spinal cord with exceptional accuracy. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These delivery systems are a significant step toward future precise gene therapy to the brain that could safely control errant brain activity with high precision. In contrast, current therapies for brain disorders mostly treat only symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new delivery systems carry genetic material into the brain and spinal cord for targeted use by specific cell types.

Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;It provides researchers with gene delivery systems for various species used in research, without the need for genetically modified, or transgenic, animals. Examples include illuminating fine structures of brain cells with fluorescent proteins and activating or silencing circuits that control behavior and cognition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Imagine this new platform as a delivery truck dropping off specialized genetic packages in specific cell neighborhoods in the brain and spinal cord,” said John Ngai, Director of the NIH’s &lt;em&gt;Brain Research Through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies® &lt;/em&gt;Initiative, or&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;The BRAIN Initiative&lt;em&gt;®&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“With these delivery systems, we can now access and manipulate specific cells in the brain and spinal cord – access that was not possible before at this scale.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new delivery tools, which use a small, stripped-down adeno-associated virus (AAV) to deliver DNA to target cells, can be broadly applied across many species and experimental systems, including small tissue samples removed during human brain surgeries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The delivery systems have been tested, or validated, in intact living systems, which is an important step for introducing new tools for widespread use. The newly published toolkit includes:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dozens of delivery systems that selectively target key brain cell types, including excitatory neurons, inhibitory interneurons, striatal and cortical subtypes, brain blood vessel cells, and hard-to-reach neurons in the spinal cord that control body movement and are damaged in several neurological diseases, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and spinal muscular atrophy&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Computer programs powered by artificial intelligence (AI) that can identify genetic “light switches,” known as enhancers, that turn genes on in specific brain cell types, using data from many different species – cutting considerable time and effort for scientists looking for these genetic switches.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, this collection of research tools will significantly accelerate understanding of the human brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, the toolkit enables access to specific brain cell types in the prefrontal cortex, an area that’s critical for decision-making and uniquely human traits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With other tools in the collection, scientists can better study individual cells and communication pathways known to be affected in several neurological diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These include seizure disorders, ALS, Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, and Huntington’s disease – as well as various neuropsychiatric conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AAV-based treatments are already approved for some conditions, such as spinal muscular atrophy for which a 2016 approval of a gene therapy known as Zolgensma transformed the lives of infants and young children who once faced severe disability or early death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new collection of gene delivery resources lays the groundwork for more precise treatments that target only affected cells in the brain, spinal cord, or brain blood vessels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The toolkit is available at distribution centers including Addgene, a global supplier of genetic research tools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This collection of publications offers researchers standard operating procedures and user guides for these tools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work is supported by the NIH’s &lt;em&gt;Brain Research Through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies® &lt;/em&gt;Initiative, or&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;The BRAIN Initiative&lt;em&gt;®&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Funding issued less than four years ago launched a large-scale, team-run project to design new molecular tools that can be useful to many research laboratories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Armamentarium for Precision Brain Cell Access aims to develop precise and reproducible access to cells and circuits in experimental research models of the brain and spinal cord. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The large-scale project brings together experts in the field of molecular biology, neuroscience, and artificial

interneuron subtypes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent years, we and others have identified a number of enhancers that, when incorporated into rAAV vectors, can restrict the transgene expression to particular neuronal populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet, viral tools to access and manipulate specific neuronal subtypes are still limited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, we performed systematic analysis of single-cell genomic data to identify enhancer candidates for each of the telencephalic interneuron subtypes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We established a set of enhancer-AAV tools that are highly specific for distinct cortical interneuron populations and striatal cholinergic interneurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These enhancers, when used in the context of different effectors, can target (fluorescent proteins), observe activity (GCaMP), and manipulate (opto-genetics) specific neuronal subtypes. We also validated our enhancer-AAV tools across species.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thus, we provide the field with a powerful set of tools to study neural circuits and functions and to develop precise and targeted therapy.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 May 2025 20:35:45 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMia0FVX3lxTFBlVmFPb0NvcUItUXFBZmdhT1BTeDdpREFQSHFYT0JsR2dtSGVLSGxRV1VQMnJVNjJYQXJ3U1BwUzQyN0lPazRXRlJXVzFVclVZMlY3b01oZi1EWWJqNFltX2lKSUZHM3dtZFVV</guid></item><item><title>维生素D补充剂有助于减缓与生物衰老相关的端粒缩短- Medical Xpress | Vitamin D supplements help slow telomere shortening linked to biological aging - Medical Xpress</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijgFBVV95cUxPZzJBMjJOQlBma0J6eDBQTTVfdzc5VVV5OU9JcUxvN21PUWhMNWd1R2NiWVRGZG13SHNXc1JjM3pnZHhhNVAyNGdkMXdUNlFTTFJYZTFxVTdJb1VjOVhmbEVfWW5JenBzNzNMNUx5ZnNHYXpUQ09MeTFlZmJOaWpGbG41UUhsYlppQVVvN0dB?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="mt-4 article-main"&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results from the VITAL randomized controlled trial reveal that vitamin D supplementation helps maintain telomeres, protective caps at the ends of chromosomes that shorten during aging and are linked to the development of certain diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;The new report, &lt;a href="https://ajcn.nutrition.org/article/S0002-9165(25)00255-2/fulltext" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition&lt;/i&gt;, is based on data from a VITAL sub-study co-led by researchers at Mass General Brigham and the Medical College of Georgia, and supports a promising role in slowing a pathway for biological aging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"VITAL is the first large-scale and long-term randomized trial to show that vitamin D supplements protect telomeres and preserve &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/telomere+length/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;telomere length&lt;/a&gt;," said co-author JoAnn Manson, MD, principal investigator of VITAL and chief of the Division of Preventive Medicine at Brigham and Women's Hospital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This is of particular interest because VITAL had also shown the benefits of vitamin D in reducing inflammation and lowering risks of selected chronic diseases of aging, such as advanced cancer and autoimmune disease."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Telomeres are made of repeating sequences of DNA, or base pairs, that prevent chromosome ends from degrading or fusing with other chromosomes. Telomere shortening is a natural part of aging and is associated with an increased risk of various age-related diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few short-term, small-scale studies have suggested that vitamin D or omega-3 fatty acid supplementation may help support telomeres, but results have been inconsistent. VITAL is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of vitamin D3 (2,000 IU/day) and omega-3 fatty acid (1 g/day) supplementation that tracked U.S. females aged 55 years and older and males aged 50 years and older for five years. The VITAL Telomere sub-study included 1,054 of these participants, whose telomere length in &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/white+blood+cells/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;white blood cells&lt;/a&gt; was assessed at baseline and at Year 2 and Year 4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared with taking placebo, taking vitamin D3 supplements significantly reduced telomere shortening over four years, preventing the equivalent of nearly three years of aging compared with placebo. Omega-3 fatty acid supplementation had no significant effect on telomere length throughout follow-up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our findings suggest that targeted vitamin D supplementation may be a promising strategy to counter a biological aging process, although further research is warranted," said Haidong Zhu, Ph.D., first author of the report and a molecular geneticist at the Medical College of Georgia, Augusta University.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They’re dying for that glow — one can of carrots at a time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/05/20/lifestyle/men-are-wearing-dangerous-soccer-cleats-as-a-fashion-trend/"&gt;new TikTok trend&lt;/a&gt; called &lt;em&gt;“&lt;/em&gt;carrotmaxxing&lt;em&gt;”&lt;/em&gt; is taking root among beauty-obsessed users looking to score a sun-kissed sheen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But instead of bronzed bliss, some people are turning orange — &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/02/29/lifestyle/what-is-face-basting-how-diaper-rash-cream-can-relieve-dry-skin/"&gt;or worse,&lt;/a&gt; landing themselves in the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Fake tan has become too expensive. Time to start carrotmaxxing,” one user, @SydneyPacce, declared on &lt;a href="https://x.com/SydneyPacce/status/1921008445269910008"&gt;X (formerly Twitter) &lt;/a&gt;on May 9 alongside a photo of six cans of sliced carrots and a bottle of Dr. Pepper.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nine days — and an apparent veggie binge — later, she posted an &lt;a href="https://x.com/SydneyPacce/status/1924281142892523721"&gt;alarming update&lt;/a&gt;: “UPDATE: CARROTMAXXING SENT ME TO THE ER.”&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;The beta-carotene-packed trend supposedly delivers a natural tan by turning skin a warmer hue. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But if you go too hard on the carrots, you might wind up with carotenemia — a rather harmless condition that literally turns your skin yellow-orange due to “high levels of beta-carotene in the blood,” according to &lt;a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/carotenemia-7254408" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Very Well Health&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Instead of glowing up, some carrotmaxxers are turning traffic-cone orange — or winding up in the ER. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;TikTok/@notsyrianpsycho&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Having your skin turn a different color is one thing — but getting sent to the ER for sodium overload from the root vegetable is another. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Experts warn that the high levels of sodium in canned carrots — the way many are partaking in this trend — can cause some serious harm. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to Harvard Medical School physicians, who wrote in a &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/heart-failure-and-salt-the-great-debate-2018121815563"&gt;recent statement&lt;/a&gt;, “It’s also highly likely that some patients are more salt-sensitive than others. Thus, directing salt restriction to those most vulnerable might be better than a one-size-fits-all approach.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That was apparently the case for @SydneyPacce, who consumed six cans of sliced carrots daily — not raw carrots, mind you — amounting to over 5,250 milligrams of sodium a day. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;For those partaking in this trend by eating canned carrots — experts warn that the sodium in this pantry item could cause some serious harm.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;TikTok/@kainoalam&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That’s more than double the American Heart Association’s &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-eating/eat-smart/sodium/how-much-sodium-should-i-eat-per-day"&gt;recommended limit&lt;/a&gt; of 2,300 mg, and way beyond the ideal cap of 1,500 mg.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I already had heart problems, so all the sodium in the carrots kinda took me out and I went into mild organ failure,” she wrote in a &lt;a href="https://x.com/SydneyPacce/status/1924654038773035064"&gt;follow-up tweet&lt;/a&gt; on May 19. “I’m doing much better now though!”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Carrots themselves aren’t the enemy — &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2023/12/15/health/drinking-this-beverage-could-benefit-people-with-cancer-or-diabetes-study/"&gt;far from it&lt;/a&gt;. Packed with fiber, vitamin K, calcium and vision-boosting antioxidants, they’re a powerhouse snack when eaten in moderation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;People who want to partake in this trend need to tread lightly.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;markobe – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Since they are known for benefiting eye health and vision, carrots are thought to be loaded with vitamin A, but they actually don’t have any vitamin A in its active form,” said Rosy Rojas, a dietetic intern at Tufts’ Frances Stern Nutrition Center.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;“Instead, carrots are filled with carotenoids, mainly beta-carotene, that can be converted to active vitamin A. Our body is able to regulate this conversion, so toxicity is not an issue.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But when paired with sodium-laced canned veggies and a desperate quest for clout, the risks grow, as &lt;a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/health/carrotmaxxing-tiktok-trend-carrots-health-warning-b2754963.html"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; by The Independent. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While the glow-up might be the goal, the carrot craze is proving to be less of a bronzed beauty hack — and more of a cautionary tale.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Because when it comes to carrotmaxxing, too much of a good thing can leave you cooked.&lt;/p&gt;

The study, published Wednesday in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2834355?guestAccessKey=afac6436-8a44-4b07-b3c3-aed8f522faec&amp;amp;utm_source=for_the_media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;amp;utm_term=052125"&gt;JAMA Network Open&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, analyzed 1,200 newly introduced or reformulated children's ready-to-eat cereals between 2010 and 2023; brand names weren't associated. The researchers found that total fat and sodium per serving increased by roughly one-third over that period. Sugar content rose by nearly 11%, with "a single serving exceeding 45% of the American Heart Association's daily recommended [added sugar] limit for children."&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                
                                
                            &lt;/div&gt;

                                    &lt;p class="storyParagraph"&gt;
                                        The study also found that while protein content averaged 1.97 grams per serving between 2010 and 2020, it "decreased significantly" to 1.69 grams in 2023. Dietary fiber held steady before 2021 but then decreased from 3.82 grams in 2021 to 2.94 grams in 2023. The findings are particularly notable given that ready-to-eat breakfast cereals are "the most commonly consumed food product among children aged 5 to 12," reports the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/21/health/cereal-nutrients-unhealthy.html"&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; per USDA data. About a third of American children eat cereal each morning, while only 10% of kids start their day with eggs. &lt;a href="https://www.consumeraffairs.com/news/nutritional-value-of-kids-cereals-declines-despite-industry-awareness-052125.html"&gt;Consumer Affairs&lt;/a&gt; notes that "though the study only examined new product launches—and not the full cereal market—it offers critical insight into where the industry may be heading."

&lt;p&gt;Then, one day later, the rats were shown the same image and treated with an electric shock until they learned to connect the image with pain. Finally, the team tested if the rats would freeze in fear in response to the sound. The “unpaired” group didn’t. The rats in the “paired” group did—it turned out human-like complex emotional models were present in rats as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once Johansen and Gu confirmed the capacity was there, they got busy figuring out how it worked exactly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Playing tag&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Behaviorally, we measured freezing responses to the directly paired stimulus, which was the image, and inferred stimulus which was the sound,” Johansen says. “But we also performed something we called miniscope calcium imaging.” The trick relied on injecting rats with a virus that forced their cells to produce proteins that fluoresce in response to increased levels of calcium in the cells. Increased levels of calcium are the telltale sign of activity in neurons, meaning the team could see in real time which neurons in rats’ brains lit up during the experiments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turned out that the region crucial for building these complex emotional models was not the amygdala, but the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC), which had a rather specialized role. “The dmPFC does not form the sensory model of the world. It only cares about things when they have emotional relevance,” Johansen explains. He said there wasn’t much change in neuronal activity during the sensory learning phase, when the animals were watching the image and listening to the sound. The neurons became significantly more active when the rats received the electric shock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the “unpaired” group, the active neurons that held the representations of the electric shock and the image started to overlap. In the “paired” group, this overlap also included the neuronal representation of the sound. “There was a kind of an associative bundle that formed,” Johansen says.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Published Wednesday in the &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ajcnut.2025.05.003"&gt;American Journal of Clinical Nutrition&lt;/a&gt;, the research saw 1,031 adults either take 2,000 IU of vitamin D every day or a placebo for four years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Using blood samples, the team measured the length of each person's telomeres, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14171589/lifting-weights-help-reduce-biological-age.html"&gt;repeating sequences of DNA&lt;/a&gt; that protect chromosomes from damage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Telomeres shorten with age, and previous research shows people with longer telomeres have a longer life expectancy than those with shorter ones. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers found telomeres were up to eight times longer in people who took daily vitamin D supplements than those in the placebo group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While it's unclear exactly how vitamin D lengthens telomeres, experts believe it could help reduce the risk of DNA-damaging oxidative stress and promote the release of enzymes thought to make telomeres longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The blood tests measured leukocyte telomere length (LTL), the length of telomeres in white blood cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Shorter LTL has been linked to an increased risk of age-related diseases like heart disease and cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the placebo group, LTL decreased 12 percent after two years from the baseline and another 16 percent two years after that. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, those who took vitamin D had just five percent less LTL after two years and two percent less two years after that. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The experts estimate the group that took vitamin D prevented the equivalent of three years of aging compared to the placebo. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Haidong Zhu, first study author and molecular geneticist at the Medical College of Georgia, said: 'Our findings suggest that targeted vitamin D supplementation may be a promising strategy to counter a biological aging process, although further research is warranted.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Telomeres, pictured here, are thought to protect chromosomes from damage. Shorter telomeres have been associated with shorter lifespans (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While the exact mechanism is unclear, the researchers suggested vitamin D could create higher levels of telomerase, an enzyme that makes telomeres longer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, vitamin D helps lower oxidative stress, an imbalance between disease-fighting antioxidants and harmful free radicals, which attack cells and tissues. Oxidative stress has been shown to damage DNA, potentially shortening telomeres. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Most experts recommend consuming about 600 to 800 IU per day, significantly less than the 2,000 IU used in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Most vitamin D supplements contain between 1,000 and 2,000 IU. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Consuming more than 4,000 IU in a day could lead to a dangerous buildup of calcium in the bloodstream. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is because vitamin D normally helps the body absorb more calcium, which is crucial for maintaining bone and muscle health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Excess vitamin D causes the body to absorb more calcium than it needs, causing it to accumulate in the bloodstream and then get deposited into tissues in the kidneys, lungs and heart. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This leads to nausea, vomiting, constipation, dehydration, bone pain and kidney stones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There were several limitations, including the lack of diversity in the sample size, as most participants were white. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study was partly funded by the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, an arm of the National Institutes of Health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;If you find running intimidating, know that there is another way to get some fresh air while doing a reasonably intense workout. It’s called interval walking training (IWT), or sometimes  "Japanese walking" or "3x3 walking." It’s a form of HIIT, but it won’t end in you collapsing on the floor, hating your life. Here’s how to do it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-to-do-the-3x3-japanese-walking-workout"&gt;How to do the 3x3 "Japanese walking" workout&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The original protocol for this exercise, as published &lt;a href="https://core.ac.uk/reader/148769277?utm_source=linkout" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;u&gt;here&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in 2007 by Hiroshi Nose’s team at Shinshu University in Japan, used a lab test to help people determine how fast they should walk during the workout. Since that’s not practical for most of us, a common substitute is to use perceived effort. During the high intensity portions, you walk a strong, fast pace—about as fast as you can without jogging, and without getting too tired. For the low intensity portions, you walk normally. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So here’s the protocol. It’s simple, and it doesn’t require a warmup, so you can just jump right in: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walk for three minutes at a normal speed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walk for three minutes at high intensity (as fast as you reasonably can).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Repeat those two steps for 30 minutes or more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;To time those intervals, you can program any smartwatch to beep at three-minute intervals, or just use your phone. I like the free &lt;a href="https://intervalspro.com/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Intervals Pro app&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on my iPhone; try &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=cc.dreamspark.intervaltimer&amp;amp;hl=en_US" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Interval Timer&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on Android. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the 2007 study, older adults who did this workout four or more times per week, for five months, ended the study with better aerobic fitness and leg strength than when they started. If you’ve ever wondered &lt;a href="https://lifehacker.com/does-walking-really-count-as-cardio-1846965965" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;whether walking counts as exercise&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, this certainly does. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="why-interval-walking-is-the-new-hiit"&gt;Why interval walking is the new HIIT&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interval walking is starting to become more popular. Garmin’s latest lifestyle watch, the &lt;a data-ga-click="1" data-ga-template="Explainers" data-ga-module="content_body" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-event_label="Vivoactive 6" href="https://zdcs.link/z6orJk?pageview_type=Standard&amp;amp;template=Explainers&amp;amp;module=content_body&amp;amp;element=offer&amp;amp;item=text-link&amp;amp;element_label=Vivoactive%206&amp;amp;short_url=z6orJk&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fhealth%2Fhow-to-start-interval-walking&amp;amp;event_label=Vivoactive%206" rel="nofollow sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Vivoactive 6&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, comes with walking workouts, which include intervals similar to the ones in the 3x3 workout.

I see a few forces at work here. First, there’s a lot of over-the-top, go-get-em attitudes in the fitness world, especially on social media. If you’ve been through a few rounds of HIIT hype, you may be sick of trying to push yourself harder and harder (or you were so intimidated by the idea that you never tried.) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="pogoClear relative my-10 border-b-[1.5px] border-t-[1.5px] border-dashed border-black py-5 sm:my-14 sm:border-0 sm:py-0" data-ga-click data-ga-template="Explainers" data-ga-module="openweb_widget" data-ga-element="openweb_scroll" data-ga-item="openweb_scroll_midpage" x-cloak x-data="{ commentsCount: null, hasComments: false }" x-init="commentsCount = await window.openweb.getMessagesCount(01JVSYZS86PA2S1K4FHQRCM9TV);

            &lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The backlash to high intensity fitness can go a bit too far the other way, telling people (often &lt;a href="https://lifehacker.com/truth-about-cortisol-influencers-blame-for-everything" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;women who have been told to worry about their cortisol&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) that they don’t need to lift weights or work hard in the gym; they can just go for walks and do some gentle yoga or Pilates. Take that advice seriously enough, and you won’t end up getting much exercise at all. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interval walking occupies a place in the middle—harder than a hot girl walk or &lt;a href="https://lifehacker.com/tiktok-s-cozy-cardio-trend-might-help-you-enjoy-exerc-1850811679" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;cozy cardio&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but easier (and more fun!) than a &lt;a href="https://lifehacker.com/what-the-12-3-30-workout-gets-wrong-and-what-it-gets-r-1848667798" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;12-3-30&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; treadmill trudge. Interval walking is especially accessible to people who don’t have a gym membership or fitnessy clothes: All you need is a pair of shoes that are comfortable to walk in. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And here’s where I think the real magic of walking comes in: It stops you from overthinking your fitness routine, and lets you just get started. You won’t be tempted to overthink about &lt;a href="https://lifehacker.com/health/the-best-running-shoes-for-men-women" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;running shoes&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://lifehacker.com/health/the-best-fitness-watches-for-runners" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;fitness watches&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;—you just get out there and walk. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/article&gt;

                A blood test called a PSA can help screen men for prostate cancer but it can also lead to unnecessary treatment.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;News that former President Joseph Biden has &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/05/18/g-s1-67544/joe-biden-prostate-cancer" target="_blank"&gt;advanced prostate cancer&lt;/a&gt; has revived long-standing questions about the benefits versus the harms of a blood test that screens for the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11774093/" target="_blank"&gt;most commonly diagnosed cancer among men&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/types/prostate/psa-fact-sheet" target="_blank"&gt;Prostate-specific antigen&lt;/a&gt;, or PSA, screening tests are an imperfect tool for detecting prostate cancer, doctors and public health experts say.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Part of the problem is identifying and treating aggressive cancers like Biden's while not unnecessarily treating men with slow-growing cancers unlikely to sicken them. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4485977/" target="_blank"&gt;Autopsies found&lt;/a&gt; the disease to be so widespread that more than one-third of white men and half of Black men in their 70s had prostate cancers that would never do any harm.&lt;/p&gt;   
   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"PSA testing alone leaves a lot to be desired as a cancer screening test," said radiation oncologist Dr. Brent Rose, an associate professor at the University of California, San Diego, School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The test measures the level of PSA, a protein produced by normal as well as malignant prostate gland cells, in the blood. Elevated PSA can be a marker for cancer. It also can signal a false positive or an inactive cancer, triggering a painful biopsy, and leading to overtreatment with punishing side effects, including impotence, incontinence and bowel dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"PSA screening is beneficial," Rose said. "There are risks, though, and so it is a personal decision whether or not to do PSA screening."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The key is to target and treat aggressive cancers while waiting and watching cancers that might never become troublesome, Rose and other oncologists told NPR. Physicians have been walking this tightrope since they began regularly using PSA tests to screen for prostate cancer in healthy men in the 1990s. There is no other test that effectively screens for prostate cancer — the &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/prostate-cancer/about/key-statistics.html" target="_blank"&gt;second deadliest cancer&lt;/a&gt; for American men, oncologists said.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;A history of conflicting guidance&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Attempts to balance the possible harms against the number of lives saved have led to &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11774093/" target="_blank"&gt;two decades of fluctuating&lt;/a&gt; – and confusing – public health guidelines on PSA screening. In 2012, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force advised against any screening, only to issue a watered-down recommendation in 2018 that men ages 55 to 69 discuss screening with their health care providers. Various physicians' groups offer conflicting guidance for this age group.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In its advice to older men, however, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force has been somewhat more consistent. In 2008, the independent panel of national experts recommended men 75 and older not be screened, and since 2018, the panel has advised against screening men 70 and older.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Biden, 82, apparently followed the guidance. He last had a PSA screening test in 2014, when he was 71 or 72 years old, a &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/05/19/nx-s1-5403887/trump-biden-cancer" target="_blank"&gt;spokesman said&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For men between the ages of 55 and 69, the task force &lt;a href="https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/prostate-cancer-screening" target="_blank"&gt;recommends&lt;/a&gt; talking to their health care providers about their preferences before deciding whether to get a PSA test. It classifies the recommendation as Grade C, which means it offers only a small benefit and insurers may not cover it.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Finding the time to have a conversation about a topic as complicated as the value of prostate-cancer screening can be challenging for most primary-care physicians, oncologists interviewed for this story said. And while some men might welcome what's called "shared decision-making," others find it agonizing. Still, the only advice for men for now is to talk the issue over carefully with their doctors.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;The case for the PSA test&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Dr. Alicia Morgans, a genitourinary medical oncologist at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, recognizes the problem and hopes that the task force will address it in new guidelines, which it is currently drafting. In August, she met with the volunteer panel in her role as chair of the medical advisory board for the advocacy group Zero Prostate Cancer.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Morgans believes the current guidance was based on a flawed clinical trial. It concluded that men screened with PSA tests were no less likely to die of prostate cancer than men assigned to a group that was not screened. But the results were muddied because nearly 90% of the men in the control group had at least one PSA test before or during the trial, she said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Morgans would like to see the recommendation beefed up so more men get screened for prostate cancer and Black men and men with a family history, who are more vulnerable get screened earlier.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I take care of people who have very advanced prostate cancer, as well as some people who have curable prostate cancer," she said, "so my perspective is really skewed by the fact that I really want to make that diagnosis when things are curable."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;So does Dr. Matthew Cooperberg, a urologic oncologist and a professor at the University of California, San Francisco. He has pushed to rename early-stage prostate cancer in part to ease the stress of a cancer diagnosis. One possible name, "&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39350309/" target="_blank"&gt;acinar neoplasm&lt;/a&gt;," describes an abnormal growth but one lacking the potential to spread or kill. Cooperberg also advocates monitoring men with elevated PSAs before rushing to biopsy their prostates.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Men should get PSA testing in midlife with the goal of finding aggressive prostate cancer," he said. "If we find low-grade disease along the way, whether or not we call it cancer, we should not treat it. We just monitor it with active surveillance. If we do that, we can erase this cancer."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;A new approach to prostate cancer screening emerges&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Dr. Tyler Seibert, a radiation oncologist and associate professor at the University of California, San Diego, is not as optimistic about eliminating prostate cancer. But he too is dedicated to finding ways to identify the bad prostate cancers and treating only them.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;When doctors first began doing PSA screening tests, he said, "there was a flawed assumption that was implicit that if you find any kind of prostate cancer, you must treat that kind of prostate cancer aggressively," he said. "Many of them would never have harmed the patient."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A new era in prostate-cancer screening has arrived, Seibert believes. Today, instead of men immediately having their prostates biopsied when they get an elevated PSA test, he and an increasing number of prostate-cancer specialists recommend first getting an MRI and, when possible, watching and waiting.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"For these patients with low-risk prostate cancer, we have really strong evidence that we can follow them closely, and they basically can just carry on with their life," he said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Not everyone is comfortable with getting periodic blood tests to see if their PSA might be rising and they might indeed need cancer treatment, Seibert acknowledged. But most of his patients do become comfortable with the protocol, he said.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"Every time you get that blood test, you're kind of a little bit nervous," he said. "If you can tolerate that, and you don't think that it's going to be causing you too much anxiety, then screening makes a lot of sense."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ronnie Cohen is freelance health journalist based in the San Francisco Bay Area.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The study also found that cereals’ protein and fiber content — nutrients essential for a healthy diet — have been in decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The findings, based on an analysis of 1,200 new or reformulated cereal products introduced in the United States between 2010 and 2023, are likely to add fuel to the ongoing debate about the relationship between processed food, mounting childhood obesity and the rising prevalence of chronic diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The debate has gained greater prominence in the months since health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. began using the federal bully pulpit to excoriate ultra-processed foods as part of his “&lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.maha.vote/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Make America Healthy Again&lt;/a&gt;” campaign. Mr. Kennedy, who has declared that “sugar is poison,” last month &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/25/well/food-dyes-ban.html" title=""&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that the Department of Health and Human Services would work to remove some artificial dyes from the U.S. food supply, citing concerns about their impact on children’s health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Shuoli Zhao, a professor of agricultural economics at the University of Kentucky and a co-author of the new study, said the findings were especially notable given evolving consumer awareness about the links between excess consumption of sugar, salt and saturated fat and chronic conditions like diabetes, hypertension and cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“What’s most surprising to me is that the healthy claims made on the front of these products and the nutritional facts on the back are actually going in the opposite direction,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The analysis, based on data gathered by the marketing consultancy Mintel, did not identify brand names, nor did it capture information on purchasing and consumption habits. The vast majority of the 1,200 products it analyzed were relaunches of existing cereals, including so-called reformulations that alter a product’s taste or nutritional content, Professor Zhao said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-kbghgg"&gt;&lt;div class="css-121kum4"&gt;&lt;p class="css-171quhb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-asuuk5"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-7axq9l" data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true" class="css-1b5b8u1"&gt;&lt;path fill="currentColor" fill-rule="evenodd" d="M2.5 12a9.5 9.5 0 1 1 19 0 9.5 9.5 0 0 1-19 0Zm8.5 1.75v-7.5h2v7.5h-2Zm0 2v2h2v-2h-2Z" clip-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;div data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript-message" class="css-6yo1no"&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;We are having trouble retrieving the article content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dv1kvn" id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

                The first Alzheimer's blood test cleared by the Food And Drug Administration is set to make diagnosis more accessible and accurate — and change the way doctors treat the disease.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;A new blood test that detects a hallmark of Alzheimer's is poised to change the way doctors diagnose and treat the disease.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The test, the first of its kind to be &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-clears-first-blood-test-used-diagnosing-alzheimers-disease" target="_blank"&gt;cleared&lt;/a&gt; by the Food and Drug Administration, is for people 55 and older who already have memory problems or other signs and symptoms of Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The results show whether the brain of a person with cognitive symptoms also has amyloid plaques, clumps of toxic proteins that build up in the spaces between brain cells. The presence of plaques in a person with cognitive symptoms usually confirms an Alzheimer's diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;   
   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"I think the blood test is going to really revolutionize the way people with Alzheimer's are cared for and diagnosed," says &lt;a href="https://www.alzdiscovery.org/about-addf/people/howard-fillit" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Howard Fillit&lt;/a&gt;, chief science officer at the Alzheimer's Drug Discovery Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Primary care physicians will now have access to something that can give them a quicker read" on whether a patient has Alzheimer's, says &lt;a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.alz.org/press/spokespeople/maria_c_carrillo_ph_d__;!!Iwwt!VrdWEd07buTn9e3_1U59sDhdIjoDbFFDZXMHo1heaKWdign1BJrnWydkO67oLWq1w8L5yJM874hC$" target="_blank"&gt;Maria Carrillo&lt;/a&gt;, chief science officer of the Alzheimer's Association.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;One benefit of a readily-available blood test will be more accurate diagnoses, Fillit says, noting that currently, primary care doctors correctly diagnose patients only about 60% of the time.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"Specialty neurologists get it right like seventy, eighty percent of the time," He says. "With the blood test, we can get it up to over 90%."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://jnm.snmjournals.org/content/63/Supplement_1/13S" target="_blank"&gt;PET scan&lt;/a&gt; is the gold standard for detecting the amyloid plaques associated with Alzheimer's. But the technology is costly, and unavailable in many communities.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Another option is to test fluid from a spinal tap, an invasive procedure that most doctors and patients tend to avoid.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;There are already&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2024/08/02/g-s1-14852/alzheimers-new-blood-tests-amyloid-tau-ptau217-diagnosis" target="_blank"&gt; lab-developed blood tests&lt;/a&gt; that can signal the presence of amyloid. But the Lumipulse assay, made by the diagnostic company Fujirebio, is the first to receive marketing clearance from the FDA.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Having such a test is likely to mean that many more people will be diagnosed when their symptoms are still mild, and potentially treatable.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/04/30/g-s1-63345/alzheimers-survey-americans-testing-treatment-risky" target="_blank"&gt;survey&lt;/a&gt; from the Alzheimer's Association found that the vast majority of older Americans would take a blood test to find out if they have the disease.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;People who are diagnosed while still in the early stages of Alzheimer's may be eligible to receive one of the two &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/27/nx-s1-5309499/alzheimers-was-taking-her-memory-so-she-started-taking-a-new-drug" target="_blank"&gt;amyloid-reducing drugs&lt;/a&gt; now on market.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Lab-developed blood tests have been used primarily by researchers, or by specialists in large medical centers. The test cleared by the FDA is likely to attract a much broader audience.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's been through rigorous evaluation, and it provides guidance for prescribers on who's eligible and when the test should be provided," Carrillo says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The result should be more testing of people in rural or underserved areas.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Blood tests have given us an opportunity to really democratize this kind of testing," Carrillo says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It also means that many more of the estimated &lt;a href="https://www.alz.org/getmedia/ef8f48f9-ad36-48ea-87f9-b74034635c1e/alzheimers-facts-and-figures.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;7.2 million Americans&lt;/a&gt; thought to be living with Alzheimer's are likely to get a formal diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;To help health health care providers counsel these individuals, the Alzheimer's Association is writing guidelines on how to speak to patients about the results of a blood test, what it means to live with the disease, and what the treatment options are.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The guidelines are expected this summer.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A widely used antidepressant drug could help the immune system fight cancer, according to a new UCLA research study.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or SSRIs, significantly enhanced the ability of T cells to fight cancer and suppressed &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/tumor+growth/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;tumor growth&lt;/a&gt; across a range of cancer types in both mouse and human tumor models, the study, &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(25)00502-1" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Cell&lt;/i&gt;, found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It turns out SSRIs don't just make our brains happier; they also make our T cells happier—even while they're fighting tumors," said Dr. Lili Yang, senior author of the new study and a member of the Eli and Edythe Broad Center of Regenerative Medicine and Stem Cell Research at UCLA. "These drugs have been widely and safely used to treat depression for decades, so repurposing them for cancer would be a lot easier than developing an entirely new therapy."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db377.htm" target="_blank"&gt;to the CDC&lt;/a&gt;, one out of eight adults in the U.S. takes an antidepressant, and SSRIs are the most commonly prescribed. These drugs, sold under brand names like Prozac and Celexa, increase levels of serotonin—the brain's "happiness hormone"—by blocking the activity of a protein called &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/serotonin+transporter/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;serotonin transporter&lt;/a&gt;, or SERT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While serotonin is best known for the role it plays in the brain, it's also a critical player in processes that occur throughout the body, including digestion, metabolism and immune activity.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;Yang and her team first began investigating serotonin's role in fighting cancer after noticing that &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/immune+cells/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;immune cells&lt;/a&gt; isolated from tumors had higher levels of serotonin-regulating molecules. At first, they focused on MAO-A, an enzyme that breaks down serotonin and other neurotransmitters, including norepinephrine and dopamine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2021, &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2021-06-drug-commonly-antidepressant-cancer-mice.html"&gt;they reported that T cells produce MAO-A&lt;/a&gt; when they recognize tumors, which makes it harder for them to fight cancer. They found that treating mice with melanoma and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/colon+cancer/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;colon cancer&lt;/a&gt; using MAO inhibitors, also called MAOIs—the first class of antidepressant drugs to be invented—helped T cells attack tumors more effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, because MAOIs have safety concerns, including &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/serious+side+effects/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;serious side effects&lt;/a&gt; and interactions with certain foods and medications, the team turned its attention to a different serotonin-regulating molecule: SERT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Unlike MAO-A, which breaks down multiple neurotransmitters, SERT has one job—to transport serotonin," explained Dr. Bo Li, first author of the study and a senior research scientist in the Yang lab. "SERT made for an especially attractive target because the drugs that act on it—SSRIs—are widely used with minimal side effects."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers tested SSRIs in mouse and human tumor models representing melanoma, breast, prostate, colon and bladder cancer. They found that SSRI treatment reduced average tumor size by over 50% and made the cancer-fighting T cells, known as killer T cells, more effective at killing cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"SSRIs made the killer T cells happier in the otherwise oppressive tumor environment by increasing their access to serotonin signals, reinvigorating them to fight and kill cancer cells," said Yang, who is also a professor of microbiology, immunology and molecular genetics and a member of the UCLA Health Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;h2&gt;How SSRIs could boost the effectiveness of cancer therapies&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team also investigated whether combining SSRIs with existing cancer therapies could improve treatment outcomes. They tested a combination of an SSRI and anti-PD-1 antibody—a common immune checkpoint blockade, or ICB, therapy—in mouse models of melanoma and colon cancer. ICB therapies work by blocking immune checkpoint molecules that normally suppress immune cell activity, allowing T cells to attack tumors more effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results were striking: the combination significantly reduced tumor size in all treated mice and even achieved complete remission in some cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Immune checkpoint blockades are effective in fewer than 25% of patients," said James Elsten-Brown, a graduate student in the Yang lab and co-author of the study. "If a safe, widely available drug like an SSRI could make these therapies more effective, it would be hugely impactful."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To confirm these findings, the team will investigate whether real-world cancer patients taking SSRIs have better outcomes, especially those receiving ICB therapies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Since around 20% of cancer patients take antidepressants—most commonly SSRIs—we see a unique opportunity to explore how these drugs might improve cancer outcomes," said Yang, who is also a member of the Goodman-Luskin Microbiome Center and the Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy. "Our goal is to design a clinical trial to compare treatment outcomes between cancer patients who take these medications and those who do not."&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Yang added that using existing FDA-approved drugs could speed up the process of bringing new cancer treatments to patients, making this research especially promising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Studies estimate the bench-to-bedside pipeline for new cancer therapies costs an average of $1.5 billion," she said. "When you compare this to the estimated $300 million cost to repurpose FDA-approved drugs, it's clear why this approach has so much potential."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The newly identified therapeutic strategy is covered by a &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/patent+application/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;patent application&lt;/a&gt; filed by the UCLA Technology Development Group on behalf of the Regents of the University of California, with Yang and Li as co-inventors.&lt;/p&gt;

Previous research has found that nostalgic reflection can promote psychological benefits such as social connectedness, self-continuity, and optimism. However, while nostalgia is typically seen as positive, it is also tinged with sadness, and little is known about how its emotional signature changes over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tim Wildschut and colleagues examined whether the affect (emotion) associated with nostalgic memories fades or intensifies with time, and how this temporal trajectory differs from other kinds of memories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers explored this question using a framework known as the Fading Affect Bias, which shows that negative emotions typically fade more than positive ones when people recall past events. The team conducted two experiments to see whether nostalgic events follow this pattern or whether they display a distinct trajectory—specifically, whether nostalgic events become less positive and more negative over time, and how this change relates to specific emotions like regret or loneliness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Experiment 1, 199 university undergraduates were randomly assigned to reflect on either a nostalgic or an ordinary event. After recalling the event, participants rated how positive and negative they felt at the time of the event’s occurrence and at the time of recall. They also completed scales assessing six psychological benefits (e.g., social connectedness, meaning in life). All procedures were completed online.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Experiment 2, 197 MTurk workers were assigned to recall either a nostalgic or an affectively neutral event. Participants again rated their emotions at both the time of the event and at recall, including not just general positive and negative affect but also 13 discrete emotions (e.g., gratitude, regret, loneliness). The aim was to assess how these discrete emotions changed over time and whether they helped explain shifts in overall affect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In both experiments, nostalgic memories diverged from the typical Fading Affect Bias pattern. Rather than becoming more emotionally neutral, nostalgic events became less positive and more negative over time. In Experiment 1, nostalgic events showed a significant decrease in positive affect and increase in negative affect from occurrence to recall, whereas ordinary events showed a decrease only in negative affect, consistent with the Fading Affect Bias. Nostalgic memories also remained more positive than ordinary memories overall, particularly at the time of the event, and this positivity was a plausible mediator of the psychological benefits associated with nostalgia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experiment 2 replicated these findings with a neutral-event control group. Nostalgic events again showed a fading of positive affect and an intensification of negative affect over time, unlike neutral events. Mediation analyses suggested that the emotional changes in nostalgic memories were linked to increases in specific emotions. In particular, increases in regret were linked to the decline in positive affect, while increases in loneliness mediated the rise in negative affect. Interestingly, gratitude increased over time and was a notable exception to the general fading trend, highlighting the complexity of nostalgia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors note that both studies relied on retrospective self-reports, which may be influenced by memory biases. While such designs are common in this area of research, prospective assessments could strengthen future findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/02699931.2025.2484646"&gt;Remembrance of things past: temporal change in the affective signature of nostalgic events&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Tim Wildschut, Constantine Sedikides, Bettina Zengel, and John J.

The immune system goes into overdrive and starts attacking healthy tissues and organs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This can cause a fever, rashes and inflammation in crucial organs such as the liver, lungs and kidneys. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Minocycline is&lt;span&gt; prescribed to around 1million Americans every year for &lt;/span&gt;various bacterial infections including pneumonia and in some cases, acne.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While facial acne is usually a result of hormonal imbalances and clogged pores, it can also be caused by bacteria on the skin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In Dunn's case, doctors struggled to pinpoint the cause of her deteriorating condition as her body continued to swell up and develop rashes for weeks at end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She recalled in a TikTok video: 'Every single one of [my] organs was shutting down and [doctors] told my parents that [I] was actually going to die.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As doctors scrambled to find out what was happening to Dunn, the then-teenager stopped breathing for about 30 minutes due to the severity of her condition and had to be put on assisted breathing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She told &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://people.com/teen-takes-acne-medication-briefly-dies-from-rare-drug-reaction-exclusive-11704952"&gt;PEOPLE&lt;/a&gt;: 'I remember just feeling like my body was shutting down. I had no idea what was happening to me, and neither did the doctors at first.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However two weeks later, doctors misdiagnosed her with Parvovirus - a contagious virus mainly affecting children that can cause facial rashes and a fever. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;DReSS symptoms can cause an outbreak of measles-like rashes all over the body. (Stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But she continued to remain in immense pain as her symptoms worsened over the next two months and had to return back to the hospital. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Eventually, a medical student realized that she was suffering from DReSS syndrome after they had spent a week learning about the disorder. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;DReSS syndrome is most commonly triggered by antibiotics and can be caused by any form of the anti-bacterial drug. &lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Its symptoms can cause an outbreak of measles-like rashes all over the body, high fever, increase in white blood cells in the blood, swelling in the lymph nodes and injuries to internal organs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The exact mechanisms of how the syndrome is triggered remains unknown but experts believe it is usually due to a combination of genetic factors and the immune system's response to certain drugs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists estimate that one in 10,000 suffer from the condition - out of which one in 10 die. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The syndrome is usually treated with a combination of topical steroid treatments and anti-inflammatory medication.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;In Dunn's case, as doctors scrambled to find out what was happening to her, the then-teenager stopped breathing for about 30 minutes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After her diagnosis, Dunn told the magazine: 'When they finally told me it was DReSS syndrome, I had never heard of it before. I had no idea an antibiotic for acne could do this to me.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Due to the severity of her condition, she was asked to use steroid treatments for weeks to suppress her immune system and stop the spread of the rashes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dunn now claims that she has since learned to be extremely cautious with medication and does not take any medication without checking with experts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Furthermore, she has also begun efforts to raise awareness about the syndrome and said: 'If my story can help even one person recognize signs early and get the right diagnosis, then it's worth sharing .'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 May 2025 17:50:22 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>FDA首次通过血液检测诊断阿尔茨海默病- AOL.com | FDA Clears First Blood Test to Diagnose Alzheimer’s Disease - AOL.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib0FVX3lxTFBXaDlSQ2hubm0zWGRFcWcyZzVJUWhnNm1jTFNzcDR6d1ZWbElLTzFmLVhXUkItU2ExdWJSVWd0eXNiVS1NUGh3UDkxcE1lM0R6dEg0VFBMZWIwUFJ5OTJMN3JzQk1fQnF1Mm1mVjNBQQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getty&lt;/p&gt;

They can take this test as a screening test,” he said. “This is a much more simple screening test, with reasonable accuracy, to tell the physician that a person with cognitive decline has symptoms that are actually due to Alzheimer’s disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the clearance is a step forward, Isaacson stressed that more research is necessary to determine how the blood test results should be interpreted and used to make medical decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://people.com/alzheimers-diagnosis-blood-test-fda-gives-clearance-11739232" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:People;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;People&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 May 2025 17:42:40 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMib0FVX3lxTFBXaDlSQ2hubm0zWGRFcWcyZzVJUWhnNm1jTFNzcDR6d1ZWbElLTzFmLVhXUkItU2ExdWJSVWd0eXNiVS1NUGh3UDkxcE1lM0R6dEg0VFBMZWIwUFJ5OTJMN3JzQk1fQnF1Mm1mVjNBQQ</guid></item><item><title>眼部检查可以区分帕金森氏症和继发性帕金森氏症-《今日帕金森新闻》 | Eye test can distinguish Parkinson’s from secondary parkinsonism - Parkinson's News Today</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilwFBVV95cUxNQ3hLdllxdDBLcWVucm9qeVk4QlNjUGdhTUZ2aUhuSkFjVW5KUWdKNWJPbjQ3NHh1RVhCUm9mb1pYckJJYnFsMDFSb1lCN2JzdDJla1RRU1NVT2ZINDFPa1ZmNi1RbVRRZUNfUUxBR3Y4MGxjSTRCbUJCUUp2MmtDRG9mVTllRVROYkFyWkRZMTFMRkF6NFFZ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="pf-content"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imaging of nerves in the eyes may be used to differentiate between &lt;a href="https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/what-is-parkinsons-disease/"&gt;Parkinson’s disease&lt;/a&gt; and secondary forms of parkinsonism, a new study shows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41531-025-00969-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Corneal confocal microscopy differentiates patients with secondary parkinsonism from idiopathic Parkinson’s disease&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,” was published in &lt;em&gt;NPJ Parkinson’s Disease&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Parkinson’s can cause abnormalities in nerves connecting eyes and brain&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parkinson’s disease is a neurodegenerative disorder &lt;a href="https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/what-causes-parkinsons-disease/"&gt;caused by the dysfunction&lt;/a&gt; and death of brain cells that are responsible for making the chemical messenger dopamine. Parkinson’s is marked by &lt;a href="https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/parkinsons-disease-symptoms/motor/"&gt;motor symptoms&lt;/a&gt; such as slowed movement, tremor, stiffness, and balance issues. Most people with Parkinson’s have idiopathic disease, meaning the underlying cause is not known.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/types-of-parkinsons-disease/#Secondary"&gt;Secondary parkinsonism&lt;/a&gt; refers to health conditions that can cause Parkinson’s-like motor symptoms, but are not actually Parkinson’s disease. Secondary parkinsonism can develop due to drugs or toxins, or because of problems with blood flow or fluid pressure in and around the brain. Since secondary parkinsonism is by definition characterized by symptoms that are similar to Parkinson’s disease, it can be difficult for clinicians to tell the two apart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Parkinson’s disease can cause abnormalities in the nerves that connect the eyes to the brain, which are generally less affected in secondary parkinsonism. These nerves can be visualized using a technique called corneal confocal microscopy, or CCM. In this study, scientists in China tested whether CCM might be used to reliably distinguish between true Parkinson’s disease and secondary parkinsonism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="bio-blockquote bio-blockquote--align-left"&gt;
  &lt;p class="bio-blockquote-text"&gt;CCM may have clinical utility as a rapid ophthalmic neuroimaging method for distinguishing patients with [secondary parkinsonism] from [Parkinson’s disease].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study included 45 people with idiopathic Parkinson’s disease and 25 with secondary parkinsonism. The researchers found patients with Parkinson’s had a lower density of nerve fibers detected by CCM than those with secondary parkinsonism. They also tended to have more branch-like protrusions on their nerves than those with secondary parkinsonism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To test if these CCM-based measures could distinguish between the two conditions, the researchers calculated a statistical value called the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). This is a statistical test of how well a measure (in this case, CCM) can distinguish between two groups, Parkinson’s or secondary parkinsonism in this study. AUC values can range from 0.5 to 1, with higher numbers reflecting better accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The AUC for CCM in this study was 0.924, suggesting high accuracy for distinguishing true Parkinson’s from secondary parkinsonism. The researchers noted they could get even better accuracy if they also included clinical measures like assessments of symptom severity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“CCM may have clinical utility as a rapid ophthalmic neuroimaging method for distinguishing patients with [secondary parkinsonism] from [Parkinson’s disease],” the scientists concluded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The treatment, called VERVE-102, could transform the future of heart attack prevention by dramatically reducing a person's levels of LDL cholesterol – the so-called ‘bad’ cholesterol – with just one injection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While statins can lower a person’s cholesterol levels by similar levels, these generally need to be taken daily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is the future,” &lt;a href="https://www.uclh.nhs.uk/our-services/find-consultant/professor-riyaz-patel"&gt;Prof Riyaz Patel&lt;/a&gt; – an academic cardiologist at University College London and a doctor at Barts Health NHS Trust, which has taken part in the trial – told &lt;em&gt;BBC Science Focus&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is reality; it’s not science fiction. We’re actually doing it. I’ve had patients of mine in the trial receive this one-and-done treatment, and it’s going to change the face of cholesterol management going forward.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of managing cholesterol over time like statins, VERVE-102 aims to provide a one-time fix by ‘switching off’ a specific gene, known as PCSK9, in the liver. This gene plays a key role in regulating how much LDL cholesterol the liver can detect and remove from the bloodstream. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Essentially, less PCSK9 leads to less LDL in the bloodstream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re seeing some spectacular results,” said Patel. “This drug turns off a tiny fraction of&lt;a href="https://www.sciencefocus.com/the-human-body/dna"&gt; DNA&lt;/a&gt;, and your LDL cholesterol is lower by 50 per cent for the rest of your life. That’s it. One and done. This is going to be revolutionary.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cholesterol can build up in the walls of blood vessels, forming plaques that may eventually rupture and block blood flow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High levels of LDL cholesterol increase the risk of this buildup, which is why millions of people (over 40 million in the US, and 7 million in the UK) take daily medications like statins to help keep their cholesterol levels under control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The VERVE-102 clinical trial involved 14 participants with familial hypercholesterolemia: a genetic condition that predisposes people to heart disease, heart attacks and strokes, due to very high LDL cholesterol levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initial results of the VERVE-102 injection indicate that all participants responded well to the medication, with no serious side effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Different doses led to different responses; the four individuals given the lowest dose of VERVE-102 saw average reductions in their LDL cholesterol of 21 per cent, while the middle cohort had reductions of 41 per cent, and the highest dose resulted in reductions of 53 per cent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But one participant, in the high-dose group, reduced their LDL cholesterol by 69 per cent after receiving VERVE-102.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Eugene Braunwald – Distinguished Hersey Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School, who was not personally involved in this study – added the initial trial data was “promising” and that it suggested “the potential for a new era of cardiovascular disease treatment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verve is currently recruiting participants in a further stage of their clinical trial, who will receive an even higher dose of VERVE-102, in the UK, Canada, Israel, Australia and New Zealand. It expects to announce its final results in the second half of 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

Using validated mental health screening tools, researchers found that 1 in 4 children had new anxiety symptoms and 1 in 7 had new depressive symptoms, despite no prior mental health history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These children reported a quality of life comparable to peers with serious illnesses like cancer or cystic fibrosis, with many expressing a deep sense of ineffectiveness and loss of confidence. The findings underscore the urgent need for integrated mental health screening and early intervention in pediatric long COVID care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Onset:&lt;/strong&gt; Nearly 40% of children with long COVID reported anxiety or depression; half had no prior diagnosis.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quality of Life:&lt;/strong&gt; Mental health impact was comparable to that of serious chronic illnesses.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Critical Risk:&lt;/strong&gt; A child’s sense of ineffectiveness was the strongest predictor of poor life quality.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Kennedy Krieger Institute&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new study from Kennedy Krieger Institute is calling attention to an emerging mental health crisis among children with long COVID. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers found that nearly 40% of pediatric patients with long COVID reported feeling significant symptoms of anxiety or depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study included 139 patients evaluated at Kennedy Krieger’s Pediatric Post-COVID-19 Rehabilitation Clinic. Clinicians used mental health screening surveys to assess symptoms reported by the patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The screenings also included measures of key aspects of quality of life including: physical functioning, emotional functioning, social functioning, and school functioning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 1 in 3 children reported that they were experiencing elevated symptoms of anxiety or depression (i.e. worry, sleep problems, and mood irritability).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dr. Laura Malone, director of the clinic and co-investigator in this research, says half of these children had no prior mental health concerns or diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Long COVID is a complex condition,” said Malone. “We’re seeing children and teens who were doing well before their COVID infection now struggling to attend school, socialize, or even enjoy basic activities.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Key findings include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1 in 4&lt;/strong&gt; children had new anxiety symptoms, and &lt;strong&gt;1 in 7&lt;/strong&gt; had new depressive symptoms, despite &lt;em&gt;no prior diagnosis&lt;/em&gt;—a sign long COVID is triggering new mental health challenges.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;On average, children reported a quality of life similar to peers with&lt;strong&gt; cancer or cystic fibrosis&lt;/strong&gt;, underscoring the severe functional impact of the condition.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The strongest predictor of poor quality of life was&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;a &lt;strong&gt;“sense of ineffectiveness&lt;/strong&gt;,” like feeling unable to succeed in life or enjoy activities.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These children are losing confidence in themselves and their ability to participate in daily life,” said Dr. Malone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That loss of function can be just as devastating as the physical symptoms. It is important to identify and treat both to improve quality of life for children with long COVID.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While previous studies have hinted at long COVID’s mental health toll, this is one of the first to use standardized, validated measures of mental health issues in a pediatric long COVID population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also warns that traditional screening tools may not capture the full picture, since physical symptoms of long COVID (like fatigue or dizziness) can overlap with those of anxiety or depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers at Kennedy Krieger urge healthcare providers to integrate routine mental health screening into care for children with long COVID. Early identification could mean faster access to the right interventions, therefore helping kids recover more quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this long COVID and mental health research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#d592b9b0b4a6babb81b4959eb0bbbbb0b1ac9ea7bcb0b2b0a7fbbaa7b2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Taylor Gleason&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://KennedyKrieger.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Kennedy Krieger Institute&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Taylor Gleason – Kennedy Krieger Institute&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;The findings will appear in &lt;em&gt;Journal of Psychology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 May 2025 16:28:33 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidEFVX3lxTFBkNnpUN0llRFRrZFp1by1KdXViOVp5R2sxNjBGNnlrVUkxTEtkTy01QnMwNXd1TnYxYVpUR1U4dkZMSC1SNnBWcW43aGM2RFJzLXE4aWdXUnplTlczQzA3TmNvMlZvUGdKX21WMDlCbzNacnVH</guid></item><item><title>专家说，昂贵的阿尔茨海默氏症生活方式计划提供了虚假的希望-纽约时报 | An Expensive Alzheimer’s Lifestyle Plan Offers False Hope, Experts Say - The New York Times</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijwFBVV95cUxNZ2ItcVVyblNKbEtyWUxFcGViNnE1RzFaWTNMdjh4UjZ2NUVwc3dYdk9QNFJaU1ZlWXdHYWE3bzhxLWlmeW9HV19KdUZsbzlCc1ZhY0RrTThuLW1PQ3FmTnVPUnZuWWxBbEJjUXEwOWpUUTlMTFN5aUVmOGNYa2FhYzUxaXBheFpOZUNNNXlHNA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-0"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Kerry Briggs had trouble keeping track of the supplements. To help, her husband, John Briggs, created a spreadsheet with rows for ashwagandha, Omega-3 and curcumin extract. There was ginseng, lion’s mane mushroom and the antioxidant liposomal glutathione, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Ms. Briggs, 64, had started taking the supplements last July, a daily regimen that grew to include 34 capsules and tablets along with two scoops of powder. When it became too much, Mr. Briggs began blending them into a shake, to which he added brown food coloring so it looked less like its natural “sickly” olive shade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Ms. Briggs was taking them all because a doctor had told her that with enough supplements and lifestyle modifications, her Alzheimer’s symptoms could not only be slowed, but reversed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;It is an idea that has become the focus of &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.cnn.com/videos/title-2538046" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;television specials&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://youtu.be/UyneMnERmnI?si=5JHTmPvmph-Qim_0&amp;amp;t=8760" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;popular podcasts&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://drtalks.com/summit/reverse-alzheimers/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;conferences&lt;/a&gt;; the sell behind mushroom supplements and self-help books.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;But the suggestion that Alzheimer’s can be reversed through lifestyle adjustments has outraged doctors and scientists in the medical establishment, who have repeatedly said that there is little to no proof for such a claim, and expressed concern that the idea could harm a large group of vulnerable Americans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Mr. Briggs had come across the idea after learning about Dale Bredesen, who had been performing a series of small and unconventional studies through which he claimed to have designed a set of guidelines to reverse Alzheimer’s symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-kbghgg"&gt;&lt;div class="css-121kum4"&gt;&lt;p class="css-171quhb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-asuuk5"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-7axq9l" data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true" class="css-1b5b8u1"&gt;&lt;path fill="currentColor" fill-rule="evenodd" d="M2.5 12a9.5 9.5 0 1 1 19 0 9.5 9.5 0 0 1-19 0Zm8.5 1.75v-7.5h2v7.5h-2Zm0 2v2h2v-2h-2Z" clip-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;div data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript-message" class="css-6yo1no"&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;We are having trouble retrieving the article content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dv1kvn" id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

              &lt;p&gt;A family vacation to Costa Rica turned sour after 12 of 13 relatives developed symptoms of a fungal lung infection following an excursion through bat-filled caves.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In season two of &lt;em&gt;The Last of Us&lt;/em&gt;, the cordyceps fungus—spoiler alert—becomes airborne, meaning the fungal infection can spread not just through bites but also when humans inhale its spores. While the TV show is highly fictitious, airborne fungi are most certainly not. A U.S. family now knows this better than most, since 12 of their members became ill after touring a bat cave in Costa Rica.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7417a1.htm"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; published Thursday in the journal Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, researchers described 12 confirmed or probable cases of &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/24811-histoplasmosis"&gt;histoplasmosis&lt;/a&gt;: a pulmonary infection caused by inhaling the fungus &lt;em&gt;Histoplasma capsulatum&lt;/em&gt;. This fungus lives in soil, frequently alongside bird or bat droppings, and can become airborne if the earth is disturbed. While symptoms are usually subtle, the infection can make infants and immunocompromised people vulnerable to more serious illnesses.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;During a vacation to Costa Rica in December of last year, 12 of 13 family members toured the bat-colonized Venado Caves, an ancient cave system and popular tourist destination. This essentially meant crawling through bat poop for two hours. When they returned to the U.S., everyone—except the one family member who hadn’t toured the cave—became ill to varying degrees, with symptoms including fever, headache, muscle pain, night sweats, respiratory problems, and gastrointestinal issues.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Five family members sought medical attention. Doctors tested four of them for fungal infections, and two tested positive for histoplasma. Two of the patients also had abnormal chest X-rays, one of which raised concern for possible lung cancer. After learning about their spelunking expedition, healthcare providers notified the CDC, which launched an investigation. Notably, the cave they had visited had also likely caused a histoplasmosis outbreak in 1998 and 1999.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Antigen testing for all four patients occurred within 1 month of symptom onset, the optimal time frame,” the team, led by CDC researchers, wrote in the report. “However, because antigen detection sensitivity for histoplasmosis is lower in patients with mild disease who are immunocompetent, the negative test results might have been false negatives.” In other words, given that it’s harder to detect histoplasmosis in healthy patients, the family members who tested negative might still have had histoplasmosis.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ultimately, doctors confirmed that one family member had histoplasmosis, eight members probably did, and three were suspected of having it. Fortunately, none of them became zombies—or had lung cancer—and within 28 days of exposure, they were all on their way to recovery. While doctors usually prescribe antifungal medication for patients with severe histoplasmosis, many cases in healthy individuals &lt;a href="https://www.lung.org/lung-health-diseases/lung-disease-lookup/histoplasmosis/treatment#:~:text=Most%20cases%20of%20histoplasmosis%20go,infection%20and%20your%20immune%20status."&gt;go away&lt;/a&gt; on their own.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Histoplasmosis is sometimes difficult to diagnose. As such, the researchers urge clinicians to “consider fungal illness in the differential diagnosis of patients with constitutional or pulmonary signs or symptoms after recent caving or other activities associated with risk for histoplasmosis,” they concluded. In collaboration with the U.S. Embassy in Costa Rica and the Costa Rica Ministry of Health, the CDC hopes to see the risk of histoplasmosis included in the Venado Caves tour waiver forms.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s not surprising that &lt;em&gt;The Last of Us&lt;/em&gt; is so popular. After all, Andrzej Sapkowski—author of &lt;em&gt;The Witcher&lt;/em&gt;—&lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/8205437-there-s-a-grain-of-truth-in-every-fairy-tale-love"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; that “there’s a grain of truth in every fairy tale.” That seems to hold true, even in a fungal zombie apocalypse.&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="99" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmay0hzjr000r3b778dpii073@published"&gt;The implications of your question trouble me. Do you think your husband is not entitled to self-pleasure? Would you be similarly offended to learn that he uses his … &lt;em&gt;hand&lt;/em&gt; to masturbate? How much control over his sexuality do you think you’re entitled to? You’re gay, so surely you’re aware of the widespread practice of open relationships within your tribe, right? Plenty of relationships survive not only their constituent partners masturbating, but partners having sex with other people, sometimes in large group settings. That’s enough to make a Fleshlight look about as threatening to a relationship as a flashlight.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="129" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmay0hzl4000s3b770qtsoeww@published"&gt;People seek pleasure from sources other than their primary partner for a number of reasons. Yeah, it may have something to do with dissatisfaction, but it just as easily might not. If you are indeed in a monogamous relationship, and I assume so given your reaction to your husband having sex with an inanimate object, maybe all he wants is some variety. People like novelty, and masturbating, even with a toy, is a way to experience it. You are better off going with your gut and what your husband tells you. If you think your sex life is active and fulfilling, it probably is. Unless you are oblivious to signs, you would know if there were an issue. Your husband likely has a healthy libido and an adventurous mind.&lt;/p&gt;

It seems that you do satisfy plenty already. No one can be everything. In the future, instead of confronting your husband over something that intimidates you sexually, you should express curiosity. What does he like about that object and why? Is there anything he’d like to try that the two of you aren’t doing? If you went as far as to ask him to incorporate the Fleshlight in your sex life, you’d be showing him the kind of acceptance that will likely make him comfortable communicating about such things. That could take the mystery out of the situation and make it so you don’t have to wonder if you should be concerned or whether you’re fulfilling his needs.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="72" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmay0i94e001l3b771vkno7vm@published"&gt;My husband, “Mike,” spent years fantasizing about a threesome with us and another woman. About six months ago, we met “Rachel” while we were out at a nightclub, and we really hit it off with her. Once, when the three of us were having some drinks at a party, my husband confessed his fantasy. Rachel is the adventurous type and said to say the word if we ever wanted to make Mike’s dream a reality.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="95" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmay0i94f001m3b772i8m3ihc@published"&gt;Mike’s birthday was nearly a month ago, and Rachel and I decided the threesome would be the perfect surprise. The trouble was, when the moment came, Mike COULD NOT get it up, which is completely unusual for him. No matter what we tried, he remained a limp noodle. Needless to say, everyone ended up sorely disappointed. But that isn’t the worst of it. Ever since then, my husband hasn’t been able to achieve an erection. I’ve suggested going to see a urologist, but Mike is so embarrassed and depressed that he refuses. Now I’m scared we’ll never have sex again! Help!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="182" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmay0i94f001p3b778aixvx8n@published"&gt;Maybe you start by letting Mike know that what he experienced is not uncommon at all. For as much as he wanted the threesome, and as much pleasure as it seemed to promise, years of fantasizing were leading up to that moment. That alone can make for a pressurized situation that promotes performance anxiety. Possibly compounding the situation was that you sprung it on him. You and Rachel had the best intentions for doing so and reason to assume that it would go in a mutually satisfying direction, but it didn’t. Anxiety, period, is a huge boner killer, and one can get stuck in a cycle of worrying about not getting hard, not being hard, and then worrying more about how it’s coming across. It can be difficult to break that cycle, no matter how hot the situation or even how affirming one’s partners are. It certainly helps when the partner(s) don’t buy into the anxiety or pressure, but there’s no guarantee that shrugging it off will actually help. Expressions of “sore” disappointment, though, almost certainly make an already fraught situation worse.&lt;/p&gt;

Knowing you have a little bit of extra lift can abate some of that nervousness and make it easier to perform. It might be that your husband doesn’t have much experience with PDE5 inhibitors since you report that his limpness during your failed threesome was “completely unusual for him.” (Granted, he may have discreetly popped a Viagra or Cialis in the past that you weren’t aware of.) If he has no experience with these drugs, he should get a prescription—they could be a game changer, and they’re easy enough to obtain online with minimal provider contact. I don’t necessarily condone having minimal contact with a provider, but it’s clear that a lot of guys are embarrassed about this stuff, and don’t like visiting the doctor regardless of the issue, so telehealth companies like Hims and Ro are taking a lot of the discomfort out of the process. Yeah, going to a urologist could help Mike—what you describe sounds like a circumstantial ED issue that has psychological roots, but hearing from a doctor that Mike isn’t broken and this issue is fixable could make a big difference. Still, if the guy won’t go, you can’t make him. Maybe you wait it out a bit more, let the problem remain persistent, and Mike may drop his resistance to the doctor. For a non-medical intervention in the meantime, he could try a cock ring. It’s not foolproof, but it may help.&lt;/p&gt;

Your sister wasn’t necessarily asking for a solution to her problem, just for your ear and compassion. It sounds like she is more on the emotional side, while you lean pragmatic. It makes a certain kind of sense that you bought her a sex toy, given her issues, and I’m sure you meant well. But you did this, by your own admission, because of her dating problems. She reacted emotionally, but a version of, “You bought this for me because I couldn’t get a man,” is the truth. The gift may have, in fact, reminded her of her dating frustrations primarily, so much so that it didn’t have a shot at ameliorating her sexual ones—if she even has those! She may not be having issues finding sex, or she may already have sex toys she uses and likes, rendering the potential usefulness of your gift moot.&lt;/p&gt;

It’s really never a safe bet to give someone a sex toy, unless you’re intimately involved with them and know they like them. Did you act incorrectly? Well, kinda. I think your intentions were pure, but not necessarily well thought out, and when it comes to giving gifts, it really is the thought that counts.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;em&gt;Editor’s note: The podcast Chasing Life With Dr. Sanjay Gupta explores the medical science behind some of life’s mysteries big and small. You can listen to episodes &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://link.chtbl.com/qKs4BcUV" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;here&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmax0u5nx00043b6moroo4sud@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Science has pretty well established that the brain isn’t static; it changes and adapts throughout our lives in response to life events in a process called &lt;a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/neuroplasticity" target="_blank"&gt;neuroplasticity&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmax6sriz000d3b6m9ch9bsca@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Researchers are discovering this is especially true of female brains, which get remodeled significantly during the three Ps: &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/05/health/teen-tween-developing-brains-wellness/index.html"&gt;puberty&lt;/a&gt; (as do the brains of adolescent males), pregnancy and &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/07/health/menopause-effect-brain-gupta-wellness"&gt;perimenopause&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmax6srj0000e3b6mmnui0c2u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            All three transitions are a frequent butt of pop-culture jokes: the  sulky, risk-taking teenager who only wants to be with friends; the scattered mom-to-be who leaves her cell phone in the fridge and can’t remember where she parked the car; and the hormonal middle-aged woman who can’t focus and spontaneously combusts with hot flashes.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmax6srj0000f3b6mdfseylyx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But far from being laughable, these behavioral stereotypes are the external manifestations of big internal shifts, many of them linked to the effects of fluctuating hormones on the brain.&lt;s&gt;&lt;/s&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmax6srj0000g3b6md9args8h@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Cognitive neuroscientist Laura Pritschet, a postdoctoral fellow in the department of psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania, is fascinated by how female hormones, including estrogen and progesterone, affect the brain’s organization and functioning.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmax6srj0000h3b6m7fpfz720@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The reason I chose that field is because I was a budding neuroscientist as an undergrad, interested in brain networks and obsessing over how intricate everything was in the brain to simply allow us to have a personality or remember things,” Pritschet told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta recently, on his podcast Chasing Life.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmax6srj0000i3b6m7u79h7fr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “At the same time in my personal life, I was surrounded by menopausal women who were talking about their cognitive complaints and their attention issues,” she said. “I thought we’ve got to connect these two together and understand this more.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmax6srj0000j3b6meb58bn78@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Pritschet even volunteered as a “guinea pig” during graduate school, having her brain scanned and blood drawn for 30 days, across two complete reproductive cycles (both on and off birth control pills), to begin to answer the question of how the day-to-day fluctuations in hormones relate to the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8975130/" target="_blank"&gt;day-to-day changes in the brain&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmax6srj0000k3b6m9s4axi0h@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Around this time, other researchers were studying what happens in the brain during pregnancy, Pritschet said, looking at the brain before and after gestation. They found many changes, but because the studies took a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27991897/" target="_blank"&gt;snapshot approach&lt;/a&gt;, many questions were left unanswered.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmax6srj0000l3b6mnr7gqlf5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “If there’s a 3 to 5% decrease in total gray matter volume, when is that occurring (during pregnancy), and how is it occurring?” Pritschet asked. “We’re missing huge gaps in what we call this metamorphosis.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmax6srj0000m3b6m5d3ucroc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;em&gt;“&lt;/em&gt;We know that the 40-week gestational window leads to these body adaptations to support the development of the fetus: We have increased plasma volume, immune function change, metabolic rate, oxygen consumption,” she said. “What does this trajectory look like over gestation?”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmax6srj0000n3b6m4tqk9xla@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            To find out, Pritschet and her team &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/16/health/how-pregnancy-changes-brain-study-wellness"&gt;tracked the brain changes&lt;/a&gt; in one woman, using MRI and blood draws, from pre-conception and fertility treatment throughout her pregnancy to two years postpartum. Their findings were published in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-024-01741-0" target="_blank"&gt;Nature Neuroscience&lt;/a&gt; in September.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “We saw this reduction in gray matter volume pretty much across the whole brain,” Pritschet explained. “We saw increased white matter microstructure and ventricle size.” (Quick anatomy lesson: The brain is made up of gray and white matter. Gray matter is where most of the brain’s thinking and processing takes place. White matter helps connect the different brain areas, allowing them to communicate with one another.)
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmax6wbtr000v3b6mchlf1wko@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The inflection point was birth,” Pritschet said. “We saw that those reductions persisted into postpartum, with slight recovery, meaning that certain areas of the brain showed this rise in gray matter volume in early postpartum. Others did not.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmax6wbtr000w3b6mfgdmmeob@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Pritschet said this “choreographed dance between major features of our brain” is in one respect a physical adaptation to the increased blood flow and swelling that comes with pregnancy.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmax6wbtr000x3b6mpj8vykm0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Additionally, the changes  may also be a preparation for the next stage: parenting.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmax6wbtr000y3b6mlbxtaxxf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s a fine-tuning of circuits,” she explained. “We know that pregnancy is the lead-up to this time in your life where there’s a lot of behavioral adaptation that has to occur, and new cognitive demands, and a new cognitive load.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmax6wbtr000z3b6m5rjtc4sa@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “And so the idea here is that there is this pruning or this delicate rewiring to make certain networks or to make communication in the brain more efficient to meet the demands that are going to have to occur,” Pritschet said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmax6wbtr00103b6mrusx1xhc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This theory is supported by earlier work. “The first pinnacle papers that came out looking at neuroanatomy in human women from preconception to postpartum found that degree of change in gray matter volume — that sort of reduction — correlated with various … maternal behaviors (such as bonding). Again, that’s all correlation,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmax6wbtr00113b6my42uf1re@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “That’s an area we need to do a lot more research on, and it needs a lot of context,” she said. “But you can expect that if there’s fine-tuning in these circuits that underlie cognitive or behavioral process, that the more fine-tuning it undergoes, the better performance you’re going to have. That’s the idea — but it’s so much more complicated than that.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmax6wbtr00123b6mnqa8qzmk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;em&gt;W&lt;/em&gt;hat    happens to the brain during pregnancy? Pritschet offers these three insights.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmax6wbtr00133b6mwxox03ed@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The body is the outward sign of a lot of inner upheaval.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmax6wbtr00143b6m5rfnesmz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Pregnancy is a transformative time in a person’s life where the body undergoes rapid physiological adaptations to prepare for motherhood,” Pritschet said via email. “But pregnancy doesn’t just transform the body — it also triggers profound change to the brain and reflects another critical period of brain development.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmax6wbtr00153b6msg6kzdpl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            She called this remodeling   an often-overlooked period of brain development that takes place well into a woman’s adulthood.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmax6wbtr00163b6mr79by7ww@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Less gray matter may not sound very positive, but it happens for a reason.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmax6wbtr00173b6mfyywoaz1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Despite what one might think, these reductions are not a bad thing, and in fact, are to be expected,” Pritschet said, noting that some of the losses are eventually regained. “This change could indicate a ‘fine-tuning’ of brain circuits, not unlike what happens to all young adults as they transition through puberty and their brain becomes more specialized.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmax6wbtr00183b6miv7xuri0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            These changes could also be a response to the high physiological demands of pregnancy itself, she said, “showcasing just how adaptive the brain can be.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h3 class="subheader inline-placeholder subheader-elevate" data-editable="text" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/subheader/instances/cmax6wc6d001e3b6mnfyb8w86@published" data-component-name="subheader" id="these-changes-could-affect-future-health-and-behavior" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
        These changes could affect future health and behavior
&lt;/h3&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmax6wbtr00193b6m9csq3658@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Mapping these changes could open the door to understanding an array of other neurological and behavioral outcomes including postpartum depression, headaches, migraines, epilepsy, stroke and parental behavior.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmax6wbtr001a3b6ma4tqkavx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The neuroanatomical changes that unfold during (pregnancy) have broad implications for understanding vulnerability to mental health disorders … and individual differences in parental behavior,” said Pritschet.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmax6wbtr001b3b6mkcyjtpwc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It may even provide critical insight into how the brain changes over a lifespan, she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

She lives alone and insists she’s “just fine,” but I can see she’s slipping -- physically, mentally and emotionally. She has high blood pressure, diabetes and serious arthritis, but she won’t stay on her medications. She hasn’t been to a primary care doctor in over five years. She flat-out refuses cancer screenings or even basic lab work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-1" data-gaid="inarticle-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="R4WIVT64Z5HLDM3AKZLE3UCKDI"&gt;Lately, I’ve noticed what could be signs of early dementia -- getting lost on familiar roads, forgetting appointments, struggling to follow conversations. I finally got her to see a neurologist last fall, and they recommended a brain scan and further testing. She never followed through. Now she’s barely leaving the house and won’t let me bring in any outside help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-2" data-gaid="inarticle-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="MAD6VREZNJFHZHD33HUSQM5HQM"&gt;I’ve tried small changes to keep her safe -- grab bars in the bathroom, meal deliveries, even offering to go with her to doctor appointments. Every single time, she shuts me down with, “Don’t start” or, “I’m not an invalid.” She’s isolating more and her mobility is getting worse. I’m scared she’s going to fall or end up in the ER with something that could’ve been managed earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-3" data-gaid="inarticle-3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="VKRTX7T7GJEJXI5TKSZF34HADA"&gt;How do I respect her independence while also not sitting back and watching her decline? -- Worried and Worn Out&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-4" data-gaid="inarticle-4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="QUL4AH3HQRH2TO6X3R73NPXRIY"&gt;DEAR WORRIED: You are carrying a heavy burden, and I commend your patience and devotion. But here’s the hard truth: You can bring a horse to water, but you can’t make it drink. No matter how much you care or how hard you try, you cannot force your mother to seek help if she refuses it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-5" class="middleParagraph" data-gaid="inarticle-5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="IFL4BN2QTBDX5PTI5JAAIHKORI"&gt;What you &lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt; do is focus on safety. Make the home as secure and fall-proof as possible. Consider a home health consultation or speak with her primary care physician about ways to support her from a distance.

The scan, which takes just 8 minutes, detects brain lesions centered on veins—a hallmark of MS—using a technique called T2*-weighted MRI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers introduced a simple diagnostic guideline known as the “rule of six,” confirming MS if six vein-centered lesions are found. This method not only improves patient comfort and reduces diagnostic delays but could also save healthcare systems millions by reducing hospital stays and complications from lumbar punctures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Non-Invasive Diagnosis:&lt;/strong&gt; The 8-minute MRI replaces the need for painful lumbar punctures.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‘Rule of Six’:&lt;/strong&gt; Finding six vein-centered brain lesions confirms MS diagnosis.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cost and Time Savings:&lt;/strong&gt; Could save the NHS up to £5 million annually and speed up diagnosis by 3 months.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Nottingham&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Experts from the University of Nottingham have proven that multiple sclerosis (MS) can successfully be diagnosed using an MRI scan, meaning patients no longer need to undergo a painful lumbar puncture.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the new study, published in&lt;a href="https://tracking.nottingham.ac.uk/tracking/click?d=6YgN0DFQukPrBk1uG7SxtALcKtt2EvxsLokElavOHZDGzHyAa6JSlRDrxnK_c2pm89Rj0wPefihwqAUR-WfWEwk6sWrXM5T-YLVLUj6bgScuSf_jfL6tpUonbgB2vU9Gt3cvT52lVHXbtlWkFn0OAuJdnIUBEX7va0nHL8K2ld_hegOT7p2IwyyZRxdGHhTg-w2"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;Neurology&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Open Access&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://tracking.nottingham.ac.uk/tracking/click?d=6YgN0DFQukPrBk1uG7SxtALcKtt2EvxsLokElavOHZDGzHyAa6JSlRDrxnK_c2pm89Rj0wPefihwqAUR-WfWEwk6sWrXM5T-YLVLUj6bgScIpMCJLRFmrDuBtNOkBwr2LXYTSqoOGghZrcfqqiQodlMYO_1SFiU7aVsJj6OSE02gEj_5nj0h-f8eIFCJHjy5aA2"&gt;, &lt;/a&gt;an official journal of the American Academy of Neurology, experts from the School of Medicine found that by using a new MRI scan, they could successfully diagnose MS in 8 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-110232"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-scan-Ms-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-scan-Ms-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-scan-Ms-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-scan-Ms-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-scan-Ms-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-scan-Ms-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-scan-Ms-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-scan-Ms-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-scan-Ms-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-scan-Ms-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-scan-Ms-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-scan-Ms-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-scan-Ms-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-scan-Ms-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-scan-Ms-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The results show that the use of the T2*-weighted MRI along with the ‘rule of six’, supported the diagnosis of MS as an alternative to a lumbar puncture. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings could provide the NHS with a scientific approach to diagnosing MS which is safer, more cost effective and more importantly acceptable to patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was funded by the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MS is a neurological condition which affects around 150,000 people in the UK. It is notoriously difficult to diagnose as it has many symptoms but not all sufferers experience all of them and the disease can progress at different rates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is currently no agreement on the best way to diagnose MS. Frequently, people suspected of having MS have a standard MRI scan and undergo a lumbar puncture, where a thin needle is inserted between the bones in the lower spine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patients often report they find it painful, and it can cause unintended complications requiring hospitalisation or time off work to recover. Although the fluid taken during a lumbar puncture can show evidence of disease, this is not always the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abnormalities are not found in everyone who has MS. Some people with conditions that can mimic MS, but need very different treatment, have similar lumbar puncture abnormalities. Both problems can lead to misdiagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lead author of the study, Professor Nikos Evangelou, Clinical Professor of Neurology at the University said: “More than half of all people diagnosed with MS in the UK have had at least one lumbar puncture, following the suspicion of MS diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings of our research are particularly exciting as we have now shown that we can give the diagnosis of MS without this painful procedure.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team used a clinical MRI scanner, of the type all neuroscience centres have, to carry out a special type of scan called a T2*-weighted MRI which is able to reveal lesions in the brain’s white matter that are centred on a vein &lt;em&gt;—&lt;/em&gt; a known indicator of MS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a conclusive diagnosis of MS, the team developed the ‘rule of six’, whereby if there were six lesions found with a central vein, this confirmed a diagnosis of MS without having to analyse all lesions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team carried out a prospective study, in Nottingham, Cardiff and London with patients who had a suspected, but not definite diagnosis of MS. Each patient was given an 8-minute MRI scan and a lumbar puncture and after 18 months, they were able to find out what the diagnosis was and whether it matched that of their initial scan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results show that the use of the T2*-weighted MRI along with the ‘rule of six’, supported the diagnosis of MS as an alternative to a lumbar puncture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result of this study and previous research conducted in Nottingham and in the USA the International Committee for the diagnosis of MS, recently announced that the MRI scan, as first proposed by the Nottingham research team, is enough to diagnose MS. A lumbar puncture is no longer needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Evangelou adds: “Not only will our findings have huge benefits for patients, but it will also mean cost savings for the NHS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People who have lumbar punctures are required to spend at least most of a day in hospital, and for a health service already at capacity, this creates more issues. If there are complications with the lumbar puncture the stay can be longer. With the MRI scan, it takes 8 minutes, is completely safe, and then you can go home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“On average, we think we will reach the diagnosis three months earlier and the change could save the NHS up to five million pounds each year, which can be reinvested in better services for our MS patients.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this MS and neuroimaging research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#97f4fff6e5fbf8e3e3f2b9e0f6fbfbd7f9f8e3e3fef9f0fff6fab9f6f4b9e2fc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Charlotte Wall&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://nottingham.ac.uk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Nottingham&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Charlotte Wall – University of Nottingham&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1212/WN9.0000000000000017" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Comparison of the Diagnostic Performance of the Central Vein Sign and CSF Oligoclonal Bands Supporting the Diagnosis of Multiple Sclerosis&lt;/a&gt;” by Nikos Evangelou et al. &lt;em&gt;Neurology Open Access&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Comparison of the Diagnostic Performance of the Central Vein Sign and CSF Oligoclonal Bands Supporting the Diagnosis of Multiple Sclerosis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Background and Objectives&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The central vein sign (CVS) describes the presence of venules within multiple sclerosis (MS) brain lesions, visible on T2*-weighted MRI. In the upcoming revision of the MS diagnostic criteria, the simplified “rule of 6” (i.e., finding 6 lesions with a central venule) can support the diagnosis of MS as an alternative to lumbar puncture (LP).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We evaluated whether a T2*-weighted MRI scan is more sensitive than oligoclonal bands (OCBs) for diagnosing MS at presentation with a typical clinically isolated syndrome (CIS). We also compared the tolerability of LP and the additional MRI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants requiring an LP to meet the 2017 McDonald diagnostic criteria for MS were enrolled in this multicenter, prospective, diagnostic superiority study from 3 UK neuroscience centers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A six-minute T2*-weighted sequence was used to assess the CVS using 2 definitions: a 40% threshold of all eligible lesions and the rule of 6. These were compared with OCBs, using the clinical diagnosis at 18 months as the reference standard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of 113 participants, 99 (mean age: 38, female: 73%) have completed all study activities: 80 were diagnosed with MS, 10 remained CIS, 8 had alternative diagnoses, and 1 remained without a diagnosis. No significant difference in diagnostic sensitivity was detected between 40% CVS threshold (90% [CI 81%–96%]) and OCB testing (84% [CI 74%–91%]) (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.332).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rule of 6 had a sensitivity of 91% (CI 83%–96%). Side effects were reported by 75% following LP compared with 9% following MRI. All participants preferred their MRI scan over their LP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Discussion&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;CVS and OCB testing is equally sensitive in supporting the diagnosis of MS in cases of typical CIS. CVS assessed using the 40% threshold, and the simpler rule of 6 produces equivalent diagnostic performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compared with OCB testing, CVS testing seems safer and better tolerated by patients. Further studies are needed to evaluate CVS specificity, particularly outside of typical CIS cases, as studied here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Classification of Evidence&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study provides Class IV evidence that CSF OCBs and the CVS are equally sensitive in supporting a diagnosis of MS in patients presenting with CIS.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 May 2025 15:24:21 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiZkFVX3lxTE5zVkhQZ1dDMFI3V2dLOUMwSVBZOEhUQ2VhUHU5T29jTHEtNmpwcGV0Vy1xb1dvSTdLWW1STHZoZzc4ZENQbWdsTW9kNktmSjU5dFpBbU11VUhQWjFZQ2hSb2RxaEV3QQ</guid></item><item><title>优于Ozempic ：科学家揭示最有效的减肥药物- SciTechDaily | Better Than Ozempic: Scientists Reveal Most Effective Weight Loss Drug - SciTechDaily</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimwFBVV95cUxQbmdWSVcxNlNCZ3NmbkRpR2Fma0RhOE1WRE1rQnhfaEs3X2twVUhTTUtITVcwVWhCWHhqZHBtcWR4aC1WM283MEJwRy1leVlLMUtHZi0wc2tXa1ZNVjZ1Z3hxQmdQZHd4bWVPX2thblBQTjdIZlp2TWdkNFNhZGV1QjBaZDg0TVd1bUthNi1uV0FlaWU4NExGZDE2SQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SciTechDaily</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 May 2025 15:06:23 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimwFBVV95cUxQbmdWSVcxNlNCZ3NmbkRpR2Fma0RhOE1WRE1rQnhfaEs3X2twVUhTTUtITVcwVWhCWHhqZHBtcWR4aC1WM283MEJwRy1leVlLMUtHZi0wc2tXa1ZNVjZ1Z3hxQmdQZHd4bWVPX2thblBQTjdIZlp2TWdkNFNhZGV1QjBaZDg0TVd1bUthNi1uV0FlaWU4NExGZDE2SQ</guid></item><item><title>官员警告说，在大都会人寿体育场举行的夏奇拉音乐会上潜在的麻疹暴露- NBC新闻 | Officials warn of potential measles exposure at Shakira concert at MetLife Stadium - NBC News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinwFBVV95cUxNSnBLSWlOTzVnYl85U3IzR3lVNmhZQ0JMNm16cllyY1BvSGZfS0J5TFB2UGZpSHF0OWhRTHFfc0Fyblh5b3c0a0tKN011ZUdGYmxKNzc5MWlwYlFMazJpcWJhWUFmSjVOS1Y1WEdBWWJxOFBhTFJtdmtpSHVjaVJweU5iLTZYTGVyeW05Qm1KLWZnNnNBX05vRmtsVVVRU2fSAVZBVV95cUxOcXMtTGhHSnZCUHJRUW1STXo4ZEdvcDlGcE1laHoxV2FTTGVmZW85YTUwQzQ1VzdFemExUVVqdmVVMmFyMHo5MTljWWo0ZnQ5UjhpbUJkZw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body__content"&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;New Jersey health officials issued a warning about a potential measles exposure during &lt;a href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/how-to-get-to-shakira-concerts-metlife-njtransit-strike/4185716/" target="_blank"&gt;the Shakira concert at MetLife Stadium&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;On Tuesday, the New Jersey Department of Health (NJDOH) announced that a non-New Jersey resident attended the concert while infected with the disease.

Anyone who was exposed at the concert could develop symptoms as late as June 6.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Those who are at risk of being infected by the measles are people who have not been fully vaccinated or have not had measles in the past. The MMR vaccine — which is administered in two doses — is the safest and most effective way to protect yourself against measles, mumps and rubella. The vaccine also prevents complications caused by those three diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Health officials recommend that residents stay up to date on routine vaccinations, including MMR shots. Anyone traveling internationally should also be fully vaccinated before traveling and babies between 6 months and 11 months should get one dose of the MMR vaccine before traveling and two more doses after their first birthday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Measles symptoms include a high fever, cough, runny nose, watery red eyes and a rash that usually appears between three to five days after symptoms begin. The rash normally begins as flat red spots that appear on the face at the hairline and spread downward to the neck, torso, arms, legs and feet. Measles can also cause pneumonia and swelling of the brain. It can also lead to miscarriage in pregnant people, premature birth or a low-birth-weight baby, officials said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="endmark body-graf"&gt;The virus spreads through the air when someone coughs or sneezes and can remain in the air for up to two hours after an infected person leaves the area. People can also get sick when they come in contact with mucus or saliva from an infected person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 May 2025 15:06:05 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinwFBVV95cUxNSnBLSWlOTzVnYl85U3IzR3lVNmhZQ0JMNm16cllyY1BvSGZfS0J5TFB2UGZpSHF0OWhRTHFfc0Fyblh5b3c0a0tKN011ZUdGYmxKNzc5MWlwYlFMazJpcWJhWUFmSjVOS1Y1WEdBWWJxOFBhTFJtdmtpSHVjaVJweU5iLTZYTGVyeW05Qm1KLWZnNnNBX05vRmtsVVVRU2fSAVZBVV95cUxOcXMtTGhHSnZCUHJRUW1STXo4ZEdvcDlGcE1laHoxV2FTTGVmZW85YTUwQzQ1VzdFemExUVVqdmVVMmFyMHo5MTljWWo0ZnQ5UjhpbUJkZw</guid></item><item><title>科学家为大脑和脊髓中的细胞设计基因递送系统-美国国立卫生研究院(NIH) (.gov) | Scientists design gene delivery systems for cells in the brain and spinal cord - National Institutes of Health (NIH) (.gov)</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirgFBVV95cUxQODNCRjNLeXd3eXFWaDEzTXlFZ1J3YlVYdFJkZnhTTENLSURtQ1NQR3V5c1BiclF5QVkwSXlhX3lSckI4Y0pqYk9ERVlMMHFPYUFSYTBVc3h5VVNkdHM3UGk5TGRPM0pfNEFBVjZldHZMNGlVN3ZHU3Z4SGFtOVl1QlRLR1kzR2tOblZ6X1RfeE40alhQTUl5aUlrUm9xWjZxcjh4d0tNano5OFduVmc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div about="/news-events/news-releases/scientists-design-gene-delivery-systems-cells-brain-spinal-cord" typeof="sioc:Item foaf:Document" role="article" class="ds-1col node node--nih-news-release news-release featured-media-floated node--full node--nih-news-release--full view-mode-full node--full node--nih-news-release--full clearfix"&gt;

  
  &lt;p class="publishdate"&gt;&lt;span class="tag-term"&gt;News Release&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="publishdate"&gt;&lt;span property="dc:date" datatype="xsd:dateTime" content="2025-05-21T11:00:00-04:00" class="date-display-single"&gt;Wednesday, May 21, 2025&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Scientists design gene delivery systems for cells in the brain and spinal cord&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;
NIH-funded breakthrough could enable targeted therapies for many neurological disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research teams funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) have created a versatile set of gene delivery systems that can reach different neural cell types in the human brain and spinal cord with exceptional accuracy. These delivery systems are a significant step toward future precise gene therapy to the brain that could safely control errant brain activity with high precision. In contrast, current therapies for brain disorders mostly treat only symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new delivery systems carry genetic material into the brain and spinal cord for targeted use by specific cell types. This platform has the potential to transform how scientists can study neural circuits. It provides researchers with gene delivery systems for various species used in research, without the need for genetically modified, or transgenic, animals. Examples include illuminating fine structures of brain cells with fluorescent proteins and activating or silencing circuits that control behavior and cognition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Imagine this new platform as a delivery truck dropping off specialized genetic packages in specific cell neighborhoods in the brain and spinal cord,” said John Ngai, Director of the NIH’s &lt;em&gt;Brain Research Through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies® &lt;/em&gt;Initiative, or The BRAIN Initiative&lt;em&gt;®&lt;/em&gt;. “With these delivery systems, we can now access and manipulate specific cells in the brain and spinal cord – access that was not possible before at this scale.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new delivery tools, which use a small, stripped-down adeno-associated virus (AAV) to deliver DNA to target cells, can be broadly applied across many species and experimental systems, including small tissue samples removed during human brain surgeries. The delivery systems have been tested, or validated, in intact living systems, which is an important step for introducing new tools for widespread use. The newly published toolkit includes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class="spaced"&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Dozens of delivery systems that selectively target key brain cell types, including excitatory neurons, inhibitory interneurons, striatal and cortical subtypes, brain blood vessel cells, and hard-to-reach neurons in the spinal cord that control body movement and are damaged in several neurological diseases, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and spinal muscular atrophy&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Computer programs powered by artificial intelligence (AI) that can identify genetic “light switches,” known as enhancers, that turn genes on in specific brain cell types, using data from many different species – cutting considerable time and effort for scientists looking for these genetic switches.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, this collection of research tools will significantly accelerate understanding of the human brain. Importantly, the toolkit enables access to specific brain cell types in the prefrontal cortex, an area that’s critical for decision-making and uniquely human traits. With other tools in the collection, scientists can better study individual cells and communication pathways known to be affected in several neurological diseases. These include seizure disorders, ALS, Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, and Huntington’s disease – as well as various neuropsychiatric conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AAV-based treatments are already approved for some conditions, such as spinal muscular atrophy for which a 2016 approval of a gene therapy known as Zolgensma transformed the lives of infants and young children who once faced severe disability or early death. The new collection of gene delivery resources lays the groundwork for more precise treatments that target only affected cells in the brain, spinal cord, or brain blood vessels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The toolkit is available at distribution centers including &lt;a href="https://www.addgene.org/collections/brain-armamentarium/"&gt;Addgene&lt;/a&gt;, a global supplier of genetic research tools. This collection of publications offers researchers standard operating procedures and user guides for these tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The work is supported by the NIH’s &lt;em&gt;Brain Research Through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies® &lt;/em&gt;Initiative, or The BRAIN Initiative&lt;em&gt;®&lt;/em&gt;. Funding issued less than four years ago launched a large-scale, team-run project to design new molecular tools that can be useful to many research laboratories. The &lt;a href="https://braininitiative.nih.gov/research/tools-and-technologies-brain-cells-and-circuits/armamentarium-precision-brain-cell-access"&gt;Armamentarium for Precision Brain Cell Access&lt;/a&gt; aims to develop precise and reproducible access to cells and circuits in experimental research models of the brain and spinal cord. The large-scale project brings together experts in the field of molecular biology, neuroscience, and artificial intelligence (AI). The eight papers appear in the May 21 issue of the journals &lt;em&gt;Neuron&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Cell, Cell Reports, Cell Genomics, and Cell Reports Methods&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;A common class of antidepressant medications might be even more useful than we thought. Research out today suggests that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or SSRIs, can fend off cancer and boost the immune system’s defenses against it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scientists at the University of California, Los Angeles, led the study, &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(25)00502-1"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in Cell. In mice and other lab experiments, they found that SSRIs shrunk a variety of cancers, improved the immune system’s ability to kill cancer cells, and bolstered the effectiveness of immunotherapy. The researchers now hope to conduct clinical trials of SSRIs for cancer in humans.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Serotonin, a hormone with many important functions, has a &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ctm2.1750"&gt;complicated relationship&lt;/a&gt; with cancer. While it appears to promote the growth of certain tumor types, it also seems to enhance our immune response to cancer. Accordingly, scientists have hoped that existing drugs that interact with serotonin, including many antidepressants, could be repurposed to fight cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Several years ago, the UCLA researchers &lt;a href="https://stemcell.ucla.edu/news/drug-commonly-used-antidepressant-helps-fight-cancer-mice"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; a study showing MAO inhibitors—early generation antidepressants that regulate serotonin by inhibiting MAO—had an anticancer effect in mice. But these older drugs can cause serious side effects and interact badly with many other drugs or foods. So the researchers next decided to see if they could find a similar effect by targeting a different protein that interacts with serotonin, SERT. And as luck would have it, we already have existing and safer drugs that can inhibit SERT, the SSRIs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers used SSRIs on mouse and human models of several different cancers (some mice were given cancers derived from human cells, for instance): melanoma, breast, prostate, colon, and bladder cancer. On average, the treatment reduced the size of these tumors by more than 50%. Looking closer, the team also found that SSRIs appeared to make certain immune cells—killer T cells—better at recognizing and killing cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It turns out SSRIs don’t just make our brains happier; they also make our T cells happier—even while they’re fighting tumors,” said senior study researcher Lili Yang, a professor of microbiology, immunology and molecular genetics at UCLA, in a &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1084293"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; from the university. “SSRIs made the killer T cells happier in the otherwise oppressive tumor environment by increasing their access to serotonin signals, reinvigorating them to fight and kill cancer cells.”&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Yang and her team then paired SSRIs with another treatment that boosts the immune system’s response against cancer, immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy; these drugs work by inhibiting certain proteins that normally keep immune cells from attacking tumors. In tests with mice, the combination further shrunk melanoma and colon cancer tumors, and in some cases, it even seemed to completely eradicate the cancer.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So far, the findings come from mice and other lab experiments, so we’re still a long way from SSRIs being the next big thing in cancer treatment. But the fact that these drugs are already approved to treat depression is an added boon, the authors say. Compared to experimental treatments, for instance, it would take much less money and resources to develop and potentially win approval of SSRIs for cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;UCLA, on behalf of the lead researchers, has filed a patent covering their combination approach, and the team is next looking to put their hypothesis to the test in an actual human trial.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Our goal is to design a clinical trial to compare treatment outcomes between cancer patients who take these medications and those who do not,” said Yang, also a researcher at UCLA’s Goodman-Luskin Microbiome Center and the Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With any luck, the same drugs that help ward off the blues can also become part of our arsenal against cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

Loneliness was closely tied to a cluster of defensive symptoms—pain, fatigue, and low mood—which were especially severe among the poor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study found that social connection helped reduce these symptoms, but the protective effects were strongest for those living in poverty. These findings suggest that social relationships are crucial to buffering the health impacts of economic disadvantage and highlight the need for targeted community support in low-income populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Income-Loneliness Gap:&lt;/strong&gt; 49% of low-income individuals felt lonely vs. 15% of high-income peers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Health Toll:&lt;/strong&gt; Lonely people in poverty showed the highest levels of pain, fatigue, and low mood.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Social Buffering:&lt;/strong&gt; Strong relationships most effectively reduced symptoms in the poorest groups.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Oxford University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new study from the University of Oxford, published in &lt;em&gt;Public Health&lt;/em&gt;, shows that European people in the lowest income deciles are much more likely to feel lonely than those in the highest income deciles, despite no difference in how often they socialise. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, both poverty and loneliness were strongly associated with higher scores on a defensive symptom cluster characterised by elevated levels of pain, fatigue and low mood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also showed that the symptom-reducing effects of social connection were strongest for people living in poverty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-110228"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/poverty-loneliness-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/poverty-loneliness-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/poverty-loneliness-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/poverty-loneliness-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/poverty-loneliness-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/poverty-loneliness-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/poverty-loneliness-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/poverty-loneliness-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows two lonely people." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/poverty-loneliness-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/poverty-loneliness-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/poverty-loneliness-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/poverty-loneliness-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/poverty-loneliness-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/poverty-loneliness-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/poverty-loneliness-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The relationships observed between income level, loneliness and the symptom cluster held even when accounting for things like living arrangements and marital status. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings have important implications for social, economic, and health policy, suggesting that strong social relationships may serve as important buffers against some of the health consequences of poverty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The defensive symptom cluster refers to set of frequently co-occurring and mutually reinforcing symptoms that, understood from an evolutionary perspective, represent the body’s response to danger and scarcity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Humans evolved in groups which provided access to resources and protection from danger; when we feel socially excluded or isolated our bodies respond with a set of symptoms that are meant to protect us, for example pain helps protect us from injury, and fatigue and low mood may help us conserve energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers, led by Dr Arran Davis of the School of Anthropology and Museum Ethnography, University of Oxford, examined data from a survey of 24,505 respondents across 20 European countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Key findings include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;People in the lowest income decile were much likely to report feeling lonely in the last week than people in the highest income decile; 49% compared to just 15%. This is despite there being no difference in the amount of time people in different income deciles reported socialising with family, friends, and colleagues.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;People who report feeling lonely have, on average, higher scores on the symptom cluster. The average lonely person has a symptom cluster score that is higher than 67% of not lonely people. However, the difference in the average symptom cluster score between lonely people and not lonely people is significantly larger in the lowest income decile than the highest income decile. The average lonely person in the lowest income decile has a symptom cluster score higher than 73% of non-lonely people in the same income decile. In the highest income decile, the average lonely person has a higher symptom cluster score than 65% of non-lonely people.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;30% of lonely individuals from the lowest income decile had high symptom cluster scores compared with just 2% of non-lonely people in the highest income decile, suggesting that social relationships play a particularly important role in influencing the health outcomes of people living in poverty.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The relationships observed between income level, loneliness and the symptom cluster held even when accounting for things like living arrangements and marital status.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Past research has identified supportive social relationships as buffers to the negative effects of poverty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings from this study suggest that as material resources decrease the importance of social resources increase, with those who are both in poverty and lonely displaying the highest symptom cluster scores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lead author, evolutionary anthropologist, Dr Arran Davis said:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The relationship between poverty and poor health is well established, and previous research suggests that loneliness may be as bad for you as smoking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our study shows that for people who are both on low incomes and lonely the health costs are particularly marked. I hope this study inspires more research into the factors that lead people to feel socially disconnected and to the development of policies that support strong communities in socioeconomically disadvantaged areas.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this poverty and loneliness research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#5a36332020333f743e2f342e323528343f1a3b3e373334743522743b39742f31" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Lizzie Dunthorne&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://ox.ac.uk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Oxford University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Lizzie Dunthorne – Oxford University&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.puhe.2025.02.037" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Associations amongst poverty, loneliness, and a defensive symptom cluster characterised by pain, fatigue, and low mood&lt;/a&gt;” by Arran Davis et al. &lt;em&gt;Public Health&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Associations amongst poverty, loneliness, and a defensive symptom cluster characterised by pain, fatigue, and low mood&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="sectitle0015"&gt;Objective&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perceived social isolation is associated with increased pain, fatigue, and depression. Other research has shown that pain and depression are more common in individuals experiencing low socio-economic status, and that social relationships are especially important for buffering the negative health effects of low socio-economic status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="sectitle0014"&gt;Study design&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cross-sectional.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="sectitle0020"&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We used a 20-country, cross-sectional sample of 24,504 respondents to the European Social Survey 7. Multilevel linear regression was used to test for the effects of loneliness, income decile, and their interaction on a symptom cluster variable that was the average of respondent &lt;em&gt;z&lt;/em&gt;-scores on self-reported pain, fatigue, and low mood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We hypothesised that loneliness and low income would be interactively associated with higher symptom cluster scores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="sectitle0025"&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those from lower income deciles were much more likely to feel lonely (48.7 % in the lowest income decile; 15.2 % in the highest income decile), despite no differences in reported time spent socialising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Multilevel linear regression indicated statistically significant associations consistent with our hypotheses: (1) lonely individuals score 0.447 &lt;em&gt;SD&lt;/em&gt; higher on the symptom cluster, (2) for every increase in income decile, symptom cluster scores decrease by 0.022 &lt;em&gt;SD&lt;/em&gt;, and (3) a loneliness by income interaction on the symptom cluster (&lt;em&gt;b&lt;/em&gt; = −0.018), with the association between loneliness and the symptom cluster being strongest amongst those in lower income deciles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="sectitle0030"&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both loneliness and low income were associated with higher scores on the symptom cluster, and social relationships were especially strong buffers of the symptom cluster for individuals experiencing poverty.

The Colombian singer‚Äôs show at the MetLife Stadium on May 15 could prove to be the epicenter of a major superspreader event after health officials identified a concertgoer ‚Äúassociated with a newly identified case of measles in a non-NJ resident who attended a concert in NJ while infectious.‚Äù Measles is one of the most contagious diseases in the world, and although no cases have been reported yet, MetLife has a max capacity of 82,000 and infected people may not start developing symptoms until as late as June 6. Although the disease was officially eliminated in the U.S. in 2000, it has seen a resurgence in recent years due to declining vaccination rates. Last week the CDC confirmed over 1,000 cases across 31 states, which have resulted in at least three deaths so far. The warning follows a similar alert issued by New Jersey health officials last week after an infected traveller passed through Newark Liberty International Airport, potentially exposing hundreds more people to the infectious disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Daily Beast</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 May 2025 14:58:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinAFBVV95cUxON3lBckVqRzRUV2FVUlZaWnBLWXVpUG5HSUhrd0t3RWlCUnY0a0lOa2pURVJka1dzWEdQM2lwRWNydmlzR2dZM0dWZ0ZWZE14U3FtSHJYRnNyNDRxWUl5ZHpEaGdfZXo1RU43SHhORnE4NDRTUWRSdkFNb1dhNnV0Zm1wdWlzcjJCNGNiSjZWaFRKanJCOXZGbFdZT1U</guid></item><item><title>为期12年的研究揭示了使您延长寿命的运动类型—这不是有氧运动-汤姆指南 | 12-year study reveals the type of exercise that makes you live longer — it's not cardio - Tom's Guide</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMixgFBVV95cUxPNDE1MmRHbHNDeFpFbFp3aGZtQmZwdER2aWtnYWd2a19IcjNGNE5wSjdZUjJLMkZLS3BFa2lwd2lvQW5YV0FPY1BtQWVxc2pGTXFaZDVJcE9Ed0RqSTFLb3czejViZnNzY0NPdnhrNEczVWZjTy04bjV1WXZnTlhuRUY5UHFmTElSeWZiWWZxTFdZanJVQTFtSmlXQk1qbTNUeHZucW9kVkRsOXN5YzdpR0E1N0hRNVJUcG1VM0JtcU9udS1UVWc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-body" class="text-copy bodyCopy auto"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Up your protein. Add collagen. Walk 10,000 steps. Get more sleep. The list of tips for living longer is endless, and much of the advice comes from people with more social media followers than qualifications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Tom’s Guide, the fitness team works hard to cut through the noise. In our latest search for evidence-backed insights, we found a fascinating study that suggests strength training could be a key piece of the longevity puzzle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Published in the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38595265/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38595265/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research&lt;/a&gt;, the study followed more than 14,000 adults aged 50 and over for 12 years, using grip strength as a simple measure of muscle health. It found that people with lower grip strength had a 45 percent higher risk of death during the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The takeaway is simple: strong muscles aren’t just about how you look, they could help you live a longer, healthier life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-what-is-grip-strength"&gt;&lt;span&gt;What is grip strength&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grip strength is exactly what it sounds like: how hard you can squeeze something with your hand. Think of it as your hand’s power meter. But it’s more than just winning at arm wrestling or opening stubborn jars. It’s actually a quick, simple way for doctors and researchers to get a snapshot of your overall muscle health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why? Because your grip says a lot about how strong your muscles are elsewhere in your body. As this study shows, keeping that strength up might just help you live longer and feel better as you age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-what-are-the-best-ways-to-build-better-strength"&gt;&lt;span&gt;What are the best ways to build better strength&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The good news is, you don’t need to live at the gym or lift massive weights to build strength. In fact, small, consistent efforts can make a big difference, especially as you age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-sTaY5QVZLcqQRuKeqdnVGK" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-sTaY5QVZLcqQRuKeqdnVGK slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get instant access to breaking news, the hottest reviews, great deals and helpful tips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re starting out, bodyweight exercises like &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/how-to/squats-how-to-do-them-and-the-benefits-for-building-leg-strength-and-muscle" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/how-to/squats-how-to-do-them-and-the-benefits-for-building-leg-strength-and-muscle"&gt;squats&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/how-to/how-to-do-a-push-up" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/how-to/how-to-do-a-push-up"&gt;push-ups&lt;/a&gt;, or even getting up from a chair without using your hands (and repeating for a couple of sets) are great ways to begin.

Just two or three strength sessions a week can help to boost muscle, improve balance, and support long-term health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like with most things in life, the key is to find something you enjoy and stick with it. Strong muscles aren’t just about aesthetics, they can help you move better, feel better, and stay independent for longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-more-from-tom-s-guide"&gt;&lt;span&gt;More from Tom's Guide&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;aside data-model-name="Bowflex SelectTech 840 Adjustable Kettlebell,Amazon Basics Cast Iron Kettlebell,Gravity Fitness Spartanbell Kettlebell,Bulldog Gear Box kettlebells,ONNIT Primal Kettlebell,JaxJox KettlebellConnect,JaxJox Kettlebell Connect,JAXJOX KettlebellConnect 2.0,Wolverston competition kettlebell,TRX Kettlebell" data-name="Buying Guide Multimodel widget" data-widget-title="multimodelWidgetTitle" data-widget-type="multimodelreview" data-render-type="editorial" class="hawk-base"&gt;&lt;div class="hawk-multi-model-review-container"&gt;&lt;div class="hawk-multi-model-review-retail-container"&gt;&lt;p class="hawk-title-container"&gt;Round up of today's best deals&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;
