			&lt;p&gt;Energy drinks are &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/B9780443138034000057"&gt;big business&lt;/a&gt;. Marketed as quick fixes for fatigue and performance dips, energy drinks are especially popular among &lt;a href="https://www.childpsych.theclinics.com/article/S1056-4993(10)00031-3/abstract"&gt;young people&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/british-journal-of-nutrition/article/use-of-energy-drinks-in-sport-perceived-ergogenicity-and-side-effects-in-male-and-female-athletes/335349F12D8EBE19FA91B032546ADC87"&gt;athletes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7563047/"&gt;sports enthusiasts&lt;/a&gt;, and so-called "&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2966367/"&gt;weekend warriors&lt;/a&gt;" – people who pack their workouts into the weekend instead of exercising regularly. &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12152-020-09442-8"&gt;Gamers&lt;/a&gt; are now a major target too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But as the market grows, so do concerns about what's actually in these drinks – and what these &lt;a href="https://nutrition.ucdavis.edu/sites/g/files/dgvnsk426/files/content/infosheets/fact-pro-energydrinks.pdf"&gt;ingredients&lt;/a&gt; might be doing to our bodies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many energy drinks contain some combination of three familiar stimulants: &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK519490/"&gt;caffeine&lt;/a&gt;, found naturally in  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/how-does-caffeine-wake-you-up" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73115" data-postid="168042" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;coffee&lt;/a&gt;, tea and cacao; &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378874113005771"&gt;guarana&lt;/a&gt;, an Amazonian plant rich in  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/how-does-caffeine-wake-you-up" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73115" data-postid="168042" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;caffeine&lt;/a&gt;; and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/taurine"&gt;taurine&lt;/a&gt;, a naturally occurring amino acid found in scallops, mussels, turkey and chicken.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-discover-unexpected-link-between-diet-and-lung-cancer-risk?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;Scientists Discover Unexpected Link Between Diet And Lung Cancer Risk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taurine, in particular, has drawn both hype and hope. It is credited with &lt;a href="https://jissn.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12970-021-00438-0#Abs1"&gt;performance-enhancing properties&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10574552/#abstract1"&gt;potential health benefits&lt;/a&gt;. But new research is raising important questions about how it behaves in the body – and when it might do more harm than good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In May 2025, a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-07711-z"&gt;study published in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; sparked headlines and unease in equal measure. It found that taurine may fuel the progression of &lt;a href="https://bloodcancer.org.uk/understanding-blood-cancer/leukaemia/"&gt;leukaemia&lt;/a&gt;, a group of blood cancers that begin in the bone marrow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study showed that while healthy bone marrow cells naturally produce taurine, leukaemia cells cannot. But they can absorb taurine from their surroundings and use it as a fuel source to grow and multiply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research on mice and in human leukaemia cell samples demonstrated that taurine in the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8194051/"&gt;tumour microenvironment&lt;/a&gt; – the area around a tumour that includes blood vessels, immune cells and structural support – accelerated the progression of leukaemia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crucially, when researchers blocked taurine uptake by leukaemia cells (using genetic techniques),  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="168042" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; progression slowed significantly. The authors suggest taurine supplements could potentially worsen outcomes in people with leukaemia and propose that developing targeted ways to block taurine uptake by cancer cells might offer a new treatment strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Taurine: friend or foe?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taurine is one of the most abundant free amino acids in the human body, found in especially high concentrations in the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8400259/"&gt;heart, muscles and brain&lt;/a&gt;. In healthy people, it's &lt;a href="https://aspenjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1177/0148607190014002183"&gt;mainly obtained through diet&lt;/a&gt;, but the body can also synthesise taurine from the amino acids &lt;a href="https://jn.nutrition.org/article/S0022-3166(22)02429-4/pdf"&gt;methionine&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/275665776_L-Cysteine_metabolism_and_its_nutritional_implications"&gt;cysteine&lt;/a&gt;, provided it has enough &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminB6-HealthProfessional/"&gt;vitamin B6&lt;/a&gt;, which is found in foods such as salmon, tuna, chicken, bananas and milk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people consuming a typical &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10574552/"&gt;western diet take in 40mg–400mg of taurine&lt;/a&gt; a day from food alone. This figure refers only to taurine that is directly ingested, not including the additional amount the body can synthesise internally, which may vary depending on age, diet and health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taurine is listed on the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) &lt;a href="https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Taurine#section=FDA-Generally-Recognized-as-Safe---GRAS-Notices"&gt;generally recognised as safe (GRAS) database&lt;/a&gt;, and according to the &lt;a href="https://efsa.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.2903/j.efsa.2012.2815"&gt;European Food Safety Authority (EFSA)&lt;/a&gt;, it's safe to consume up to six grams per day. By comparison, a serving of &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5215981/"&gt;Red Bull or Monster&lt;/a&gt; contains around one gram – comfortably below that threshold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite recent concerns about a possible link to blood cancer progression, taurine isn't inherently harmful. In fact, some people may benefit from supplementation, especially those receiving long-term &lt;a href="https://www.uhsussex.nhs.uk/resources/understanding-parenteral-nutrition/"&gt;parenteral nutrition&lt;/a&gt;, where nutrients are delivered directly into the bloodstream because the gut isn't working properly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with &lt;a href="https://www.biomolther.org/journal/view.html?uid=948&amp;amp;vmd=Full&amp;amp;"&gt;chronic liver, kidney or heart failure&lt;/a&gt; may also have trouble producing or holding on to enough taurine, making supplementation helpful in specific clinical settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ironically, some research suggests taurine may actually &lt;a href="https://journals.lww.com/cancerjournal/fulltext/2015/11020/effect_of_taurine_on_attenuating.35.aspx"&gt;help reduce the side effects of chemotherapy in leukaemia patients&lt;/a&gt; – even as emerging studies raise concerns that it could also fuel the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This contradiction underscores how much context matters: the effects of taurine depend not just on dosage and delivery, but also on the patient's underlying condition. What helps in one context, could harm in another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But here's the catch: taking taurine as a supplement for particular health reasons is very different from consuming large quantities through energy drinks, which &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/bdr2.1177"&gt;often combine&lt;/a&gt; taurine with high levels of caffeine and sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This combination can put strain on the heart, interfere with sleep and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10535526/"&gt;increase the risk of side effects&lt;/a&gt;, particularly for people with underlying health conditions or those taking other stimulants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest research raises important questions about whether taurine-heavy products could be harmful in some cases, especially for people with, or at risk of, blood cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;So, should you worry?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.gov.scot/publications/energy-drinks-evidence-brief/"&gt;According to the current evidence&lt;/a&gt;, if you're a healthy adult who occasionally sips an energy drink, there's little cause for alarm. But moderation is key.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consuming multiple high-taurine drinks daily or taking taurine supplements (without prior professional consultation), on top of a taurine-rich diet might not be wise, especially if future research confirms links between taurine and cancer progression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until more is known, the safest approach would be to enjoy your energy boosts by consuming a nutritious diet &lt;a href="https://www.bda.uk.com/resource/energy-drinks-and-young-people.html"&gt;rather than consuming energy drinks&lt;/a&gt;. If you have any underlying health conditions – or a family history of cancer – it's always best to consult a healthcare professional before diving into taurine supplementation or consumption of energy drinks.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/256957/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IN A NUTSHELL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;📊 &lt;strong&gt;UK Biobank&lt;/strong&gt; completed the largest whole-body imaging project, scanning 100,000 volunteers over 15 years.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;🧠 The project provides an unprecedented dataset for advancing disease research, diagnostics, and treatment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;💡 Researchers are leveraging the data to develop AI models for early disease detection and understanding organ aging.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;🔬 Over 1,300 scientific papers have been published, showcasing the transformative impact of this &lt;strong&gt;comprehensive dataset&lt;/strong&gt; on medical science.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UK Biobank has achieved a monumental breakthrough in medical imaging, completing the world’s largest whole-body imaging project. This endeavor, stretching over 15 years, saw the participation of 100,000 volunteers, who contributed immensely to advancing disease research and diagnostics. By scanning brains, hearts, abdomens, blood vessels, bones, and joints, UK Biobank has provided researchers with an unprecedented dataset. This accomplishment is not just about numbers; it represents a significant leap forward in understanding human health, influencing prevention methods, and enhancing treatment options worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;A Detailed Look Inside the Human Body&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fifteen years ago, a cohort of 100,000 dedicated volunteers embarked on an ambitious journey with the UK Biobank, contributing to what would become the largest imaging project of its kind. Among them, Alison, a member of the Participant Advisory Group, emphasized the importance of this initiative, stating her motivation was to &lt;i&gt;“create a healthier future for all of us to enjoy.”&lt;/i&gt; These volunteers provided critical data, including lifestyle information and blood samples, which paved the way for groundbreaking research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project, backed by a substantial £60 million investment, involved extensive imaging sessions. Each volunteer underwent five-hour imaging appointments, where researchers collected 12,000 Magnetic Resonance (MR) images of vital organs such as the brain, heart, and abdomen. Additionally, ultrasounds of carotid arteries and comprehensive body scans were conducted, measuring bone density and body fat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="3dJWyw35s9"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.rudebaguette.com/en/2025/07/were-redefining-urban-mobility-envos-utility-personal-transporter-unleashed-as-the-future-of-compact-electric-vehicles/"&gt;“We’re Redefining Urban Mobility”: Envo’s Utility Personal Transporter Unleashed as the Future of Compact Electric Vehicles&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The imaging data has equipped scientists with the tools to explore diseases in unprecedented detail. According to Professor Louise Thomas, &lt;i&gt;“researchers can measure the size, shape, and composition of nearly every organ and tissue in the body in seconds, rather than hours per person.”&lt;/i&gt; This capability marks a significant advancement in the realm of medical research, offering insights previously unattainable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;A Bright Future for Disease Research&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UK Biobank’s imaging data is already catalyzing significant discoveries in disease research. Scientists are leveraging this vast dataset to develop advanced AI models, such as one for a healthy heart, which aims to detect diseases early. Notably, researchers are beginning to grasp the concept that our organs might age biologically at a different rate than we do. This understanding is reshaping how we perceive age-related diseases and their onset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="kFAML4AF8u"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.rudebaguette.com/en/2025/07/were-about-to-break-the-ocean-speed-limit-revolutionary-kite-powered-sailboat-closes-in-on-historic-world-record/"&gt;“We’re About to Break the Ocean Speed Limit”: Revolutionary Kite-Powered Sailboat Closes In on Historic World Record&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the remarkable findings from this dataset is the intricate connection between the heart and brain. Such revelations are possible due to the immense scale of data being integrated into machine learning platforms, allowing for disease prediction years before symptoms manifest. Professor Paul Matthews highlighted the potential of this data, remarking on a study that used brain imaging from 20,000 participants to develop an AI tool capable of predicting the onset of Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases. &lt;i&gt;“The beauty of UK Biobank is the breadth of the data collected… the imaging scans add another layer of exquisite detail,”&lt;/i&gt; he noted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Unprecedented Scale and Impact&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UK Biobank’s imaging project is remarkable not just for its scale but also for its profound impact on the scientific community. Described as more than ten times larger than any prior studies, this project offers researchers the ability to discern disease patterns previously invisible. By providing a panoramic view of the human body, the data allows for a holistic understanding of how various aspects of our lives, from lifestyle choices to genetic predispositions, influence our health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="m7mJIol9S7"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.rudebaguette.com/en/2025/07/i-built-it-to-break-the-rules-mit-students-pocket-sized-3d-printer-creates-complex-objects-in-just-seconds/"&gt;“I Built It to Break the Rules”: MIT Student’s Pocket-Sized 3D Printer Creates Complex Objects in Just Seconds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With over 1,300 peer-reviewed scientific papers already published based on this data, the UK Biobank has set a new standard for medical research. The rapid analysis of heart scans in under a second is just one example of the technological advancements made possible by this dataset. The ability to see inside the human body &lt;i&gt;“in ways that were previously impossible”&lt;/i&gt; opens new avenues for research, enabling scientists to make connections that can lead to new diagnostics and therapeutic strategies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Role of Volunteers and Continuous Advancements&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Central to the success of the UK Biobank’s imaging project is the role played by its volunteers. These individuals, driven by a desire to contribute to a healthier future, have collectively enabled a dataset of immense value to be compiled. Their commitment has not only enhanced our understanding of disease progression but also provided a foundation for future breakthroughs in medical science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the dataset continues to grow, so too does its potential to transform healthcare. The integration of lifestyle and health data with imaging results creates a comprehensive picture that can inform personalized medicine approaches. The ongoing contributions from these volunteers ensure that the UK Biobank remains a pivotal resource in the quest to unravel the complexities of human health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UK Biobank’s imaging project signifies a monumental stride in medical research, offering insights that promise to revolutionize disease prevention and treatment. As we continue to explore the depths of this dataset, one must wonder: how will these insights shape the future of global healthcare, and what new frontiers will we uncover next?&lt;/p&gt;

The report noted that peanut butter is an “energy dense” food: Ounce for ounce, it has a lot more dietary fat and calories compared with eggs, Greek yogurt, lean meats, chicken breast, beans, fish and other high-protein foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="RHASUYW6CJAMPKFTSOMWTRJTYE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Peanut butter is certainly nutritious. It contains &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/07/14/high-fiber-meal-plan/" target="_blank"&gt;fiber&lt;/a&gt;, vitamins, minerals and heart-healthy unsaturated fats. But it contains at least twice as many grams of fat as protein. You should consider it a great source of fat, rather than a great source of protein, said Jose Antonio, an author of the report and a professor of health and human performance at Nova Southeastern University in Florida.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="VME3BIY6YFC25IYWPNMQEPYGDM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“If you read the nutrition label on any jar of peanut butter, you will see that it’s mostly fat,” said Antonio, who is also the chief executive of the International Society of Sports Nutrition. “The fat is good for you. But don’t fool yourself into thinking that you’re getting a lot of high-quality protein.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="XH2J4HCF6RDUZCUNWCYPZQZYYA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Two tablespoons of&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;creamy peanut butter — the amount in one serving, or one ounce — has about seven grams of protein, 16 grams of fat and 190 calories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="UFNDUEGEFNA6JO77UA7FF7BHFY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The authors of the report noted that people who use peanut butter to help them meet their protein needs should consider eating it in moderation because of its high &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2023/06/13/weight-loss-calories-fiber-microbiome/" target="_blank"&gt;calorie&lt;/a&gt; density. Otherwise, the authors warned, they may be setting themselves up for “unintentional weight gain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="TC334XRZABHF3CC7P3T2KLA4HQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“Peanut butter is a healthy food, but calories still matter,” Antonio said. “If you want to gain weight, eat a bunch of peanut butter.

It is also used off-label to treat other health issues, including low back pain. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Past studies have also found that using gabapentin may increase a person’s risk of developing cognitive impairment and dementia. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new study reports that people who receive six or more prescriptions of gabapentin for lower back pain are at a higher risk of developing dementia and mild cognitive impairment.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scientists found these risks were more than doubled in adults between the ages of 35 to 49 years.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like all medications, gabapentin has some potential side effects, including dizziness, tiredness, water retention, and dry mouth. Past studies have also found that using gabapentin may cause &lt;hl-trusted-source source="Food and Drug Administration (FDA)" rationale="Governmental authority"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-safety-and-availability/fda-warns-about-serious-breathing-problems-seizure-and-nerve-pain-medicines-gabapentin-neurontin" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;breathing difficulties&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-trusted-source&gt;, and may increase a person’s risk of developing &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9732650/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;cognitive impairment&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10266423/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;dementia&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists also discovered these risks were more than doubled in adults between the ages of 35 to 49 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For this study, researchers analyzed data from more than 26,000 adults through the federated health research network &lt;a href="https://trinetx.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;TriNetX&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists selected participants who had a diagnosis of chronic pain, &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/chronic-pain-syndrome" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;chronic pain syndrome&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/318465" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;lumbar radiculopathy&lt;/a&gt;, and chronic low back pain. They also categorized study participants into different age groups: 18–64, 18–34, 35–49, 50–64, and 65 or older. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Currently, there is a discrepancy on whether taking gabapentin increases a patient’s risk for developing dementia,” &lt;a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=vMyxOfQAAAAJ&amp;amp;hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Nafis B. Eghrari&lt;/a&gt;, a 4th-year medical student at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine in Cleveland, OH, and first author of this study, told &lt;em&gt;Medical News Today&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Moreover, there lacks a strong understanding of how gabapentin impacts cognitive function and whether it contributes to neurodegenerative processes. Previous studies have shown mixed findings on this topic. Thus, we decided to explore this gap in the field,” explained Eghrari.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Upon analysis, researchers found that study participants who received six or more gabapentin prescriptions had a 29% higher risk of developing dementia, and an 85% greater chance of being diagnosed with MCI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“The significance of this finding is an association between gabapentin prescription and dementia on a nationwide level,” Eghrari explained. “Though this does not imply causation, this warrants further investigation on the drug’s long-term effects.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In terms of clinical significance, I recommend that physicians prescribing gabapentin for chronic pain perform cognitive exams on a regular basis when seeing patients,” he continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’d also advise patients who are taking this drug to alert their physician if they notice any cognitive deficits, including confusion, poor memory, or slowed thinking,” said the researcher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eghrari and his team also discovered that when looking at participants by age groups, the risks for dementia more than doubled and more than tripled for MCI in people who were 35 to 49 years old. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were surprised to find this relatively higher risk in the non-elderly population,” Eghrari said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These results indicate that gabapentin may have a greater cognitive impact on non-elderly individuals, as elderly individuals are already at risk for neurodegeneration due to their older age. This finding warrants further investigation into the underlying mechanism of how gabapentin may impact cognition.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;– Nafis B. Eghrari&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The key takeaway of this study is that patients prescribed gabapentin for chronic back pain should be closely monitored by their physician for cognitive decline,” he continued. “Moreover, gabapentin should be prescribed with caution due to the associated risk of dementia/cognitive impairment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We hope to carry this research forward and explore whether there is a true causative relationship between gabapentin and cognitive impairment,” Eghrari added. “We also plan to investigate the underlying mechanisms of how the drug may impact cognition.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;MNT &lt;/em&gt;had the opportunity to speak with &lt;a href="https://infospine.net/meet-dr-anand/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Neel Anand&lt;/a&gt;, MD, MCh Orth, a board-certified orthopedic spine surgeon and director of the Cedars-Sinai Spine Center in Los Angeles, about this study. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anand, who was not involved in the research, commented that there are pros and cons to studies with big data sets as there are many variables and it is hard to determine the true causative factor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, little or no information was provided on any other illnesses participants may have had or other medications they were taking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The best thing I would take from the study is […] [that] there’s not a single drug without a side effect — they all have some issues,” Anand pointed out. “So the answer is, if you’re chronically going to take something, you better watch out — something’s [potentially] going to go wrong somewhere.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anand said the best way to prove anything is to take a cohort of study participants who take a specific medication and nothing else, and compare them to another cohort who does not take the medication. And researchers need to ensure that participants take the medication if it is prescribed to them.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;He noted that, in some cases, patients do not follow the doctor’s indications regarding prescription medication. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Sometimes they do more, sometimes they’ll take less,“ Anand said. “The only way to actually study [the real-life effects of long-term drug use] would be to literally take a thousand people and give them gabapentin and nothing else, and a thousand you don’t, and then follow them over 5 years or more,” he suggested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, he admitted that “at least we can be cognizant“ that there may be a heightened risk of dementia with prolonged gabapentin use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is “a possibility that [doctors] needs to be aware [of] or at least counsel our patients [on] — that’s fair,” Anand added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Medical News Today</author><pubDate>Wed, 16 Jul 2025 10:20:26 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqgFBVV95cUxQaG5DYUV0cU1qREE2YnZnMXRmYTFkZnl0ZUNVeGxWVGtTUTZQclAzRTZPQWhUNWdJWkNxMGxOX2t5a1B1UThjU3d4bU5heWxJMUNXUHgtRmptN25OdVVJeGotN0pTZjJEWU1GRk1fUkdaY3o4TzZtLWRBdUJkVk1VWkhidk1xeGEzcUZneEo5SGVWRjF0QmxNLU9ObXE3T2Z1cGxtV25HeW5pUQ</guid></item><item><title>即使是健康的大脑也会随着年龄的增长而衰退。以下是您可以做的事情-美国国家公共广播电台 | Even healthy brains decline with age.

                Even healthy brains slow down as they age. But there are ways to keep that thinker in tip-top shape.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;After about age 40, our brains begin to lose a step or two.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Each year, our reaction time slows by a few thousandths of a second. We're also less able to recall items on a shopping list.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Those changes can be signs of a disease, like Alzheimer's. But usually, they're not.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Both of those things, memory and processing speed, change with age in a normal group of people," says &lt;a href="https://www.tgen.org/faculty-profiles/matt-huentelman/" target="_blank"&gt;Matt Huentelman&lt;/a&gt;, a professor at TGen, the Translational Genomics Research Institute, in Phoenix.&lt;/p&gt;   
   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Huentelman should know. He helps run &lt;a href="https://mindcrowd.org/" target="_blank"&gt;MindCrowd&lt;/a&gt;, a free online cognitive test that has been taken by more than 700,000 adults.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;About a thousand of those people had test scores indicating that their brain was "exceptional," meaning they performed like a person 30 years younger on tests of memory and processing speed.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Genetics played a role, of course. But Huentelman and a team of researchers have been focusing on other differences.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"We want to study these exceptional performers because we think they can tell us what the rest of us should be doing," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Early results suggest that sleep and maintaining cardiovascular health are a good start. Other &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/article/S0140-6736(20)30367-6/fulltext" target="_blank"&gt;measures&lt;/a&gt; include avoiding smoking, limiting alcohol and getting plenty of exercise.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Huentelman was one of several dozen researchers who met in Miami this summer to discuss healthy brain aging. The event was hosted by the &lt;a href="https://mcknightbrain.org/" target="_blank"&gt;McKnight Brain Research Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, which funds studies on age-related cognitive decline and memory loss.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;To preserve cognitive function in later life, "we're going to have to understand [brain] aging at a mechanistic level," says &lt;a href="https://mcknightbrain.org/the-mcknight-brain-research-foundation-announces-alice-luo-clayton-phd-as-chief-executive-officer/" target="_blank"&gt;Alice Luo Clayton&lt;/a&gt;, a neuroscientist who is the group's chief executive officer.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Another speaker was &lt;a href="https://mbi-umiami.org/lab-member/christian-agudelo-md/" target="_blank"&gt;Christian Agudelo&lt;/a&gt;, a sleep neurologist at the University of Miami's Evelyn F. McKnight Brain Institute.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I think the value of sleep and sleep deprivation became true to me when I had kids," Agudelo says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Those kids are 4 and 6 now, so Agudelo is getting more sleep. But his own experience is consistent with his &lt;a href="https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/alz.12250" target="_blank"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; on the relationship between sleep and cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"The better you sleep, the better your brain health is going to be both structurally and functionally," Agudelo says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Keep in mind: Better sleep isn't just about getting more sleep.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The key is getting high-quality sleep, which allows the brain to cycle through all the &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK526132/" target="_blank"&gt;sleep stages&lt;/a&gt;, Agudelo says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Researchers can measure how well a person is sleeping by monitoring their brain wave patterns. But people usually know when they've had a good night's rest, Agudelo says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"You go to sleep, you wake up and you feel like that experience was worthwhile," he says. "You feel refreshed."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Ensuring high-quality sleep is tricky. But people can improve the odds with certain behaviors, Agudelo says&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Waking up at the same time every single day and aligning our sleep rhythms with the rhythm of the sun" can lead to better sleep, he says. So can "being active, both socially and physically."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Those behaviors increase "sleep pressure," the body's natural desire to sleep the longer we are awake, Agudelo says. When that pressure is high, he says, "we can fall asleep more easily and deeply."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Brain aging is also influenced by vascular risk factors, like blood pressure, cholesterol levels and diabetes, says &lt;a href="https://health.ucdavis.edu/medical-center/team/639/charles-decarli---neurology---dementia---alzheimer-s-disease-sacramento/" target="_blank"&gt;Charles DeCarli&lt;/a&gt;, a neurologist who co-directs the Alzheimer's Disease Research Center at the University of California, Davis.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;People know that these risk factors usually contribute to medical conditions like heart attack or stroke, DeCarli says. But &lt;a href="https://diversevcid.ucdavis.edu/" target="_blank"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; on thousands of people 65 and older has found that these risk factors can also impact the brain directly — even if they don't cause a heart attack or other cardiovascular problems.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The size of the brain, the shape of the brain, the tissue integrity of the brain looks older in people who have these risk factors than in people who do not have them," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;So DeCarli and a team of researchers are studying whether it's possible to protect the brain by aggressively treating conditions that affect the circulatory system.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The question is, if you have these diseases and they are well controlled, will you have a younger-looking brain?" he says. "And the answer seems to be yes."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

The factors include not smoking, a &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/09/03/health/mediterranean-diet-shopping-list-printable-wellness?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:nutritious diet;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;nutritious diet&lt;/a&gt;, regular exercise, a healthy weight, optimal blood pressure, controlled blood sugar and well-managed cholesterol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers reviewed 483 studies on the impacts of maximizing Life’s Simple 7 on the health of many different body systems over the course of people’s lives in a meta-analysis published Wednesday in the &lt;a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1161/JAHA.124.038566" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Journal of the American Heart Association;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Journal of the American Heart Association&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maintaining ideal levels of at least three of Life’s Simple 7 metrics was associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular disease, even if someone had a genetic predisposition, according to the data. And better scores across all of the factors showed benefits in many body systems beyond cardiovascular health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A few years ago, we learned that &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/10/health/heart-dementia-risk-wellness?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:heart health and brain health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;heart health and brain health&lt;/a&gt; are very closely tied. Through this review, we found that almost every organ system and bodily function also benefits from maintaining the healthy lifestyle behaviors of Life’s Simple 7,” said lead study author Dr. Liliana Aguayo, a research assistant professor at the Nell Hodgson Woodruff School of Nursing and the Global Diabetes Research Center at Emory University in Atlanta, in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were pleasantly surprised to find that Life’s Simple 7 at optimal levels touched every aspect of health, from head to toe. It goes well beyond just cardiovascular health to encompass whole-body health,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Eating plant-based foods can help heart health, said Dr. Nour Makarem of Columbia University. - FG Trade/E+/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;It doesn’t take much to see the benefit&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers conducted a systemic review of studies that followed a gold standard approach, said Dr. Nour Makarem, assistant professor of epidemiology and co-leader of the Chronic Disease Unit at the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health in New York City. Makarem was not involved in the research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most significant findings of the research is that a little change makes a big difference when it comes to lifestyle and health, Aguayo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study assessed adherence to Life’s Simple 7 using a scale from 0 to 14 points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each improvement by 1 point was associated with an 11% decrease in dementia risk, a 6% decreased risk of eye disease, a 23% decreased risk of fatty liver disease, and an 11% decreased risk of chronic kidney disease, Aguayo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This means that small changes, for example, moving from obesity to overweight, adding any physical activity even if below recommended levels counted as progress,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of the studies showed an adherence to Life’s Simple 7 was associated with maintaining brain and lung function, vision and hearing, and teeth and muscle strength over the course of aging, according to the data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The essential 8 steps&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The studies included in the meta-analysis used Life’s Simple 7 to evaluate lifestyle behaviors, but the AHA has since updated the metrics to Life’s Essential 8.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new guidelines are more comprehensive, such as including avoiding secondhand smoke, vaping and nicotine products in the not smoking factor and pointing people to the &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/25/health/mediterranean-diet-cancer-prevention-wellness?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mediterranean diet;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/27/health/best-diets-heart-aha-wellness?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:DASH diet;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;DASH diet&lt;/a&gt; under the healthy eating metric, Makarem said. DASH stands for Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension; high blood pressure is a major contributor to heart disease and stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, the update added an eighth metric that recognizes the role of sleep in long-term health, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good sleep means seven to nine hours a night for most adults, 10 to 16 hours for children ages 5 and younger, 9 to 12 hours for kids ages 6 to 12, and 8 to 10 hours for adolescents ages 13 to 18, according to the AHA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study confirms that adopting a healthy lifestyle is important to achieve optimal health as well as managing the conventional risk factors for cardiovascular disease –– weight, blood pressure, cholesterol and blood sugar, Aguayo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Even adding a little bit of exercise can help. - Oleg Breslavtsev/Moment RF/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Small changes make a big difference&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everyday lifestyle choices have a big impact on overall health, and it’s worth it to take steps toward better cardiovascular health, Aguayo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The key message is that it is never too early or too late to make small, feasible changes,” she said in an email. “Small improvements in diet, physical activity, smoking, or managing risk factors (weight, blood pressure, cholesterol and sugar) can have meaningful benefits, not just for heart health, but for all the body, from head to toe.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a heart-healthy diet, Makarem recommends focusing on plant-based foods such as fruits, vegetables, legumes and whole grains and consuming lean proteins such as fish. She also recommended limiting processed foods, sodium and sugar-sweetened beverages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adults should engage in 150 minutes of moderate physical activity — like walking, dancing or &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/cnn-underscored/home/the-best-garden-tools?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:gardening;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;gardening&lt;/a&gt; — or 75 minutes of vigorous physical activity a week, Makarem added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even considering how impactful small changes can be, ideal cardiovascular health is very rare –– with less than 4% of people worldwide meeting the criteria, Aguayo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We must do more to support young people, especially women, by making it easier, more affordable, and achievable for all to improve their cardiovascular health,” she added. “Cardiovascular disease is still the number one killer of women. Supporting the heart health of young people and women is both cost-effective and the right thing to do.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sign up for &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/newsletters/fitness-life-but-better?source=nl-acq_article" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:CNN’s Fitness, But Better newsletter series;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;CNN’s Fitness, But Better newsletter series&lt;/a&gt;.

You’ve probably seen erythritol listed on sodas, protein bars, and even toothpaste. It’s everywhere. Almost zero calories, no sugar spikes, and perfect for keto diets. Sounds like a win, but maybe not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study from the &lt;a href="https://www.colorado.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Colorado Boulder&lt;/a&gt; has cracked open a side of erythritol that few expected. It’s not about weight gain or tooth decay. It’s about what this &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/artificial-sweeteners-erythritol-directly-linked-to-heart-attacks-and-strokes/"&gt;sweetener&lt;/a&gt; does to your brain’s blood vessels that may elevate the risk of a stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our study adds to the evidence suggesting that non-nutritive sweeteners that have generally been purported to be safe, may not come without negative health consequences,” said Professor Christopher DeSouza, who led the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-understanding-artificial-sweeteners"&gt;Understanding artificial sweeteners&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Artificial sweeteners like erythritol have become go-to sugar substitutes for people looking to cut calories or manage blood sugar. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/erythritol" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Erythritol&lt;/a&gt;, in particular, is a sugar alcohol found naturally in some fruits but is typically produced in bulk from corn or wheat starch. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It tastes sweet like sugar but has almost zero calories and doesn’t spike blood glucose, making it popular among those with diabetes or on keto diets. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike some other sugar alcohols, erythritol usually causes fewer digestive issues because your body absorbs most of it before it reaches the colon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, it’s not without controversy. Some recent studies, including this one, have raised concerns about potential links between high erythritol levels and cardiovascular issues like heart attack and stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-sweetener-changes-brain-cells"&gt;Sweetener changes brain cells&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers did not yet test this in people. They went straight to the cells that line your brain’s blood vessels. These cells regulate blood flow, keep inflammation in check, and help prevent clots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cells were exposed to erythritol for just three hours. The amount used was equal to what you would get from one sugar-free drink. That was all it took to cause noticeable changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cells got stressed. They flooded with free radicals, also called reactive oxygen species or ROS. These unstable molecules damage proteins, DNA, and cell membranes. In response, antioxidant defenses went up, but not enough. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was like the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/artificial-sweetener-erythritol-sugar-substitute-linked-to-blood-clots-heart-disease/"&gt;cells&lt;/a&gt; knew they were under attack and tried, unsuccessfully, to defend themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-blood-vessels-started-misbehaving"&gt;Blood vessels started misbehaving&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;That same short exposure changed how the cells produced nitric oxide, a molecule that helps blood vessels relax. Less nitric oxide means tighter vessels. That’s bad news when your brain needs steady blood flow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The total amount of the enzyme that makes nitric oxide didn’t change much, but its function tanked. It stopped doing its job well. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Erythritol messed with the enzyme’s activation at two specific sites. One turned down, one cranked up. The result was about 20 percent less nitric oxide production. This sets the stage for constricted &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/nutritionists-reveal-the-surprising-health-benefits-of-maple-syrup-including-less-belly-fat/"&gt;vessels&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-sweetener-makes-brain-vessels-tighten"&gt;Sweetener makes brain vessels tighten&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same cells started pumping out more &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/23139-endothelin" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;endothelin-1&lt;/a&gt;, a protein that tells blood vessels to tighten up. Compared to normal cells, the erythritol-exposed ones had a 30 percent increase in ET-1. They also had more of its precursor, Big ET-1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s a double whammy. First, blood vessels lose their ability to widen. Then, they get signals to squeeze even more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Big picture, if your vessels are more constricted and your ability to break down blood clots is lowered, your risk of stroke goes up,” said first author Auburn Berry. “Our research demonstrates not only that, but how erythritol has the potential to increase stroke risk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-clots-don-t-stand-a-chance"&gt;Clots don’t stand a chance&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blood clots are tricky. You want your body to stop bleeding when you get a cut. But you also want it to break down unnecessary clots inside vessels. One of the body’s tools for that is tissue-type plasminogen activator, or t-PA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this study, the researchers added thrombin, which mimics a clotting &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/common-sweetener-can-destroy-some-of-the-most-dangerous-bacteria/"&gt;signal&lt;/a&gt;. Normally, that should have made the cells release more t-PA. In untreated cells, that’s exactly what happened. A nice 25 percent boost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In erythritol-treated cells? Nothing. The response was completely muted. Clots form and cells don’t react. That’s the formula for a stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One study tracked over 4,000 people in the U.S. and Europe. The research team found that those with high blood levels of erythritol had more strokes and heart attacks within three years. This happened across both sexes and regardless of other health issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Colorado team didn’t just observe changes. They showed exactly how the sweetener weakens brain vessel cells in ways that match the stroke patterns found in people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-sweeteners-may-harm-blood-vessels"&gt;Sweeteners may harm blood vessels&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;DeSouza and his team exposed real human brain vessel cells to a typical drink-size dose of erythritol. Many people consume several such servings a day. And unlike some substances, erythritol crosses into the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study wasn’t designed to track long-term effects, but it does raise a concern. What happens when those cells face erythritol not just for three hours, but every day?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Given the epidemiological study that inspired our work, and now our cellular findings, we believe it would be prudent for people to monitor their consumption of non-nutrient-sweeteners such as this one,” said DeSouza.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/japplphysiol.00276.2025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Journal of Applied Physiology&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 16 Jul 2025 09:26:38 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMif0FVX3lxTE53dzc4LXUwSmlGalJMa0Z0MnE2LUU1aFJCZEIyUXJfMklUQnQ0NWF5bFBlVUdEMDJsTlMxaHdacjhDYjI2VjZYdlFYVDdNZk84TmpxN3VjT3EyRkJsaUhxLVRVY05BZjEySGVsQkxESmZKa1hoQTdneTUwRmp0RUU</guid></item><item><title>等离子体中心遵守安全规则，女人说“你让一个白人通过昨天” -无聊的熊猫 | Plasma Center Follows Safety Rules, Woman Says “You Let A White Man Through Yesterday” - Bored Panda</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiakFVX3lxTE9MNWpReWR4TDQ3cThMRzUwY0xmRmFENTV3VndfTTUxV0VvOXRQdGQ3bEg1X0JwSWFJaVBXTjZ3REZKSzF4eTdxYy1Sbm1hSzgwSFVDYVhKeVRRZ2tzM3pTM25aVllETVFoc0E?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Making a donation is typically a great thing to do.

According to the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/givingequalsliving/giveplasma/why-give" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener nofollow"&gt;&lt;span&gt;U.S. Department of Health and Human Services&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, 130 plasma donations will treat someone with primary immunodeficiency for an entire year. And 1,200 donations will take care of an individual with hemophilia for a year. Plasma is also used for tetanus and rabies treatment, and pregnant women with Rh sensitization rely on it as well. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;So who exactly is eligible to donate plasma? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.plasmasource.org/who-it-s-for/eligibility" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener nofollow"&gt;&lt;span&gt;PlasmaSource&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; notes on their site that donors must be between 18 and 69 years old and weigh at least 110 pounds. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;They must be in good physical health and test negative for any transmissible infectious diseases. It’s also crucial  that they disclose all of their current medical conditions and share any medications they’re currently taking.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="post-desktop-ad-within-content post-ads margin-left"&gt;&lt;span class="dfp-ad"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pg-ad-label"&gt;ADVERTISEMENT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p id="boredpandacom_singlepost_low_infinite_3" align="center" data-freestar-ad="__728x90"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Donors must then complete a health screening and physical exam to check their blood pressure, pulse, temperature, protein levels and ensure they don’t have anemia. If a donor has recently given birth, they must be at least six months postpartum, and all donors must avoid taking aspirin for at least 48 hours prior to giving plasma. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;On the morning that someone plans to donate plasma, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/qualifications-for-plasma-donation-and-what-to-expect-when-donating" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener nofollow"&gt;&lt;span&gt;WebMD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; recommends having a healthy breakfast and drinking lots of liquids but avoiding coffee, tea and alcohol. It’s best to avoid oily and greasy foods too, as these can impact the quality of a person’s plasma.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;As for what donors can expect during the process, WebMD says the entire appointment should take approximately 90 minutes. This time will include registration, screening and the donation, which typically lasts for about 25 minutes. Afterwards, donors should have a snack and drink plenty of fluids, then take it easy for the rest of the day.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It’s also important to note that, in the United States, plasma can only be used after a donor gives &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/givingequalsliving/giveplasma/giving-process" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener nofollow"&gt;&lt;span&gt;at least twice&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. So donors must return to the same center within 6 months after their first donation to ensure that their plasma is safe. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="attachment-link-container shareable-image-block" id="getty-images-AtTM7SEiAQU-unsplash" data-href="http://www.boredpanda.com/entitled-woman-plasma-donation/?image_id=getty-images-AtTM7SEiAQU-unsplash.jpg"&gt;&lt;a class="web-share-button list-item-share new-share-experiment" data-location="single-post-image" data-title="You\'re Not Entitled To Payment.

And they help hundreds of thousands of people each year. But not everyone supports the idea of paying donors for their plasma, as this can get into murky ethical territory.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.colorado.edu/today/2024/03/06/plasma-donations-financial-lifesaver-and-ethical-dilemma#:~:text=Pharmaceutical%20companies%20often%20pay%20around,a%20certain%20number%20of%20donations." target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener nofollow"&gt;&lt;span&gt;CU Boulder Today&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; reports that donors are often paid $50 per donation but can sometimes be paid up to $200 during times of shortages. And advertisements sometimes boast that donors can receive $800 a month for giving plasma a few times.        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But Emily Gallagher, Assistant Professor of Finance at CU Boulder, argues that these donation centers sometimes prey on low-income individuals who are desperate for &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/fastest-easiest-way-people-made-money/" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener "&gt;&lt;span&gt;extra cash&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“The more payday lenders and pawn shops that are in a local area, the more likely that a plasma center will soon open there,” Gallagher says. “It probably is the case that when plasma centers are analyzing where to open, the prevalence of these types of alternative lenders is a good signal of a market to enter.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;She also worries about the health of those who donate frequently. “Nobody actually knows what the longer-term health costs of doing this twice per week might be,” Gallagher noted.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;So if you plan on donating plasma, it’s probably a good idea to do so out of the kindness of your heart, rather than because you have no other way to pay rent on time.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="post-desktop-ad-within-content post-ads margin-left"&gt;&lt;span class="dfp-ad"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pg-ad-label"&gt;ADVERTISEMENT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p id="boredpandacom_singlepost_low_infinite_4" align="center" data-freestar-ad="__728x90"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We would love to hear your thoughts on this situation in the comments below, pandas.

			&lt;p&gt;A massive, 24-year-long study of more than 1.2 million children provides reassurance to parents around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has found &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt; compelling evidence that childhood vaccines lead to  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/autism-spectrum-disorder" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73013" data-postid="167987" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;autism&lt;/a&gt;, asthma, or dozens of other chronic disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers in Denmark examined the safety of a specific vaccine ingredient – aluminum salts – which, despite &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2021.663280"&gt;frequent debunking&lt;/a&gt;, remains a common talking point among vaccine skeptics. &lt;a href="https://www.chop.edu/vaccine-education-center/vaccine-safety/vaccine-ingredients/aluminum"&gt;Clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; have tested their safety extensively, and they've been used in &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/basics/explaining-how-vaccines-work.html"&gt;non-live vaccines&lt;/a&gt; for more than 70 years to boost the immune system's response to lower doses of medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/is-there-thimerosal-in-vaccines-and-is-it-safe-heres-what-the-science-says?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;Is There Thimerosal in Vaccines, And Is It Safe? Here's What The Science Says&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though the salts contain aluminum ions, their chemical properties are quite different to those of pure aluminum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's really important for parents to understand that we are not injecting metal into children," epidemiologist and senior author Anders Hviid from Statens Serum Institute in Denmark &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/kids-health/study-finds-no-link-aluminum-vaccines-autism-asthma-rcna218682"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; NBC News.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our study addresses many of these concerns and provides clear and robust evidence for the safety of childhood vaccines."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From 1997 through 2020, Hviid and colleagues tracked the health outcomes of more than 1.2 million Danish children using a nationwide registry containing details on childhood vaccinations, diagnoses, and potential biases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the children were born at a time when fewer vaccines with aluminum salts were recommended. Others grew up when more were recommended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, a kid's exposure to vaccine-related aluminum salts before age 2 was not significantly related to any of 50 chronic disorders, including 36 autoimmune, 9 allergic, and 5 neurodevelopmental conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lack of dose-dependent relationship between aluminum salts and a child's ongoing health strongly suggests the ingredient is safe for use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_167990" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-167990" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/images_annals2500997ff2_figure_2_early_childhood_vaccination_with_aluminum_adsorbed_vaccines_in-642x468.jpg" alt="Early Childhood Vaccines" class="size-medium wp-image-167990" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/images_annals2500997ff2_figure_2_early_childhood_vaccination_with_aluminum_adsorbed_vaccines_in-642x468.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/images_annals2500997ff2_figure_2_early_childhood_vaccination_with_aluminum_adsorbed_vaccines_in-569x415.jpg 569w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/images_annals2500997ff2_figure_2_early_childhood_vaccination_with_aluminum_adsorbed_vaccines_in-768x560.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/images_annals2500997ff2_figure_2_early_childhood_vaccination_with_aluminum_adsorbed_vaccines_in-600x437.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/images_annals2500997ff2_figure_2_early_childhood_vaccination_with_aluminum_adsorbed_vaccines_in.jpg 870w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-167990" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Early childhood vaccination with aluminum-adsorbed vaccines in Denmark from 1997 through 2020.

Whether we realize it or not, the typical adult &lt;a href="https://www.chop.edu/vaccine-education-center/vaccine-safety/vaccine-ingredients/aluminum"&gt;ingests&lt;/a&gt; about 7 to 9 milligrams of aluminum a day in various forms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By some estimates, if infants receive all the vaccines they need in the first six months of life, that would amount to about 4.4 mg of aluminum. In that same time frame, breast-fed infants ingest about 7 mg of aluminum, and formula-fed infants ingest about 38 milligrams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When aluminum adjuvants in vaccines are injected into muscle, they enter the bloodstream and are then &lt;a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2024/04/scicheck-posts-raise-unfounded-concerns-about-aluminum-in-vaccines/"&gt;processed&lt;/a&gt; by the kidneys and expelled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.acap.2017.09.003"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; of 85 infants, aluminum concentrations in the blood and hair did not increase after receiving a vaccine. This suggests that aluminum concentrations in the body don't accumulate or reach toxic levels after vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-does-the-world-health-organisation-do" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73079" data-postid="167987" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/groups/global-advisory-committee-on-vaccine-safety/topics/adjuvants"&gt;notes&lt;/a&gt; that the level of aluminum after vaccination "never exceeds safe US regulatory thresholds… even for low birth-weight infants."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, there is strong evidence to suggest aluminum adjuvants are safe for use in childhood vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus, each year, about &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/global-immunization/fast-facts/index.html"&gt;four million deaths&lt;/a&gt; are avoided because of these immunizations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Childhood vaccinations don't threaten children's lives, they save them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was published in the &lt;a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/ANNALS-25-00997"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Annals of Internal Medicine&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The result? Poor focus, memory glitches, and emotional fatigue. I’ve developed five daily habits — used with patients and in my own life — that help restore clarity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve seen more frazzled, forgetful, foggy patients this year than ever before. Not because they’re sick. Not because they’re old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But because their brains are overstimulated and undernourished in ways we still don’t fully understand. “I forget words mid-sentence.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My brain feels like a browser with 78 tabs open.” “Even when I rest, &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/health-wellness/tiny-signs-chronic-fatigue-system"&gt;I feel tired&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These aren’t rare comments. I hear them every day — like the mother of three who told me she forgot her ATM PIN at checkout, or the tech worker who confessed he hasn’t read a full email in months.  From executives. From teachers. From teenagers. This is a clinical reality, not just a vibe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;As a doctor, I’ve come to believe we’re living through a silent cognitive crisis, and that's why everyone's brains feel so broken right now. &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="media media--type-image media--view-mode-default"&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.yourtango.com/sites/default/files/image_blog/2025-07/why-everyones-brain-feels-so-broken-right-now.png" alt="woman who's brain feels broken" title="why everyone's brain feels so broken right now" class="img-fluid" typeof="foaf:Image" decoding="async"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-credit field--type-string field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;CrizzyStudio / Shutterstock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not dementia. Not quite depression. Something subtler — and more pervasive. A kind of neural exhaustion from too many inputs, too few boundaries, and no clear &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/simple-steps-help-you-hit-reset-button-your-life-only-15-minutes"&gt;way to reset&lt;/a&gt;. The science is beginning to catch up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;We’re starting to understand how constant stimulation physically reshapes the brain. We were never built for this.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is what I see in the clinic every week: A lawyer tells me he’s making more mistakes in briefs than ever before. A college student describes &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/people-who-suddenly-lose-interest-everyone-around-them-often-have-these-reasons"&gt;losing interest in everything&lt;/a&gt;, even her favorite books. A nurse forgets common medication names during shifts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;None of them is sick. All of them are overwhelmed. And it’s not just mental. It’s physical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their nervous systems are stuck in a mild but constant state of fight-or-flight. Their pulse is up. Their sleep is down. And their minds can’t seem to slow down, even when their bodies try. We weren’t built for this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/self/people-maintain-discipline-say-no-without-feeling-guilty-have-these-strengths"&gt;People Who Maintain The Discipline To Say No Without Feeling Guilty Have These 5 Strengths&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your brain doesn't work in modern life. In medical terms, here’s what we think is happening: Brain scans now reveal that chronic overstimulation — including scrolling, alerts, newsfeeds, and multitasking — shrinks the prefrontal cortex, heightens stress pathways, and overwhelms the brain with noise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cortisol overdrive:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/health-wellness/subtle-ways-stress-completely-messes-up-your-life"&gt;Chronic stress&lt;/a&gt;, even mild, keeps the stress hormone cortisol elevated, leading to memory impairment and mood instability.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Default Mode Network disruption:&lt;/strong&gt; The brain’s Default Mode Network (DMN) — active during rest and introspection — supports creativity, memory, and self-awareness. But constant task-switching and alerts suppress DMN activity, preventing the brain from entering deeper states of reflection and consolidation. Harvard and UC studies suggest this disruption may reduce creative insight and cognitive resilience.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dopamine dysregulation:&lt;/strong&gt; Constant hits of novelty (social media, texts, headlines) mess with our motivation system. What used to feel rewarding — a walk, a conversation — feels dull by comparison.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/self/productive-people-avoid-these-things-like-plague"&gt;The Top 1% Of Productive People Avoid These 8 Things Like The Plague&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The result: A pervasive sense that we’re always behind, always distracted, and never really resting. Here are the five strategies I recommend most often. Not supplements. Not brain games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Here are five simple, evidence-backed tools that help reset the brain and make it feel less broken:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Start your day with a light, not a screen&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sunlight (or a 10,000 lux lamp) within 30 minutes of waking boosts alertness, mood, and circadian rhythm regulation. Scrolling does the opposite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Protect at least one “deep work” block&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even 45 minutes a day of uninterrupted focus, with no pings or multitasking, can &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/things-laser-focused-people-do-stay-on-task-finish-stuff"&gt;rebuild attention networks&lt;/a&gt; over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Reclaim boredom&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let yourself do nothing — no phone, no podcast, no input — for 5–10 minutes a day. This reactivates the Default Mode Network (DMN), the brain’s system for creativity, memory, and self-reflection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The DMN becomes active when you’re not focused on external tasks — during rest, daydreaming, or mind-wandering. Doing nothing — especially without digital stimulation — helps engage this network, supporting:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Creativity&lt;/strong&gt; (idea generation, divergent thinking)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Autobiographical memory&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Future planning&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Problem-solving&lt;/strong&gt; rooted in personal experience&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/health-wellness/everyday-habits-can-damage-your-brain-according-research"&gt;11 Everyday Habits That Can Damage Your Brain, According To Research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Use your eyes to calm the mind&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lateral eye movement — like looking side to side while walking outdoors or deliberately scanning the horizon — activates the parasympathetic system and reduces stress. Even 5 minutes of this, especially in nature, can lower heart rate and improve focus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Schedule a daily digital reset&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Choose a fixed time (even 20 minutes) when all devices go off. Treat it like a prescription. This single boundary can lower anxiety and help your brain transition from reaction to reflection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One patient — a 39-year-old software project manager — implemented all five of these habits over a week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Day 4, her headaches stopped. By Day 6, she told me her memory had “snapped back.” By Day 7, she had read a book cover to cover for the first time in two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This isn’t magic. It’s neurology. A week of &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/plant-habits-now-enjoy-good-life-years-to-come"&gt;intentional habits&lt;/a&gt; can change how your brain feels and functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;If your brain feels broken lately, it’s not a personal failure — it’s a system failure. &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are living in a world designed to fracture our attention and monetize our exhaustion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But you can push back. You can &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/ways-set-much-needed-boundary-without-saying-single-word"&gt;create boundaries&lt;/a&gt;. You can heal your focus. And it starts with one habit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/self/extraordinary-traits-highly-productive-people"&gt;If You Have These 15 Habits, You're An Extraordinarily Productive Person&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dr. Michael Hunter has degrees from Harvard, Yale, and the University of Pennsylvania.

          &lt;p&gt;A sweeping analysis of health data from more than 1.2 million children in Denmark born over a 24-year period found no link between the small amounts of aluminum in vaccines and a wide range of health conditions—including asthma, allergies, eczema, autism, and attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The finding, &lt;a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/ANNALS-25-00997"&gt;published in the Annals of Internal Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, firmly squashes a persistent anti-vaccine talking point that can give vaccine-hesitant parents pause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Small amounts of aluminum salts have been added to vaccines for decades as adjuvants, that is, components of the vaccine that help drum up protective immune responses against a target germ. Aluminum adjuvants can be found in a variety of vaccines, including those against diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis, &lt;em&gt;Haemophilus influenzae&lt;/em&gt; type b (Hib), and hepatitis A and B.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite decades of use worldwide and no clear link to harms, concern about aluminum and cumulative exposures continually resurfaces—largely thanks to anti-vaccine advocates who fearmonger about the element. A leader of such voices is Robert F. Kennedy Jr, the current US health secretary and an ardent anti-vaccine advocate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/p6LJXPOv4SM?t=3885"&gt;a June 2024 interview with podcaster Joe Rogan&lt;/a&gt;, Kennedy falsely claimed that aluminum is "extremely neurotoxic" and "give[s] you allergies." The podcast has racked up nearly 2 million views on YouTube. Likewise, Children's Health Defense, the rabid anti-vaccine organization &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/robert-f-kennedy-jr-announces-the-launch-of-childrens-health-defense-300710874.html"&gt;Kennedy created in 2018&lt;/a&gt;, has also made &lt;a href="https://childrenshealthdefense.org/search/?search=aluminum"&gt;wild claims about the safety of aluminum adjuvants&lt;/a&gt;. That includes linking it to &lt;a href="https://childrenshealthdefense.org/news/high-aluminum-found-autism-brain-tissue/"&gt;autism&lt;/a&gt;, despite that &lt;a href="https://www.immunize.org/wp-content/uploads/catg.d/p4026.pdf"&gt;many high-quality scientific studies&lt;/a&gt; have found &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2908388/"&gt;no link&lt;/a&gt; between any vaccines and autism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While anti-vaccine advocates like Kennedy routinely dismiss and attack the plethora of studies that do not support their dangerous claims, the new study should reassure any hesitant parents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Clear data, unclear future&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the study, lead author Niklas Worm Andersson, of the Statens Serum Institut in Copenhagen, and colleagues tapped into Denmark's national registry to analyze medical records of over 1.2 million children born in the country between 1997 and 2018. During that time, new vaccines were introduced and recommendations shifted, creating variation in how many aluminum-containing vaccines children received.&lt;/p&gt;

But new research from Oregon Health &amp;amp; Science University suggests this long-standing advice may be outdated — and unnecessarily costly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-1" data-gaid="inarticle-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="O47LVBCYVNBDZIZGAPBXXQFJ54"&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/cmr.00031-25" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;study published Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;, OHSU scientists argue that adults who completed their childhood vaccinations may not need tetanus or diphtheria boosters nearly as often as previously thought. Their findings suggest protection lasts far longer for most healthy adults — at least 30 years, and possibly for life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-2" data-gaid="inarticle-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="SRHNCEKEWZC6JC7PXTOKXFOG54"&gt;“Why keep vaccinating adults every 10 years?

His findings suggest that for adults who received the standard five-dose childhood vaccine series, immunity often lasts for life — making routine boosters largely unnecessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-8" data-gaid="inarticle-8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-enter:VFGBCU7HQRBXJE7QU65XVOPECQ" data-fusion-component="VFGBCU7HQRBXJE7QU65XVOPECQ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-exit:VFGBCU7HQRBXJE7QU65XVOPECQ" data-fusion-component="VFGBCU7HQRBXJE7QU65XVOPECQ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-9" data-gaid="inarticle-9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="VUC5ZPJWE5F2RC3UH2MZYDOBGU"&gt;Based on the evidence, the researchers propose a simpler, age-based schedule: a booster at age 30 and another at 60.

The United Kingdom, for example, doesn’t recommend routine adult boosters and has maintained low rates of both diseases, even during a 2022 influx of more than 70 diphtheria cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-11" data-gaid="inarticle-11"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="X7HRTR64UFHVFHAKUGYPQ7WZQY"&gt;The World Health Organization dropped its recommendation for routine adult boosters in 2017, advising them only in specific circumstances such as pregnancy, travel, or wound care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-12" data-gaid="inarticle-12"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="YXBKNZR7OFGPROTROSIIYEJOGQ"&gt;Meanwhile, more than 18 million Americans receive these boosters annually, costing over $1 billion.

Researchers analyzed 50 chronic conditions — including autism spectrum disorder (ASD), ADHD, asthma, and juvenile arthritis — and found no association with cumulative aluminum exposure from vaccines given before age two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even when stratified by sex, birth cohort, and follow-up duration, results consistently showed no elevated risk. These findings strongly support the safety of aluminum-adsorbed vaccines and reinforce their role in protecting children without harming their development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No Neurological Harm:&lt;/strong&gt; Aluminum exposure from vaccines was not linked to autism, ADHD, or other neurodevelopmental disorders.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No Immune Risks:&lt;/strong&gt; Autoimmune and allergic conditions like asthma and eczema were unaffected by aluminum in vaccines.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Large-Scale Evidence:&lt;/strong&gt; Over 1.2 million children studied, with consistent results across groups and follow-up periods.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For decades, aluminum in childhood vaccines has been the subject of scientific scrutiny, media headlines, and parental worry. Aluminum salts, used as adjuvants in vaccines to boost the immune response, are an integral part of routine immunizations worldwide, including those given in infancy and early childhood. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet questions have persisted: could repeated exposure to aluminum from vaccines harm a child’s developing brain or immune system?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Could it raise the risk of neurological conditions like autism spectrum disorder (ASD) or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), or contribute to autoimmune or allergic diseases?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A landmark Danish study now provides the most comprehensive answer yet: no.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Published in &lt;em&gt;Annals of Internal Medicine&lt;/em&gt;, the study analyzed a nationwide cohort of more than 1.2 million children born in Denmark between 1997 and 2018, following them for up to eight years to assess the risk of developing 50 chronic disorders, including 36 autoimmune diseases, nine allergic or atopic conditions, and five neurodevelopmental disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings were unequivocal: there was no evidence of increased risk of any of these conditions associated with higher cumulative aluminum exposure from vaccines administered in the first two years of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, the study even found slightly lower hazard ratios for some outcomes, including ASD and ADHD, among children with higher aluminum exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A Natural Experiment on a National Scale&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the unique strengths of this study was its use of real-world, population-level data across a 24-year period. During this time, Denmark’s national vaccination program underwent several policy-driven changes, replacing or supplementing certain vaccines with others that contained different amounts of aluminum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These changes created what researchers call a “natural experiment,” allowing them to measure the effects of varying aluminum exposure in children while controlling for individual health and demographic factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By linking data from Denmark’s medical birth registry, vaccination records, hospital diagnoses, and prescription data, the researchers were able to build a rich picture of each child’s medical history and cumulative aluminum exposure. On average, vaccinated children received a median cumulative dose of about 3 milligrams of aluminum by age two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Children were then followed from age two for diagnoses of any of the 50 chronic conditions of interest, which included:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Autoimmune disorders&lt;/strong&gt; like type 1 diabetes, juvenile arthritis, and autoimmune thyroid disease.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Allergic and atopic conditions&lt;/strong&gt; such as asthma, atopic dermatitis (eczema), allergic rhinitis, and food allergies.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neurodevelopmental disorders&lt;/strong&gt;, with particular focus on autism spectrum disorder (ASD), ADHD, Asperger syndrome, and related conditions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results showed no evidence of harm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Reassuring Findings Across the Board&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the combined group of autoimmune disorders, the adjusted hazard ratio per additional milligram of aluminum exposure was 0.98 (95% CI, 0.94–1.02), meaning no meaningful increase in risk. Similarly, the hazard ratio for allergic or atopic conditions was 0.99 (95% CI, 0.98–1.01).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps most notably, for neurodevelopmental disorders — a focus of much public concern — the hazard ratio was 0.93 (95% CI, 0.90–0.97), suggesting no elevated risk. When broken down further:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Autism spectrum disorder (ASD): hazard ratio 0.93 (95% CI, 0.89–0.97)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;ADHD: hazard ratio 0.90 (95% CI, 0.84–0.96)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Asperger syndrome and atypical autism also showed no significant increase.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even for the most common allergic conditions like asthma and eczema, there was no evidence of harm. In fact, the hazard ratio for asthma — the most frequently diagnosed outcome — was 0.96 (95% CI, 0.94–0.98), again showing no elevated risk associated with aluminum in vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers noted that these findings are “incompatible with moderate to large increases in risk” for any of the conditions examined, even when they extended follow-up to age eight and performed subgroup analyses by sex, birth cohort, and vaccine type.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Putting Concerns in Context&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aluminum adjuvants have been used in vaccines for over 90 years and are essential for eliciting a strong and lasting immune response to certain vaccine antigens. The total aluminum exposure from vaccines in the first two years of life — typically around 3 milligrams — is well below established toxicological safety thresholds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So why have concerns persisted?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much of the worry stems from animal studies, which showed neurotoxic effects of aluminum at much higher doses than those used in human vaccines, and from ecological or small observational studies that suggested possible associations with autism or autoimmune diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, such studies often lacked rigorous control for confounding factors or were conducted under experimental conditions not comparable to human vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This new Danish study addresses these limitations by analyzing human data at an unprecedented scale and controlling for key variables like maternal smoking, socioeconomic status, and maternal medical history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Strengths and Limitations&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sheer size and scope of this study — covering children born in Denmark over two decades — make it one of the most robust investigations of vaccine safety to date. Its use of comprehensive national health registries allowed researchers to follow outcomes objectively and uniformly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors acknowledged some limitations: because they relied on routinely collected registry data, they could not individually review medical records. Some rare disorders could not be analyzed in detail due to their very low incidence, and the study could not entirely rule out very small risks for extremely rare outcomes or risks manifesting later in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the researchers concluded that any such risks would have to be so small as to be “incompatible with moderate to large increases in risk,” and thus unlikely to meaningfully influence public health recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the current climate of vaccine hesitancy, this study provides critical reassurance for parents, healthcare providers, and policymakers. With social media amplifying misinformation and skepticism, robust evidence like this helps counter false narratives and reinforce confidence in childhood immunization programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the authors note, “our findings strengthen the case for maintaining high vaccination rates — and protecting children not only from preventable infections, but also from misplaced fears.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaccines remain one of the most effective public health tools available. The diseases they prevent — diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, Hib, and others — can cause severe illness, disability, and death. The inclusion of aluminum as an adjuvant ensures these vaccines work effectively while remaining safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study underscores that safety, showing that children exposed to aluminum through vaccines grow up just as healthy, neurologically, immunologically, and developmentally, as those who receive less.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Looking Ahead&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future research may continue to monitor long-term outcomes into adolescence and adulthood and to investigate extremely rare disorders. But for now, the evidence is clear: aluminum-adsorbed vaccines do not harm children’s brains, immune systems, or allergic health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parents can take comfort in knowing that vaccinating their children protects them from serious diseases without increasing the risk of chronic conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As vaccine scientists noted, “Vaccines are among the most scrutinized medical interventions in history — and still among the safest.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This new research is a powerful addition to that body of scrutiny and reassurance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this vaccine safety and neurodevelopment research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://neurosciencenews.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Neuroscience News Communications&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://neurosciencenews.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Neuroscience News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Neuroscience News Communications – Neuroscience News&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/ANNALS-25-00997" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Aluminum-Adsorbed Vaccines and Chronic Diseases in Childhood: A Nationwide Cohort Study&lt;/a&gt;” by Niklas Worm Andersson et al. &lt;em&gt;Annals of Internal Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aluminum-Adsorbed Vaccines and Chronic Diseases in Childhood: A Nationwide Cohort Study&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Background:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aluminum is used as an adjuvant in nonlive vaccines administered in early childhood. Concerns persist about potential associations between vaccination with aluminum-adsorbed vaccines and increased risk for chronic autoimmunity, atopy or allergy, and neurodevelopmental disorders. Large-scale safety data remain limited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Objective:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To assess the association between cumulative aluminum exposure from early childhood vaccination and risk for autoimmune, atopic or allergic, and neurodevelopmental disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Design:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A cohort study linking nationwide registry data on childhood vaccinations, outcome diagnoses, and potential confounders, leveraging the variations in the aluminum content of childhood vaccines over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Setting:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Denmark, 1997 to 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Participants:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;1 224 176 children born in Denmark between 1997 and 2018 who were alive and residing in the country at age 2 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Intervention:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cumulative aluminum amount received (per 1-mg increase) through vaccination during the first 2 years of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Measurements:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Incident events of 50 chronic disorders, including autoimmune (dermatologic, endocrinologic, hematologic, gastrointestinal, and rheumatic), atopic or allergic (asthma, atopic dermatitis, rhinoconjunctivitis, and allergy), and neurodevelopmental (autism spectrum disorder and attention deficit–hyperactivity disorder).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Results:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cumulative aluminum exposure from vaccination during the first 2 years of life was not associated with increased rates of any of the 50 disorders assessed. For groups of combined outcomes, adjusted hazard ratios per 1-mg increase in aluminum exposure were 0.98 (95% CI, 0.94 to 1.02) for any autoimmune disorder, 0.99 (CI, 0.98 to 1.01) for any atopic or allergic disorder, and 0.93 (CI, 0.90 to 0.97) for any neurodevelopmental disorder. For most individually analyzed outcomes, the upper bounds of the 95% CIs were incompatible with relative increases greater than 10% or 30%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Limitation:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Individual medical records were not reviewed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This nationwide cohort study did not find evidence supporting an increased risk for autoimmune, atopic or allergic, or neurodevelopmental disorders associated with early childhood exposure to aluminum-adsorbed vaccines. For most outcomes, the findings were inconsistent with moderate to large relative increases in risk, although small relative effects, particularly for some rarer disorders, could not be statistically excluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Primary Funding Source:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;None.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 15 Jul 2025 20:48:44 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMib0FVX3lxTE80cFV5WlZGakZDa1JMbnN0cldBZjRqdkVqVmxkU0xzbzRGdHk2dVZFd245Rl9FUkVkb3RMZUlVUk9KQnR3cURkMHF4QTZFMnMwdHZ0SnA4ZHliWFlPNmNmcV85OFl5LUNleldxR3Q2Yw</guid></item><item><title>PHMDC在药物过量服用增加后发布公共卫生警报- Channel 3000 | PHMDC issues public health alert after increase in drug overdoses - Channel 3000</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi4gFBVV95cUxOelB2cVNMS0dINmNnWThXZ3ZnY1otcE1VaW1kNjBKakk2MDVVc0xZTDNZZTQzaDYwZmhrR3czcElWd0k1UUJ2QTR0VEwwUGs3ZFlUbGY3R1MyNWZITWVVc3BuVjZGU1FYLTBTUnBKM2RKeEFfcDdBWFZlaHlLMmM2UG1nd0ZCLUppUGZaVXp6NnM0UmNqRF81WHJ0NXE2d3pNQUhxR1F1UHR0QW9fNVRoUXJlb0VrNHFwaEYtcDlscHdpRm54MFduTXV6aU5OT1Bjbnl1UTUyTjI1RVVVTDVack5n?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-body" itemprop="articleBody" class="asset-content  subscriber-premium" false&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;MADISON, Wis. -- Public Health Madison &amp;amp; Dane County issued a public health alert on Tuesday due to an increase in drug overdoses in Dane County. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PHMDC reported the alert is based on data from hospitals and EMS providers. Within 24 hours, July 13 to July 14, there were five confirmed overdose response calls from EMS. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is unknown what is driving this spike. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Drug use during the summer months can also increase the risk of heat-related illnesses, like heat stroke and dehydration." "This is because certain types of drugs raise core body temperature and interfere with the body’s ability to regulate temperature,” said Public Health Supervisor Julia Olson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_top" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you or someone you know is using drugs, PHMDC gave the following tips:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=misAs9xKO8s" target="_blank"&gt;Know the signs of an overdose:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pale, sweaty or clammy skin&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lips/fingertips turn blue&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Slow or irregular breathing: gasping, gurgling, or snoring&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Difficult or unable to wake&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Always call 911 if you think someone is overdosing&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Don’t use street drugs alone; call Never Use Alone at 800-484-3731&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Check in with your friends/family who use drugs&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Test all drugs for fentanyl before using&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Carry Narcan® (naloxone) and be prepared to use multiple doses when needed&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Get safer use supplies, like fentanyl test strips and Narcan®, from the Syringe Services Program at Public Health Madison &amp;amp; Dane County: 2705 E.

Scientists found that older musicians showed more efficient brain connectivity and better performance than non-musicians of the same age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This suggests that musical training builds cognitive reserve, preserving brain networks and reducing the need for age-related compensatory mechanisms. The findings support the idea that positive lifestyle choices like learning music can mitigate age-related cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Older musicians outperformed peers on speech-in-noise tasks, with more youthful brain connectivity patterns.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Functional MRI showed that musical training preserved the integrity of auditory and motor brain networks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The study supports the “Hold-Back Upregulation” hypothesis: cognitive reserve maintains brain efficiency.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;PLOS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Long-term musical training may mitigate the age-related decline in speech perception by enhancing cognitive reserve, according to a study published July 15&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; in the open-access journal &lt;em&gt;PLOS Biology &lt;/em&gt;by Claude Alain from the Baycrest Academy for Research and Education, Canada, and Yi Du from the Chinese Academy of Sciences.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Normal aging is typically associated with declines in sensory and cognitive functions. These age-related changes in perception and cognition are often accompanied by increased neural activity and functional connectivity – the statistical dependence of activity between different brain regions – in widely distributed neural networks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-111656"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/music-aging-cognition-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/music-aging-cognition-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/music-aging-cognition-neuroscience-770x514.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/music-aging-cognition-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/music-aging-cognition-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/music-aging-cognition-neuroscience-293x196.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/music-aging-cognition-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/music-aging-cognition-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows an older man playing piano and a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/music-aging-cognition-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/music-aging-cognition-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/music-aging-cognition-neuroscience-770x514.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/music-aging-cognition-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/music-aging-cognition-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/music-aging-cognition-neuroscience-293x196.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/music-aging-cognition-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;As predicted, the results revealed reduced age-related declines in speech-in-noise performance among older musicians compared to older non-musicians.  Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The recruitment of neural activity and strengthening of functional connectivity are thought to reflect a compensatory strategy employed by older adults to maintain optimal cognitive performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Positive lifestyle choices, such as musical training, higher levels of education, and bilingualism, contribute to cognitive and brain reserve, which represents the accumulation of cognitive and neural resources before the onset of age-related brain changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cognitive Reserve Theory suggests that this reserve accrued through experience and training can help mitigate the impact of age-related brain decline, leading to better-than-expected cognitive performance. Yet how cumulative reserves influenced by positive lifestyle factors affect neural activity in older populations remains controversial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To investigate this question, the researchers used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to measure brain activity in 25 older musicians, 25 older non-musicians, and 24 young non-musicians who were asked to identify syllables masked by noise sounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers focused their analysis on neural responses within the auditory dorsal stream, which includes auditory, inferior parietal, dorsal frontal motor, and frontal motor areas, supporting sound-to-action mapping and sensorimotor integration during speech processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As predicted, the results revealed reduced age-related declines in speech-in-noise performance among older musicians compared to older non-musicians. During speech-in-noise perception, the older non-musicians showed the typical age-related compensatory increase in functional connectivity in auditory dorsal streams bilaterally (i.e., in both hemispheres of the brain).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By contrast, older musicians exhibited a connectivity pattern in bilateral auditory dorsal streams that resembled young non-musicians, with connectivity strength in the right dorsal stream correlating with speech-in-noise perception.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, older musicians exhibited more youth-like spatial pattern of functional connectivity during the task, whereas older non-musicians consistently showed a spatial pattern that deviated from young non-musicians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taken together, these findings support the “Hold-Back Upregulation” hypothesis, which posits that cognitive reserve from musical training promotes a more youthful functional connectivity pattern, leading to superior behavioral outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond merely compensating for age-related declines, cognitive reserve may work by maintaining the integrity and functional architecture of neural networks, thereby mitigating the adverse effects of aging on cognitive performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But due to the study design, it was not possible to determine cause-and-effect relationships between musical training and performance in the perception task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the authors, future studies should further test the “Hold-Back Upregulation” hypothesis using different cognitive tasks, such as memory and attention tasks, and investigate other sources of reserve, such as physical exercise and bilingualism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eventually, these findings may inform interventions aimed at preserving cognitive function and improving communication outcomes in aging populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Lei Zhang adds, “A positive lifestyle helps older adults cope better with cognitive ageing, and it is never too late to take up, and stick with, a rewarding hobby such as learning an instrument.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Yi Du adds, “Just like a well-tuned instrument doesn’t need to be played louder to be heard, the brains of older musicians stay finely tuned thanks to years of training. Our study shows that this musical experience builds cognitive reserve, helping their brains avoid the usual age-related overexertion when trying to understand speech in noisy places.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;This work was supported by STI 2030—Major Project (2021ZD0201500, https://service.most.gov.cn/) to YD, the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (RGPIN-2021-02721, https://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/index_eng.asp) to CA, and Canadian Institute for Health Research (PJT 183614, https://cihr-irsc.gc.ca/e/193.html) to CA.

          &lt;h2 class="AlignCenter"&gt;Ultra-Processed Foods: The Smoking Gun Behind the Obesity Epidemic&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For years, the mainstream chorus has been singing the same tired tune:&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;“It’s just calories in, calories out.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Move more, eat less, and voilà—problem solved. But a new study published in&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PNAS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;just torched that simplistic model and handed the mic to what many dismissed as fringe theory: ultra-processed foods (UPFs) aren’t just empty calories—they’re metabolic saboteurs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Study Breakdown&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Researchers ran a tightly controlled trial comparing diets rich in UPFs versus minimally processed foods. The results? People eating UPFs consumed significantly more calories and gained weight—&lt;strong&gt;even though both diets were matched for macros, fiber, sugar, and sodium&lt;/strong&gt;. That’s not just a crack in the calories-in/calories-out wall. It’s a wrecking ball.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;UPFs mess with satiety signals, gut hormones, and reward pathways. They’re engineered to be hyper-palatable and easy to overconsume. You’re not just eating food—you’re eating a product designed to override your body’s natural brakes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Exercise Isn’t the Fix&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study didn’t let participants slack off. Physical activity was monitored and held constant. Still, those on the UPF-heavy diet gained weight. So no, your morning jog isn’t going to undo the damage from a dinner of frozen pizza and neon-orange snack dust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This isn’t about moralizing food choices or shaming bodies. It’s about calling out a system that’s been gaslighting people into thinking their weight is just a personal failure of willpower. It’s not. It’s biochemical warfare disguised as convenience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Final Word&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So next time someone parrots&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;“just eat less and move more,”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;hand them this study. Then ask them why Big Food keeps pumping out edible plastics while public health spirals. Spoiler: it’s not because they care about your macros.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;📎 Read the full study on&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.2420902122" target="_blank"&gt;PNAS&lt;/a&gt;.  There’s also a good article in the Washington Post today: &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/07/16/obesity-cause-diet-exercise/" target="_blank" title=""&gt; What causes obesity? A major new study is upending common wisdom.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="103" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd4t27hd00691dktf9c9yw1w@published"&gt;Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the United States secretary of health and human services, has some strong opinions about teeth. Specifically, he seems to kind of hate fluoride, a mineral that, when added to the public drinking water in small amounts, can prevent dental decay. Despite what Kennedy claims, there are &lt;a href="https://slate.com/technology/2025/01/fluoride-childrens-iq-study-pregnancy-science.html"&gt;no proven negative side effects&lt;/a&gt; of doing this. So far this year, Utah and Florida have banned fluoride in their drinking water, and a &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/05/16/fluoride-bans-states-florida-utah/83667361007/"&gt;slew of other states&lt;/a&gt; are considering doing the same. Without fluoride in the water, “you’re going to see probably slightly more cavities,” RFK Jr. &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2025/06/27/rfk-jr-fluoride-more-cavities-balance/84382999007/"&gt;recently admitted&lt;/a&gt; on Fox News.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="99" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd4uxkpk001j3b775jw5nlhe@published"&gt;That cavalier attitude about a rise in cavities has upset a lot of dentists. Cavities aren’t trivial—they can result in a lot of pain. “Dental decay is a &lt;em&gt;disease&lt;/em&gt;,” Barry Taylor, executive director of Oregon Dental Association, told me. “Essentially, he’s saying: There will be more disease.” The American Dental Association “is very concerned for people of all ages and socioeconomic status” in communities stopping water fluoridation, a spokesperson wrote in an email. “People who suffer from untreated dental disease miss millions of school and work hours,” they added. So far, RFK Jr. is not looking great for America’s teeth.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="85" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd4uxkpk001k3b77vzuh0y04@published"&gt;When Slate saw the above not-so-flattering image in a &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/insurers-wont-say-if-theyll-pay-for-childhood-vaccines-dropped-from-recommended-schedule/"&gt;recent Wired article&lt;/a&gt;, we had to wonder, &lt;a href="https://www.threads.com/@nicmonsees/post/DLnVWcwzJdA/what-is-even-happening-here-with-rfk-jrs-teeth-and-gums"&gt;as others&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Dentistry/comments/1lppwoz/what_the_hell_is_happening_in_rfk_jrs_mouth/"&gt;did&lt;/a&gt;, if Kennedy is not great for his &lt;em&gt;own&lt;/em&gt; teeth. His mouth looks a little … grimy. Is it possible the man is against not just fluoride but also toothbrushes and floss? I called up a few dentists to see what they might make of his incisors. (Here, I’ll state the requisite caveat: It’s impossible to diagnose from a single photo and without a full dental workup.)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="43" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd4uxkpl001l3b772tc71rb3@published"&gt;There’s a lot to unpack. “The first thought is, he needs to brush his teeth,” Taylor said. “It may just be a picture that was taken after lunch, and he has a piece of Windsor clam or something in there, I don’t know.”&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="128" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd4uxkpl001m3b77kaq4e30p@published"&gt;Other dentists were less sure about the wad of yellowish stuff stuck between his left front tooth and the tooth next to it. When I showed the picture to my own dentist, he thought it looked most like calculus—hardened plaque—though, he said, that usually forms across multiple teeth. Arosha Weerakoon, a professor in dentistry at the University of Queensland, in Australia, suggested that it could be something called Valplast, a type of flexible denture—perhaps that front tooth of his is fake. Though the consensus was that most if not all of RFK Jr.’s teeth look as if they are probably real, which is “pretty big for that age,” my dentist noted. (Kennedy is 71 years old, and most people have replaced at least a few teeth by then.)&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="141" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd4uxkpl001n3b77tf2lmlcv@published"&gt;He got high marks for his gums too. There’s some darkening at the point where tooth meets gum, which indicates recession. But that happens naturally with aging, Weerakoon said, and at a glance, the extent of RFK Jr.’s recession appears to be in line with what you might expect at 71. Notably, his gums aren’t puffy, which would indicate gum disease. (Another controversial figure who likely &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; have gum disease: Elon Musk. &lt;a href="https://dentalwiseturkey.com/elon-musk-teeth/"&gt;That puffy part by his front tooth&lt;/a&gt;? “It’s severely inflamed,” Weerakoon said. A slight touch to that area while speaking or eating, and “that’d be bleeding everywhere.”) Gum disease is &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/21482-gum-periodontal-disease"&gt;most often caused by the buildup of plaque&lt;/a&gt;, which consists of bacteria that can infect the gums. Oral hygiene—especially brushing and flossing—is important to prevent gum disease. So Kennedy’s nice gums suggest that he may, generally, be a flosser.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="94" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd4uxkpm001o3b77ysdxu7lv@published"&gt;There’s also the matter of the white strip on his top gum. Taylor suggested that it could be medical tape used to cover a surgical site. Weerakoon asked her dentist friends about it, and they came to a different conclusion: “It’s a Zyn.” That’s also what my own dentist thought. A friend and extracurricular Zyn expert whom I checked with concurred that it looks identical to the nicotine pouch that people push into their gums. It aligns, too, with public speculation back in January that RFK Jr. &lt;a href="https://people.com/rfk-jr-speculation-nicotine-pouch-confirmation-hearing-8783718"&gt;popped a Zyn&lt;/a&gt; during a confirmation hearing.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="103" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd4uxkpm001p3b77v01xq99j@published"&gt;Taken together, while the average person might recoil from this pic, it’s not damning of Kennedy’s dental hygiene. “If I was at a cocktail party, I’d be thinking, ‘decent teeth,’ ” said Taylor. “Just from that one picture, it appears that he has had good dental care in his life.” But what about the discoloring? Weerakoon notes that the slight difference between the two left teeth is likely due to a knock on the left tooth, which could have killed the tooth’s nerve. (I have the misfortune of an identical discoloring on the same exact tooth due to a slip on a rock.)&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  
  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="144" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd4uxkpm001q3b77ax38ympe@published"&gt;The rest of the yellowing is a sign not of bad hygiene but of natural teeth “within a range of normal for that age,” Taylor said. All teeth yellow with time, and no amount of brushing and mouthwash can fix that—you’d have to have veneers or get bleach treatments, common choices for many Americans, particularly those in the &lt;a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2004/07/what-nice-teeth-the-democrats-have.html"&gt;public eye&lt;/a&gt;. Veneers are &lt;a href="https://www.gq.com/story/why-does-everyone-in-hollywood-have-veneers-now"&gt;a norm in Hollywood now&lt;/a&gt;, and there’s even &lt;a href="https://www.hiltonheadcosmeticdentist.com/president-trump-wear-porcelain-veneers/"&gt;speculation&lt;/a&gt; that Donald Trump’s too-perfect teeth &lt;a href="https://www.bhdentists.com/blog/donald-trumps-smile-care-secrets/"&gt;are actually veneers&lt;/a&gt;. The interesting truth is that teeth don’t have to necessarily &lt;em&gt;look&lt;/em&gt; good to be in good condition—in fact, natural teeth will almost certainly &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; look “good” (i.e., white, spot-free, straight). So here I might throw RFK Jr. a bone: He’s not feeling any sort of pressure for his teeth to perfectly look the part. You could even say he’s helping to redefine dental beauty standards.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="110" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd4uxkpm001r3b77c3a0zl5d@published"&gt;The fact that RFK Jr.’s teeth are largely in dentist-approved shape, though, is really the point. Although the fluoridation of public water that he opposes can benefit everyone, it’s consistently found to be most beneficial to &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama-health-forum/fullarticle/2834515"&gt;people with low incomes or who live in rural areas&lt;/a&gt;. There are other ways to get fluoride: toothpaste with fluoride or a professional fluoride treatment at your dentist’s office. And there are other important steps to keep your teeth in good shape and fight cavities: eating a healthy diet, brushing and flossing, regularly visiting the dentist. But all of these options require a certain level of access to resources, money, time, and health education.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="65" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd4uxkpn001s3b77i61q9mp2@published"&gt;“RFK can afford any dentist anytime he wants to,” said Weerakoon. “So he can afford to go without water fluoridation.” For those who aren’t as fortunate, fluoridation is a great, inexpensive option to reduce cavities among all populations; the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has given the process the distinction of being “&lt;a href="https://blogs.cdc.gov/pcd/2015/04/23/community-water-fluoridation-one-of-the-10-greatest-public-health-achievements-of-the-20th-century/"&gt;one of the 10 greatest public health achievements of the 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;

  



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="91" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd4uxkpn001t3b77mnp979qy@published"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama-health-forum/fullarticle/2834515"&gt;recent study projected&lt;/a&gt; that complete fluoridation removal from drinking water in the U.S. would lead to an increase of roughly 25.4 million cases of decayed teeth in children and cost approximately $9.8 billion over five years in health care expenses. Low-income communities will be hardest hit. Dental disease isn’t just a cavity here and there. It can cause millions of &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/school-health-conditions/chronic/oral-health.html"&gt;missed school days&lt;/a&gt; among children; cost someone a job or create significant quality-of-life challenges due to social stigma; and, some research suggests, even result in complications such as &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/adult-health/in-depth/dental/art-20047475#:~:text=Some%20research%20suggests%20that%20heart,birth%20and%20low%20birth%20weight"&gt;cardiovascular disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="90" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd4uxkpn001u3b774t6aqse1@published"&gt;Kids, who cannot go out and buy fluoride toothpaste for themselves, will be particularly harmed by RFK Jr.’s anti-fluoride crusade. Weerakoon saw firsthand what could become more common in the States when working at a &lt;a href="https://www.health.qld.gov.au/public-health/industry-environment/environment-land-water/water/fluoridation"&gt;school in Queensland&lt;/a&gt; where many children were not drinking fluoridated water. She had a 4-year-old patient with so many holes in his teeth that he had to have all them removed. And yet, tooth decay &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/oral-health"&gt;is largely preventable&lt;/a&gt;. “We’re protecting those who are most vulnerable,” Weerakoon said, “that don’t have an opportunity to help &lt;span class="slate-paragraph--tombstone"&gt;themselves.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;For generations, chicken soup has been &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/002067.htm"&gt;a go-to remedy&lt;/a&gt; for people feeling under the weather. It holds a cherished place in many cultures as a comforting treatment for colds and  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-influenza" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="103478" data-postid="167855" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;flu&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But is there any real science behind the idea that soup can help us recover from respiratory infections?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alongside colleagues, I conducted a &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/17/13/2247"&gt;systematic review&lt;/a&gt; to explore this question, which examined the scientific evidence on the role of soup in managing acute respiratory tract infections, such as the common cold,  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-influenza" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="103478" data-postid="167855" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;influenza&lt;/a&gt; and  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/coronavirus" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73041" data-postid="167855" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;COVID-19&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Out of more than 10,000 records, we identified four high-quality studies involving 342 participants. These studies tested a variety of soups, including &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/does-chicken-soup-really-help-when-youre-sick-a-nutrition-specialist-explains-whats-behind-the-beloved-comfort-food-213847"&gt;traditional chicken broth&lt;/a&gt;, barley soup, and herbal vegetable blends. While still early-stage, the evidence was promising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/chicken-soup-has-been-a-remedy-for-thousands-of-years-but-why?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;Chicken Soup Has Been a Remedy For Thousands of Years… But Why?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9391229/"&gt;One study found&lt;/a&gt; that people who ate soup recovered up to 2.5 days faster than those who didn't.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms such as nasal congestion, sore throat and fatigue were milder. Some participants also showed reduced levels of &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/ageing-isnt-the-same-everywhere-why-inflammation-may-be-a-lifestyle-problem-260322"&gt;inflammation-related&lt;/a&gt; markers: substances in the blood that rise when the immune system is fighting an infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specifically, levels of &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4176007/"&gt;IL-6&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/tumor-necrosis-factor-alpha"&gt;TNF-α&lt;/a&gt; – two proteins that help trigger inflammation – were lower in those who consumed soup. This suggests that soup may help calm an overactive immune response, potentially making symptoms less severe and recovery more comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, none of the studies examined how consuming soup influenced everyday outcomes of acute respiratory tract infections, such as whether people took fewer days off work or were less likely to end up in hospital. That's a major gap in the evidence, and one that future research needs to address.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/can-chicken-soup-really-cure-body-and-soul-52357"&gt;are several reasons soup&lt;/a&gt; may help.

(GoodLifeStudio/Getty Images Signature/Canva)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Not just nourishment&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's also a strong cultural and behavioral aspect to food-based self-care: when people use food not just for nourishment, but as an intentional part of managing illness and promoting recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In many households, food becomes medicine not only because of its ingredients, but because it symbolizes care, routine and reassurance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My previous research found that &lt;a href="https://www.dovepress.com/parent-use-of-complementary-medicine-remedies-and-services-for-the-man-peer-reviewed-fulltext-article-JMDH"&gt;parents, in particular&lt;/a&gt; often &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1744388120301900?via%3Dihub"&gt;turn to traditional remedies&lt;/a&gt;, like soup, as a first line of defense when illness strikes, often well before seeking professional medical advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This reflects &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0965229917309056?via%3Dihub"&gt;a growing interest in home remedies&lt;/a&gt; and the importance of culturally familiar treatments: remedies that feel safe, trusted and emotionally resonant because they're part of a person's upbringing or community norms. These kinds of treatments can increase confidence and comfort when self-managing illness at home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Food-based self-care may become increasingly important as pressure on healthcare systems continues to grow. With rising concerns about &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/antimicrobial-resistance"&gt;antimicrobial resistance&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://qualitysafety.bmj.com/content/33/11/738"&gt;overstretched services&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.576229/full"&gt;lingering trauma from global pandemics&lt;/a&gt;, simple, evidence-informed home treatments can play a crucial role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They help people manage mild illness, reduce unnecessary antibiotic use and avoid placing additional strain on GPs or &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/dec/31/big-rise-in-people-going-to-ae-in-england-for-minor-ailments-data-shows"&gt;emergency departments for minor ailments&lt;/a&gt; that can be safely treated at home. Even a simple phone &lt;a href="https://www.gponline.com/simple-phone-message-common-cold-cuts-gp-appointment-waits-21/article/1581517"&gt;message about the common cold&lt;/a&gt; – "Most common colds get better in a few days and don't need treatment from your GP" – has been shown to reduce appointment demand by 21 percent, highlighting how low-cost, home-based care could ease pressure across the system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Local Government Association (LGA) &lt;a href="https://www.local.gov.uk/sites/default/files/documents/22.32%20-%20Self%20Care%20Publication_02.1_1WEB.pdf"&gt;reports that&lt;/a&gt; GPs handle approximately 57 million cases of minor conditions such as coughs and colds annually, costing the NHS over £2 billion a year. &lt;a href="https://www.local.gov.uk/topics/social-care-health-and-integration/role-councils-promoting-self-care"&gt;It argues that&lt;/a&gt; educating people about &lt;a href="https://www.pagb.co.uk/content/uploads/2024/01/PAGB-Self-Care-Survey-2023.pdf"&gt;effective self-care&lt;/a&gt; could help save GPs an hour a day on average.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Soup fits the bill&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;So chicken soup is easy to prepare, affordable, safe for most people and widely recognized as a comforting, familiar home remedy for minor illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, our review highlighted a clear need for more research. Future studies could examine standardized soup recipes and investigate whether particular combinations of nutrients or herbs work best: does chicken soup have the same effect as barley broth or vegetable potage? Is there a difference if it's homemade versus canned?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just as importantly, future research needs to measure meaningful outcomes: how quickly people return to work or school, how well they sleep during illness, how they rate their comfort and energy levels, for example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soup isn't a replacement for medicine. But alongside rest, fluids and paracetamol, it might offer a simple way to ease symptoms and help people feel better.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/260960/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

Okra's health benefits definitely make it worth the effort.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Brazilian researchers discovered that okra, a fuzzy green pod often overlooked in supermarkets, may help reduce body fat, improve blood sugar and cholesterol levels, and even protect vital organs like the liver f rom obesity-related damage &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In this animal trial, researchers worked with newborn rats, dividing them into two initial groups based on litter size to simulate different feeding conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The first group included only three pups per mother - allowing them to have more access to milk and gain weight more rapidly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The other group followed a standard litter size of eight pups, creating more competition for milk and slower early growth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At three weeks old, all rats were weaned and placed on one of two diets: a standard rodent diet or the same diet supplemented with 1.5 percent okra. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The form of the okra, whether fresh, powdered, or otherwise, was not specified. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The rats remained on their assigned diets until adulthood at 100 days old. Researchers tracked body weight, food and water intake, blood sugar, fat accumulation, and muscle mass every two days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also measured insulin sensitivity in both the body and brain, and analyzed inflammation markers in the hypothalamus, the brain region that regulates appetite and energy balance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;By adulthood, rats from small litters on a standard diet showed greater food consumption, higher blood sugar, and increased fat mass compared to the others, highlighting the metabolic risks tied to early-life overnutrition and the potential mitigating effects of okra.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;While human trials are still needed, scientists believe introducing okra early in life could offer protective health effects over time&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Rats that were overfed early in life showed clear signs of metabolic dysfunction, including insulin resistance, a key driver of Type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, those same rats who were later placed on an okra-supplemented diet had lower blood sugar and cholesterol levels compared to those that didn’t receive okra, despite identical early-life overfeeding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The small-litter rats on the okra diet also experienced slightly increased fat mass but showed gains in muscle mass, better glucose tolerance, and improved blood sugar control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Strikingly, their brains also exhibited reduced inflammation and responded to insulin administered directly into the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This was something not observed in the overfed rats on a standard diet, suggesting improved central insulin sensitivity, which plays a role in regulating hunger and energy balance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In contrast, rats from standard-sized litters, whether on an okra diet or not, showed no significant differences in weight, blood sugar, fat accumulation, or brain inflammation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This led researchers to conclude that okra's benefits may be most effective in those already at risk of obesity-related conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While human trials have not yet been conducted, the researchers believe that compounds in okra, such as catechins, quercetin, and other phenolic antioxidants, may help counteract the long-term effects of early-life overnutrition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They noted that consuming excess calories during critical developmental windows, whether in animals or humans, can lead to lasting damage to the liver, heart, and brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Introducing antioxidant-rich foods like okra, they suggest, could be a simple and affordable strategy to reduce metabolic disease risk later in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The fruit can be eaten raw in salads or salsa as well as cooked or roasted along other fruits and vegetables into various dishes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, the scientists believe that the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of okra can help fight against the damage caused by obesity, improve blood sugar levels and heart health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, previous research has shown that eating okras can also reduce the risk of developing colon cancer and improves bone health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Krasuna noted: 'Fiber also helps with blood sugar control. It works by slowing down the absorption of sugar and carbs. Okra is a great high-fiber food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'One-half cup of cooked okra provides more than 2 grams of fiber - nearly 10 percent of what adults need in a day.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Furthermore, one-half cup of cooked okra also provides 32 micrograms of Vitamin K (essential for blood clotting and bone health), 14 milligrams of Vitamin C (supports the immune system and enhances iron absorption) as well as 37 micrograms of folate ( a crucial B vitamin essential for cell growth and division). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The fruit can be eaten raw in salads or salsa as well as cooked or roasted along other fruits and vegetables into various dishes. The study was published in Brain Research earlier this month. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Tue, 15 Jul 2025 18:24:20 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiogFBVV95cUxNeXJQd3hrWF9uZUd3WEUxb1N3WDFJYl9PZG9wRS13M205MkVjQmpBSE9Pdzl4cmV2dVNpVVFLZDNEMy1HTXJ0c0ppSm53OHVoN3dpbDZHaEFUcU9uNnJXdHBzd3hwbzNlRU40N0JBaFFnb2lFWjRySDBabnFKZmVnRlBOcG1YblJEVW92b292N01hRmk1em9iMWt2M0xTbEEwdVHSAacBQVVfeXFMTlJVX2J4VkNDVlRJWktsdGd1TFZXWGtDaG1BZ2NCd3owa19BVDZXMnlFbUhXb2g0YXYxWHJQOW9Ec3RLNm9sazUwdjZFS0lObUVlbEVocnJxZFlUcWFTUVVWOF85aHJuVkhrWWFOVTJQOG5kVHIxUXc2WmpROXJENWJjdFEtSFF5bExLSW9VWE9IVzdHdHpsekVwNFh0cC1vZ0RWbkNJQmM</guid></item><item><title>想随着年龄的增长提高你的大脑吗？音乐可能是答案- Medical Xpress | Want to boost your brain as you age?

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long-term musical training may mitigate the age-related decline in speech perception by enhancing cognitive reserve, according to a study published in &lt;i&gt;PLOS Biology&lt;/i&gt; by Claude Alain from the Baycrest Academy for Research and Education, Canada, and Yi Du from the Chinese Academy of Sciences.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                &lt;p class="w-100 my-4 d-print-none"&gt;
     
     
     &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7587637799"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
     
&lt;/p&gt;  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Normal aging is typically associated with declines in sensory and cognitive functions. These age-related changes in perception and cognition are often accompanied by increased neural activity and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/functional+connectivity/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;functional connectivity&lt;/a&gt;—the statistical dependence of activity between different brain regions—in widely distributed neural networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recruitment of neural activity and strengthening of functional connectivity are thought to reflect a compensatory strategy employed by &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/older+adults/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;older adults&lt;/a&gt; to maintain optimal cognitive performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Positive lifestyle choices, such as musical training, higher levels of education, and bilingualism, contribute to cognitive and brain reserve, which represents the accumulation of cognitive and neural resources before the onset of age-related brain changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cognitive Reserve Theory suggests that this reserve accrued through experience and training can help mitigate the impact of age-related brain decline, leading to better-than-expected cognitive performance. Yet how cumulative reserves influenced by positive lifestyle factors affect &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/neural+activity/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;neural activity&lt;/a&gt; in older populations remains controversial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To investigate this question, the researchers used &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/functional+magnetic+resonance/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;functional magnetic resonance&lt;/a&gt; imaging (fMRI) to measure brain activity in 25 older musicians, 25 older non-musicians, and 24 young non-musicians who were asked to identify syllables masked by noise sounds.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;The researchers focused their analysis on neural responses within the auditory dorsal stream, which includes auditory, inferior parietal, dorsal frontal motor, and frontal motor areas, supporting sound-to-action mapping and sensorimotor integration during speech processing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As predicted, the results revealed reduced age-related declines in speech-in-noise performance among older musicians compared to older non-musicians. During speech-in-noise perception, the older non-musicians showed the typical age-related compensatory increase in functional connectivity in auditory dorsal streams bilaterally (i.e., in both hemispheres of the brain).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By contrast, older musicians exhibited a connectivity pattern in bilateral auditory dorsal streams that resembled young non-musicians, with connectivity strength in the right dorsal stream correlating with speech-in-noise perception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, older musicians exhibited a more youth-like spatial pattern of functional connectivity during the task, whereas older non-musicians consistently showed a spatial pattern that deviated from young non-musicians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taken together, these findings support the "Hold-Back Upregulation" hypothesis, which posits that cognitive reserve from musical training promotes a more youthful functional connectivity pattern, leading to superior behavioral outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond merely compensating for age-related declines, cognitive reserve may work by maintaining the integrity and functional architecture of &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/neural+networks/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;neural networks&lt;/a&gt;, thereby mitigating the adverse effects of aging on cognitive performance. But due to the study design, it was not possible to determine cause-and-effect relationships between &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/musical+training/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;musical training&lt;/a&gt; and performance in the perception task.&lt;/p&gt;

Eventually, these findings may inform interventions aimed at preserving cognitive function and improving communication outcomes in aging populations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Lei Zhang adds, "A positive lifestyle helps older adults cope better with cognitive aging, and it is never too late to take up, and stick with, a rewarding hobby such as learning an instrument."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Yi Du adds, "Just like a well-tuned instrument doesn't need to be played louder to be heard, the brains of older musicians stay finely tuned thanks to years of training. Our study shows that this musical experience builds &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/cognitive+reserve/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;cognitive reserve&lt;/a&gt;, helping their brains avoid the usual age-related overexertion when trying to understand speech in noisy places."&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Life may unfold as a continuous stream, but our memories tell a different story. We do not recall the past as one long, unbroken text. Instead, we remember it as a series of meaningful events, like how sentences are structured with grammar and punctuation. Like any narrative, this organization gives our experiences shape and coherence, helping us make sense of what and when things happen.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                &lt;p class="w-100 my-4 d-print-none"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;The brain must devote a lot of space to this herculean task, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wrong! It turns out that a tiny but mighty region pulls far more than its weight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a paper &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/neuron/abstract/S0896-6273(25)00360-5" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;i&gt;Neuron&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/locus+coeruleus/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;locus coeruleus&lt;/a&gt;, acts like a "&lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/memory/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;memory&lt;/a&gt; reset button" during meaningful changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our key question was: as an experience unfolds, how does the brain 'know' when one meaningful memory has ended and the next should begin?" said UCLA psychology professor and first author David Clewett. "Research has shown that remaining in a stable context, such as the same room, binds sequential experiences together in memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"By contrast, experiencing a shift in context, or event boundary, drives memories apart to represent distinct events. In this way, context acts as the grammar of human memory. What we found is that the locus coeruleus is most active at event boundaries when memories become separated. Thus, this small region at the core of the brain's arousal system may serve to punctuate our thoughts and memories."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clewett and co-authors Ringo Huang at UCLA and Lila Davachi at Columbia recruited 32 volunteers who looked at pictures of neutral objects while inside an MRI scanner. To manipulate whether the surrounding context was stable or changing, simple tones were played in either the right or left ear.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;Eight pure tones were repeated in the same ear to create a sense of a coherent event, then the tone switched to the other ear and changed in pitch to elicit perception of an event boundary. This repeat-switch pattern continued throughout the remainder of the sequence, creating the perception of four different auditory events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers then tested how these tone switches influenced memory. They reasoned that time provides a window into how events are formed: when people successfully reconstruct the order of a sequence, it suggests these items are linked within a single memory. In contrast, it is harder to remember the precise sequence of events when they have been stored in separate, distinct memories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As they predicted, locus coeruleus activation at event boundaries predicted later memory separation, as shown by worse ability to remember the order of item pairs that spanned boundaries. The researchers also cross-checked their measurements of locus coeruleus activation against eye pupil dilation measurements taken at the same time, because pupils are known to dilate slightly both as new events occur and when the locus coeruleus is active.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These measurements confirmed that observations during the fMRI were indeed capturing activation in this small brain area. Functional magnetic resonance imaging, or fMRI, measures brain activity by detecting changes in blood flow while a person is inside the scanner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The consequences of this neural and memory reset signal were far-reaching. Stronger locus coeruleus activation at boundaries between events predicted larger changes in activation patterns within the hippocampus, a brain region that tracks contextual details like place and time and is central to the formation of new memories.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;p&gt;"Part of the job of the hippocampus is to map the structure of our experiences, so it has an index of the beginning, middle and ends of events. We found that the locus coeruleus may provide the critical 'start' signal to the hippocampus, as if saying, 'Hey, we're in a new event now,'" said Davachi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Prior work had shown that bursts of locus coeruleus activity help reconfigure brain networks to direct attention to new and important experiences. Our findings suggest that this updating signal is even more widespread, also reaching memory-related regions that carry representations of ongoing events."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers also examined how brief bursts of locus coeruleus activation are influenced by background levels of locus coeruleus activity. This matters because locus coeruleus neurons operate in two distinct modes: a burst-like mode that flags significant events and forms new memories, and a background mode that regulates general alertness and stress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The locus coeruleus is like the brain's internal alarm system," Clewett said. "But under chronic stress, this system becomes overactive. The result is like living with a fire alarm that never stops ringing, making it difficult to notice when a real fire breaks out."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the dynamic interplay between these firing patterns has been studied in the context of decision-making, perception and learning, its relevance for how we perceive and remember events has, thus far, been unclear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, the authors set out to test whether bursts of locus coeruleus activation at event boundaries, the neural signals that segment memories, might be weakened or lost under conditions of chronic stress. This question posed a challenge, as fMRI alone cannot measure absolute levels of stress or locus coeruleus activation. To address this, they used an imaging method that indirectly measures neuromelanin, a pigmented neurochemical that accumulates in the locus coeruleus with repeated activation over time.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;As predicted, participants with a higher neuromelanin-related signal, thought to indicate &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/chronic+stress/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;chronic stress&lt;/a&gt;, showed weaker pupil dilation responses to event boundaries. Stronger low-frequency fluctuations in locus coeruleus activation, a proxy for background levels of activity, also predicted weaker spikes in locus coeruleus activation and pupil responses to boundaries during the task. Together, these findings suggest that chronic hyperarousal may blunt one's sensitivity to change, disrupting the cues that anchor and organize new episodes in memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Identification of the locus coeruleus as the gateway or conductor for memory formation may lead to better ways to treat PTSD and other memory-related disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, where the locus coeruleus is unusually hyperactive. There are potential ways to quiet an overactive locus coeruleus, whether pharmacologically or through slow-paced breathing or even hand-squeezed stress balls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But good long-term solutions require further research and will take time to discover and bring to market. Perceiving events in the "right" way is directly linked to better memory, suggesting that improving locus coeruleus function is an effective target for either protecting or recovering memory function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Conducting basic science and clinical research is critical for opening new doors for treating debilitating disorders," Clewett said. "Recent legislative actions threaten this future, not only for scientific research but for breakthroughs that can improve the lives of patients and their families. It is perhaps ironic that at a time when legislation promises 'big and beautiful change,' it turns out one of the brain's smallest players may have the biggest impact on how we understand and remember our lives."&lt;/p&gt;

She picked her teeth constantly, a nervous habit, and in the absence of dental floss broke off the sharp silver teeth &lt;br&gt;of her comb and shoved the metal between her teeth. She refused to bathe. I found myself cataloguing all this, the many ways in which Alzheimer’s disease has ravaged her brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watching a parent transform into a toddler-like dependent who throws tantrums and can’t be left alone for more than five minutes is heartbreaking. But Heather Sandison, N.D., author of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Reversing-Alzheimers-Toolkit-Improve-Cognition/dp/0063339080?tag=syn-yahoo-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5Bartid%7C10055.a.65207455%5Bsrc%7Cyahoo-us" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Reversing Alzheimer’s;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;Reversing Alzheimer’s&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;says it can also be highly motivating.

Plus, because women live longer, they have a 48% chance of developing dementia in their lifetimes compared with a 35% chance for men. It’s a safe bet that anyone who lives long enough will suffer from some form of memory loss. To prepare for this possibility, my husband and I have set up care plans (and set aside funds) so our adult children won’t have to make tough decisions on their own.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;this simple act may protect your brain from dementia&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Power of the Pen&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since I was a little girl, I’ve been putting pen to paper to track my thoughts and feelings, set goals and make sense of the world. Apparently I’m in good company. Joan Didion famously said, “We tell ourselves stories in order to live.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond providing clarity and the opportunity for self-reflection, science suggests that writing by hand has brain-protective benefits. A &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2023.1219945/full" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:January 2024 study published in Frontiers in;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;January 2024 study published in &lt;em&gt;Frontiers in &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2023.1219945/full" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Psychology;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Psychology&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;reported that it activated more areas of the brain than typing and led to low-frequency synchronous brain waves in the back of the head (the visual cortex) via the sensory processing areas and all the way up to the top of the head (the motor cortex). “Such brain waves in exactly those parts of the brain are beneficial for learning and memory,” says study author &lt;a href="https://www.ntnu.edu/employees/audrey.meer" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Audrey van der Meer, Ph.D., M.Sc;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Audrey van der Meer, Ph.D., M.Sc&lt;/a&gt;., a professor of neuropsychology at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another study, published in &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5926989/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The Journals of Gerontology in 2016;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Journals of Gerontology &lt;/em&gt;in 2016&lt;/a&gt;, reported that &lt;strong&gt;journal writing reduced the odds of all-cause dementia by more than 50%&lt;/strong&gt;. Additionally, the use of more complex language in the writing predicted a 25% reduction in risk of Alzheimer’s. “You use your body and senses to a larger extent when writing by hand versus typing, and the letters you draw on paper need to be precisely formed, which requires hand-eye coordination and fine motor skills,” says van der Meer. “All that is great stimulation for the brain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So as I watch my mom sink into the abyss of dementia, I’ve naturally turned to writing as a lifeline. On a recent family vacation, I wrote about what we ate, what we did and who we saw, hoping to capture details my future brain might struggle to recall. It struck me that I was in essence creating revivable memories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soon, my catalogs of daily activities evolved into handwritten letters addressed to a “future me” —something tangible for my adult children to use as an “Instruction Manual for Mom” should I ever begin losing my mind. Each letter in the series acknowledges a harsh truth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="caas-pull-quote-wrapper caas-img caas-lazy" data-src&gt;&lt;blockquote class="caas-blockquote"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yes, you are in the throes of &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;dementia. I imagine it’s a special kind of hell to be locked &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;inside a brain that can’t follow &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;simple instructions, one that &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;can’t make sense of &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;anything happening in the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;moment. It’s natural to be scared, to act in ways that are &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;counter to who you are, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;and that’s why you need skilled &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;around-the-clock help. Your children may tell you &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;that &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;you’re &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;not a burden. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Trust me, they are lying.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Others address specific aspects of the disease:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="caas-pull-quote-wrapper caas-img caas-lazy" data-src&gt;&lt;blockquote class="caas-blockquote"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I know you don’t think &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;you stink, but you do. I know the water may feel like pins and needles on your thinning skin, but you need to wash yourself with soap and water. Even if it’s just a sponge bath. You also need to wear deodorant. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-pull-quote-wrapper caas-img caas-lazy" data-src&gt;&lt;blockquote class="caas-blockquote"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sometimes you will think someone who is long dead is still alive. Other times you will think someone who is very &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;much alive has passed away. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s awkward. Uncomfortable. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sad. So sad. But people &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;understand that you will make &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;mistakes. People will &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;forgive you your ailing brain. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before you balk at the callous nature of these letters, the ones that say "&lt;em&gt;Make no mistake, this isn’t going to get better&lt;/em&gt;," keep in mind that I’m also cataloging favorite memories. I’m taking note of simple moments in our lives, remembering my mom when she was in her prime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Case in point: Once, while we were driving the boys home from school, my mom spontaneously belted out Barry Manilow’s “Copacabana.” My boys and I joined in, fudging the words in a sort of chorus gone wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The goal is to create a paper trail of who I am and who my mom was so that if I begin slipping away, my family will have something tangible to hold on to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Dizzying Toll of Alzheimer’s Disease&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease is wildly unpredictable: One person with it may become combative, while another remains blissfully complacent. Unfortunately, no matter how Alzheimer’s presents, there are no effective medications for the advanced disease. The Food and Drug Administration has approved a few immunotherapy drugs for early-stage Alzheimer’s, but they require frequent IV infusions, can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars and carry risks of complications, including brain swelling (um, no thank you!).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These new treatments are groundbreaking in that they can remove some of the disease-related proteins from the brain, but they’re not a cure,” says&lt;a href="https://www.dementiaresearcher.nihr.ac.uk/profile-dr-jessica-z-k-caldwell-cleveland-clinic/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Jessica Z.K. Caldwell;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt; Jessica Z.K. Caldwell&lt;/a&gt;, Ph.D., director of the Women’s Alzheimer’s Movement Prevention and Research Center at Cleveland Clinic. “And while the studies show strong positive effects for white men, the sample sizes for women and people of color were too small to draw definitive conclusions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No one can predict whether I’ll develop Alzheimer’s disease. Even on the rare chance that I carry two copies of the APOE4 gene — the strongest known genetic risk factor for Alzheimer’s — my odds of developing the disease can be modified by lifestyle changes. &lt;strong&gt;Experts estimate that nearly half of dementia cases, even those that are genetically linked, might be delayed or prevented with certain lifestyle and behavioral changes. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s never too early to implement changes that foster better brain health, but it can be too late. My mom’s situation, unfortunately, falls into the latter category.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Road Map for the Future&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the time the cognitive changes of Alzheimer’s appear, the disease has been developing for decades. But much remains within our control, stresses Caldwell. In fact, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(24)01296-0/abstract" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:a 2024 report published in The Lancet;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;a 2024 report published in &lt;em&gt;The Lancet &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;linked 14 modifiable factors to reduced dementia risk — things like maintaining a healthy weight, exercising regularly and maintaining strong social connections&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to adopting such strategies, Caldwell says challenging your brain is critical: “If you’re coasting through life relying on devices instead of your own learning and memory, you’re missing an opportunity to strengthen neural circuits, grow new neurons and protect your brain.” With that in mind, I’m taking a proactive approach. Instead of consulting Siri for driving directions, calculations and random trivia, I’ve been using my head to come up with the answers (or doing the work to find them). I eat a diet rich in omega-3’s and blueberries. I exercise daily, meditate a few times each week and prioritize my oral health. And, of course, I write.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But no matter how much I prepare, I know there are no guarantees. That’s why my husband and I are open with our children about my mom’s decline — so they’ll understand what may lie ahead for us and how we hope they’ll navigate the disease should we follow the same path.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hope my boys will never have to give me the letters I’ve written; I hope that the steps I’m taking now will protect me over the long haul. But if things don’t work out in my favor, I view the written word as a prescription for healing — that of my children as much as my own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 15 Jul 2025 17:46:15 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibkFVX3lxTFBfRVJEX2d2S0dvQ0hfWmdibDJVX0NpSzNMR2IwSnpPVURjV0pCLVZrb3V4LTJFTmNack53c1BGYXlFaW1mQjRERGdoOEtPS29IOXRpVkVXdkdjaFJWQ0VfZF9ub2FHQ3RPQ3kxR2J3</guid></item><item><title>2025年，佛罗里达州有4人死于食肉细菌，其中包括一名圣约翰县居民- News4JAX | 4 people in Florida have died from a flesh-eating bacteria in 2025, including a St. Johns County resident - News4JAX</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi5AFBVV95cUxPSGNzYWZuX1JmME9IOTRpemI0VUtEb1JPb0FDNGlVdU5vZVg4R1psVUY2emVSRDBSa0ctWFhoMkYyaXdhaWRNbTQ5S2FYaGJaTjZjWTVzNWNFTHl4dVdMNTdoTDRPcUEwWnFWRlVEYkR2T3FNYlFTWnJpaXI5aXNUTWpiQ3FhMnJCYVA3b3pqWmJwbG93YWpNOExWQVhOXzRldktjZ09abmFJVXJjTVAtakdLdGVWeGdxNlNLeHNIQ0J3cTZ6RE1RMjhJb2dxcVdSTGJsc3Zfb3BESlV4QWt0eUQ3cTA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__StackBase-sc-1fnzlkn-7 fURyTV iQviKm articleBody" itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-3 bYFsJw cuqaEv article-text"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ST.

                                &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;MOWER COUNTY, Minn. — An unvaccinated outdoor cat on a Mower County farm tested positive for rabies after having contact with two children and a dog, according to the Minnesota Department of Health (MDH).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;On June 28, the cat, usually friendly, attacked a dog, scratching it and latching onto its neck. The following day, the cat bit two children, prompting the owner to euthanize the animal. The University of Minnesota Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory confirmed the rabies diagnosis on July 2.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_top" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;MDH recommended post-exposure treatment for the children, which began on June 29. The Minnesota Board of Animal Health confirmed the dog as the only domestic animal exposed. Despite being overdue for vaccination, the dog received a rabies booster on June 30 and will be confined for 45 days.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Unvaccinated outdoor cats on the property were likely exposed, and the owner chose to euthanize them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_middle" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Minnesota Board of Animal Health advises vaccinating all domestic animals, including dogs and cats, against rabies.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;For questions about rabies exposure in animals, contact the Board at 651-201-6808. For human exposure inquiries, reach out to MDH at 651-201-5414.

While everyone is different—and your pace may vary from day to day—it often takes just 15 to 20 minutes to walk a mile at a moderate speed, says &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1596630&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.onepeloton.com%2Finstructors%2FPeloton_M&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.prevention.com%2Ffitness%2Ffitness-tips%2Fa65414857%2Fwalk-a-mile-a-day-benefits%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Marcel Dinkins;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Marcel Dinkins&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Peloton instructor and motivational speaker.

And the farther you walk, the more pronounced those benefits become. “Walking has been shown to decrease all-cause mortality,” Moretti says. “In fact, the more you walk, the less likely you’ll be to get cancer, arthritis, heart disease, and much more.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Mental Health&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walking can &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7923965/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:boost your mental health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;boost your mental health&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

This may happen for a number of reasons, but Dinkins points out that walking (and other forms of exercise) can be a great way to &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/fitness/a43369771/walk-to-lower-your-stress/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:clear your mind;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;clear your mind&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Calorie Burn&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like any form of regular exercise, walking a mile a day burns calories. “Any movement burns calories,” says &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bethwarrenmsrd/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Beth Warren;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Beth Warren&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, R.D.N., founder of Beth Warren Nutrition. “And done consistently, [it] adds up to a significant positive impact on your weight.” The exact number of calories you’ll burn will depend on your metabolism, pace, and more. But most people can expect to burn &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/fitness/fitness-tips/a41048373/calories-burned-walking/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:about 100 calories;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;about 100 calories&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; when they walk a mile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Weight Loss&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The impact of &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a65401665/expert-walking-tips-weight-loss/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:walking on weight loss;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;walking on weight loss&lt;/a&gt; depends on what you were doing before. “It stands to reason that if someone goes from doing nothing to walking a mile a day, they may see a trend of weight loss over the course of several weeks to months,” Gentilcore says. What else you’re doing matters, too. “Walking a mile every day will help boost weight loss if you’re consuming a nutritious diet and are in a calorie deficit,” Moretti says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to Walk a Mile a Day&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s one thing to say you’ll walk a mile a day, and another to actually do it. But experts have some tips to help you reach your goal:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Plan when you’ll walk.&lt;/strong&gt; “You could walk to work if it’s feasible, take a brisk stroll during your lunch break, make it a post-dinner ritual, or do it the first thing in the morning,” Dinkins says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Put the walk on your calendar. &lt;/strong&gt;“There’s a lot of power that comes with checking off that you did something on any given day,” Gentilcore says. “I find that once someone can see that they’re being consistent, that’s a behavior that will generally stick around for a while.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Walk a little longer every day. &lt;/strong&gt;Moretti recommends walking 5 minutes several times a week. “Every two weeks, add another 2 minutes to your schedule,” he says. “After a few months, you’ll be walking 20 to 30 minutes per day.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Break up your walks.&lt;/strong&gt; If walking a whole mile seems intimidating, &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a65255832/walking-hack-lower-blood-pressure/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:break it into smaller segments;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;break it into smaller segments&lt;/a&gt; throughout your day. “The key is finding what works best for your schedule and lifestyle, and making it a consistent habit,” Dinkins says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 15 Jul 2025 17:01:25 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibkFVX3lxTE5kbXV6MVdZeE12dXV0VEViaTVqV3hEZ2R3eTcyRmZuUWV0Z1VYbmx3MzdsbGpGYzA4ME9wSDRJcHQ4UWZ0SGw3LUxyRFhLMzhBNVQzY3NKSFctZ3B3cDdxamV5WHBGMWI1YW9sMnJn</guid></item><item><title>香蕉真的能帮助你拉屎吗？以下是专家们的意见- AOL.com | Do Bananas Actually Help You Poop?

So…which is it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turns out, the answer depends on a few factors. So, we asked a gastroenterologist and a registered dietitian to weigh in. Here’s what you need to know about bananas and their effect on your digestion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meet the experts:&lt;/strong&gt; Valerie Agyeman, R.D.N., is a dietitian and founder of &lt;a href="http://www.flourishheights.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Flourish Heights;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Flourish Heights&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

The fruit contains both soluble fiber, which helps soften stool, and insoluble fiber, which adds bulk and helps move waste through the intestines, says Valerie Agyeman, R.D.N., dietitian and founder of &lt;a href="http://www.flourishheights.com" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Flourish Heights;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Flourish Heights&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “This combo of soluble and insoluble fiber can help get things moving without being too harsh on the digestive system,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bananas also provide potassium, a mineral that supports muscle contractions, including those in the digestive tract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How bananas may help relieve constipation&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key reason bananas may help you go is thanks to their fiber content. And in some cases, it’s their resistant starch, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Resistant starch is a form of carbohydrate that bypasses digestion and feeds your beneficial gut bacteria, helping support the microbiome. Unripe bananas (the ones on the greener side) are a solid source of resistant starch, and early research suggests this type of starch may improve constipation symptoms by supporting gut health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 2024 clinical trial in &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1596630&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41598-024-79465-1&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.prevention.com%2Ffood-nutrition%2Fa65268799%2Fdo-bananas-help-you-poop%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Scientific Reports;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;Scientific Reports&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; looked at resistant starch type‑3 (RS‑3), a form of starch found in unripe bananas, in adults with chronic constipation. Those who took RS‑3 daily for 12 weeks experienced a significant increase in bowel movement frequency and reported healthier stool consistency. They also saw improvements in their microbiome, specifically higher levels of beneficial bacteria strains, including Bifidobacterium and Akkermansia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While this study didn’t test bananas directly, it highlights how resistant starch, the same component in unripe bananas, can support gut regularity in adults,” says Mishal Reja, M.D., a gastroenterologist and medical advisor at &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1596630&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.beekeepersnaturals.com%2F%3Fview%3Dnewgroup1_index_1742835651678&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.prevention.com%2Ffood-nutrition%2Fa65268799%2Fdo-bananas-help-you-poop%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Beekeeper’s Naturals;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Beekeeper’s Naturals&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Can bananas ever cause constipation?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There isn’t any evidence that suggests bananas can cause constipation. However, people with sensitive digestive systems (like those who have Irritable Bowel Syndrome) may react to bananas regardless of ripeness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In these individuals, even small amounts of fermentable sugars, such as the &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/healthy-eating/a19756314/fodmap-diet/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:FODMAPs;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;FODMAPs&lt;/a&gt; found in ripe bananas, can trigger symptoms like bloating, gas, abdominal pain, and changes in bowel habits, including diarrhea or constipation,” Dr. Reja says. “These symptoms occur because the sugars ferment in the gut and produce excess gas, which the digestive tract may struggle to handle effectively.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since greener bananas have less fermentable sugars, they may be a better bet, but even these bananas can cause symptoms in certain people. If you experience symptoms after eating bananas or other similar foods, talk to your healthcare provider about next steps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Should you try bananas for constipation?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For most people, one medium banana a day is a good place to start whether you’re dealing with constipation occasionally or regularly, Agyeman says. That said, it’s always a good idea to talk to your doctor before changing up your diet, especially if you’re on medications or have pre-existing conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just make sure to stick to one banana a day (ideally on the greener side) and aim to hit your hydration goals. “Eating too many bananas without enough fluid or [a variety of] fiber in your diet could have the opposite effect and slow things down,” Agyeman says. “Fiber needs water to do its job, so combining them helps maximize digestion support.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can squeeze bananas into many different meals, but adding the fruit to your breakfast or a snack works well for consistency. And if you don’t love bananas plain, try blending one into a smoothie with Greek yogurt, a scoop of protein powder, and flaxseeds, or slice it onto whole-grain toast with almond butter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What else can help with constipation?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Generally, getting more fiber every day is a tried-and-true way to help prevent constipation. “Eating bananas in moderation can be fine, but they shouldn’t be relied on as a main source of fiber,” Dr. Reja says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To get more fiber, Agyeman recommends chia pudding, kiwi, prunes, cooked leafy greens, and hydrating soups. “These foods are high in fiber and water, which is the ideal combo for supporting healthy digestion,” she reiterates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re looking for a supplement, be sure to talk to your doctor first. Dr. Reja recommends one that contains prebiotic fibers like chicory root, acacia fiber, and partially hydrolyzed guar gum (PHGG), all of which support gut health without causing bloating in most people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If your symptoms persist or seriously interfere with daily life, call your doctor as it might be time for over-the-counter help. Dr. Reja says that might include some of the following:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Polyethylene glycol (PEG 3350, like Miralax): It draws water into the colon and softens stool. It’s well-tolerated, but shouldn’t be used long-term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Psyllium husk (like Metamucil): A bulk-forming fiber that helps regulate bowel movements by adding structure to the stool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Magnesium citrate: A quick-acting osmotic laxative that is good for short-term use, but shouldn’t be used regularly without guidance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Senna (like Senokot): A stimulant that activates bowel movements. It might be helpful occasionally, but it’s not for daily or long-term use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;If over-the-counter remedies stop being effective or if your constipation persists for more than a couple of weeks despite doing things like drinking more water and eating more fiber, it’s time to check in with a doctor again. Other signs that warrant a doctor’s visit include significant abdominal pain, unintended weight loss, blood in the stool, or a sudden and persistent change in bowel habits, Dr. Reja says. “These symptoms could indicate an underlying condition that requires further evaluation and testing,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Bottom Line&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bananas won’t act as a laxative, but their fiber and resistant starch content might help you stay regular in the long run. For most people, starting with one medium banana a day is a safe bet—go for a greener one if you tolerate it well, but stick with a riper banana if you have a sensitive stomach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Dr. Reja reminds us: “When it comes to digestion, consistency matters more than quick fixes.” That means staying hydrated, eating plenty of whole plant foods that are rich in fiber, and seeing a doctor if your constipation persists. And if you’re into bananas, go ahead and peel one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dietary supplements are products intended to supplement the diet.

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Catriona Reddin, senior study author and researcher at the University of Galway, said: 'This research represents a significant contribution to our understanding of how some diabetes medications may impact brain health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Diabetes is a known risk factor for dementia, but whether glucose-lowering therapies can help prevent cognitive decline has remained unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Our findings suggest that GLP-1 receptor agonists, in particular, may have a protective effect on brain health.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study comes after a similar experiment from the University of Florida, which tracked 400,000 Americans on glucose-lowering drugs and found dementia risk was 33 percent lower for GLP-1 users compared to other interventions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Around 8million adults in the US have some form of dementia, and 500,000 are diagnosed every year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, one in eight US adults has reported taking Ozempic or similar medications at least once for diabetes or weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the new study, published in &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaneurology/fullarticle/2831975"&gt;JAMA Neurology&lt;/a&gt;, researchers identified 26 studies that explored the relationship between GLP-1 agonist use and dementia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These included a total of 164,531 participants, most of whom (65 percent) were men. The average age was 64 with a follow-up time of 31 months. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Wendy Williams, pictured here, is one of the most famous faces of dementia. She was diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia in 2023 at age 59&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Bruce Willis (pictured here) was also diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia in 2023 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Studies included in the analysis were published between 2015 and 2024. Of the 26 in the review, 10 looked at the impact of GLP-1 agonists. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team suspected GLP-1 agonists may lower inflammation, which is a major driver of dementia. It's thought to activate the immune cells microglia and astrocytes in the brain, which damage neurons and disrupt the blood-brain barrier, the brain's protective layer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;GLP-1 agonists have also been shown to lower blood pressure and protect blood vessels, reducing the risk of vascular dementia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.thecardiologyadvisor.com/news/study-suggests-glp-1ras-may-reduce-dementia-risk/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"&gt;study published in April&lt;/a&gt; also found GLP-1s may stimulate neural growth in the hippocampus, an area of the brain responsible for learning and memory formation. However, this research is early.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Professor Martin O'Donnell, Dean of the College of Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences at University of Galway: 'Given the increasing prevalence of both diabetes and dementia, findings from this study have important public health implications for prevention of dementia.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Recent reports from the Alzheimer's Association report rates of Alzheimer's disease - the most common form of dementia - &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14683527/alzheimers-rises-25th-years-people-diagnosed.html"&gt;have risen 25 years in a row in the US&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Diabetes, meanwhile, affects 12 percent of Americans - 38million. Reports published in 2022 suggest rates in the Americas have tripled in the last 30 years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There were several limitations to the new study, mainly including a lack of data on subtypes of dementia like vascular and Lewy body dementia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Tue, 15 Jul 2025 16:55:28 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipgFBVV95cUxOcU4xck9vdmM3NnkzcVJ0c29qN3JvUDdzbGc3eXFBU3hlNDlkMnF2cnN5eFZ2LVk5Rm05azJyNzBvVzVtQTRVTWFpdXBfd0l1U09WM19abERkdmhENU1TOHgtV1QycUwtbGl2czR0bDhBWlo5SnRUSHFBVlpfc3JEb01IVERFVnNXYy1IZ0ZSODVIeEhuWnRYM0REY1F1d1BlemgzcHF30gGrAUFVX3lxTE5obWxHc2VOTF9CaVZFNXJsVTNlMXFXSHBPUEZjbmw1RW1xNlcwQjlveDZkSHkzSDV3ZUQyOUNMSUktXzBHQndNSkdBT2Q2b09tXzFlbnJFb1hVdGNpMVo3VThhazVIUFN5aGUzOUNSUElUNmVROG1ybXo5U01yLUotaXlHNUR6Z3duV3ZZQVdPYXk0NVV3SmltQkJkQkpWR1JLWWo3dU5pX0Z3bw</guid></item><item><title>医生忽略了我的舌头肿块......然后我忍受了我一生中“最病态”的经历-每日邮报 | Doctors ignored my tongue lump... then I endured the 'most morbid' experience of my life - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipAFBVV95cUxQY0NCMlBiZHFwcW9HUTZVZTBDYmVGWVJrZEdtMW1CTFBNWGY0clJQMjFfLTN2RUJFZ3FjaEtLSnFmbjU1dTJjYXVCZW9Dd1VNdW5qeDIwMFRydGNlRm83WFByWG1NUjVaeWFndS0tMi1mQWgtRFBuRDdwUlh4TUpCbGlTWEhiUW9IR3FBMENjTWxjYlBjWmdnNV84Tmo1UlpvaTY3d9IBqgFBVV95cUxPdnZsTUhoWVVWUm16aENNUFNyLURUaFM5NWRKVlhOVElBd1dKdWFYcUVIaWd6anUtdTd0dlo3dEVLNl9vSmY0SFBMcF9qYi1lZkRxNjYtYzVWekQ0UlNRT1E1UUlrcS1SSm5YenFXZGFKcWhxZWRtRUhXbUpGaGRGV3VVUnhSVllzSF9EVkdHYUg2S29TZlFBdkMzZm1UbWtJYkJyYVFyWkdDdw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When Jamie Powell woke up one morning in late 2019 with a painful bump on her tongue, she assumed she had bitten it in her sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Random bumps on the tongue generally heal on their own within a few days, but the one on Powell’s stayed firm for two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Straining in front of a mirror to view her tongue in its entirety, Powell saw a protrusion of tissue, like a square stamp had traced the area perfectly. A bit farther back was the offending bump, large and nearly brushing the inside of her teeth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her dentist insisted that whatever it was, it &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14786545/Womans-mouth-cancer-deadly-common-infection.html"&gt;would go away with time&lt;/a&gt;. Thirty-six at the time, fit, healthy, and a nonsmoker, Powell was not a high risk for &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-f75ea270-618e-11f0-a87f-05a3c163b258"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;. But weeks passed, and the bump remained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Powell went to an urgent care clinic in January 2020, where the doctor referred her to an ear, nose, and throat specialist, who performed a biopsy of the bump.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A week went by in silence until Powell got the news that &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14654813/Common-mouth-problem-warning-sign-cancer-tongue-removed.html"&gt;the bump was cancerous&lt;/a&gt;, and it had spread to her lymph nodes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her diagnosis kicked off what she considers to be the most 'morbid' period of her life, starting with a tongue resection surgery and 30 grueling radiation treatments that she often wished she could quit early because the pain was so great. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Tongue cancer accounts for less than one percent of all new cancer cases in the US every year. Around 20,000 cases and 3,200 deaths are confirmed annually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Thirty-six at the time, fit, healthy, and a nonsmoker, Jamie Powell was not a high risk for cancer. Neither she nor her dentist could believe that the obtrusive bump on the side of her tongue could be a cancerous mass&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While the rate of deaths due to tongue cancer has remained about the same for about two decades, the patient profile of new cases of tongue cancer is beginning to shift from primarily older male smokers to women and younger healthy adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Oral cancers usually spread quickly if left untreated, and Powell is confident that hers was allowed to grow unchecked when she was sent home from her dentist’s office over five years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘It was scary and frustrating not to know what was going on and not having anyone listen to me,’ she told &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://people.com/cancer-survivor-reflects-on-life-five-years-after-tongue-surgery-11768664"&gt;People&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Powell had a section of her tongue surgically removed on March 23, 2020, just as Covid was getting its grip on the world. Doctors reconstructed it using tissue taken from her thigh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I remember the surgeon describing the surgery to me. I was just numb, and I heard him say that my voice will be different,’ she said. ‘I instantly thought of my kids. How will I sing to them? How will I tell them how much I love them?’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She then had all of the lymph nodes removed on her left side to stop the spread of the cancer in its tracks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I couldn’t talk or eat. I had a feeding tube and I used my iPad to communicate to the doctors and nurses,’ Powell said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She also had to endure six weeks of radiation treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Powell had a section of her tongue surgically removed on March 23, 2020, just as Covid was getting its grip on the world&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;With her head encased in a mesh mask that is bolted to a radiation table to ensure complete stillness, Powell suffered sunburn-like charred skin on her neck, blisters on her lips, and painful ulcers in her mouth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Off the table, she was fatigued, nauseous, and had lost her sense of taste, so everything tasted of either wet cardboard or sewage. She also no longer had working salivary glands, resulting in a constant dry mouth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I’d rather do surgery every single day than go through head and neck radiation again,’ Jamie, now 41, &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@jamieraepowell/video/7060165809494281519"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She lost her ability to speak by week three of radiation, her mouth essentially one big canker sore. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After surgery, she had to retrain her brain to form sounds and piece them into words. She still has trouble with words starting with ‘sh’ and ‘ch’.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Eating without salivary glands requires her to sip water after every bite. And if she has a dinner date with friends, she has to decide ahead of time whether she will eat or talk. She can no longer do both.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At bedtime, she does not recline. Instead, she sits back as if in an airplane seat, propped against acupressure pillows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Think about when you’re sleeping and you wake up and your mouth is dry. I have that 24/7, and it’s heightened to the next exponent at night. So I have to sleep sitting up no matter what,’ she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Radiation treatments led to irritated sun burned-like skin on her neck, sores in her mouth, and blisters around her lips&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘And I wake up every hour from choking because of the dry mouth, so I take a drink of water, and I also have a spray bottle, and I will spray the inside of my mouth, like how you water your house plant.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Every morning, at four am, she has to pry her jaw open with both hands and use the handle of a spoon to prop her mouth open so that she can stretch it out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘For months after radiation, I couldn’t taste anything, then one morning I made my coffee and I could actually taste it - I cried,’ she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Powell began documenting her experience on TikTok when she realized there were no other creators like her on the site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Tongue cancer is rare, but federal tracking indicates it is becoming more common. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Rates of new cases have risen &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://seer.cancer.gov/statfacts/html/tongue.html"&gt;about 49 percent&lt;/a&gt; since 1992, according to the National Cancer Institute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cases are becoming increasingly common in women and young people, which scientists believe are tied to human papillomavirus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About 70 percent of oropharyngeal cancers affecting the tonsils, base of the tongue, soft palate, and throat are linked to HPV, yet only 61 percent of US teens are fully vaccinated against the virus, which requires two or three doses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The death rate due to tongue cancer has remained steady for decades, but case rates are ticking up in part, scientists believe, due to human papillomavirus&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over 42 million Americans carry HPV, a virus that causes genital warts and cancers like cervical, throat, and anal malignancies, with 47,000 new HPV-related cancer cases diagnosed yearly. Despite this, public awareness of HPV’s cancer risks is declining, even as vaccination remains a critical defense. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Most oral cancers are missed until it’s in the later stages,’ Powell said. ‘I’ve learned that no one should go through this alone. The more we talk about this cancer, the more help we can be to one another.’&lt;/p&gt;
