			&lt;p&gt;New research into a popular sleeping aid has some scientists worried about long-term usage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An analysis of adults with insomnia, which has not yet been peer-reviewed, has found that people prescribed melatonin for more than a year are at greater risk of heart issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among more than 130,000 adults across multiple countries, those who were prescribed melatonin long-term had an 89 percent higher risk of heart failure over five years, and were twice as likely to die from any cause, compared with those not prescribed melatonin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/one-dietary-supplement-was-shown-to-reduce-aggression-by-up-to-28"&gt;One Dietary Supplement Was Shown to Reduce Aggression by Up to 28%&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings are preliminary and don't change current health recommendations. They do not necessarily mean that melatonin – the &lt;a href="https://health.ucdavis.edu/blog/cultivating-health/melatonin-and-your-sleep-is-it-safe-what-are-the-side-effects-and-how-does-it-work/2025/02"&gt;fourth most popular&lt;/a&gt; natural product taken by adults in the US – is causing dangerous repercussions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What the results do suggest is that longer-term uses of melatonin need to be studied further to ensure they are safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Melatonin is typically considered safe and well-tolerated for short-term use among those who are not pregnant or breastfeeding. That &lt;a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/melatonin-for-sleep-does-it-work"&gt;means around 1 to 2 months&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is &lt;a href="https://health.ucdavis.edu/blog/cultivating-health/melatonin-and-your-sleep-is-it-safe-what-are-the-side-effects-and-how-does-it-work/2025/02"&gt;limited&lt;/a&gt; research on the supplement's effects after that time, a situation that some researchers believe should be remedied, especially as the supplement grows in popularity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/circ.152.suppl_3.4371606"&gt;new research&lt;/a&gt; was presented at the American Heart Association's Scientific Sessions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Melatonin supplements may not be as harmless as commonly assumed," &lt;a href="https://newsroom.heart.org/news/long-term-use-of-melatonin-supplements-to-support-sleep-may-have-negative-health-effects?preview=4987&amp;amp;preview_mode=True"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; medical researcher Ekenedilichukwu Nnadi at SUNY Downstate/Kings County Primary Care in New York. "If our study is confirmed, this could affect how doctors counsel patients about sleep  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/hiv" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73049" data-postid="180326" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;aids&lt;/a&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/spark-into-space-comp"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg" alt="Win a $10,000 Space Coast Adventure Holiday" class="alignnone wp-image-177074 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro.jpg 844w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A melatonin supplement replicates a hormone naturally produced by the brain to help keep the body's internal clock ticking. Taking this substitute at the end of the day can help some people fall asleep and stay asleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the US and many other nations, melatonin supplements are available over the counter, which means patients can take them without medical guidance or supervision on dosage or length of use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While some &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/neurolint15010031"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; suggest that long-term melatonin use is safe, comprehensive research is lacking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among other countries, the recent analysis from Nnadi and colleagues analyzed the electronic health records of adults in the US and also in the UK, where melatonin is only available via prescription.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A secondary analysis found that those who took melatonin for over a year were almost 3.5 times as likely to be hospitalized for heart failure when compared to those not taking melatonin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus, the risk of dying from any cause jumped from 4.3 percent to 7.8 percent between groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research is concerning, but the findings should be approached with caution. The study's methodology has a major limitation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants were not surveyed on their melatonin use. Their prescription records were used to gauge who was taking what. This means that the control group (those who did not take melatonin) may have included, for example, people in the US who took melatonin without a prescription.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carlos Egea, President of the Spanish Federation of Sleep Medicine Societies, who was not involved in the study, notes this limitation in an expert reaction to the research. However, he still takes the study's associations seriously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These findings challenge the perception of melatonin as a benign chronic therapy and only highlight the need for a prospective trial with a control group to clarify its safety profile," &lt;a href="https://www.sciencemediacentre.org/expert-reaction-to-conference-abstract-on-association-between-long-term-melatonin-supplementation-and-incidence-of-heart-failure-in-patients-with-insomnia/"&gt;argues&lt;/a&gt; Egea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even in the short term, melatonin can come with downsides that many users aren't aware of. For instance, a recent &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/melatonin-overdoses-in-australia-raise-questions-over-its-safety-in-children"&gt;series of non-fatal overdoses&lt;/a&gt; among children in Australia has &lt;a href="https://www1.racgp.org.au/newsgp/clinical/melatonin-shown-to-reduce-some-mental-health-disor"&gt;raised questions&lt;/a&gt; over the safety profile of the supplement for certain age groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Melatonin products might be based on a natural hormone, but that doesn't mean there aren't risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The recent findings were &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/circ.152.suppl_3.4371606"&gt;presented&lt;/a&gt; in November at the &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/ahasessions"&gt;American Heart Association's Scientific Sessions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

I do feel there's no emergency number to call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"'I'd like to report a crime. Yeah, someone stole me.' There is no one to report this too."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Thornton, also a journalist and broadcaster, talks about her own experience of perimenopause, saying the "worst" thing she experienced was going from being somebody "who can multitask... being very capable" to somebody who felt "entirely incapable". &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Barnett has previously spoken out about her health. In 2019, she wrote the book Period: It's About Bloody Time, chronicling her experience of endometriosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;During the podcast episode, she says it is "pretty nerve-wracking" to share certain parts of her life - but that she "wanted to create this space for other people to be ready to talk about things".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Barnett, who hosted Radio 4's Woman's Hour until last year, says she ultimately wanted to make the podcast so she could not only tell the stories of others, but give listeners her perspective and experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"I'm usually the interviewer, I'm usually hosting," Barnett tells Thornton.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"It's not easy to share and I know that, and I think that's why it's important that somebody who interviews does, when appropriate - not all the time, because that's not my job and it's not about me - but where appropriate and especially when you're asking others to do the same, share themselves."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Rounding off the episode, Barnett can be heard saying she hopes that "the normalisation - which we both said needs to happen around perimenopause and this degradation of one's hormones that happens from... the age of 30s right through in women - can move into common parlance".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"And it doesn't mean what happens feels any less extraordinary or outrageous, but how we meet it could change," she adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb"&gt;How to treat menopause symptoms&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;A growing number of women take &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/hormone-replacement-therapy-hrt/" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;hormone replacement therapy (HRT)&lt;/a&gt;

Don’t release the bat into the wild so it can be collected and tested for rabies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rabid bats typically peak in late summer. In August 2024, 23 rabid bats were recorded. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Santa Clarita Valley, in particular, has recorded the most rabid bats in Los Angeles County, with Canyon Bat species being the majority found. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Veterinary Public Health has been conducting outreach to communities to increase public awareness and reporting, according to the release. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The public health department has advised people to never touch a bat and never allow pets to interact with them. In L.A. County, about 14% of bats that come into contact with people or pets test positive for rabies, increasing to about 33% in late summer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other good practices include: &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="rte2-style-ul"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cover a bat with a box or container if you find the animal in your home, especially if it’s near a sleeping person or pet. Call Animal Control for collection and don’t release the bat into the wild. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Seek medical attention immediately for rabies treatment if the bat can’t be tested or if it tests positively for rabies.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Vaccinate your pets against rabies. The illness is fatal in animals once symptoms begin. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Know the signs of illness in bats. Bats that are on the ground, unable to fly or are active during the day may be sick. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Los Angeles Times</author><pubDate>Thu, 06 Nov 2025 19:21:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiyAFBVV95cUxNWjVicGN2Tk1LS0xwRl85ang2U0N2ZEpIZWRQWGJDMjFabWhtRG9DY3pRRVdCQmpKUzlZMFhWWEtGR3NiaUFualphRENaV2xjbDNzTXprRHNPZFhLcGVaTWIxWXJST3ZjOGM1TVN5YXVlRTJSaUVYT25TdWV4QmoxSU9ud1RHSmRqc3dNT3lMeUtvRlY0Vk9sQUo5Y19tS3A2dTl0NUNHVVhOaVlyYzN6ZkdFUUdnRVZjbjJDdjgwVHY3NkdTVzJyMQ</guid></item><item><title>科学家从大脑类器官中学到了什么-《纽约时报》</title><link>https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/06/science/brain-organoids-neurons.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The New York Times</author><pubDate>Thu, 06 Nov 2025 19:00:12 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMie0FVX3lxTE9OYVg2UjdESkV5UkxuTzNKdEdCUjJRNVBDa2RNMkpTenY3cmFYWTNTdUVJZ0NQQTNQUG1acEp5QUlkSVRIR1lPZ2pvM2pUX29seGlOWWd1MzB6RUpRVFV2QVdvSVdtSEhRNVZGbTR6WEt4NXBxSk1GWGdFVQ</guid></item><item><title>如果您服用二甲双胍- Medical Xpress ，为什么您的日常散步可能效果不佳</title><link>https://medicalxpress.com/news/2025-11-daily-youre-metformin.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="mt-4 article-main"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A widely prescribed diabetes drug may be sabotaging one of the most trusted strategies for preventing the disease: exercise.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         
										    


                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;That is the conclusion of a Rutgers-led study &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/jcem/advance-article/doi/10.1210/clinem/dgaf551/8276136" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology &amp;amp; Metabolism&lt;/i&gt;, which found that metformin blunts critical improvements in blood vessel function, fitness and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/blood+sugar+control/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;blood sugar control&lt;/a&gt; that normally come from working out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since 2006, doctors have been advised to tell patients with &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/high+blood+sugar/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;high blood sugar&lt;/a&gt; to take metformin while engaging in exercise. Two proven therapies should deliver better results together, they reasoned. But Rutgers researchers said the math doesn't add up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Most health care providers assume one plus one equals two," said Steven Malin, a professor in the Department of Kinesiology and Health in the School of Arts and Sciences and the lead author of the study. "The problem is that most evidence shows metformin blunts exercise benefits."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To test the theory, Malin's team recruited 72 adults at risk for &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/metabolic+syndrome/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;metabolic syndrome&lt;/a&gt;. The syndrome is viewed as a cluster of conditions that raise the risk of diabetes and heart disease. They divided the trial participants into four groups: people performing high-intensity exercise while taking a placebo; &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/high-intensity+exercise/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;high-intensity exercise&lt;/a&gt; with metformin; low-intensity exercise with placebo; and low-intensity exercise with metformin.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;Over 16 weeks, researchers tracked changes in blood vessel function under insulin stimulation, a process that helps vessels dilate and deliver oxygen, hormones and nutrients after meals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results were clear: Exercise alone improved vascular insulin sensitivity, meaning &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/blood+vessels/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;blood vessels&lt;/a&gt; responded better to insulin and allowed more blood flow to muscles. This matters because insulin's ability to open blood vessels helps shuttle glucose out of the bloodstream and into tissues, lowering blood sugar after meals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when metformin was added, the improvements shrank. The drug also diminished gains in aerobic fitness and reduced the positive effects on inflammation and fasting glucose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Blood vessel function improved with exercise training, regardless of intensity," Malin said. "Metformin blunted that observation, suggesting one type of exercise intensity is not better either with the drug for blood vessel health."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This matters because exercise is supposed to lower blood sugar and improve physical function, crucial goals of diabetes treatment. If metformin interferes with those benefits, patients may not get the protection they expect to help lower disease risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"If you exercise and take metformin and your blood glucose does not go down, that's a problem," Malin said. "People taking metformin also didn't gain fitness. That means their physical function isn't getting better and that could have long-term health risk."&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;p&gt;The implications go beyond lab measurements. Fitness gains translate into energy for daily life. This includes activities such as climbing stairs, playing with children and staying active with friends. If those improvements stall, quality of life suffers, Malin said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings don't mean people should stop taking metformin or exercising, Malin said. Instead, it raises urgent questions for doctors about how the two treatments can be combined and the need for close monitoring. Malin hopes future research will uncover strategies that preserve the benefits of both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why does metformin blunt exercise benefits? The answer is unclear but may lie in the drug's mechanism of action, Malin said. Metformin works partly by blocking parts of the mitochondria, which reduces oxidative stress and improves blood sugar control. But that same inhibition may interfere with the cellular adaptations triggered by exercise, including improvements in mitochondrial function and aerobic capacity. In other words, the very process that makes metformin effective may block the body's ability to respond fully to physical training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous research has hinted at similar effects, but this trial is among the first to examine vascular insulin sensitivity, which is a key factor controlling glucose regulation and cardiovascular health, Malin said. By showing that metformin can blunt improvements in both large arteries and tiny capillaries regardless of exercise intensity, the study underscores the complexity of combining such treatments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stakes are high, Malin said. Type 2 diabetes affects nearly 35 million people in the United States, and prevention strategies often hinge on lifestyle changes combined with medication. If those strategies don't work as expected, patients could face greater risks down the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We need to figure out how to best recommend exercise with &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/metformin/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;metformin&lt;/a&gt;," Malin said. "We also need to consider how other medications interact with exercise to develop better guidelines for doctors to help people lower chronic disease risk."&lt;/p&gt;

Rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis attack joints. Sjögren’s disease is known for dry eyes and mouth. Myositis and myasthenia gravis weaken muscles in different ways, the latter by attacking how nerves signal them. Lupus has widely varied symptoms including a butterfly-shaped facial rash, joint and muscle pain, fevers and damage to the kidneys, lungs and heart. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;They’re also capricious: Even patients faring well for long periods can suddenly have a “flare” for no apparent reason.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Many start with vague symptoms that come and go or mimic other illnesses. Many also have overlapping symptoms – rheumatoid arthritis and Sjögren’s also can harm major organs, for example. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Diagnosis can take multiple tests, including some blood tests to detect antibodies that mistakenly latch onto healthy tissue. It usually centers on symptoms and involves ruling out other causes. Depending on the disease it can take years and seeing multiple doctors before one puts the clues together. There are efforts to improve: The National MS Society is educating doctors about newly updated guidelines to streamline diagnosis of multiple sclerosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The human immune system is a complex army with sentinels to detect threats like germs or cancer cells, a variety of soldiers to attack them, and peacemakers to calm things down once the danger is over. Key is that it can distinguish what’s foreign from what’s “you,” what scientists call tolerance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Sometimes confused immune cells or antibodies slip through, or the peacemakers can’t calm things down after a battle. If the system can’t spot and fix the problem, autoimmune diseases gradually develop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Most autoimmune diseases, especially in adults, aren’t caused by a specific gene defect. Instead, a variety of genes that affect immune functions can make people susceptible. Scientists say it then takes some “environmental” trigger, such as an infection, smoking or pollutants, to set the disease into motion. For example, &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://apnews.com/article/multiple-sclerosis-epstein-barr-study-b325dceb5612e4ec7f22c8f25901e5eb"&gt;the Epstein-Barr virus is linked to MS.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Scientists are zeroing in on the earliest molecular triggers. For example, white blood cells called neutrophils are first responders to signs of infection or injury — but abnormally overactive ones are suspected of playing a key role in lupus, rheumatoid arthritis and other diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Women account for about 4 of 5 autoimmune patients, many of them young. Hormones are thought to play a role. But also, females have two X chromosomes while males have one X and one Y. Some research suggests an abnormality in how female cells switch off that extra X can increase women’s vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;But men do suffer from autoimmune diseases. One especially severe one named VEXAS syndrome wasn’t discovered until 2020. It mainly affects men over 50 and in addition to typical autoimmune symptoms it can cause blood clots, shortness of breath and night sweats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Certain populations also have higher risks. For example, lupus is more common in Black and Hispanic women. Northern Europeans have a higher risk of MS than other groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;According to investment research company Morningstar, the global market for autoimmune disease treatments is $100 billion a year. That’s not counting doctor visits and such things as lost time at work. Treatment is lifelong and, while usually covered by insurance, can be pricey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Not so long ago there was little to offer for many autoimmune diseases beyond high-dose steroids and broad immune-suppressing drugs, with side effects that include a risk of infections and cancer. Today some newer options target specific molecules, somewhat less immune dampening. But for many autoimmune diseases, treatment is trial and error, with little to guide patient decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;___&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

				&lt;p&gt;Why autoimmune diseases are so difficult to diagnose&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many start with vague symptoms that come and go or mimic other illnesses. Many also have overlapping symptoms – rheumatoid arthritis and Sjögren’s also can harm major organs, for example.&lt;/p&gt;		&lt;div class="c-ad c-ad--bigbox l-article__ad"&gt;							&lt;p class="c-ad__label"&gt;Story continues below advertisement&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/div&gt;	&lt;p&gt;Diagnosis can take multiple tests, including some blood tests to detect antibodies that mistakenly latch onto healthy tissue. It usually centers on symptoms and involves ruling out other causes. Depending on the disease it can take years and seeing multiple doctors before one puts the clues together. There are efforts to improve: The National MS Society is educating doctors about newly updated guidelines to streamline diagnosis of multiple sclerosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How the immune system gets out of whack&lt;/p&gt;	&lt;div class="c-tabs"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The human immune system is a complex army with sentinels to detect threats like germs or cancer cells, a variety of soldiers to attack them, and peacemakers to calm things down once the danger is over. Key is that it can distinguish what’s foreign from what’s “you,” what scientists call tolerance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes confused immune cells or antibodies slip through, or the peacemakers can’t calm things down after a battle. If the system can’t spot and fix the problem, autoimmune diseases gradually develop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Autoimmune diseases are often set off by a trigger&lt;/p&gt;	
	&lt;p&gt;Most autoimmune diseases, especially in adults, aren’t caused by a specific gene defect. Instead, a variety of genes that affect immune functions can make people susceptible. Scientists say it then takes some “environmental” trigger, such as an infection, smoking or pollutants, to set the disease into motion. For example, the Epstein-Barr virus is linked to MS.&lt;/p&gt;		&lt;div class="c-ad c-ad--bigbox l-article__ad"&gt;							&lt;p class="c-ad__label"&gt;Story continues below advertisement&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;/p&gt;

					
		&lt;/div&gt;	&lt;p&gt;Scientists are zeroing in on the earliest molecular triggers. For example, white blood cells called neutrophils are first responders to signs of infection or injury — but abnormally overactive ones are suspected of playing a key role in lupus, rheumatoid arthritis and other diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Women are at highest risk for autoimmune diseases&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Women account for about 4 of 5 autoimmune patients, many of them young. Hormones are thought to play a role. But also, females have two X chromosomes while males have one X and one Y. Some research suggests an abnormality in how female cells switch off that extra X can increase women’s vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But men do suffer from autoimmune diseases. One especially severe one named VEXAS syndrome wasn’t discovered until 2020. It mainly affects men over 50 and in addition to typical autoimmune symptoms it can cause blood clots, shortness of breath and night sweats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Certain populations also have higher risks. For example, lupus is more common in Black and Hispanic women. Northern Europeans have a higher risk of MS than other groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Treatment for autoimmune diseases is complicated&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to investment research company Morningstar, the global market for autoimmune disease treatments is $100 billion a year. That’s not counting doctor visits and such things as lost time at work. Treatment is lifelong and, while usually covered by insurance, can be pricey.&lt;/p&gt;		&lt;div class="c-ad c-ad--bigbox l-article__ad"&gt;							&lt;p class="c-ad__label"&gt;Story continues below advertisement&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/div&gt;	&lt;p&gt;Not so long ago there was little to offer for many autoimmune diseases beyond high-dose steroids and broad immune-suppressing drugs, with side effects that include a risk of infections and cancer. Today some newer options target specific molecules, somewhat less immune dampening. But for many autoimmune diseases, treatment is trial and error, with little to guide patient decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;___&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

			&lt;p&gt;Our bodies are in a constant state of ebb and flow, from &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/this-5-minute-breathing-exercise-lowers-blood-pressure-as-much-as-drugs-or-exercise"&gt;the breaths we're taking&lt;/a&gt; to the fluids &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/hidden-waves-wash-fluid-through-the-brain-while-you-sleep"&gt;washing our brains clean&lt;/a&gt; each night. Scientists have now discovered that key rhythms in our brains and in our guts actually share some of the same underlying physics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same oscillation patterns that help to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/5-common-herbs-and-spices-with-digestive-benefits-backed-by-science"&gt;digest food&lt;/a&gt; also appear to be at work in the brain's blood vessels, helping to deliver oxygen and nutrients when needed. The findings could significantly improve our understanding of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/an-extra-sense-may-connect-gut-bacteria-with-our-brain"&gt;both biological systems&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This discovery is the work of an international team of researchers, and was prompted by wanting to better understand how blood vessels in the brain control rhythmic changes in blood flow, known as cortical &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasomotion"&gt;vasomotion&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/fragments-of-bacteria-in-our-gut-may-lull-our-brains-to-sleep-at-night"&gt;Fragments of Bacteria in Our Gut May Lull Our Brains to Sleep at Night&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before tackling what may be the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/the-human-brains-complexity-verges-on-the-brink-of-chaos-physicists-say"&gt;most complex thing in the Universe&lt;/a&gt;, the researchers started with a simpler oscillation system: gut &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peristalsis"&gt;peristalsis&lt;/a&gt;, which pushes food through the digestive system. Building on &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-71999-4"&gt;previous studies&lt;/a&gt;, the team produced a more complete mathematical model of the rhythms and waves involved, known as a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ginzburg%E2%80%93Landau_equation"&gt;Ginzburg-Landau (GL) model&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_180104" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-180104" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/OscillationChart.jpg" alt="Gut oscillation model" class="wp-image-180104 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/OscillationChart.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/OscillationChart-600x270.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-180104" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Part of the research involved modeling changing oscillations in cat intestines. (Sellier-Prono et al., &lt;em&gt;Phys. Rev. Lett.&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The researchers tested whether their updated model could reproduce the same oscillation patterns they saw in experiments in cat intestines, and sure enough it could.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new mathematical approach shows how nearby groups of oscillations can sync up or 'couple' with each other, if the original differences aren't too great. There are certain thresholds where that happens, and certain thresholds where it doesn't happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That not only helps to explain flow patterns in the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/common-drugs-can-rewire-your-gut-for-several-years-study-finds"&gt;digestive system&lt;/a&gt;, but intriguingly the physics seem to match up with those of the brain's neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_180374" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-180374" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/gut_frequencies_1.png" alt="Scientists Find an Unexpected Link Between The Hidden Rhythms in The Gut And Brain" class="wp-image-180374 size-full" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-180374" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;An optical image of the vasculature of a mouse brain, with different rhythms highlighted in different colors. (UC San Diego)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Coupled oscillators talk to each other and each section of the intestine is an oscillator that talks to the other sections near it," &lt;a href="https://today.ucsd.edu/story/synchronized-frequencies-helps-you-digest-food"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; physicist Massimo Vergassola, from UC San Diego.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Normally, coupled oscillators are studied in a homogeneous setting, meaning all the oscillators are at more or less similar frequencies. In our case, the oscillators were more varied, just as in the intestine and the brain."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, there are still major differences between the gut and the brain. For instance, the gut is a one-way path for food, but blood can travel in many different directions through the network of vessels in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/spark-into-space-comp"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg" alt="Win a $10,000 Space Coast Adventure Holiday" class="alignnone wp-image-177074 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro.jpg 844w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While these findings talk about similar behavior rather than a direct connection, they could help scientists better understand pulsations in the brain and gut that can signal &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/hidden-rhythms-between-your-stomach-and-brain-could-shape-your-mood"&gt;changes in mental health&lt;/a&gt; or even&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-discover-hidden-pulse-in-the-brain-that-may-warn-of-dementia"&gt; foreshadow dementia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The brain is infinitely more complicated than the gut, but this is science at its best," &lt;a href="https://today.ucsd.edu/story/synchronized-frequencies-helps-you-digest-food"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Kleinfeld. "You ask one question, it leads you somewhere else, you solve that problem, then return to your original question."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1103/8njd-qd14"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Physical Review Letters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        &lt;p&gt;Our immune system has a dark side: It’s supposed to fight off invaders to keep us healthy. But sometimes &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/autoimmune-disease-lupus-diagnosis-symptoms-b1f2ba32883c63fff1af689a45281305"&gt;it turns traitor and attacks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; our own cells and tissues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What are called autoimmune diseases can affect just about every part of the body – and tens of millions of people. While &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/autoimmune-lupus-women-rheumatoid-arthritis-aff0e28dece3ef4168f301bd84331ea5"&gt;most common in women&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, these diseases can strike anyone, adults or children, and they’re on the rise. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New research is raising the prospect of treatments that might do more than tamp down symptoms. Dozens of clinical trials are testing ways to reprogram an immune system-gone-rogue, with some promising early successes &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/photo-essay/autoimmune-disease-lupus-diagnosis-symptoms-c4d3ba32ccd0e0be779e712f4d8bf4d9"&gt;against lupus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, myositis and certain other illnesses. Other researchers are hunting ways to at least delay brewing autoimmune diseases, spurred by a drug that can buy some time before people show symptoms of Type 1 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is probably the most exciting time that we’ve ever had to be in autoimmunity,” said Dr. Amit Saxena, a rheumatologist at NYU Langone Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are some things to know.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;h2&gt;What are autoimmune diseases?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;They’re chronic diseases that can range from mild to life-threatening, more than 100 with different names depending on how and where they do damage. Rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis attack joints. Sjögren’s disease is known for dry eyes and mouth. Myositis and myasthenia gravis weaken muscles in different ways, the latter by attacking how nerves signal them. Lupus has widely varied symptoms including a butterfly-shaped facial rash, joint and muscle pain, fevers and damage to the kidneys, lungs and heart. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They’re also capricious: Even patients faring well for long periods can suddenly have a “flare” for no apparent reason.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
&lt;h2&gt;Why autoimmune diseases are so difficult to diagnose&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many start with vague symptoms that come and go or mimic other illnesses.

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers at the University of California San Diego have found that an intensive retreat combining multiple mind-body techniques, including meditation and healing practices, produced rapid and wide-ranging changes in brain function and blood biology. The researchers found that the retreat engaged natural physiological pathways promoting neuroplasticity, metabolism, immunity and pain relief. The findings, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-025-09088-3" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Communications Biology&lt;/i&gt;, provide insights into how consciousness and psychological practices can enhance physical health.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         
										    


                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Meditation and other mind-body practices have been utilized by cultures worldwide for thousands of years to promote health and wellness; however, the underlying biology of these approaches remains poorly understood. The new study is the first to comprehensively quantify the biological effects of multiple mind-body techniques administered together over a short period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We've known for years that practices like meditation can influence health, but what's striking is that combining multiple mind-body practices into a single retreat produced changes across so many biological systems that we could measure directly in the brain and blood," said senior study author Hemal H. Patel, Ph.D., professor of anesthesiology at UC San Diego School of Medicine and research career scientist at the Veterans Affairs San Diego Healthcare System.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This isn't just about stress relief or relaxation; this is about fundamentally changing how the brain engages with reality and quantifying these changes biologically."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of the study, 20 &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/healthy+adults/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;healthy adults&lt;/a&gt; attended a 7-day residential program led by neuroscience educator and author Joe Dispenza, D.C., featuring daily lecture sessions, approximately 33 hours of guided meditation and group healing practices. These practices used an "open-label placebo" approach, meaning participants knowingly took part in healing activities presented as placebos—procedures or treatments with no active medical ingredient, but which can still produce real benefits through the power of expectation, social connection and shared practices.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before and after the retreat, participants had their brains scanned using &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/functional+magnetic+resonance/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;functional magnetic resonance&lt;/a&gt; imaging (fMRI), an approach that measures brain activity in real time. The researchers also used blood testing to measure changes in &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/metabolic+activity/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;metabolic activity&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/immune+activation/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;immune activation&lt;/a&gt; and other biological functions.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;The researchers observed several major changes after the retreat:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Brain network changes: Meditation during the retreat reduced activity in parts of the brain associated with mental chatter, making &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/brain+function/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;brain function&lt;/a&gt; more efficient overall.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enhanced neuroplasticity: When applied to laboratory-grown neurons, &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/blood+plasma/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;blood plasma&lt;/a&gt; from post-retreat participants made &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/brain+cells/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;brain cells&lt;/a&gt; grow longer branches and form new connections.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Metabolic shifts: Cells treated with post-retreat plasma showed an increase in glycolytic (sugar-burning) metabolism, indicating a more flexible and adaptive metabolic state.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Natural &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/pain+relief/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;pain relief&lt;/a&gt;: Blood levels of endogenous opioids—the body's natural painkillers—increased after the retreat, indicating that the body's natural pain-relief systems were activated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Immune activation: Meditation increased inflammatory and anti-inflammatory immune signals simultaneously, suggesting a complex, adaptive immune response rather than a simple suppression or activation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gene and molecular signaling changes: Small RNA and gene activity in blood shifted after the retreat, particularly in pathways related to brain function.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;p&gt;Participants also completed the Mystical Experience Questionnaire (MEQ-30) to assess whether they had a "mystical" experience during meditation—characterized by profound feelings of unity, transcendence, and altered states of consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Average MEQ scores increased significantly after the retreat, rising from 2.37 before the retreat to 3.02 afterwards. Higher scores on these surveys were also correlated with greater biological changes after the retreat, including greater integration of brain activity across different regions. In other words, the more connected the brain is, the greater the likelihood of a mystical experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings suggest that intensive meditation can trigger very similar &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/brain+activity/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;brain activity&lt;/a&gt; to that which has been previously documented with psychedelic substances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We're seeing the same mystical experiences and neural connectivity patterns that typically require psilocybin, now achieved through meditation practice alone," added Patel. "Seeing both central nervous system changes in brain scans and systemic changes in blood chemistry underscores that these mind-body practices are acting on a whole-body scale."&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study results provide a biological framework for understanding how non-drug mind-body interventions can support health and well-being. By enhancing neuroplasticity and activating the immune system, these practices could help promote mental health, emotional regulation and stress resilience. Additionally, the activation of endogenous opioid pathways suggests that this combination of mind-body practices may also be useful for chronic pain management.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;While the retreat's effects were measured in healthy adults, the researchers emphasize that controlled trials in patient populations are still needed to determine specific clinical benefits and applications. They are particularly interested in whether mind-body retreats can benefit people with chronic pain, mood disorders or immune-related conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead, the research team plans to investigate how each individual component of the retreat—meditation, reconceptualization, and open-label placebo healing—works alone and in combination. Additionally, future studies will investigate the duration of these biological changes and whether repeated interventions can enhance or sustain their effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This study shows that our minds and bodies are deeply interconnected—what we believe, how we focus our attention, and the practices we participate in can leave measurable fingerprints on our biology," said first author Alex Jinich-Diamant, a doctoral student in the Departments of Cognitive Science and Anesthesiology at UC San Diego.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It's an exciting step toward understanding how conscious experience and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/physical+health/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;physical health&lt;/a&gt; are intertwined, and how we might harness that connection to promote well-being in new ways."&lt;/p&gt;

In a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/collections/gjdefhadcj" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/collections/gjdefhadcj" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;collection&lt;/a&gt; of five papers published in &lt;i&gt;Nature&lt;/i&gt; on 5 November, they tracked hundreds of thousands of early brain cells in the cortexes of humans and mice, and captured with unprecedented precision the molecular events that give rise to mixture of neurons and supporting cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It's really the initial first draft of any ‘cell atlases’ for the developing brain,” says Hongkui Zeng, executive vice-president director of the Allen Institute for Brain Science in Seattle, Washington, and co-author of two papers in the collection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01088-x" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03641-0/d41586-025-03641-0_50851088.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;Biggest brain map ever details huge number of neurons and their activity&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These atlases could offer new ways to study neurological conditions such as autism and schizophrenia, as researchers can now “mine the data, find genes that may be critical for a particular event in a particular cell type and at a particular time point”, says Zeng. “We have a very exciting time coming,” adds Zoltán Molnár, a developmental neuroscientist at the University of Oxford, UK, who was not involved with any of the studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work is part of the BRAIN Initiative Cell Atlas Network (BICAN) — a project launched in 2022 by the Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies (BRAIN) Initiative at the US National Institutes of Health with US$500 million in funding to build reference maps of mammalian brains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Patterns of development&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two of the papers map parts of the mouse’s cerebral cortex — the area of the brain involved in cognitive functions and perception. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zeng and her colleagues focused on how the visual cortex develops from 11.5-day-old embryos to 56 days after birth. They created an atlas of 568,654 individual cells and identified 148 cell clusters and 714 subtypes&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. “It's the first complete high-resolution atlas of the cortical development, including both prenatal and postnatal” phases, says Zeng.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One surprise, she says, was how many neurons continued to take up specialised identities after birth, particularly between day 11, when newborn mice open their eyes for the first time, to day 21.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another study focussed on brain development in human embryos. How different brain cells emerge “is a long-standing question in developmental neurobiology”, says Tomasz Nowakowski, a neuroscientist at the University of California, San Francisco. He and his colleagues created a family tree map of human cortical cells&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR2" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; using brain tissue collected from 8 human fetuses at various stages of development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01468-3" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03641-0/d41586-025-03641-0_51349062.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;Brain tissues, assemble! Inside the push to build better brain models&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They identified 6,402 progenitor cells in these tissues and inserted a unique DNA ‘barcode’ into each of them. This allowed the researchers to track which stem cells generated which types of brain cells, because when the cells divide, the barcodes are copied and passed on to their daughter cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nowakowski and his team found that in embryos that are less than 20 weeks old, progenitor cells were mostly developing into excitatory neurons, cells which relay electrical signals to activate other neurons. But after 20 weeks, the cells shifted to generating inhibitory neurons, ones which halt neuronal communication. “This shows how these progenitors transition from one type into the other,” says Molnár.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team also observed that the generation of other types of brain cells — called astrocytes and oligodendrocytes — in humans “seems to be much more continuous and protracted”, compared to mice, Nowakowski adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We actually don't know what controls all these developmental programmes and switches or why they occur in development and especially at such precise moments,” says Nowakowski. Addressing these questions will be a key goal for future studies, he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Because of this, it might have more benefits than other types of bread.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Here are &lt;strong&gt;three ways&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;sourdough can have a positive impact&lt;/strong&gt; on your body:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-1-improved-digestion"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The &lt;a href="https://www.health.com/fermented-foods-7970958" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;fermentation&lt;/a&gt; process used to create sourdough helps break down &lt;a href="https://www.health.com/gluten-7374035" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;gluten&lt;/a&gt;, a protein found in grains such as wheat, barley, and rye that is resistant to digestion.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Sourdough also has lower levels of other compounds known to cause gastrointestinal issues, including:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Phytates&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tannins&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trypsin inhibitors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This means that sourdough may be easier to digest and result in fewer gastrointestinal symptoms compared to commercially leavened bread.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Study Highlight:&lt;/strong&gt; A 2023 review of 25 studies showed that people who switched from bread made with baker’s yeast to sourdough bread reported significant improvements in gastrointestinal comfort.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-2-better-balanced-blood-sugar"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The fermentation process used to make sourdough produces organic acids, such as lactic and acetic acids, which help slow the absorption of starch in the digestive tract. When food is digested slowly, glucose is released more gradually into the bloodstream, preventing a significant spike in blood sugar levels after eating.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This means that compared to other breads,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;sourdough is low on the&lt;strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.health.com/low-glycemic-index-foods-8363965" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;glycemic index&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, a classification system that ranks carbohydrate-rich foods on a scale of 0-100 according to their impact on blood sugar levels. The glycemic index estimates how quickly food is digested and absorbed into the bloodstream.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For example, the GI for a 30-gram serving of bread made with white wheat flour is 71, while the glycemic index for a 30-gram serving of sourdough bread is 54.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-3-a-boost-in-the-ability-to-absorb-nutrients"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Anti-nutritional factors found in &lt;a href="https://www.health.com/sourdough-bread-vs-whole-wheat-bread-11688429" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;whole wheat or grain breads&lt;/a&gt;, such as phytates, tannins, and trypsin inhibitors, can make it harder to absorb nutrients from food.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Phytates, in particular, can bind to minerals like &lt;a href="https://www.health.com/magnesium-7229399" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;magnesium&lt;/a&gt;, calcium, and iron, blocking their absorption in the digestive tract.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;The fermentation process used to make sourdough breaks down anti-nutritional factors like phytates. &lt;/strong&gt;In fact, some studies suggest that certain sourdough formulations can degrade over 96% of the phytic acid in the dough.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While sourdough contains less gluten than other breads made with wheat flour, it’s not gluten-free and&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;isn’t a good choice for people with celiac disease or those who are sensitive to &lt;a href="https://www.health.com/foods-high-in-gluten-11706346" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;gluten-containing foods&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;If you’d like to enjoy sourdough but can’t eat gluten, choose a gluten-free sourdough product. &lt;/strong&gt;Gluten-free sourdough bread is made with gluten-free flours such as those made with millet, sorghum, teff, quinoa, and buckwheat. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; Gluten-free sourdough will have a different texture than sourdoughs made with wheat flour, as gluten adds a chewy and airy texture to baked goods.&lt;br&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;A Florida doctor named Lily J. Voepel is in hot water after some of her patients contracted the dangerous bloodborne infection hepatitis C while under her care. A recent investigation by the Florida Department of Health uncovered numerous unsafe practices at Voepel’s office that may have contributed to these cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At least three patients caught hepatitis C through treatments they received at Voepel’s office in Melbourne, Florida, according to an &lt;a href="https://mqa-internet.doh.state.fl.us/MQASearchServices/healthcareproviders/LicenseVerification?LicInd=81873&amp;amp;ProCde=1501"&gt;administrative complaint&lt;/a&gt; filed against the doctor by the health department. The department’s subsequent investigation found “several deficiencies in the facility’s hygiene and sterilization procedures” at the office. The office’s license has been temporarily suspended, and Voepel is on the hook for a hefty fine.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;“Unsafe infection control practices”&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The health department first &lt;a href="https://brevard.floridahealth.gov/newsroom/2025/04/doh-brevard-notifies-public-of-potential-hepatitis-exposure-2025-04-11.html"&gt;notified&lt;/a&gt; the public about the potential hepatitis C exposure at Voepel’s office earlier this April, warning patients about “unsafe infection control practices” that might have occurred during their time there. People who visited the office between June 2023 and March 2025 were advised to get testing for the bloodborne viral disease as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Hepatitis C is an often chronic, potentially life-shortening infection. It can be transmitted through sex or improperly sterilized and/or shared needles. Though most people won’t experience any symptoms early on, the virus can wreak havoc on the liver over time. Without treatment, chronic infections can cause cirrhosis and significantly raise the risk of liver cancer. Thankfully, the once lifelong infection is now almost always curable with antiviral therapy.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the department’s &lt;a href="https://mqa-internet.doh.state.fl.us/MQASearchServices/Document"&gt;complaint&lt;/a&gt; against Voepel, they laid out multiple health code and other violations discovered during an inspection of Voepel’s office conducted this past March.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Among other things, inspectors found expired drugs and defibrillator pads, out-of-date manuals, and no risk management program in place. The office also failed to have adequate sterilization equipment, such as a handwashing station that could sterilize surgeons’ hands before a procedure. And the office was not properly registered as a pain-management clinic with the health department, yet it advertised itself as such.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;A hefty punishment&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;As a result of the department’s investigation, Voepel agreed to having her office’s surgery registration license suspended for six months, starting October 15, along with having to pay a $2,000 fine. She will also have to pay $18,000 to reimburse the department’s costs in pursuing and investigating the case.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The physician will additionally have to undergo several continuing education courses on infection control, risk management, and ethics. And she will have to provide a written plan to the health department on how her office has changed to comply with the rules moving forward.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;

Here’s why.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meet the experts&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href="https://www.memorialcare.org/providers/christopher-j-berg" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Christopher Berg, MD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Christopher Berg, MD&lt;/a&gt;, is a cardiologist at MemorialCare Heart and Vascular Institute at Orange Coast Medical Center in Fountain Valley, CA. &lt;a href="https://www.sydney.edu.au/medicine-health/about/our-people/academic-staff/emmanuel-stamatakis.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Emmanuel Stamatakis, PhD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Emmanuel Stamatakis, PhD&lt;/a&gt;, is the study co-author and professor of physical activity, lifestyle, and population health at The University of Sydney. &lt;a href="https://portal.findresearcher.sdu.dk/en/persons/bdelpozocruz/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Borja del Pozo Cruz, PhD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Borja del Pozo Cruz, PhD&lt;/a&gt;, is the lead study author and a professor in the Department of Sports Science and Clinical Biomechanics at the University of Southern Denmark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What did the study find?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the study, researchers analyzed data from 33,560 people between the ages of 40 and 79 who walked fewer than 8,000 steps a day and had no history of cardiovascular disease or cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The participants wore fitness trackers for a week to track their step counts and how those steps were distributed during the day. After that, the researchers followed the participants’ health for about eight years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that people who walked continuously for 10 to 15 minutes a day had about a 4% risk of a cardiovascular event such as a heart attack or stroke, compared to 13% in those who strolled for only about five minutes at a time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The perks were the biggest for people who were the least active overall (namely, those who took 5,000 or fewer steps a day). In this group, the risk of developing cardiovascular disease dropped from 15% for short walkers to 7% in those who walked up to 15 minutes at a time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why might longer walks be better?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are likely a few things going on here. “Most walking in this study was of light intensity,” says &lt;a href="https://www.sydney.edu.au/medicine-health/about/our-people/academic-staff/emmanuel-stamatakis.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Emmanuel Stamatakis, PhD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Emmanuel Stamatakis, PhD&lt;/a&gt;, study co-author and professor of physical activity, lifestyle, and population health at The University of Sydney. “When you walk for 10 to 15 minutes or longer without stopping, your heart and lungs get a chance to work continuously.” This “steady-state” activity helps your body use oxygen more efficiently, improving your circulation in the process, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This can be especially helpful in people who are usually inactive, says &lt;a href="https://portal.findresearcher.sdu.dk/en/persons/bdelpozocruz/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Borja del Pozo Cruz, PhD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Borja del Pozo Cruz, PhD&lt;/a&gt;, lead study author and a professor in the Department of Sports Science and Clinical Biomechanics at the University of Southern Denmark. “To gain cardiovascular benefits, the body needs either sufficient volume (more total activity) or intensity (higher effort per minute) and continuous walking achieves a combination of both, even at moderate speeds,” del Pozo Cruz says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the flip side, walking in shorter bursts with a lower level of intensity doesn’t let your cardiovascular system “switch on” long enough to tease out these benefits, Stamatakis says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While this all makes sense in theory, keep in mind that the participants’ walking habits were only tracked for a week and that the study simply found a link between lower amounts of walking—it didn’t prove that walking less raised the risk of heart issues, says &lt;a href="https://www.memorialcare.org/providers/christopher-j-berg" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Christopher Berg, MD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Christopher Berg, MD&lt;/a&gt;, a cardiologist at MemorialCare Heart and Vascular Institute at Orange Coast Medical Center in Fountain Valley, CA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So, how long do your walks actually need to be? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings don’t mean that exercise snacks aren’t worth it. “For people who are currently inactive, the first and most important step is simply to start moving—any increase in daily steps helps,” del Pozo Cruz says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But once you've done that, del Pozo Cruz suggests including longer, uninterrupted walks of at least 10 minutes at a brisk pace. Over time, you can ramp up the speed and duration of your walks, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Berg points out that this may take some planning on your end, whether it’s setting aside time at the end of your day to go for a walk or making a lunch date with a coworker to get moving around together. “Longer periods of walking are not going to happen by accident,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, pushing the amount of time and your pace is the best way to go, according to Stamatakis. “To get the most out of it, you either need to extend the length of the session or increase the intensity, one of the two,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 06 Nov 2025 15:55:30 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigwFBVV95cUxNeGwzMUFjSUR5N3RhSEl2TTBWVElJU2RkdjZZSmJYa0h5X25KcFVFV3RmR3JpRWdOeGpJdldZZ0gybWMwZzY5OGZ3NHhaUC1pVl9YdlRCVHpvaU1MWW5haUY5YjhNdDMzbXlkNUJOeXpHbDZzT2RWY1BjUzJJdUt5OWlSNA</guid></item><item><title>国情咨文：近三分之二的美国年轻人考虑移居国外- StudyFinds</title><link>https://studyfinds.org/young-americans-want-out-of-usa/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content"&gt;&lt;div class="post-featured-image"&gt;&lt;picture&gt;

&lt;p class="post-featured-image-caption"&gt;The stress and loneliness of an increasingly divided society has left many Americans wondering if the grass is greener elsewhere. (Credit: Kosoff on Shutterstock)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-3-in-4-admit-they-re-more-stressed-about-nation-s-future-than-before"&gt;3 In 4 Admit They’re More Stressed About Nation’s Future Than Before&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-block-group has-quaternary-background-color has-background is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained"&gt;
&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-in-a-nutshell"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In A Nutshell&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;63% of young adults&lt;/strong&gt; (ages 18-34) and &lt;strong&gt;53% of parents&lt;/strong&gt; have considered leaving the U.S. due to the state of the nation&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Half of all adults&lt;/strong&gt; report signs of loneliness, while &lt;strong&gt;69%&lt;/strong&gt; say they needed more emotional support this year than they received&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI anxiety nearly doubled&lt;/strong&gt; among students (78%, up from 45%) and surged across all age groups in just one year&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;75% of Americans&lt;/strong&gt; are more stressed about the country’s future than before, with political division tied to isolation, physical symptoms, and daily struggles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most young Americans have considered leaving the country. Data from the American Psychological Association shows that 63% of adults ages 18 to 34 have considered relocating abroad this year because of the state of the nation. Among parents, more than half (53%) have had the same thought.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These aren’t knee-jerk reactions to a single news cycle or election outcome. The numbers come from the APA’s Stress in America 2025 survey, fielded Aug. 4–24, 2025, among more than 3,000 adults across the country, nearly a year after the 2024 election. While personal stress levels hover around 5 on a 1–10 scale on average, collective anxiety about the nation’s direction has reached a troubling high. Seventy-five percent of adults now say they’re more stressed about the country’s future than they used to be.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Political tensions show no signs of letting up. Seventy-six percent of adults call the future of the nation a significant source of stress, a number that has held steady since before the 2024 election, when it stood at 77%. The persistence of this anxiety, regardless of which party controls &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/why-painting-your-home-white-could-help-survive-heatwave/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;the White House&lt;/a&gt; or Congress, suggests Americans are grappling with something deeper than partisan politics.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-freedom-corruption-and-fear-how-americans-describe-their-country"&gt;Freedom, Corruption, and Fear: How Americans Describe Their Country&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When asked to choose words that best represent America today, survey respondents revealed a country wrestling with its own identity. “Freedom” topped the list at 41%, but “&lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/why-george-washingtons-worries-about-americas-fate-coming-true/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;corruption&lt;/a&gt;” came in close behind at 38%. “Opportunity” hit 37%, while “division” landed at 36%. Hope and fear nearly tied at 35% and 32%.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Beyond abstract concerns, &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/political-leaders-dark-personalities-drive-division-polarization/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;societal division&lt;/a&gt; is hitting home in personal ways. Sixty-two percent of Americans call it a significant stressor in their lives, and that stress is associated with deeper feelings of isolation. Among adults who cited division as a major source of stress, 61% reported feeling isolated from others. Compare that to just 43% among those not stressed by division. Similar gaps showed up for feeling left out (57% versus 39%) and lacking companionship (54% versus 44%).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-growing-crisis-of-connection"&gt;A Growing Crisis of Connection&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Feelings of isolation aren’t limited to those stressed by political division. Across the board, roughly half of all American adults report signs of loneliness. Fifty-four percent said they’ve felt isolated from others, 50% have felt left out, and 50% said they lack companionship, at least some of the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Perhaps more troubling, 69% of adults said they needed more &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/best-dogs-for-emotional-support/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;emotional support &lt;/a&gt;over the past year than they actually received. That number is up from 65% in 2024, pointing to a widening gap between what people need and what they’re getting. Among those stressed by societal division, the unmet need for support climbs even higher, to 75%.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Adults experiencing high levels of loneliness were more likely to report living with chronic health conditions. Eighty percent of this group said they have a chronic illness, compared to 66% of those with moderate loneliness and 68% with low loneliness. Depression, anxiety disorders, and chronic pain were particularly common among those with high loneliness.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-when-political-stress-shows-up-in-the-body"&gt;When Political Stress Shows Up in the Body&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Anxiety about national division doesn’t stay abstract for long. Among people who report significant stress over &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/a-nation-divided-u-s-politics-taking-physical-emotional-toll-on-americans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;societal division&lt;/a&gt;, 83% experienced at least one physical symptom of stress in the past month. For those not stressed by division, that number drops to 66%. The most common complaints included feeling nervous or anxious, fatigue, and headaches.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Stress over division also showed up in daily behavior. Adults in this group were more likely to have lost patience or &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/arguments-with-in-laws/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;yelled at family members&lt;/a&gt; (60% versus 49%), canceled social plans (55% versus 37%), and found it hard to plan ahead (53% versus 37%).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Americans seem caught between competing views of progress. While 66% say they have more opportunities than previous generations, 64% believe their generation has made sacrifices others didn’t have to make.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-technology-anxiety-spikes-especially-around-ai"&gt;Technology Anxiety Spikes, Especially Around AI&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As Americans grapple with political and social stress, technology is adding a new layer of concern. Anxiety about artificial intelligence has surged dramatically in just one year. Fifty-seven percent of adults now cite &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/artificial-intelligence/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;the rise of AI &lt;/a&gt;as a significant source of stress, up from 49% in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Students have been hit particularly hard by AI-related worry. Seventy-eight percent reported stress about AI, nearly double the 45% from last year. Young adults ages 18 to 34 saw their anxiety jump from 52% to 65%. Parents are concerned too, with stress levels rising across age groups: 70% of parents with children ages 5 to 7 (up from 49%), 65% with kids ages 8 to 12 (up from 53%), and 62% with teenagers ages 13 to 17 (up from 53%).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The spread of inaccurate or misleading information is another growing concern. Sixty-nine percent of adults called misinformation a significant stressor, up from 62% the previous year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Other major sources of stress remain steady. Seventy-five percent cited the economy, 66% pointed to money concerns, and 65% mentioned U.S. politics, housing costs, and mass shootings.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-where-americans-still-find-meaning"&gt;Where Americans Still Find Meaning&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite widespread worry about national politics, most people maintain a sense of control over their personal lives. Seventy-seven percent say they have a great deal or at least some control over their own futures. Seventy-four percent believe their personal dreams and goals are still within reach. An even larger majority, 84%, say they can create a good life for themselves, even if it looks different from what previous generations experienced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But obstacles are real. Eighty-five percent of adults cited barriers standing in the way of their dreams and goals, and 26% aren’t sure they’ll achieve what they hope for or don’t think it’s possible at all. For those who feel their dreams slipping away, the emotional toll is steep. Eighty-nine percent said their &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/midterms-political-events-sleep/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;mental health&lt;/a&gt; was a significant source of stress.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When asked what makes life feel meaningful, relationships dominated. Ninety-two percent of adults pointed to connections with others as a source of purpose. Family topped the specific categories at 77%, followed by friendships at 62%, romantic relationships at 47%, and pets at 39%. Health and well-being came in at 59%.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Work tells a different story. While 69% of employed adults call their jobs a significant source of stress, marking the highest level since the &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/lifetime-lockdown-40-of-americans-will-avoid-public-spaces-long-after-coronavirus-pandemic-ends/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;early days of the COVID-19 pandemic&lt;/a&gt; in May 2020, only 46% say work gives their life meaning. That gap between stress and fulfillment raises questions about how Americans balance productivity with purpose in an era where hustle culture remains dominant.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead, &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/paycheck-income-debt-survey/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;financial stability&lt;/a&gt; topped the list of personal goals at 64%, followed by maintaining or improving health at 60%. Spending time with family and friends came in at 53%.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite anxiety about the nation’s trajectory, 65% of adults say they feel personally responsible for helping shape the country’s future. Parents feel this responsibility even more acutely, with 72% saying they have a duty to contribute to national direction, compared to 61% of non-parents. Seventy-three percent of all adults believe they can help steer the country toward something better.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The survey captures Americans navigating multiple crises at once: political division, social isolation, technological disruption, and &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/your-2025-financial-forecast/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;economic uncertainty.&lt;/a&gt; Half of adults report feeling lonely or left out. More than two-thirds say they need more emotional support than they’re getting. Young people are stressed about AI at nearly double last year’s rate. And three-quarters are more worried about the country’s future than before, with many young adults and parents seriously weighing whether to leave.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yet resilience persists. Most people still believe they can build meaningful lives, maintain control over their futures, and contribute to positive change. Whether that optimism can hold in the face of compounding pressures remains one of the most important questions facing American society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-methodology"&gt;Methodology&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-survey-design-and-sample"&gt;Survey Design and Sample&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The 2025 Stress in America survey was conducted online by The Harris Poll on behalf of the American Psychological Association between August 4 and 24, 2025. The survey included 3,199 adults ages 18 and older living in the United States. The sample was designed to be nationally representative and included oversamples of specific racial and ethnic groups to allow for subgroup analysis: 800 Black adults, 809 Latino/a/e or Latinx adults, and 800 Asian adults. For Latino respondents, interviews were conducted in English or Spanish based on preference.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-weighting-and-adjustments"&gt;Weighting and Adjustments&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Data were weighted to reflect population proportions based on the March 2024 Current Population Survey by the U.S. Census Bureau, as well as data from PEW research studies on internet use, political affiliation, and language use. Weighting variables included age by gender, race and ethnicity, education, region, household income, frequency of internet use, and political party affiliation. Latino/a/e or Latinx adults were additionally weighted for acculturation, taking into account household language and ability to read and speak English and Spanish. Country of origin (U.S. or non-U.S.) was also included for Latino/a/e or Latinx and Asian subgroups.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-sampling-precision"&gt;Sampling Precision&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Respondents were selected from among individuals who have agreed to participate in Harris surveys. The sampling precision is measured using a Bayesian credible interval. For the full national sample, data is accurate to within plus or minus 2.5 percentage points at a 95% confidence level. For racial and ethnic subsamples, the credible intervals are wider: plus or minus 4.9 percentage points for the Black sample, plus or minus 5.2 percentage points for the Latino/a/e or Latinx sample, and plus or minus 5.1 percentage points for the Asian sample.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-limitations"&gt;Limitations&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As with all surveys, this study is subject to multiple sources of error that cannot be fully quantified, including coverage error, nonresponse error, question wording and response option effects, and post-survey weighting adjustments. The survey also used the UCLA Three-Item Loneliness Scale to measure loneliness levels, assigning numerical values to responses about feeling isolated, left out, or lacking companionship, then grouping respondents into high, moderate, or low loneliness categories.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        &lt;p&gt;Ruth Wilson doesn’t look sick yet “everywhere hurts all the time” – because her immune system is attacking her own body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Massachusetts woman has lupus, nicknamed the disease of 1,000 faces for its variety of symptoms — one of a rogues’ gallery of &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/nobel-prize-medicine-a68cf8a3b930570630168a949d277cde"&gt;autoimmune diseases&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; that affect tens of millions of people and are a big medical mystery. Now researchers are decoding the biology behind these debilitating diseases in hopes of eventually treating the causes, not just the symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wilson’s journey offers a glimpse of the burden.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It took six years of symptoms — fevers, rashes, pain, swelling and, finally, her kidneys starting to fail — to get diagnosed. Over a decade later, Wilson relies on a handful of pills every morning and a monthly IV treatment to tamp down – not eliminate – a chronic disease that’s often invisible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="Enhancement" data-align-center&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes healthy people “fake being sick so they don’t have to go to work. We fake being well so that we can continue to do the things that we want to do.”&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;Her daily pain, fatigue and brain fog wax and wane. Worse are “flares,” when symptoms abruptly and markedly worsen. For Wilson, they bring sudden high fevers, legs too swollen to walk, more intense pain. They impact her job at a medical lab and time with her husband, teen son and college-age daughter.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Wilson learned too much sunshine is one of her triggers. So a family visit to the beach means lots of sunscreen, a big hat and long sleeves.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;Whenever a flare strikes, Wilson pricks her finger for a blood sample. It’s part of a study led by the Lupus Research Alliance to better understand the disease’s variations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="Enhancement" data-align-fullwidth&gt;

She saved her life by begging for one more test in an emergency room about to send her home, again, without answers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That last-ditch test found the Massachusetts woman’s kidneys were failing. The culprit? Her &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/autoimmune-lupus-women-rheumatoid-arthritis-aff0e28dece3ef4168f301bd84331ea5"&gt;immune system had been attacking her own body&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; all that time and nobody caught it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I just wish there was a better way that patients could get that diagnosis without having to go through all of the pain and all of, like, the dismissiveness and the gaslighting,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wilson has lupus, nicknamed the disease of 1,000 faces for its variety of symptoms — and her journey offers a snapshot of the dark side of the immune system. Lupus is one of a rogues’ gallery of &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/nobel-prize-medicine-a68cf8a3b930570630168a949d277cde"&gt;autoimmune diseases&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; that affect as many as 50 million Americans and millions more worldwide – hard to treat, on the rise and one of medicine’s biggest mysteries.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;Now, building on discoveries from cancer research and the COVID-19 pandemic, scientists are decoding the biology behind these debilitating illnesses. They’re uncovering pathways that lead to different autoimmune diseases and connections between seemingly unrelated ones – in hopes of attacking the causes, not just the symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The list goes on: A new count from the National Institutes of Health tallied 140 autoimmune conditions, many rare but altogether a leading cause of chronic disease that’s often invisible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You look normal. People see you and they don’t think you have this horrible disease,” said Wilson, 43, who balances her illness with volunteering to help educate the public and even doctors about life with lupus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="Enhancement" data-align-fullwidth&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;While there’s still an enormous amount to learn, recent steps have some specialists daring to wonder if just maybe, ways to cure or prevent at least some of these diseases are getting closer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In dozens of clinical trials, scientists are harnessing some of patients’ own immune cells to wipe out wayward ones that fuel lupus and a growing list of other diseases. It’s called CAR-T therapy and early results with these “living drugs” are promising. The first lupus patient was treated in Germany in March 2021 and remains in drug-free remission, the researchers said last month.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;And a drug named teplizumab can delay the start of Type 1 diabetes symptoms in people destined to get sick, buying some time before they’ll need insulin. Citing that “tantalizing evidence,” the NIH’s new five-year plan for autoimmune research — if it gets funded — urges pursuing similar windows to intervene in other simmering diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is probably the most exciting time that we’ve ever had to be in autoimmunity,” said Dr. Amit Saxena, a rheumatologist at NYU Langone Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Inside job&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="Enhancement" data-align-fullwidth&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your immune system has multiple overlapping ways to detect and attack bacteria, viruses or other bad actors. That includes teaching key soldiers -- T cells and antibody-producing B cells — how to distinguish what’s foreign from what’s “you.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s a delicate balancing act, especially considering germs sometimes adapt features similar to human molecules so they can confuse and sneak past immune defenses. And while the immune system has built-in safeguards to curtail any misbehaving cells, autoimmune diseases set in when the system gets off-kilter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Numerous genes involved in different immune functions can make people susceptible to common autoimmune diseases. That means if one family member is sick, others may be at increased risk. Such genes can include variants that &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/multiple-sclerosis-ancient-dna-c8fbfe4ba7d4e2447eec52c6000878dc"&gt;once protected our ancestors&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; from long-ago threats including the &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/oddities-science-health-plague-bubonic-04349f994460d01c56fe5a57960b6ce8"&gt;Black Death&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; but that today can translate into a hyperactive immune system.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;But “genes are not everything,” said Dr. Mariana Kaplan of NIH’s National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies show if one identical twin develops an autoimmune disease, the other isn’t guaranteed to get sick. Non-genetic factors that trigger an immune response play a big role, such as infections, certain medicines, smoking, pollutants. In lupus, even a bad sunburn is suspect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“At some point there is a second or third hit and the immune system says, ‘That’s it, I can’t handle any more of these insults,’” said Kaplan, who directs systemic autoimmunity research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And women are more likely to get autoimmune diseases than men, maybe because of estrogen or their extra X chromosome. That’s especially evident in lupus; women account for 90% of cases, often young ones like Wilson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="Enhancement" data-align-fullwidth&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/template&gt;
    
&lt;/bsp-figure&gt;

                &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fainting spells and body-wide rashes began in her 20s and intensified with two pregnancies. Youngsters in tow, she saw a variety of doctors for fevers, swelling, joint and back pain until that fateful ER visit when she requested a urine test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Months of grueling treatment saved her kidneys. But over a decade later, the Littleton, Massachusetts, woman still lives with daily pain from lupus. Deep fatigue and brain fog — difficulty with concentrating, short-term recall, multitasking — wax and wane.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Therapies have improved in recent years, from high-dose steroids and drugs that broadly suppress the immune system to include additional options that focus on specific molecules. Wilson gets a monthly lupus-targeted IV treatment and takes about six daily medicines to calm her overactive immune system and related symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;Worse are what are called flares, when symptoms abruptly and markedly worsen. For Wilson, they bring sudden high fevers, legs too swollen to walk, more intense pain, lasting days to a week. They impact her job at a medical lab and time with her husband, teen son and college-age daughter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s not a bad life, it’s just a bad day,” she tells herself to get through.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kaplan, the NIH scientist, has a biological explanation for the daily slog: The same inflammatory proteins that cause aches and fatigue during a cold or flu continually course through the bodies of patients with systemic autoimmune diseases like lupus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Hunting the root causes&lt;/h2&gt;
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;“These are my babies,” said Dr. Justin Kwong, a research fellow in Kaplan’s lab at NIH, as he carefully examines cells in an incubator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kwong is performing something so tricky it’s not done in many laboratories: He’s growing batches of neutrophils, the body’s most common white blood cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They are first responders that race to the site of an injury or infection, and Kaplan suspects they’re among the earliest immune cells to run amok and trigger certain autoimmune diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How? Some types of neutrophils spew out their insides to form sticky spider-web like structures that trap and kill germs. The neutrophils die in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;But patients with lupus and some other diseases harbor abnormal neutrophils that form too many webs, Kaplan said. Her team is investigating if other immune defenses mistakenly sense the resulting debris as foreign, sparking a chain reaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We think that’s a fundamental initial process,” Kaplan said. “We’re trying to find why it happens, why it happens more often in women, and can we come up with strategies to stop this without harming the way we defend ourselves from infections.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another common feature: Patients with a number of autoimmune diseases, especially women, often suffer heart attacks and strokes at unusually young ages. Kaplan’s research suggests those aptly named NETS, or neutrophil extracellular traps, may be key — by damaging blood vessels and spurring hardened arteries typically seen in older people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But neutrophils don’t live long outside the body and testing mature ones from lupus patients’ blood won’t show how they went awry — something Kwong’s baby neutrophils may aid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Teasing apart patient differences&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="Enhancement" data-align-fullwidth&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whatever triggers it, lupus has bafflingly varied symptoms and treatments that can keep some patients symptom-free but not others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That suggests “lupus is not a single disease,” Kaplan said. “What we call lupus probably represents many different conditions that have some common factors.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How to subtype lupus isn’t clear. But another disease, rheumatoid arthritis, may offer clues. Perhaps best recognized by painfully disfigured fingers, RA can attack any joint and even some organs, sometimes scarring lungs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like with lupus, RA treatment is trial-and-error and scientists are exploring different underlying factors to explain why. In one study, an international team used tiny samples of patients’ joint tissue to identify six inflammatory subtypes of RA based on patterns of cells, how they clustered and their activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It “changed how we think about the disease,” said Northwestern University rheumatology chief Harris Perlman, one of the coauthors. Now researchers are comparing cells in joint tissue before and after patients start a new drug to see if they could help guide treatment choices, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Living with lupus&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="Enhancement" data-align-fullwidth&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wilson learned to wear sunscreen and a big hat outdoors and how to ration her energy in hopes of avoiding flares. When her kids were old enough for school, she returned, too, getting degrees that led to laboratory research and data science jobs — and a better understanding of her own disease and its treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One day her then-rheumatologist asked if she’d answer some medical students’ questions. Wilson remembers many knew “what lupus looks like in a textbook” but not the patient perspective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I realized, my god, I need to start talking about this.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What that looks like now: One evening last February, Wilson bubbled with nerves and excitement at finally meeting some members of her online lupus support group. At UMass Chan Medical School, Wilson greeted the two women and two men with hugs. They shared symptoms and treatments — and rueful stories of well-meaning relatives urging them to just get more sleep to combat the lupus fatigue that rest can’t conquer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A month later, Wilson traveled to Washington for a meeting organized by the Lupus Research Alliance, where she urged scientists and drug company researchers to heed patient reports of changes in their everyday lives, such as whether a new therapy helps brain fog.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;Drug studies that measure physical symptoms and blood markers are “only capturing half the story,” she said. “If a treatment allows me to think clearly, to engage in my life, to be the person I know I am beneath all of this, then that is just as important as reducing inflammation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While her doctor isn’t recommending experimental treatments yet, Wilson recently joined the Lupus Landmark Study that will track biological samples from 3,500 patients to better understand disease variations. Whenever a flare strikes Wilson pricks her finger for a blood sample to share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s important for me to also be a voice for patients because I think of myself and how lonely I was at the very beginning,” Wilson said. For a long time, “I never wanted to talk about it. Especially my kids, I wanted them to know that I was going to be OK. And so you put on your makeup and your lipstick and your three shades of eye corrector and you go on.”&lt;/p&gt;

Among these include:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Legumes (this includes products made from soy beans like tofu and soy milk)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Seeds&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nuts&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Extra virgin olive oil, canola oil, and avocados&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Fruits&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Vegetables&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;All of them have certain properties that can help in lowering cholesterol levels, experts have said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Last year, Andrea Glenn, assistant professor at New York University's Department of Nutrition and Food Studies, told &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/the-portfolio-diet-a-smart-investment-for-your-heart" target="_blank" class="backlink" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="Harvard Health Publishing"&gt;Harvard Health Publishing&lt;/a&gt; that "viscous fiber" is one of the various types of soluble fiber that "has a somewhat sticky quality.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is usually found in eggplant, chia seeds, barley, and oats, among others.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Under the portfolio diet, the recommended servings on a daily basis include viscous fiber (20 grams), nuts and seeds (45 grams), plant-based proteins (50 grams), plant sterols (2 grams), oils or monounsaturated fats (45 grams), according to CNBC.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Besides this, there are certain foods that people following a portfolio diet are required to skip. These include red meat, butter, cream, certain daily products, saturated fat, and ultra-processed foods.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Glenn suggested that it is not an "all-or-nothing approach."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"You can take your own diet and make a few small changes and see cardiovascular benefits,” Glenn added.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Also read: &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/new-study-says-skipping-breakfast-doesn-t-slow-brain-function-or-reduce-focus-in-adults-101762237367324.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="New study says skipping breakfast doesn’t slow brain function or reduce focus in adults"&gt;New study says skipping breakfast doesn’t slow brain function or reduce focus in adults&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Benefits of a portfolio diet&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several studies led by Jenkins have found less risk of heart disease in individuals following the portfolio diet.

UTIs can be annoying and somewhat painful at best and quite serious at worse, potentially leading to lasting health issues if left untreated, per the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1596630&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mayoclinic.org%2Fdiseases-conditions%2Furinary-tract-infection%2Fsymptoms-causes%2Fsyc-20353447&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.prevention.com%2Fhealth%2Fa69269440%2Fsymptoms-of-urinary-tract-infection%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mayo Clinic;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt;. That's why knowing the most common UTI symptoms is so important for catching an infection early and getting the treatment you need, particularly if you are in a high-risk group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're postmenopausal, your likelihood of having a UTI increases. "In women after &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a69076977/what-menopause-does-to-your-body/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:menopause;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;menopause&lt;/a&gt;, an average of one UTI a year is pretty common," said &lt;a href="https://stanfordhealthcare.org/doctors/m/kavita-mishra.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Kavita Mishra, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Kavita Mishra, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, a urogynecologist at Stanford Medicine. Changes in the pH of the vagina can alter the balance of bacteria and yeast in postmenopausal women and make it easier for bacteria to make their way into the urethra, aka the lower urinary tract. "UTIs are also fairly common for sexually active women," added Dr. Mishra, although peeing before and after sex can help prevent their occurrence. Women with &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/health-conditions/a69242599/is-diabetes-reversible/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:diabetes;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; are also more likely to get a UTI because of the condition's impact on the immune system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meet the experts: &lt;a href="https://stanfordhealthcare.org/doctors/m/kavita-mishra.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Kavita Mishra, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Kavita Mishra, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, a urogynecologist at Stanford Medicine; &lt;a href="https://www.mountsinai.org/profiles/lisa-dabney" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Lisa Dabney, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Lisa Dabney, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, the director of urogynecology and pelvic reconstructive surgery at Mount Sinai West and Mount Sinai Morningside in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Knowing the signs and symptoms of a UTI can help you stop what you're doing and get treatment before the infection becomes something serious. Here, doctors share common UTI symptoms and what to do to get rid of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Common UTI symptoms&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Pain, burning, or stinging when you pee&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pain or burning when you pee is often the first sign of a UTI or bacteria in the urethra or bladder, said Dr. Mishra. However, it doesn’t necessarily mean you have a full-blown UTI—unless it becomes persistent. If you only feel pain once during the day and don’t show any other symptoms of a UTI, your body has likely already flushed out the bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drinking extra water as soon as the burning starts may help flush out small amounts of bacteria and help prevent the infection from growing, according to &lt;a href="https://www.mountsinai.org/profiles/lisa-dabney" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Lisa Dabney, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Lisa Dabney, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, the director of urogynecology and pelvic reconstructive surgery at Mount Sinai West and Mount Sinai Morningside in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;A strong urge to pee all the time&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;If all you can think about is how badly &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a65782866/reasons-you-always-have-to-pee/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:you have to pee;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;you have to pee&lt;/a&gt;—especially if you just went and are experiencing other symptoms, such as painful urination—you probably have a UTI. Bacteria can irritate the urethra and the lining of the bladder and make you feel like you desperately need to go constantly, said Dr. Mishra.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, many women will experience an overactive bladder without an infection, so be sure to note if the urge is not typical for you when speaking with a doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Frequent urination despite a nearly empty bladder&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Frequent urination is another symptom of a urinary tract infection, per the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1596630&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mayoclinic.org%2Fdiseases-conditions%2Furinary-tract-infection%2Fsymptoms-causes%2Fsyc-20353447&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.prevention.com%2Fhealth%2Fa69269440%2Fsymptoms-of-urinary-tract-infection%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mayo Clinic;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt;. A UTI can make you feel like you have a full bladder, but only dribbles come out when you go. Frequent trips to the bathroom and little to no relief are telltale signs to look out for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Cloudy, bloody, or discolored urine&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a33235427/pee-color-meaning/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:color of your pee;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;color of your pee&lt;/a&gt; can tell you a lot of things, including whether you have an infection. Anything off the yellow or clear spectrum should be a red flag. Cloudy, red, or brown urine are all signs of infection, said Dr. Mishra.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before you panic, take stock of what you ate in the past 24 hours. Beets and other foods can also make your pee a frightening pink, orange, or red color, but you won’t have any pain, and the color will quickly pass if something you ate is to blame.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Strong-smelling urine&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;You don’t have to sniff the bowl every time you go, but a strong, pungent smell is a common UTI symptom, according to the &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/9135-urinary-tract-infections" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Cleveland Clinic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;. However, some foods may also cause your pee to smell. Coffee and asparagus are two likely culprits. If your urine still smells after going a couple of times, or it’s paired with a cloudy or red color, it’s time to call the doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Pressure, cramping, or pain in your pelvis&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Older women in particular may have cramping, pressure, or abdominal pain when they have a UTI. In some women, pain, cramping, and &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a22586222/body-aches-causes/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:muscle aches;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;muscle aches&lt;/a&gt;—which can also be felt in your flank or lower back, the &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/9135-urinary-tract-infections" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Cleveland Clinic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt; says—may be the most pronounced symptoms. These symptoms are often easy to ignore or attribute to something else—say, something you ate or PMS—but it’s important to pay attention to them and bring them up with your doctor, who can help you find the cause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Extreme fatigue or fever&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;As with any type of infection, once the body detects that something is wrong, it goes into a state of inflammation. Along with other protective measures, this triggers the release of white blood cells that can cause feelings of &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a20501661/why-you-are-always-tired/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:fatigue;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;fatigue&lt;/a&gt;, which can be associated with a UTI if you have also noticed other symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Likewise, a &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a20429676/how-to-break-a-fever/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:fever;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;fever&lt;/a&gt; accompanied by some of the other symptoms above is often a sign that the infection has become more serious and spread to the kidneys, said Dr. Mirsha. If you have a fever over 101°F or and are experiencing chills or night sweats, seek medical help immediately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to ease common UTI symptoms&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though you may have heard that cranberry juice is the magical cure for UTIs, don’t fall into the hype. While cranberry juice contains an active ingredient to prevent bacteria from attaching itself to the walls of your bladder, the juice doesn’t contain enough of that ingredient to really make a difference (plus, it’s packed with added sugar), said Dr. Mishra.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A UTI can be incredibly painful and interrupt your daily life, but these infections are easy to treat once you seek the help of a doctor, who will test your urine to ensure you’re dealing with a UTI. Symptoms usually clear up entirely within a few days of taking prescribed antibiotics. Here are a few more things you can do to feel better ASAP:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drink lots of fluids. &lt;/strong&gt;This is especially important once you have started taking antibiotics. Extra fluids will help get the antibiotics to the infected area faster and help remove bacteria. Drinking six to eight 8-ounce glasses of water daily can also help prevent future infections, &lt;a href="https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/urologic-diseases/bladder-infection-uti-in-adults/treatment" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:according to the NIDDK;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;according to the NIDDK&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consider OTC pain relief.&lt;/strong&gt; Dr. Mishra recommended popping a urinary pain relief medication, such as &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0018SGX6I/?linkCode=ogi&amp;amp;tag=syn-yahoo-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5Bartid%7C2141.a.69269440%5Bsrc%7Cyahoo-us" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:AZO;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;AZO&lt;/a&gt;. These medications numb the bladder, relieve burning, and reduce the constant urge to go. Be warned, they will turn your urine a shocking shade of orange. “You can always use over-the-counter pain medications like &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01HI7WP0U?linkCode=ogi&amp;amp;tag=syn-yahoo-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5Bartid%7C2141.a.69269440%5Bsrc%7Cyahoo-us" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Tylenol;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Tylenol&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0034XS7DC?linkCode=ogi&amp;amp;tag=syn-yahoo-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5Bartid%7C2141.a.69269440%5Bsrc%7Cyahoo-us" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Motrin;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Motrin&lt;/a&gt;, but they don’t seem to work as well as AZO,” said Dr. Mishra.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Skip the coffee, soda, alcohol, and citrus juice.&lt;/strong&gt; Stick to water to avoid irritating your bladder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use a heating pad.&lt;/strong&gt; If you’re experiencing cramps or painful pressure, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sunbeam-King-Size-MicroPlush-Electric-Controller/dp/B00474Z0Q4/?linkCode=ogi&amp;amp;tag=syn-yahoo-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5Bartid%7C2141.a.69269440%5Bsrc%7Cyahoo-us" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:a heating pad;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;a heating pad&lt;/a&gt; can help ease your discomfort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;And once your symptoms have totally cleared up? Avoid holding in pee for long periods of time—bacteria flourishes when urine stays in the bladder for too long. Always wipe from front to back after having a bowel movement (to prevent bacteria transfer), and consider using birth control without spermicides (as they &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/22493-spermicide" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:have been linked;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;have been linked &lt;/a&gt;to a higher chance of UTIs). All of these small, everyday habits will go a long way toward preventing urinary tract infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This article was medically reviewed by Carolyn Swenson, MD, &lt;strong&gt;an assistant professor of obstetrics and gynecology &lt;/strong&gt;and member of &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;the &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/about/g26577234/medical-review-board/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Prevention Medical Review Board;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Prevention Medical Review Board&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, on April 27, 2019.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a20437183/prevent-period-cramps/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:menstrual cramps;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;menstrual cramps&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/sex/a21601460/birth-control-side-effects/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:birth control side effects;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;birth control side effects&lt;/a&gt;, and even pregnancy complications, tack this onto the list of painful health issues many women unfortunately deal with: &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/health-conditions/a22734350/urinary-tract-infection-symptoms-treatments/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:urinary tract infections (aka UTIs);elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;urinary tract infections (aka UTIs)&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, 40 to 60 percent of women will experience at least one UTI in their lifetime—and 1 in 4 will have multiple, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/urologic-diseases/bladder-infection-uti-in-adults/definition-facts" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases&lt;/a&gt; (NIDDK).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s because a woman has a shorter urethra (aka, the tube that releases urine) than a man, making it easier for bacteria to reach the urinary tract. Still, it’s also not a female-only issue: Around &lt;a href="https://www.urologyhealth.org/urologic-conditions/urinary-tract-infections-in-adults" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:12 percent of American men;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;12 percent of American men&lt;/a&gt; (especially those over 50) will get a UTI in their lifetime. The infection can form in any part of your urinary tract, including your bladder, urethra, ureters, or kidneys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there are other reasons women are more predisposed to urinary tract infections. For instance, if you’re postmenopausal, your likelihood of having a UTI increases. “In women after menopause, an average of one UTI a year is pretty common,” says &lt;a href="https://stanfordhealthcare.org/doctors/m/kavita-mishra.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Kavita Mishra, MD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Kavita Mishra, MD&lt;/a&gt;, a urogynecologist and clinical assistant professor at Stanford University School of Medicine. Changes in the pH of the vagina can alter the balance of bacteria and yeast in postmenopausal women and make it easier for bacteria to make their way into the urethra.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“UTIs are also fairly common for sexually active women,” adds Dr. Mishra, although peeing before and after sex can help prevent their occurrence (since you’re flushing out bacteria). Women with &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/health-conditions/a21764231/type-2-diabetes-definition/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:diabetes;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; are also more likely to get a UTI because of condition’s impact on the immune system. And unfortunately, there are even more &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a20433449/8-most-common-causes-of-utis/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:common causes of a UTI;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;common causes of a UTI&lt;/a&gt;, including constipation, &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/fitness/a22021995/dehydration-symptoms/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:dehydration;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;dehydration&lt;/a&gt;, a switch in birth control, and even the type of underwear you're wearing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To make matters worse, there’s a plethora of &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a20477713/urinary-tract-infection-myths/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:misinformation;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;misinformation&lt;/a&gt; out there about UTIs, making it even harder for women to open up about dealing with the infection. One important thing to remember: &lt;strong&gt;Getting a UTI says nothing about your level of hygiene, and you shouldn’t be too embarrassed to seek proper care.&lt;/strong&gt; In fact, delaying treatment can make the infection worse, potentially leading to kidney damage, recurrent infections, or even &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/health-conditions/a21051577/sepsis-definition/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:sepsis;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;sepsis&lt;/a&gt; (if the UTI works its way up to your kidneys), says the NIDDK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Knowing how to spot the symptoms of a urinary tract infection is key. That way, you can seek care ASAP and prevent it from turning into a serious health issue.

The research indicates that the strength of this relationship is partly explained by an individual’s sensitivity to potential social threats. The findings were published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2025.113454" target="_blank"&gt;Personality and Individual Differences&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous research has explored connections between shyness and brain regions involved in emotion and social processing, such as the prefrontal cortex and the amygdala. However, findings have been inconsistent, leaving the specific neural architecture of shyness unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One prominent model suggests shyness emerges from a conflict between the motivation to approach social situations and the motivation to avoid them. To investigate this, researchers often use the concepts of the Behavioral Inhibition System (BIS) and the Behavioral Activation System (BAS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The BIS is associated with avoidance motivation, making individuals more sensitive to potential punishment or negative outcomes, while the BAS is tied to approach motivation and sensitivity to rewards. The present study aimed to connect these motivational systems to the spontaneous, or resting-state, brain activity associated with shyness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Shyness is a common personality trait, but its neural basis has remained elusive. Most existing research has focused on the prefrontal cortex and amygdala, while the role of the cerebellum—traditionally viewed as a ‘motor’ region—has been largely overlooked,” said study author Hong Li, a psychology professor at South China Normal University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Yet recent evidence shows that the cerebellum also contributes to emotion and social processing. We wanted to understand whether the cerebellum plays a meaningful role in shyness and how motivational systems—especially the Behavioral Inhibition System (BIS), which governs our sensitivity to threat—might link brain activity to shy behavior. This question bridges an important gap between biological mechanisms and everyday emotional experience.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers recruited 42 healthy university students. Participants completed questionnaires to measure their levels of trait shyness. They also filled out surveys to assess the sensitivity of their Behavioral Inhibition System and Behavioral Activation System. For example, a high BIS score might reflect agreement with a statement like, “If I think something unpleasant is going to happen, I usually get pretty ‘worked up.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each participant also underwent a resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scan. This technique measures brain activity while a person is at rest and not performing any specific task, allowing scientists to observe the brain’s baseline or spontaneous neural patterns. The researchers then analyzed the fMRI data using a method called Regional Homogeneity, or ReHo. This technique measures the degree of synchronized activity among neighboring points in the brain, essentially gauging the local functional harmony within a specific area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analysis first looked for direct correlations between shyness scores and ReHo values across the entire brain. The results pointed to a significant association in one particular area: the right posterior lobe of the cerebellum. Specifically, individuals who reported higher levels of shyness tended to have lower ReHo values in this region. This suggests that greater shyness is associated with less synchronized local neural activity in this part of the cerebellum when the brain is at rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No other brain regions showed a significant relationship with shyness in this analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We initially expected the prefrontal cortex to play a stronger role, given previous findings,” Li told PsyPost. “Instead, the cerebellum showed a clear and specific association with shyness. This was surprising and exciting—it suggests that the cerebellum contributes not only to coordination and timing, but also to the fine-tuning of emotional and social responses.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also examined the relationships between the personality measures. They found that shyness scores were strongly and positively correlated with scores on the Behavioral Inhibition System. This aligns with the idea that shy individuals tend to be more sensitive to potential threats and social punishments. In contrast, there was no significant correlation between shyness and the Behavioral Activation System, which relates to reward-seeking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With these connections established, the team performed a mediation analysis to see if the BIS or BAS could explain the link between cerebellar activity and shyness. This statistical method examines whether one factor helps explain the relationship between two others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analysis revealed that the Behavioral Inhibition System did indeed play a mediating role. The data suggest that lower synchronized activity in the right posterior cerebellum is associated with a more sensitive behavioral inhibition system, which in turn is linked to higher levels of shyness. The BIS appears to function as a partial bridge connecting the neural pattern to the personality trait.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Behavioral Activation System, on the other hand, did not show any significant mediating effect. This result provides evidence that shyness may be more strongly driven by avoidance and inhibition motivations than by a lack of approach or reward-seeking motivations. The findings refine the motivational conflict model of shyness, pointing to the primary influence of the brain’s threat-detection system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our results show that people who are more shy tend to have lower spontaneous neural activity in a specific part of the cerebellum (the right posterior lobe),” Li explained. “This relationship is partly explained by higher activity in the Behavioral Inhibition System, which makes people more cautious or anxious in social situations.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In simpler terms, shyness may not just come from “overthinking” or lack of confidence—it might also reflect how certain brain systems regulate our sensitivity to potential social threat. This understanding can help us view shyness not as a flaw, but as a meaningful difference in how the brain balances safety and connection.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study does have some limitations to consider. The sample size was relatively modest and consisted only of university students, which may limit how broadly the findings can be applied to the general population. The study’s cross-sectional design identifies associations between brain activity and personality, but it cannot establish a direct causal relationship. It remains unclear whether the brain patterns contribute to shyness or if experiences related to shyness shape the brain over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s important not to interpret these findings as showing that shyness is ’caused’ by a single brain region,” Li noted. “The cerebellum does not make someone shy by itself. Rather, shyness arises from complex interactions among brain systems, personality, and experience. Our data are correlational, so we can’t infer direct causality—but they point to a promising direction for future longitudinal and experimental research.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While the effect sizes in our mediation model are moderate—indicating a partial but meaningful role for the BIS in linking cerebellar activity to shyness—readers should view them as foundational rather than definitive, given our exploratory approach and sample size. Practically, this suggests that targeting the BIS through therapies could have tangible benefits for reducing shyness, though the effects might vary across individuals; it’s not a ‘cure-all’ but a stepping stone toward personalized interventions that could improve social functioning in everyday contexts like work or relationships.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also noted that resting-state fMRI captures only one aspect of brain function. Incorporating task-based fMRI, where participants engage in social tasks during the scan, could provide a more complete picture of the neural processes at play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are currently planning to explore how training or modulation of the cerebellum and BIS-related circuits might reduce excessive social inhibition,” Li explained. “For example, neurofeedback and real-time fMRI could be used to help individuals gain more control over their behavioral inhibition responses. We also aim to examine different subtypes of shyness—such as ‘positive shyness’ and ‘fearful shyness’—to see whether they involve distinct neural patterns.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I hope this study encourages people to think about shyness with greater compassion. Being shy does not mean being socially deficient—it often reflects a heightened sensitivity to social cues and a desire to interact carefully and meaningfully. Understanding the brain basis of shyness helps us appreciate it as a form of emotional intelligence, rather than simply a barrier to overcome.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2025.113454" target="_blank"&gt;Associations between trait shyness and cerebellar spontaneous neural activity are mediated by behavioral inhibition&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Liang Li, Yujie Zhang, Benjamin Becker, and Hong Li.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Thu, 06 Nov 2025 13:11:32 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikgFBVV95cUxOaXh5SVh6bWh1bWJOdmdHQmlHWERMUkFBdFI3TWVRZlJ0TU11RUNmTlpvaDJWLU9LN3llZ1k1UVFuU2FDb05CVGhMNk5UNHFZNldNTWhXa2hIcmFzMmozaGo2YWJiYk5XWl9tSjhpRld1aWczZ1o1OFRnT29jSnlfSjY4NjFtZXoxTFU4b3R6SXJyZw</guid></item><item><title>当雷暴袭来时，哮喘会变成急诊室的噩梦- Gizmodo</title><link>https://gizmodo.com/thunderstorms-could-turn-your-asthma-into-a-nightmare-2000682082</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content prose dark:prose-invert lg:prose-xl prose-science dark:prose-science"&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Has your asthma ever acted up during or shortly after stormy weather? Turns out, there’s a perfectly good reason for that. Research out today links thunderstorms to worsening asthma attacks.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Doctors at the University of Kansas Medical Center examined emergency department data from hospitals in the area. On days when a storm took place, they found, the typical number of asthma-related ER visits was substantially higher than on non-storm days. The findings suggest that people with asthma should take extra precautions when thunder is in the immediate forecast, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The main takeaway is awareness,” lead author Diala Merheb, an internal medicine resident at KUMC, told Gizmodo.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Thunderstorm asthma&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;There have been &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7501467/#:~:text=Clear%20published%20reports%20of%20thunderstorm%20asthma%20date%20back%20to%20the%20early%201980s%2C2%2C3%20with%20more%20than%20twenty%20distinct%20occurrences%20now%20recognized"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; of “thunderstorm asthma” epidemics dating back to the 1980s, which seem to more affect people with seasonal allergies, or hay fever. But the most dramatic incident yet occurred nearly a decade ago in Melbourne, Australia. In late November 2016, a thunderstorm &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanplh/article/PIIS2542-5196(18)30120-7/fulltext"&gt;appeared&lt;/a&gt; to cause a surge of asthma attacks that sent over 3,000 people to the emergency room, hospitalized nearly 500 residents, and killed at least 10.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Numerous studies have documented the phenomenon internationally since, including some in the U.S. According to Merheb, though, theirs is the first research to look for this link between thunderstorms and asthma in Wichita, Kansas, specifically. Importantly, Wichita is already known for having high rates of seasonal pollen allergy, and it’s currently the &lt;a href="https://aafa.org/asthma-allergy-research/allergy-capitals/"&gt;top-ranked&lt;/a&gt; city on the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America (AAFA)’s list of “allergy capitals.”&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The researchers analyzed five years’ worth of ER data from three hospitals in Wichita, from January 2020 to December 2024. This data was then cross-referenced with meteorologic records of the area.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Across those five years, about 4,500 ER visits related to asthma were documented, while 38 storm days occurred in the region, encompassing just 2% of the total days during the study period. But a whopping 14.1% of all asthma-related ER visits took place on those storm days, the researchers found. On average, there were nearly 18 ER visits related to asthma per day during thunderstorms, compared to roughly three ER visits a day when it wasn’t storming.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The team is &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1103520"&gt;presenting&lt;/a&gt; its research this week at the annual meeting of the American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology. That means their work is preliminary for the time being, since the study hasn’t been published in a peer-reviewed journal yet. The authors also note that their results can only show a correlation between thunderstorms and asthma.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;At the same time, the findings are only the latest to find a connection between these two things. “While this doesn’t prove cause and effect, it suggests that thunderstorm conditions, such as changes in wind or pollen dispersion, may play a role in triggering flare-ups,” Merheb said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;What does this mean for people with asthma?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Given what Merheb and others have found, it seems prudent for people with asthma and the doctors who treat them to be more cognizant of the potential risk.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“For people living with asthma, knowing that certain weather conditions can increase risk allows for more proactive management like keeping up with controller medications, and carrying rescue inhalers,” she said. “For clinicians, it reinforces the importance of discussing environmental triggers with their patients as part of routine asthma care.”&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Ironically enough, mild rain showers can actually &lt;a href="https://community.aafa.org/blog/how-does-rain-affect-pollen-levels"&gt;lower&lt;/a&gt; people’s risk of seasonal allergies by simply washing away the pollen in the environment. Conversely, the causes of thunderstorm asthma appear to be more complex. Past research has &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7501467/#:~:text=The%20meteorological%20activity,smaller%2C%20respirable%20size."&gt;suggested&lt;/a&gt; the strong winds of a thunderstorm can kick pollen or mold high up in the air, while the added electrical activity or moisture during a storm can break apart this pollen into smaller fragments more likely to cause a serious allergic reaction when inhaled.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But the arrival of a thunderstorm alone isn’t enough to routinely cause the sort of huge asthma surges seen during the 2016 Melbourne event. So there’s certainly more research needed to figure out the exact drivers of thunderstorm asthma— research that the authors are already looking to conduct.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“We’re hoping to build on these findings by looking more closely at local weather and environmental variables, things like wind patterns, humidity, and pollen data, to better understand what combination of factors might drive these events,” Merheb said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the meantime, if you have asthma and you see a thunderstorm on the way, that should give you even more motivation to stay firmly indoors if you can.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;

When used in tandem, the drugs were shown to reverse some of the brain changes &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimers-disease-harms-the-brain-in-2-distinct-phases-study-reveals"&gt;brought on by the disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The harmful clumps of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tau_protein"&gt;tau protein&lt;/a&gt; that build up in brains affected by Alzheimer's were reduced significantly, and the mice showed improvements in learning and memory tasks – two brain capabilities often impaired by Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By combining the two drugs, the researchers were able to target different types of brain cells affected by the disease. Letrozole seemed to counter Alzheimer's in neurons, while irinotecan worked in &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glia"&gt;glia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Alzheimer's is likely the result of numerous alterations in many genes and proteins that, together, disrupt brain health," &lt;a href="https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2025/07/430386/do-these-two-cancer-drugs-have-what-it-takes-beat-alzheimers"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; neuroscientist Yadong Huang, from UC San Francisco and Gladstone Institutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This makes it very challenging for drug development – which traditionally produces one drug for a single gene or protein that drives disease."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's a promising start, but there's more work to be done: Obviously the drugs have only been directly tested in mice so far, and these medications also come with &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/medicines/letrozole/side-effects-of-letrozole/"&gt;side effects&lt;/a&gt;.

According to the researchers, this approach could lead to more personalized and effective treatments, based on how gene expression has been altered in each case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's estimated that &lt;a href="https://www.alzint.org/about/dementia-facts-figures/dementia-statistics/"&gt;more than 55 million people&lt;/a&gt; have Alzheimer's, and as the world's population ages, that's expected to more than double in the next 25 years. Finding ways to prevent the disease and even reverse symptoms would have a huge impact on global health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If completely independent data sources, such as single-cell expression data and clinical records, guide us to the same pathways and the same drugs, and then resolve Alzheimer's in a genetic model, then maybe we're on to something," &lt;a href="https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2025/07/430386/do-these-two-cancer-drugs-have-what-it-takes-beat-alzheimers"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Sirota.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're hopeful this can be swiftly translated into a real solution for millions of patients with Alzheimer's."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2025.06.035"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cell&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An earlier version of this article was published in July 2025.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The borough was &lt;a href="https://www.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/epi/databrief65.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;once known&lt;/a&gt; for the highest rate of overdose deaths in the city, before being outpaced by the Bronx. Its overdose rate is now the second lowest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="f7tq4"&gt;With just under 500,000 residents, Staten Island is dealing with an overall smaller population of drug users than other boroughs. On Staten Island, 81 people died of overdoses last year, down from 157 in 2023. Overdoses killed more than 2,000 residents last year citywide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="co40p"&gt;Hotspotting was developed as a partnership between MIT and a coalition of Staten Island health care providers. It uses an AI-driven algorithm to help identify individuals at the highest risk of overdosing based on their medical history, justice involvement and a wide range of other factors. The district attorney’s office and local health organizations can also refer people to the program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="bhai"&gt;Peers with their own history with substance use then actively reach out to those identified to ask about their needs — whether that’s housing, treatment, Narcan or anything else — and help coordinate care. The program uses regular check-ins and an app with monetary incentives to help keep clients on track.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="d01jg"&gt;More than 600 drug users have been engaged in the program so far. Between April 2022 and April 2024, four of those clients died of overdoses, compared with 25 individuals in a control group, according to reports published by the Staten Island Performing Provider System, the health care coalition that runs the program. There was also a dramatic drop in emergency room visits among those who participated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="9ogsp"&gt;Drug policy researchers haven’t definitively identified what is behind the nationwide drop in overdose deaths, or why some areas are seeing bigger improvements than others, though they say investments in programs to reduce the harms of drug use and connect people to care are likely helping to move the needle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="52k1k"&gt;Joseph Conte, executive director of the Staten Island Performing Provider System, called the proactive outreach baked into the hotspotting program a “paradigm shift” on Staten Island.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="8g41"&gt;Others working on the program said it has also been part of a broader effort to coordinate among different health care providers and agencies that might come into contact with people at risk of overdosing and address gaps in care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="7mdrm"&gt;Germoso said he is sometimes connected to people who are already in an outpatient drug treatment program but are still using illicit drugs and may need a connection to mental health care or other services to really turn things around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="boa0v"&gt;Staten Island has its own challenges when it comes to addressing the overdose crisis, including the fact that many people are more isolated from services than in other parts of the city, said Donna Demarest, the director of harm reduction at Community Health Action of Staten Island, which participates in the hotspotting program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="bkl9"&gt;But she said the island’s insular nature also makes it easier for different organizations to unite around a single initiative like hotspotting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="b7mvk"&gt;The program is now expanding. NYC Health and Hospitals announced earlier this year it would try it out as part of a new pilot program at Lincoln Hospital in the Bronx — the borough that currently has the highest rate of overdose deaths in the city — with the help of $600,000 in funding from the Robin Hood Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Gothamist</author><pubDate>Thu, 06 Nov 2025 11:31:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipAFBVV95cUxOZlZlMVM2NEJMb3NGbFFVYmYzZGZGMXlobzhBdzNVcDdhUUxROEhBUHdGd1NDSG5qYW5JTGYyUU5TV3FhMDAxMDV2bDhYMkFsR3dNZEdSOEJzQUFWeF9yUUZ5a2g1ZnJGVy1SaUJNNFExZ3BZOWQzZlQ3LVV5Q3RiM0xIYmtHamlQNl9aWlZlaUdPbzJtMXpYY1IxNUV3VU1acHRqbA</guid></item></channel></rss>
