Fewer than 10 cases are reported each year in the U.S., but &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://apnews.com/article/health-52f7e46efac248b6998edee89e052b27"&gt;almost all are fatal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Here are some things to know about the amoeba, its latest victim and other dangers on freshwater lakes:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The amoeba's scientific name is Naegleria fowleri and it is most dangerous in water that stays for a while over 77 degrees Fahrenheit (25 degrees Celsius), including in lakes and rivers in the U.S. and other places with hot, sometimes dry summers like Pakistan and Australia. Infections have been reported in 26 U.S. states as far north as Minnesota.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The amoeba enters the brain through the olfactory nerve in the nose. Once inside, it causes an infection called primary amebic meningoencephalitis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Symptoms start as a fairly standard headache and nausea. By the time the pain becomes severe, it is almost always too late to save the infected person. Of the 167 cases reported in the U.S. between 1962 and 2024, only four people have survived, according to the &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.cdc.gov/naegleria/media/pdfs/naegleria_factsheet508c.pdf"&gt;U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;. Most of the deaths happened within five days of getting sick, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;One infection in a body of water doesn’t increase the chances of another infection in the same body of water, the agency said. The amoeba cannot move from one person to another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;It was the first death from the amoeba in South Carolina since 2016, the CDC said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Jaysen Carr went swimming at Lake Murray about 15 miles (24 kilometers) west of Columbia over the July Fourth weekend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;He got sick several days later and died on July 18.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;His father and mother had never heard of the amoeba before a doctor in tears told them what tests of his spinal fluid had found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Clarence Carr said he was shocked to learn South Carolina, like most other U.S. states, has no law requiring public reporting of deaths or infections from the amoeba. The lake wasn’t closed and no water testing was performed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;“My son was a very smart individual. If he had one warning, he would have thought swimming in the lake was a bad idea,” Carr said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The amoeba is fairly common and is most dangerous when the water is warm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;There is no science-based threshold for what level of the organism in the water would be safe or unsafe, and it would be difficult to test water regularly, the South Carolina Department of Environmental Services said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Researchers are trying to figure out why the infections are so rare. Some people have been found to have had antibodies, signaling they may have survived exposure. Others may die from brain swelling and other problems without the amoeba ever being detected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;“My son lost his life swimming. We assumed it was safe,” Carr said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Last year, the CDC started a pilot program of giving infected patients an antibiotic approved for use in Europe that has killed the amoeba in lab studies &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The amoeba can show up in hot springs, rivers and, on rare occasions, in tap water. That’s why doctors recommend using sterile water for cleaning nasal passages with a neti pot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The only way to be completely safe is to not swim in lakes or rivers and, if you do, keep your head above water. Pinching your nose or using nose clips when diving or swimming can keep water out of your nose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;There are other dangers in swimming in lakes and rivers instead of pools, where chemicals can kill off dangerous bacteria and other organisms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;A mouthful of water could contain E.coli bacteria. And while the bacteria normally live in the intestines of healthy people and animals, some strains can cause a range of conditions, including urinary tract infection, cystitis, intestinal infection and vomiting, with the worst cases leading to life-threatening blood poisoning, according to &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/e-coli/symptoms-causes/syc-20372058"&gt;the Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Algae can also cause illnesses. Cyanobacteria — also referred to as blue-green algae — are plant-like organisms that live in water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The algae can look like foam, scum, mats, or paint on the surface of the water and can grow underneath it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The organisms can quickly grow out of control, or “bloom," in warm weather, helped along by excessive nutrients in fertilizers and pet waste carried along by stormwater.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC eTIW sUzSN "&gt;Some of the algae produce toxins that can cause symptoms including skin irritation, stomach cramps, vomiting, nausea, diarrhea, fever, sore throat, headache, muscle and joint pain, mouth blisters, seizures, and acute liver damage, according to the &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.cdc.gov/harmful-algal-blooms/about/index.html#:~:text=Algae%20and%20cyanobacteria%20(also%20called,make%20people%20and%20animals%20sick."&gt;U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>ABC News</author><pubDate>Tue, 29 Jul 2025 23:15:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinwFBVV95cUxOeE5ac0RHSmQtcGt2ajBXMUVNYV8zMFJfRUVOZVZ3Yjc2cERmeUNYSkl4OWRHaEFrcXU2RFh0VzhyNWM2Z2l6TW1JRVFJR2NWTy1JMU1Da3VqcUxLdkN5MnNxWC14MkZtVGFaTWVTZ3RQNlZFVkVQUlo5dVpzZ0NfS3N2WUZnZ3paSzNyaTR3M0VaYm12eXE5aDRYcG5mOHfSAaQBQVVfeXFMTjVtRVhNZTZQWGRmbXFDZUpMT3NrUXRwa1JpeWdVRnRIaTJZLTRTWjFnZXhtUUFaVzE3a1V0czdaRnVGWTN5cnBvVHM3SERDckZPTUxYcnE4Y0t1UkhuNjNyMjZKYmxUSW53cE5Ma2tLMGpyaEwzNTV1RFQxeGhyTVFNeXh0SU9xMmtqb1Q4NVZrSW93c3JGQnNVVWJEZ09YV1dJRGY</guid></item><item><title>在南卡罗来纳州的一个湖泊上，一只吃大脑的阿米巴虫杀死了他们的儿子，父母们希望得到更多的警告- Star Tribune</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMizwFBVV95cUxQNmhwQmtKV2NxZU81MzNWTk9yWnBlTXVPczVSc3QybGpYUGtPRW0zWUhoR2hvQkNKSEdFWVRudWFtUzhVUTdHemxHUnFoSFlLeFFfZWJhMXEzTTNWSDdCcjU3Q0UzLS04dFVQUFl1YXNLSHZoWUdMcFRkVmt0UlUtT3B6dkl5by1hRHFwZmhEcnh3emttY0VlS0ZvcFpfcUs3dnV5NWc2bFJCSHNsQ1lLLWRMT0xjbzBqeHBHdFNycG10SFBFczloY0RIM2ppTGs?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="article-body-item" class="rt-Box  pb-5 article-body-rich-text"&gt;&lt;div class="rt-Box w-full"&gt;&lt;p class="rt-Text"&gt;COLUMBIA, S.C.  — Two weeks after Jaysen Carr spent the Fourth of July swimming and riding on a boat on one of South Carolina's most popular lakes, he was dead from an amoeba that lives in the warm water and entered his brain through his nose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="article-body-item" class="rt-Box  pb-5 article-body-rich-text"&gt;&lt;div class="rt-Box w-full"&gt;&lt;p class="rt-Text"&gt;His parents had no clue the brain-eating amoeba, whose scientific name is Naegleria fowleri, even existed in Lake Murray, just 15 miles (24 kilometers) west of Columbia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="article-body-item" class="rt-Box  pb-5 article-body-rich-text"&gt;&lt;div class="rt-Box w-full"&gt;&lt;p class="rt-Text"&gt;They found out when a doctor, in tears, told them the diagnosis after what seemed like a fairly regular headache and nausea took a serious turn. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="article-body-item" class="rt-Box  pb-5 article-body-rich-text"&gt;&lt;div class="rt-Box w-full"&gt;&lt;p class="rt-Text"&gt;Jaysen, 12, fought for a week before dying on July 18, making him one of about 160 people known to have died from the amoeba in the U.S. in the past 60 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="article-body-item" class="rt-Box  pb-5 article-body-rich-text"&gt;&lt;div class="rt-Box w-full"&gt;&lt;p class="rt-Text"&gt;As they grieve their son, the boy's parents said they were stunned to learn South Carolina, like most other U.S. states, has no law requiring public reporting of deaths or infections from the amoeba.

							&lt;p data-start="281" data-end="390"&gt;We live in a world where “wellness” has become a buzzword, but disease still creeps in through the back door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="392" data-end="552"&gt;Everywhere you look, there’s another green juice, another detox kit, another celebrity-endorsed superfood promising to clean out your insides and give you glow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="554" data-end="599"&gt;And yet, cancer rates remain alarmingly high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="601" data-end="698"&gt;Despite the yoga apps, the mushroom powders, and the clean beauty swaps—we’re still getting sick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="700" data-end="887"&gt;But there’s one diet change—backed by decades of research—that continues to stand out. One that consistently lowers cancer risk, supports immunity, and improves long-term health outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="889" data-end="920"&gt;It’s not sexy. It’s not trendy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="922" data-end="942"&gt;It’s just… veganism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-section-id="11svawb" data-start="944" data-end="990"&gt;The plant-based connection you can’t ignore&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="992" data-end="1033"&gt;I know. The word alone can be polarizing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1035" data-end="1238"&gt;But hear me out—not from a moral soapbox, but from a health-conscious, evidence-following, former-skeptic who used to eat turkey sandwiches every day for lunch and believed cheese was its own food group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1240" data-end="1346"&gt;I’m not writing this to shame anyone. I’m writing this because the science is there—and we’re ignoring it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1348" data-end="1548"&gt;Multiple large-scale studies have shown that a vegan diet—meaning one that excludes all animal products—correlates with a reduced risk of several cancers, including colon, breast, and prostate cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1550" data-end="1806"&gt;A 2022 study published in &lt;em data-start="1576" data-end="1590"&gt;BMC Medicine&lt;/em&gt;, which followed over 470,000 people in the UK, found that vegans had &lt;a href="https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12916-022-02256-w?.com"&gt;a 14% lower risk of cancer&lt;/a&gt; compared to meat-eaters. The difference was especially pronounced for hormone-related cancers like breast and prostate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1808" data-end="1954"&gt;Other studies have suggested that a vegan diet may reduce markers of inflammation and oxidative stress—two key contributors to cancer development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1956" data-end="2122"&gt;And it’s not just about removing animal products. It’s about replacing them with fiber-rich, nutrient-dense plant foods that flood the body with protective compounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2124" data-end="2191"&gt;As Dr. T. Colin Campbell, author of &lt;em data-start="2160" data-end="2177"&gt;The China Study&lt;/em&gt;, once said: “The closer people come to an all-plant, whole-food diet, the lower their risk for chronic disease—especially cancer.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-section-id="ppfc5" data-start="2314" data-end="2340"&gt;But what about protein?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2342" data-end="2411"&gt;That’s the first question I asked when I first considered this shift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2413" data-end="2637"&gt;For years, we’ve been trained to see meat as synonymous with protein. Never mind that lentils, quinoa, tofu, tempeh, beans, and even broccoli all contain plenty of protein—without the cholesterol and carcinogenic byproducts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2639" data-end="2816"&gt;The truth is, most people in developed countries consume more protein than they actually need—often at the expense of fiber, which the average person is &lt;em data-start="2792" data-end="2802"&gt;woefully&lt;/em&gt; deficient in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2639" data-end="2816"&gt;According to USDA data, adults in wealthier nations typically exceed protein requirements (around 103 g/day versus the ~56 g RDA), yet average fibre intake hovers around just 10–20 g/day—&lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/nutritionreviews/article/78/Supplement_1/29/5877740?&amp;amp;login=false"&gt;far below the recommended&lt;/a&gt; 25–30 g.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2818" data-end="3053"&gt;And guess what? Fiber doesn’t just help with digestion. It also plays a key role in binding and eliminating excess hormones and carcinogens from the body—something that’s especially important when we talk about breast and colon cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3055" data-end="3157"&gt;A plant-based diet gives you both: enough protein and more fiber than any meat-centric meal ever will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-section-id="kskko8" data-start="3159" data-end="3193"&gt;So why don’t more people do it?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3195" data-end="3231"&gt;Honestly? Because it’s inconvenient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3233" data-end="3361"&gt;Because it goes against tradition, against cravings, against that comforting childhood memory of grilled cheese and tomato soup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3363" data-end="3471"&gt;Because the idea of “giving up” animal products feels like a punishment, even when the benefits are glaring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3473" data-end="3632"&gt;We’re creatures of habit. We like our routines. We don’t want to read labels, explain our choices at dinner parties, or say no to Mom’s famous chicken pot pie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3634" data-end="3745"&gt;I’ve been there. I used to roll my eyes at vegans at work potlucks, thinking they were overcomplicating things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3747" data-end="3850"&gt;But then I started noticing how good they looked. Clear skin. Energy after lunch. No afternoon crashes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3852" data-end="3962"&gt;And when I started reading the research—not the headlines, but the actual studies—I couldn’t unsee what I saw.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3852" data-end="3962"&gt;Studies show that plant-based diets rich in whole foods and antioxidants significantly&lt;a href="https://www.learnskin.com/articles/plant-based-diet-and-what-it-does-for-skin-health/?.com"&gt; improve skin health&lt;/a&gt;, aiding conditions like acne, psoriasis, and eczema—likely through reduced inflammation and a healthier gut–skin axis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3852" data-end="3962"&gt;Similarly, clinical reviews confirm that a whole-food, plant-centric diet is linked to&lt;a href="https://farmingdale-observer.com/2025/02/05/a-large-study-in-the-u-s-and-europe-confirms-the-health-benefits-of-plant-based-diets/?.com"&gt; greater energy&lt;/a&gt;, better mood, and reduced post-lunch fatigue—thanks to steady blood sugar and anti-inflammatory effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3852" data-end="3962"&gt;So while it may feel inconvenient to change your habits or explain your choices, science was already changing—and confirming—what I was seeing in front of my eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-section-id="szagdv" data-start="3964" data-end="4012"&gt;My turning point wasn’t dramatic—it was quiet&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4014" data-end="4072"&gt;It didn’t happen after a diagnosis or a documentary binge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4074" data-end="4183"&gt;It was a slow unraveling. A breadcrumb trail of facts that started building into something I couldn’t ignore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4185" data-end="4440"&gt;I was flipping through a medical journal in a waiting room when I stumbled across a study linking dairy consumption to increased breast cancer risk. A week later, I read about the carcinogenic compounds formed when red meat is cooked at high temperatures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4442" data-end="4630"&gt;Then came the meta-analysis linking meat-heavy diets with cancer mortality. The one that showed a fourfold increase in cancer risk among middle-aged adults who ate a lot of animal protein.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4632" data-end="4662"&gt;And I thought—what am I doing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4664" data-end="4784"&gt;I’ve always been a believer in prevention. In showing up early to the problem instead of cleaning up after the wreckage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4786" data-end="4812"&gt;So I started cutting back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4814" data-end="4848"&gt;First meat. Then dairy. Then eggs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4850" data-end="4988"&gt;I didn’t become a different person overnight. I just became someone more interested in my long-term health than my short-term convenience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-section-id="1yq7kqb" data-start="4990" data-end="5027"&gt;The benefits weren’t just physical&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5029" data-end="5100"&gt;Within a few weeks, I felt lighter—not just in my body, but in my mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5102" data-end="5171"&gt;I had more energy during the day. Fewer stomach issues. Better sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5173" data-end="5227"&gt;But there was something else I hadn’t expected: peace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5229" data-end="5377"&gt;Because making that choice every day—to eat in a way that aligned with both the science &lt;em data-start="5317" data-end="5322"&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; my values—didn’t feel restrictive. It felt empowering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5379" data-end="5435"&gt;I wasn’t just avoiding disease. I was choosing vitality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5437" data-end="5581"&gt;And maybe that’s why this shift is so misunderstood. Because it gets lumped into a category of deprivation, when really, it’s about nourishment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-section-id="t7fko6" data-start="5583" data-end="5609"&gt;It’s not all or nothing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5611" data-end="5690"&gt;Let me be clear: you don’t need to label yourself a vegan to reap the benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5692" data-end="5758"&gt;This isn’t a purity contest. It’s about direction, not perfection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5760" data-end="5937"&gt;Even moving toward a more plant-based lifestyle—like eating vegan meals most of the week or replacing animal products where it’s easy—can have measurable impacts on your health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5939" data-end="6003"&gt;Plant-based diets reduce the risk of cancer by &lt;a href="https://www.pcrm.org/news/health-nutrition/plant-based-diets-follow-national-recommendations-reduce-inflammation?.com"&gt;supporting immune function&lt;/a&gt; and reducing inflammation and hormone levels associated with tumor growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6158" data-end="6234"&gt;That’s not niche advice. That’s rooted in decades of public health research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6236" data-end="6286"&gt;So no, you don’t have to become a tofu evangelist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6288" data-end="6366"&gt;But you &lt;em data-start="6296" data-end="6303"&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; start by swapping your morning omelet for oatmeal and berries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6368" data-end="6407"&gt;Or trying a bean chili instead of beef.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6409" data-end="6459"&gt;Or saying yes to that almond milk latte next time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6461" data-end="6481"&gt;Every choice counts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-section-id="nfbd1k" data-start="6483" data-end="6521"&gt;Cancer doesn’t wait for convenience&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6523" data-end="6650"&gt;We like to believe we have time. That we’ll change when things slow down, or after the holidays, or when we’re finally “ready.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6652" data-end="6730"&gt;But cancer doesn’t wait for the perfect moment. And neither should prevention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6732" data-end="6839"&gt;Our food choices are among the most powerful tools we have—and yet they’re often the last thing we address.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6841" data-end="6867"&gt;Not because we don’t care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6869" data-end="6923"&gt;But because we’re afraid of what change might cost us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6925" data-end="6998"&gt;Here’s what I’ve learned: the cost of not changing is often much greater.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-section-id="6w7uql" data-start="7000" data-end="7018"&gt;The bottom line&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7020" data-end="7057"&gt;I’m not here to tell you what to eat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7059" data-end="7152"&gt;I’m just inviting you to think bigger about what your diet is doing &lt;em data-start="7127" data-end="7132"&gt;for&lt;/em&gt; you—or against you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7154" data-end="7272"&gt;Veganism isn’t about rules or righteousness. It’s about reclaiming agency in a world that profits off our poor habits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7274" data-end="7439"&gt;It’s about recognizing that our bodies are capable of extraordinary healing—when we stop feeding them things that harm and start flooding them with things that help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7441" data-end="7462"&gt;And yes, it’s simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7464" data-end="7524"&gt;Maybe not emotionally simple. Maybe not logistically simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7526" data-end="7573"&gt;But biologically? Metabolically? Statistically?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7575" data-end="7655"&gt;It’s one of the simplest, most powerful levers we can pull for long-term health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7657" data-end="7696"&gt;So before you dismiss it, ask yourself:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7698" data-end="7779"&gt;What’s one small shift I could make today to give my body a better shot tomorrow?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7781" data-end="7798"&gt;Then start there.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;COLUMBIA, S.C. — The parents of 12-year-old Jaysen Carr, who &lt;a href="/article/news/local/brain-eating-amoeba-south-carolina/101-da55c2f0-ec50-4446-9353-d77c6c8fca0f" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;died earlier this month&lt;/a&gt; after contracting a rare &lt;a href="/article/news/health/jaysen-carr-identified-amoeba-death-lake-murray-suspected/101-ddc9dd05-eacf-4528-987d-97b55e2e84d1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;brain-eating amoeba&lt;/a&gt;, spoke publicly for the first time Tuesday, calling on state agencies and lawmakers to take action so that no other family experiences the pain they are now facing.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Jason should still be here,” Jaysen’s father, Clarence Carr, said during a news conference in Columbia. “There’s absolutely no excuse why he shouldn't be.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jaysen died on July 18 after being hospitalized for over a week and a half. His family said the infection came after he swam in Lake Murray over the July 4th holiday.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Carrs were joined by their attorney, Tyler Bailey, who said the family has not been contacted by any public health or environmental agency following their son's death. Bailey identified the cause of death as &lt;em id="isPasted"&gt;Naegleria fowleri&lt;/em&gt;, an amoeba that thrives in warm freshwater and is almost always fatal once symptoms begin.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Not one agency has reached out. There’s never been any testing of the water. No questioning of where Jaysen was swimming,” Bailey said. “We’re doing the work the agencies should have done.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jaysen’s father shared how the illness progressed. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We just assumed it was a regular migraine or headache,” Clarence Carr said. “But in hindsight, this was no headache. He was being attacked.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After returning from the lake, his son complained of a headache. “We gave him some Tylenol, and he said he felt better,” Clarence Carr said. “The next day he felt the same, so we went to the ER.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even after a hospital visit and antibiotics, Jaysen’s condition worsened. Eventually, doctors performed a spinal tap to test for meningitis. “We did disclose he had been in Lake Murray,” Clarence said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jaysen continued to fight despite the odds. "I've never witnessed anyone with the will to fight like my son, and I probably won't ever," Carr added. He refused to quit."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The South Carolina Department of Health is not required by law to be notified by hospitals nor is ordered to track this particular illness. Usually, that data is reported federally to the Centers for Disease Control. There's also no testing mechanism for the amoeba, which is naturally occurring and can be found in almost any freshwater lake or river. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The state already has a mechanism in place for testing our beaches,” Bailey said. “But our lakes are where the residents go, and there should not be a distinction between the two.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bailey said the family plans to push for legislative changes, including requiring routine testing of lakes for deadly pathogens, adding &lt;em&gt;Naegleria fowleri&lt;/em&gt; to the state’s list of reportable diseases, and issuing public safety advisories when water temperatures climb above 80 degrees.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We want the Department of Environmental Services to begin testing immediately,” Bailey said. “The same system we have for beaches can be duplicated for our lakes.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The family said Jaysen’s story highlights the importance of informed choices.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They say it’s rare,” Ebony Carr said. “But how rare is it when it happens to your child? That risk is too high.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bailey said water temperature and levels are already tracked at Lake Murray. He believes those systems can also be used to issue health advisories.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A simple message like, ‘Water temperatures are high, there may be a risk of amoeba exposure—please use caution,’ could save lives,” Bailey said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jaysen's family said he was a gifted athlete and musician, who was also involved in supporting students with special needs at his school.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He played three different divisions of baseball. He was in honor band. He loved unconditionally,” said his mother, Ebony Carr. “He either loved you or just didn’t know you yet.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Carrs say they are just beginning their advocacy journey. A state lawmaker, Rep. Jermaine Johnson, has expressed interest in filing legislation later this year. But the family says they want immediate action from public health and environmental agencies.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If we had known the risk, he wouldn’t have been in that lake,” Clarence Carr said. “We want other parents to know. We don’t want any other child to go through this.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The family is urging people to contact their lawmakers and agency leaders to demand changes that will protect South Carolina families.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Jaysen was a fighter,” Bailey said. “And now, his legacy will be a fight for something greater—safety, awareness, and change.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We are deeply saddened by the tragic loss of Jaysen Carr and extend our heartfelt condolences to his family and other loved ones during this incredibly difficult time.

&lt;p&gt;On October 20, 2023, health officials in the County of San Diego, California, put out &lt;a href="https://www.countynewscenter.com/health-officials-investigating-outbreak-linked-to-raw-milk/"&gt;a press release&lt;/a&gt; warning of a &lt;em&gt;Salmonella&lt;/em&gt; outbreak linked to raw (unpasteurized) milk. Such an outbreak is not particularly surprising; the reason the vast majority of milk is pasteurized (heated briefly to kill germs) is because milk can easily pick up nasty pathogens in the farmyard that can cause severe illnesses, particularly in children. It's the reason public health officials have long and strongly warned against consuming raw milk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time of the press release, officials in San Diego county had identified nine residents who had been sickened in the outbreak. Of those nine, three were children, and all three children had been hospitalized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On October 25, the county put out &lt;a href="https://www.countynewscenter.com/county-updates-raw-milk-salmonella-case-count-and-product-recall/"&gt;a second press release&lt;/a&gt;, reporting that the local case count had risen to 12, and the suspected culprit—&lt;a href="https://www.marlerblog.com/files/2024/07/fdbFrRFL3n.pdf"&gt;raw milk and raw cream from Raw Farm LLC&lt;/a&gt;—had been recalled. The same day, Orange County's health department put out its own &lt;a href="https://www.ochealthinfo.com/press/salmonella-infections-orange-county-linked-raw-milk-raw-farm-llc"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;, reporting seven cases among its residents, including one in a 1-year-old infant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both counties noted that the California Department of Public Health (CDPH), which had posted the recall notice, was working on the outbreak, too. But, it doesn't appear that CDPH ever followed up with its own press release about the outbreak. The CDPH did post tweets related to the outbreak: &lt;a href="https://x.com/CAPublicHealth/status/1717631849558913229"&gt;one on October 26, 2023,&lt;/a&gt; announced the recall; &lt;a href="https://x.com/CAPublicHealth/status/1730300684849795213"&gt;a second on November 30, 2023,&lt;/a&gt; noted "a recent outbreak" of &lt;em&gt;Salmonella &lt;/em&gt;cases from raw milk&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;but linked to general information about the risks of raw milk; and &lt;a href="https://x.com/CAPublicHealth/status/1732807204430921907"&gt;a third on December 7, 2023,&lt;/a&gt; linked to general information again with no mention of the outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that seems to be the extent of the information at the time. For anyone paying attention, it might have seemed like the end of the story. But, according to the final outbreak investigation report—&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7427a1.htm"&gt;produced by CDPH and local health officials&lt;/a&gt;—the outbreak actually ran from September 2023 to March 2024, spanned five states, and sickened at least 171 people. That report was released last week, on July 24, 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On October 20, 2023, health officials in the County of San Diego, California, put out &lt;a href="https://www.countynewscenter.com/health-officials-investigating-outbreak-linked-to-raw-milk/"&gt;a press release&lt;/a&gt; warning of a &lt;em&gt;Salmonella&lt;/em&gt; outbreak linked to raw (unpasteurized) milk. Such an outbreak is not particularly surprising; the reason the vast majority of milk is pasteurized (heated briefly to kill germs) is because milk can easily pick up nasty pathogens in the farmyard that can cause severe illnesses, particularly in children. It's the reason public health officials have long and strongly warned against consuming raw milk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time of the press release, officials in San Diego County had identified nine residents who had been sickened in the outbreak. Of those nine, three were children, and all three children had been hospitalized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On October 25, the county put out &lt;a href="https://www.countynewscenter.com/county-updates-raw-milk-salmonella-case-count-and-product-recall/"&gt;a second press release&lt;/a&gt;, reporting that the local case count had risen to 12, and the suspected culprit—&lt;a href="https://www.marlerblog.com/files/2024/07/fdbFrRFL3n.pdf"&gt;raw milk and raw cream from Raw Farm LLC&lt;/a&gt;—had been recalled. The same day, Orange County's health department put out its own &lt;a href="https://www.ochealthinfo.com/press/salmonella-infections-orange-county-linked-raw-milk-raw-farm-llc"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;, reporting seven cases among its residents, including one in a 1-year-old infant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both counties noted that the California Department of Public Health (CDPH), which had posted the recall notice, was working on the outbreak, too. But it doesn't appear that CDPH ever followed up with its own press release about the outbreak. The CDPH did write social media posts related to the outbreak: &lt;a href="https://x.com/CAPublicHealth/status/1717631849558913229"&gt;One on October 26, 2023,&lt;/a&gt; announced the recall; &lt;a href="https://x.com/CAPublicHealth/status/1730300684849795213"&gt;a second on November 30, 2023,&lt;/a&gt; noted "a recent outbreak" of &lt;em&gt;Salmonella &lt;/em&gt;cases from raw milk&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;but linked to general information about the risks of raw milk; and &lt;a href="https://x.com/CAPublicHealth/status/1732807204430921907"&gt;a third on December 7, 2023,&lt;/a&gt; linked to general information again with no mention of the outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that seems to be the extent of the information at the time. For anyone paying attention, it might have seemed like the end of the story. But according to the final outbreak investigation report—&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7427a1.htm"&gt;produced by CDPH and local health officials&lt;/a&gt;—the outbreak actually ran from September 2023 to March 2024, spanned five states, and sickened at least 171 people. That report was released last week, on July 24, 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;In late June, the Scientific Advisory Group for the Origins of Novel Pathogens (SAGO), a group of independent experts convened by the World Health Organization (WHO), &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/independent-assessment-of-the-origins-of-sars-cov-2-from-the-scientific-advisory-group-for-the-origins-of-novel-pathogens"&gt;published an assessment&lt;/a&gt; of the origins of COVID.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report concluded that although we don’t know conclusively where the virus that caused the pandemic came from: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a zoonotic origin with spillover from animals to humans is currently considered the best supported hypothesis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SAGO did not find scientific evidence to support “a deliberate manipulation of the virus in a laboratory and subsequent biosafety breach”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This follows a series of &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/who-convened-global-study-of-origins-of-sars-cov-2-china-part"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-virology-093022-013037"&gt;research papers&lt;/a&gt; since the early days of the pandemic that have reached similar conclusions: COVID most likely emerged from an infected animal at the Huanan market in Wuhan, and was not the result of a lab leak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But conspiracy theories about COVID’s origins persist. And this is hampering our ability to prevent the next pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Attacks on our research&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As experts in the emergence of viruses, we published a peer-reviewed paper in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0820-9"&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/a&gt; in 2020 on the origins of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like SAGO, we evaluated several hypotheses for how a novel coronavirus could have emerged in Wuhan in late 2019. We concluded the virus very likely emerged through a natural spillover from animals – a “zoonosis” – caused by the unregulated wildlife trade in China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since then, our paper has become a focal point of &lt;a href="https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/2025/03/12/covid-likely-came-from-a-lab-and-it-matters-enormously-to-prevent-another-pandemic/"&gt;conspiracy theories&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://oversight.house.gov/hearing/investigating-the-proximal-origin-of-a-cover-up/"&gt;political attacks&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea SARS-CoV-2 might have &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/06/03/opinion/covid-lab-leak.html"&gt;originated in a laboratory&lt;/a&gt; is not, in itself, a conspiracy theory. Like many scientists, we &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/covid-19/scientists-exactly-zero-evidence-covid-19-came-lab"&gt;considered that possibility seriously&lt;/a&gt;. And we still do, although evidence hasn’t emerged to support it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the public discourse around the origin of the pandemic has increasingly been shaped by &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/lab-leak-true-origins-of-covid-19/"&gt;political agendas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/08/opinion/covid-fauci-hearings-health.html"&gt;conspiratorial narratives&lt;/a&gt;. Some of this has &lt;a href="https://www.aei.org/op-eds/the-proximal-origin-of-a-scientific-fraud/"&gt;targeted our work&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/lab-leak-proponents-rutgers-accused-defaming-and-intimidating-covid-19-origin"&gt;vilified experts&lt;/a&gt; who have studied this question in a data-driven manner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A common conspiracy theory claims &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/16/opinion/covid-pandemic-lab-leak.html"&gt;senior officials pressured us&lt;/a&gt; to promote the “&lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/lab-leak-true-origins-of-covid-19/"&gt;preferred&lt;/a&gt;” hypothesis of a natural origin, while silencing the possibility of a lab leak. Some conspiracy theories even propose &lt;a href="https://theintercept.com/2023/07/21/covid-origin-nih-lab-leak/"&gt;we were rewarded&lt;/a&gt; with grant funding in exchange. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These &lt;a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2023/03/scicheck-no-evidence-scientists-received-grant-for-changing-opinion-on-pandemic-origins-contrary-to-claims/"&gt;narratives are false&lt;/a&gt;. They &lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2021133117"&gt;ignore&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abj0016"&gt;dismiss&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/06/03/opinion/covid-lab-leak.html"&gt;misrepresent&lt;/a&gt; the extensive body of evidence on the origin of the pandemic. Instead, they rely on selective quoting from private discussions and a distorted portrayal of the scientific process and the &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article/38/12/5211/6353034"&gt;motivations of scientists&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-react-class="BlueskyEmbed" data-react-props='{"uri":"at://did:plc:univ47kzorwxjih3lqzrnwmv/app.bsky.feed.post/3lslxgkd72s2o"}'&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;So what does the evidence tell us?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the five years since our Nature Medicine paper, a substantial body of new evidence has emerged that has deepened our understanding of how SARS-CoV-2 most likely emerged through a natural spillover.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In early 2020, the case for a zoonotic origin was already compelling. Much-discussed features of the virus &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867421009910"&gt;are found in related coronaviruses&lt;/a&gt; and carry signatures of natural evolution. The genome of SARS-CoV-2 showed no signs of laboratory manipulation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The multi-billion-dollar &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/china-cracking-down-its-wildlife-trade-it-enough"&gt;wildlife trade&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.actasia.org/news/actasias-fur-report-update-2022-2023/"&gt;fur farming industry&lt;/a&gt; in China regularly moves high-risk animals, &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(22)00194-5"&gt;frequently infected with viruses&lt;/a&gt;, into dense urban centres.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s believed that SARS-CoV-1, the virus responsible for the SARS outbreak, emerged this way in 2002 in &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140673603146302/fulltext"&gt;China’s Guangdong province&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, detailed analyses of epidemiological data show the earliest known COVID cases &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abp8715"&gt;clustered around&lt;/a&gt; the Huanan live-animal market in Wuhan, in the Hubei province, &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2020-DON229"&gt;in December 2019&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Multiple independent data sources, including early &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abm4454"&gt;hospitalisations&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(21)00991-0"&gt;excess pneumonia deaths&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666606521000031"&gt;antibody studies&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0195670121000463"&gt;infections among health-care workers&lt;/a&gt; indicate COVID first spread in the district where the market is located. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abp8715"&gt;2022 study&lt;/a&gt; we and other experts showed that environmental samples positive for SARS-CoV-2 clustered in the section of the market where wildlife was sold. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(24)00901-2"&gt;2024 follow-up study&lt;/a&gt; we demonstrated those same samples contained genetic material from susceptible animals – including raccoon dogs and civets – on cages, carts, and other surfaces used to hold and transport them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This doesn’t prove infected animals were the source. But it’s precisely what we would expect if the market was where the virus first spilled over. And it’s contrary to what would be expected from a lab leak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These and all &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abp8337"&gt;other independent lines of evidence&lt;/a&gt; point to the Huanan market as the &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.add8384"&gt;early epicentre&lt;/a&gt; of the COVID pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Hindering preparedness for the next pandemic&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speculation and conspiracy theories around the origin of COVID have &lt;a href="https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/jvi.00089-23"&gt;undermined trust in science&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_balance"&gt;false balance&lt;/a&gt; between lab leak and zoonotic origin theories assigned by some commentators has added fuel to the conspiracy fire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-02981-z"&gt;anti-science agenda&lt;/a&gt;, stemming in part &lt;a href="https://faseb.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1096/fba.2023-00032"&gt;from COVID origin conspiracy theories&lt;/a&gt;, is being used to help justify deep cuts to funding for biomedical research, public health and global aid. These areas are essential for pandemic preparedness. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the United States this has meant major cuts to the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/08/hhs-mass-firings"&gt;US Centers for Disease Control&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01397-1"&gt;National Institutes of Health&lt;/a&gt;, the closure of the &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c307zq8ppj6o"&gt;US Agency for International Development&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2501790"&gt;withdrawal from the WHO&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ajtmh.org/view/journals/tpmd/111/1/article-p216.xml"&gt;Undermining trust in science&lt;/a&gt; and public health institutions also hinders the development and uptake of &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goats-and-soda/2025/03/28/g-s1-56881/vaccines-gavi-usaid-rubio"&gt;life-saving vaccines and other medical interventions&lt;/a&gt;. This leaves us more vulnerable to future pandemics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The amplification of conspiracy theories about the origin of COVID has promoted a dangerously flawed understanding of pandemic risk. The idea that a researcher discovered or engineered a pandemic virus, accidentally infected themselves, and unknowingly sparked a global outbreak (in exactly the type of setting where natural spillovers are known to occur) defies logic. It also detracts from the significant risk posed by the wildlife trade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast, the &lt;a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-virology-093022-013037"&gt;evidence-based conclusion&lt;/a&gt; that the COVID pandemic most likely began with a virus jumping from animals to humans highlights the very real risk we increasingly face. This is &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abn2222"&gt;how pandemics start&lt;/a&gt;, and it will happen again. But we’re dismantling our ability to stop it or prepare for it.&lt;/p&gt;

While it doesn’t imply that people with psychiatric diagnoses are more prone to hate, the overlap suggests that online hate speech may cultivate traits like low empathy and emotional instability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Posts from communities for personality disorders had the most linguistic similarity to hate speech groups. These findings may inform future interventions by adapting therapeutic strategies typically used for managing such disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speech Overlap:&lt;/strong&gt; Hate speech communities shared linguistic traits with Cluster B personality disorder communities.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No Diagnostic Link:&lt;/strong&gt; The study does not claim individuals with mental illness are more hateful—only that language patterns are similar.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Therapeutic Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; Insights could guide new strategies for countering hate speech using mental health approaches.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;PLOS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new analysis suggests that posts in hate speech communities on the social media website Reddit share speech-pattern similarities with posts in Reddit communities for certain psychiatric disorders. Dr. Andrew William Alexander and Dr. Hongbin Wang of Texas A&amp;amp;M University, U.S., present these findings July 29&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; in the open-access journal &lt;em&gt;PLOS Digital Health&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ubiquity of social media has raised concerns about its role in spreading hate speech and misinformation, potentially contributing to prejudice, discrimination and real-world violence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-112000"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/hate-speech-mental-health-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/hate-speech-mental-health-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/hate-speech-mental-health-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/hate-speech-mental-health-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/hate-speech-mental-health-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/hate-speech-mental-health-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/hate-speech-mental-health-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/hate-speech-mental-health-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain and online forum chat bubbles." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/hate-speech-mental-health-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/hate-speech-mental-health-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/hate-speech-mental-health-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/hate-speech-mental-health-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/hate-speech-mental-health-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/hate-speech-mental-health-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/hate-speech-mental-health-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The authors suggest their findings could help inform new strategies to combat online hate speech and misinformation, such as treating them using elements of therapy developed for psychiatric disorders. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior research has uncovered associations between certain personality traits and the act of posting online hate speech or misinformation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, whether any associations exist between psychological wellbeing and online hate speech or misinformation has been unclear. To help clarify, Alexander and Wang used artificial intelligence tools to analyze posts from 54 Reddit communities relevant to hate speech, misinformation, psychiatric disorders, or, for neutral comparison, none of those categories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Selected groups included r/ADHD, a community for discussing attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, r/NoNewNormal, dedicated to COVID-19 misinformation, and r/Incels, a community banned for hate speech.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers used the large-language model GPT3 to convert thousands of posts from these communities into numerical representations capturing the posts’ underlying speech patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These representations, or “embeddings,” could then be analyzed through machine-learning techniques and a mathematical approach known as topological data analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This analysis showed that speech patterns in hate speech communities were similar to speech patterns in communities for complex post-traumatic stress disorder, and borderline, narcissistic and antisocial personality disorders. Links between misinformation and psychiatric disorders were less clear, but with some connections to anxiety disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, these findings do not at all suggest that people with psychiatric disorders are more prone to hate speech or misinformation. For one, there was no way of knowing if the analyzed posts were made by people actually diagnosed with disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More research is needed to understand the links and explore such possibilities as hate speech communities mimicking speech patterns seen in psychiatric disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors suggest their findings could help inform new strategies to combat online hate speech and misinformation, such as treating them using elements of therapy developed for psychiatric disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors add, “Our results show that the speech patterns of those participating in hate speech online have strong underlying similarities with those participating in communities for individuals with certain psychiatric disorders. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Chief among these are the Cluster B personality disorders: Narcissistic Personality Disorder, Antisocial Personality Disorder, and Borderline Personality Disorder. These disorders are generally known for either lack of empathy/regard towards the wellbeing of others, or difficulties managing anger and relationships with others.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alexander notes, “While we looked for similarities between misinformation and psychiatric disorder speech patterns as well, the connections we found were far weaker. Besides a potential anxiety component, I think it is safe to say at this point in time that most people buying into or spreading misinformation are actually quite healthy from a psychiatric standpoint.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alexander concludes, “I want to emphasize that these results do not mean that individuals with psychiatric conditions are more likely to engage in hate speech. Instead, it suggests that people who engage in hate speech online tend to have similar speech patterns to those with cluster B personality disorders. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It could be that the lack of empathy for others fostered by hate speech influences people over time and causes them to exhibit traits similar to those seen in Cluster B personality disorders, at least with regards to the target of their hate speech. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While further studies would be needed to confirm this, I think it is a good indicator that exposing ourselves to these types of communities for long periods of time is not healthy and can make us less empathetic towards others.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;AWA was a Burroughs Wellcome Fund Scholar supported by a Burroughs Wellcome Fund Physician Scientist Institutional Award (G-1020069) to the Texas A&amp;amp;M University Academy of Physician Scientists (https://www.bwfund.org/funding-opportunities/biomedical-sciences/physician-scientist-institutional-award/grant-recipients/).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The funders had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript.

In this study, we collected thousands of posts from carefully selected communities on the social media site Reddit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We then utilized OpenAI’s GPT3 to derive embeddings of these posts, which are high-dimensional real-numbered vectors that presumably represent the hidden semantics of posts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We then performed various machine-learning classifications based on these embeddings in order to identify potential similarities between hate speech/misinformation speech patterns and those of various communities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, a topological data analysis (TDA) was applied to the embeddings to obtain a visual map connecting online hate speech, misinformation, various psychiatric disorders, and general mental health.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 29 Jul 2025 19:41:41 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigAFBVV95cUxOUF9zeGkzaE5CX0VyR0ZxbU80aTNJalMwR0VOd3BPdnNsc2VwckRTNHVFYUM2SWExdjdvVFhXeHd0cUFpZ1B4OUZSd2t3bkpSdHllc0lKQmFpMTJKWmU4NFRzQ3pCY2RLeUVoRG52c0dVc3lUb1pSQVc4Tk1RQjlJQw</guid></item><item><title>1亿美国人服用的最常见的止痛药可能会使您更容易作弊和吸毒-每日邮报</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The world’s most popular pain reliever may cause people to take more risks and reduce fear around risky decisions, leading to bolder behavior. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nearly a quarter of Americans take acetaminophen, known around the world as paracetamol, weekly and data estimates 100million Americans take it annually. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Recently, scientists &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14567929/Experts-issue-warning-worlds-common-painkiller-bizarre-unexpected-effect.html"&gt;have been investigating&lt;/a&gt; how it might influence &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14567929/Experts-issue-warning-worlds-common-painkiller-bizarre-unexpected-effect.html"&gt;people's behavior&lt;/a&gt; on a larger scale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To measure the effects of acetaminophen - the active ingredient in Tylenol -researchers from &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/ohio/index.html" id="mol-e57f0750-6c7b-11f0-b899-97c7884526fb"&gt;Ohio&lt;/a&gt; State University had over 500 college students participate in a risk-taking game. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some participants received a normal dose of acetaminophen, 1,000 mg, mirroring standard over-the-counter use, while others received a placebo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the game, they inflated a virtual balloon to earn cash rewards. If it burst, they lost everything. The acetaminophen group pumped more aggressively and popped more balloons, suggesting they cared less about the risk of losing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In follow-up surveys, those on acetaminophen rated activities like bungee jumping or gambling as less risky than the placebo group, but only when the scenarios were emotionally charged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers warned that while the changes in risk-taking are subtle, they’re worth watching, mainly because acetaminophen is found in over 600 medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Acetaminophen is the active pain reliever in Tylenol&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study suggested that acetaminophen’s effect on risk-taking behavior likely goes beyond just dulling fear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The over-the-counter drug may also alter deeper cognitive and neurological processes, including by turning off the brain’s alarm signals for danger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It may also reduce awareness of one’s mistakes, and quiet a part of the brain that gives someone a gut feeling that danger is close.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Baldwin Way, co-author of the 2020 study and associate professor of psychology at Ohio State University, said: ‘Acetaminophen seems to make people feel less negative emotion when they consider risky activities – they just don’t feel as scared.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Way conducted three experiments in his report, published in the journal &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://academic.oup.com/scan/article/15/7/725/5897711?login=false"&gt;Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Across these studies, 545 undergraduate students took part in a task developed in 2002 that is often used by researchers to measure risk-taking behavior: inflating a balloon in exchange for cash rewards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They can stop at any time, bank the money, and move on to the next balloon. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The people who took acetaminophen pumped more and more, despite the risk of the balloon popping and losing all their money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the balloon-popping game, people who took acetaminophen pumped 32 times compared to 29 times in the placebo group, and had more bursts, with 8.5 in the acetaminophen group compared to 7.9 in the placebo group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Nearly a quarter of Americans take acetaminophen - the active ingredient in Tylenol - weekly and data estimates 100million Americans take it annually (stock photo)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above compares results of people who took acetaminophen versus those who were given the placebo in risk-taking games&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Way said: ‘If you’re risk-averse, you may pump a few times and then decide to cash out because you don’t want the balloon to burst and lose your money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘But for those who are on acetaminophen, as the balloon gets bigger, we believe they have less anxiety and less negative emotion about how big the balloon is getting and the possibility of it bursting.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Previous research by Dr Way on the effects of acetaminophen on people’s behavior has suggested that it dulls positive and negative emotions, including hurt feelings, distress over another person’s suffering, and their joy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He posited in his latest research that the medicine reduces anticipatory anxiety. Typically, as the balloon expands, people feel growing anxiety about it bursting, making them stop pumping earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The drug may blunt this nervous feeling, though, causing people to take more risks.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And according to Dr Way, ‘increased risk-taking could have important effects on society.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;With a dampened feeling of fear, anxiety and negative emotions, people may be more likely to partake in risky behavior, including cheating on partners, drinking excessively and taking drugs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

          &lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Two Gut Bacteria May Hold the Key to Multiple Sclerosis—But Don't Get Too Excited Yet&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nearly a million Americans wake up each day with multiple sclerosis, a disease that turns their own immune system against their brain and spinal cord. For decades, researchers have suspected that something in the gut might trigger this autoimmune assault. Now, a clever twin study has fingered two specific bacterial culprits: &lt;em&gt;Eisenbergiella tayi&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Lachnoclostridium&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research, &lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2419689122" target="_blank"&gt;published in PNAS&lt;/a&gt;, used 81 pairs of identical twins where only one sibling had MS. It's an elegant approach—same genes, different outcomes. The German-led team found these two bacteria lurking in higher numbers in the small intestines of the twins with MS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But here's where it gets interesting. They didn't stop at correlation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From Gut to Brain: The Mouse Test&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The researchers transplanted gut bacteria from the twins into specially bred mice prone to MS-like disease. The results were stark: mice getting bacteria from MS twins developed paralysis within twelve weeks. Those getting microbes from healthy twins stayed mobile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Female mice were hit harder—matching the real-world pattern where &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/multiple-sclerosis/facts-statistics-infographic" target="_blank"&gt;women are three times more likely&lt;/a&gt; to develop MS than men.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;E. tayi&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Lachnoclostridium&lt;/em&gt; belong to the Lachnospiraceae family, typically harmless fiber-digesters. What makes these two troublemakers different isn't clear yet, but they can feast on mucus when fiber runs low—potentially thinning the intestinal barrier and exposing immune cells to inflammatory signals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Bigger Picture: MS by the Numbers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Multiple sclerosis affects &lt;a href="https://atlasofms.org/" target="_blank"&gt;2.9 million people worldwide&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/multiple-sclerosis/facts-statistics-infographic" target="_blank"&gt;nearly one million in the US alone&lt;/a&gt;. It typically strikes in the prime of life—average diagnosis age is 32—when people are building careers and starting families.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The disease is unpredictable. About 85% start with relapsing-remitting MS, where symptoms flare and fade. Without treatment, roughly half progress to secondary progressive MS within a decade, where disability steadily accumulates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Current treatments can slow progression but can't cure the disease or reverse damage. That's why finding specific bacterial triggers matters—it offers a concrete target instead of trying to re-engineer the entire gut ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reality Check: Breakthrough or False Dawn?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This isn't the first time researchers have linked gut bacteria to MS. &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28893994/" target="_blank"&gt;Previous studies&lt;/a&gt; found similar patterns with different bacterial players. The field is littered with promising leads that didn't pan out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several red flags warrant caution:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The mouse problem&lt;/strong&gt;: MS-like disease in mice isn't MS in humans. Countless therapies that worked in rodents have failed in clinical trials. The immune systems are different, the gut environments are different, and lab mice live in sterile bubbles unlike the microbial chaos of human guts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sample size&lt;/strong&gt;: 81 twin pairs sounds impressive, but it's still relatively small for drawing broad conclusions about a complex disease affecting millions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Causation vs. correlation&lt;/strong&gt;: Even with the mouse experiments, we can't be certain these bacteria &lt;em&gt;cause&lt;/em&gt; MS rather than simply thriving in the inflammatory environment MS creates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The replication challenge&lt;/strong&gt;: Independent teams need to confirm these findings in different populations. Science is littered with exciting results that couldn't be reproduced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Path Forward&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this research holds up, the therapeutic possibilities are intriguing. Targeted antibiotics, designer bacteriophages, or engineered probiotics could potentially eliminate the troublesome bacteria while leaving beneficial microbes alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Early trials of high-fiber diets have shown modest benefits in MS patients—possibly by keeping mucus-eating bacteria occupied with safer food sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But any gut-targeted therapy will need to navigate the complex ecosystem of beneficial bacteria that support vitamin synthesis and immune regulation. Broad-spectrum antibiotics sometimes worsen autoimmune diseases, highlighting the delicate balance involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Bottom Line&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This twin study represents solid, methodical science. The researchers controlled for genetics, used functional testing in mice, and identified specific bacterial species rather than vague "microbiome imbalances."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it's one study, using mouse models, with a modest sample size. The history of MS research is filled with promising leads that ultimately led nowhere. Remember when researchers were convinced MS was caused by a virus? Or when they thought it was purely genetic?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The smart money says this research will spawn follow-up studies, some confirming the findings, others contradicting them. That's how science works—messy, incremental, often disappointing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the million Americans living with MS, this offers hope for new treatment approaches. But it's not a breakthrough yet—it's a promising lead that needs years of additional research to prove its worth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The gut-brain connection in autoimmune disease is real. Whether these two bacterial species are key players or bit characters in a much larger drama remains to be seen.&lt;/p&gt;

Fewer than 10 cases are reported each year in the U.S., but &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://apnews.com/article/health-52f7e46efac248b6998edee89e052b27"&gt;almost all are fatal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Here are some things to know about the amoeba, its latest victim and other dangers on freshwater lakes:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The amoeba's scientific name is Naegleria fowleri and it is most dangerous in very warm water, including in lakes and rivers in the southern part of the U.S. and other places with hot, sometimes dry summers like Pakistan and Australia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The amoeba enters the brain through the olfactory nerve in the nose. Once inside, it causes an infection called primary amebic meningoencephalitis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Symptoms start as a fairly standard headache and nausea. By the time the pain becomes severe, it is almost always too late to save the infected person. Of the 167 cases reported in the U.S. between 1962 and 2024, only four people have survived, according to the &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.cdc.gov/naegleria/media/pdfs/naegleria_factsheet508c.pdf"&gt;U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;. Most of the deaths happened within five days of getting sick, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Jaysen Carr went swimming at Lake Murray about 15 miles (24 kilometers) west of Columbia over the July Fourth weekend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;He got sick several days later and died on July 18.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;His father and mother had never heard of the amoeba before a doctor in tears told them what tests of his spinal fluid had found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Clarence Carr said he was shocked to learn South Carolina, like most other U.S. states, has no law requiring public reporting of deaths or infections from the amoeba. The lake wasn’t closed and no water testing was performed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;“My son was a very smart individual. If he had one warning, he would have thought swimming in the lake was a bad idea,” Carr said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The amoeba is fairly common and is most dangerous when the water is warm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Researchers are trying to figure out why the infections are so rare. Some people have been found to have had antibodies, signalling they may have survived exposure. Others may die from brain swelling and other problems without the amoeba ever being detected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;“My son lost his life swimming. We assumed it was safe,” Carr said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The amoeba can show up in hot springs, rivers and, on rare occasions, in tap water. That’s why doctors recommend using sterile water for cleaning nasal passages with a neti pot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The only way to be completely safe is to not swim in lakes or rivers and, if you do, keep your head above water. Pinching your nose or using nose clips when diving or swimming can keep water out of your nose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;There are other dangers in swimming in lakes and rivers instead of pools, where chemicals can kill off dangerous bacteria and other organisms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;A mouthful of water could contain E.coli bacteria. And while the bacteria normally live in the intestines of healthy people and animals, some strains can cause a range of conditions, including urinary tract infection, cystitis, intestinal infection and vomiting, with the worst cases leading to life-threatening blood poisoning, according to &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/e-coli/symptoms-causes/syc-20372058"&gt;the Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Algae can also cause illnesses. Cyanobacteria — also referred to as blue-green algae — are plant-like organisms that live in water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The algae can look like foam, scum, mats, or paint on the surface of the water and can grow underneath it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The organisms can quickly grow out of control, or “bloom," in warm weather, helped along by excessive nutrients in fertilizers and pet waste carried along by stormwater.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC eTIW sUzSN "&gt;Some of the algae produce toxins that can cause symptoms including skin irritation, stomach cramps, vomiting, nausea, diarrhea, fever, sore throat, headache, muscle and joint pain, mouth blisters, seizures, and acute liver damage, according to the &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.cdc.gov/harmful-algal-blooms/about/index.html#:~:text=Algae%20and%20cyanobacteria%20(also%20called,make%20people%20and%20animals%20sick."&gt;U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>ABC News</author><pubDate>Tue, 29 Jul 2025 18:41:08 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinwFBVV95cUxOeE5ac0RHSmQtcGt2ajBXMUVNYV8zMFJfRUVOZVZ3Yjc2cERmeUNYSkl4OWRHaEFrcXU2RFh0VzhyNWM2Z2l6TW1JRVFJR2NWTy1JMU1Da3VqcUxLdkN5MnNxWC14MkZtVGFaTWVTZ3RQNlZFVkVQUlo5dVpzZ0NfS3N2WUZnZ3paSzNyaTR3M0VaYm12eXE5aDRYcG5mOHc</guid></item><item><title>在南卡罗来纳湖上吃脑变形虫杀死他们的男孩后，父母希望得到更多警告- VINnews</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMixwFBVV95cUxNT2lfRzJSZnRmSGl5ZnBPdlIxdUhFUndVSFNUUkVGV3NTZktGVzBQNTVqLWREejlITDZQR000blAxMFhPalZxRWtUMl9Qc1ItZWhybW1Gamo2VzRKTVA4MlJVY05NeThwNF9VX2R2TnZOSWRjT1Z6M0ZzQldrcFBCallsQjVSRDBhdHdjcWpneWRlVEZNN1ZoS1FmUmk5Y3lKcjV4Q3BkZFhPbnF3dmJ3RmlwX09fbWo4bG1PWlZBOWNFRU1vSENr?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="td-post-content tagdiv-type"&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) — Two weeks after Jaysen Carr spent the Fourth of July swimming and riding on a boat on one of South Carolina’s most popular lakes, he was dead from an amoeba that lives in the warm water and entered his brain through his nose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;strong class="whatsapp-promotion-mobile"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His parents had no clue the brain-eating amoeba, whose scientific name is Naegleria fowleri, even existed in Lake Murray, just 15 miles (24 kilometers) west of Columbia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They found out when a doctor, in tears, told them the diagnosis after what seemed like a fairly regular headache and nausea took a serious turn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jaysen, 12, fought for a week before dying on July 18, making him one of about 160 people known to have died from the amoeba in the U.S. in the past 60 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As they grieve their son, the boy’s parents said they were stunned to learn South Carolina, like most other U.S. states, has no law requiring public reporting of deaths or infections from the amoeba. The lake wasn’t closed and no water testing was performed. If they hadn’t spoken up, they wonder if anyone would have even known what happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I can’t believe we don’t have our son. The result of him being a child was losing his life. That does not sit well. And I am terrified it will happen to someone else,” Clarence Carr told The Associated Press as his wife sat beside him, hugging a stuffed tiger that had a recording of their middle child’s heartbeat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best Fourth of July ever&lt;br&gt;
Jaysen loved sports. He played football and baseball. He loved people, too. As soon as he met you, he was your friend, his father said. He was smart enough to have skipped a grade in school and to play several instruments in his middle school band in Columbia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He either loved you or he just didn’t know you,” his father said. “He was the type of person who could go to a jump park and five minutes later say, ‘This is my friend James.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Friends invited Jaysen and his family for the Fourth of July holiday weekend on the lake, where Jaysen spent hours swimming, fishing and riding on an inner tube that was being pulled by a boat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Mom and Dad, that was the best Fourth of July I’ve ever had,” Clarence Carr remembered his son telling him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A headache suddenly gets worse&lt;br&gt;
A few days later, Jaysen’s head started to hurt. Pain relievers helped. But the next day the headache got worse and he started throwing up. He told the emergency room doctors exactly where he was hurting. But soon he started to get disoriented and lethargic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amoeba was in his brain, already causing an infection and destroying brain tissue. It entered through his nose as water was forced deep into his nasal passages, possibly from one of the times Jaysen jumped into the water. It then traveled along his olfactory nerve into his brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amoeba caused an infection called primary amebic meningoencephalitis. Fewer than 10 people a year get it in the U.S., and over 95% of them die, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amoeba is fairly common. Researchers are still trying to figure out why the infections are so rare. Some people have been found to have had antibodies, signalling they may have survived exposure. Others may die from brain swelling and other problems without the amoeba ever being detected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amoeba is found in warm water and the infection is almost always fatal&lt;br&gt;
The amoeba becomes dangerous in very warm water and for years has been seen almost exclusively in the summer in the southern part of the country. But a few recent cases have popped up in Maryland, Indiana and Minnesota, scientists said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CDC said 167 cases of the infection have been reported in the U.S. between 1962 and 2024, and only four people have survived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boys seem most susceptible, but researchers don’t know if that is simply because they are more likely to jump and dive into the water or play in sediment at the bottom of lakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amoeba can show up in hot springs, rivers and, on rare occasions, in tap water. That’s why doctors recommend using sterile water for cleaning nasal passages with a neti pot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only way to be completely safe is to not swim in lakes or rivers and, if you do, keep your head above water. Pinching your nose or using nose clips when diving or swimming can keep water out of your nose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parents want others to know the danger from the brain-eating amoeba&lt;br&gt;
As he sat in an intensive care hospital room with his son, Clarence Carr couldn’t help but think of all the people on the lake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He wondered if any of them had any clue about the microscopic danger in that water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There are entire families out there on pontoon boats, jumping off, just like our kids were having the time of their lives,” he said. “It very well could be their last moments, and they are unaware of it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Alzheimer’s Association, in its first clinical guidelines on blood biomarker testing, said Tuesday that tests that have over 90% sensitivity (ability to identify positive results) and 90% specificity (ability to identify negative results) can be used instead of current diagnostic methods like PET scans and cerebrospinal fluid tests.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The group said that tests that have over 90% sensitivity and 75% specificity can be used to triage patients, meaning negative results rule can rule out Alzheimer’s with high probability but positive results should be confirmed with the standard diagnostic methods, given that these blood tests have a higher likelihood of false positives.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The authors stressed that the guidelines should not be considered a substitute for a full clinical evaluation and that they apply only to people who are in the care of specialists and have already been confirmed to have cognitive impairment. The authors also noted that there’s wide variability in the blood tests on the market and that many do not meet the accuracy thresholds.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They did not endorse specific tests, but reviewed dozens that measured biomarkers such as pTau217, the ratio of pTau217 to non-pTau217, and the ratio of Aβ42 to Aβ40. They will post a chart of the various tests and their accuracy in an online portal that will be continually updated, said Rebecca Edelmayer, one of the guidelines’ authors and vice president of scientific engagement at the Alzheimer’s Association. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The approval of new Alzheimer’s drugs in recent years has &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2023/07/25/alzheimers-blood-test-diagnostics-leqembi/"&gt;ignited a race&lt;/a&gt; to roll out blood tests as a more convenient and cheaper way for patients to get diagnosed, and so far the Food and Drug Administration has &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/05/16/alzheimers-fujirebio-fda-approval/"&gt;approved&lt;/a&gt; one test. But up until now, doctors haven’t had clear guidelines on when to use them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While the recommendations are expected to be updated over time, even the first stab could lead to more patients getting tested and diagnosed, particularly in rural areas, where access to scans and spinal fluid tests are typically more difficult to access.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I think this is reasonable. They’ve really thought through this very carefully in terms of making a diagnosis,” said Joseph Quinn, a professor of neurology at Oregon Health &amp;amp; Science University who was not involved in writing the guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s still best for patients who plan to start treatment to receive PET scans first, said Stephen Salloway, a professor of neurology at Brown University who was not involved with the guidelines. New therapies from Eisai, Biogen, and Eli Lilly aim to shrink a plaque in the brain called amyloid that’s thought to be linked to Alzheimer’s, and doctors, if possible, should scan patients not only before treatment but throughout treatment to ensure that the amyloid is shrinking, he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The blood tests can detect whether patients are positive or negative for amyloid, but are not reliable measures of how much amyloid is in their brain, said Salloway, who has consulted for drug companies making Alzheimer’s treatments.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The recommendations do not address how to use blood tests in the course of monitoring patients receiving treatment. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Drugmakers have supported the development of blood tests, and Lilly has been trying to make it easier for patients to get diagnosed, recently striking an &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/03/27/eli-lilly-alzheimers-disease-telemedicine-synapticure/"&gt;agreement&lt;/a&gt; with a telehealth provider in which it connects patients to a virtual platform so they can get a diagnosis if necessary and get a prescription for treatment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To make the guidelines, the authors reviewed close to 50 studies. They excluded studies that analyzed populations of people who both did and didn’t have cognitive impairment, since they wanted to focus only on those with cognitive impairment. They only evaluated tests that used a single threshold that determined positive or negative results. And they also rated how certain the evidence was for each test’s accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The guidelines also serve as a “call to action” for researchers to understand how to conduct studies and publish results in a way for the Alzheimer’s Association to deem the tests as having strong evidence backing them up, said Edelmayer.&lt;/p&gt;

                 &lt;div class="post_text"&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By COLlive reporter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A case of measles has been confirmed in a dormitory associated with the Central Yeshiva Tomchei Tmimim Lubavitch – 770 Eastern Parkway in Crown Heights, prompting urgent health guidance from the ODA Crown Heights Health Center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The patient, a young Yeshiva bochur from Israel currently studying in the “Kevutza” program at 770, was officially diagnosed earlier on Tuesday with the highly contagious virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The risk of a large-scale outbreak is real,” stated the medical team at ODA in a public health text message to its patients at 1:19 PM on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ODA didn’t disclose whether this bochur was a resident of the dormitories at 749 Eastern Parkway, 755 Eastern Parkway, 1414 President Street, 1214 Sterling Place, or another in the neighborhood. A medical source told COLlive it was the 755 dormitory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Please ensure all children and young adults are vaccinated with MMR. Watch for symptoms: fever, rash, cough, conjunctivitis, and diarrhea,” the ODA wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measles is an illness that spreads through respiratory droplets and can cause high fever, cough, rash, conjunctivitis (red eyes), and diarrhea. It can also lead to serious complications, especially in young children and those with weakened immune systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ODA Health Center, located at 779 East New York Avenue, added, “If visiting a medical facility with these signs, call ahead so the case can be properly managed and exposure minimized.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Residents were advised to review their family’s vaccination records and contact their doctor or the ODA Health Center with any concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For appointments or questions, contact the ODA Crown Heights Health Center at (718) 260-4670.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Many people think that dementia is only a concern later in life, but the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8055902/healthy-habits-to-help-you-live-longer/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;habits and lifestyle choices&lt;/a&gt; we make today quietly shape our brain health and can influence our future risk.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; One habit that’s become increasingly common in modern life is &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/habit-to-break-to-reduce-dementia-risk-11682107" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;spending most of the day sitting&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; But why does this happen? We dive into the details below and provide expert-backed tips to reduce your risk of developing dementia.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-why-a-sedentary-lifestyle-can-increase-dementia-risk"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Why a Sedentary Lifestyle Can Increase Dementia Risk &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It Increases Insulin Resistance and Type 2 Diabetes Risk &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Inactivity is closely linked to insulin resistance and the development of type 2 diabetes, which are well-established risk factors for both vascular dementia and Alzheimer’s disease,” says Robinson.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Insulin resistance occurs when the body becomes less sensitive to insulin, a hormone that helps move glucose (sugar) from the bloodstream into cells.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Robinson explains that &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8001377/having-diabetes-can-speed-up-cognitive-decline-here-are-5-things-you-can-do-to-help/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;poor glucose control damages blood vessels&lt;/a&gt; and disrupts insulin signaling in the brain, impairing the delivery of nutrients and oxygen to brain cells. Over time, this can impair cognition.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; These metabolic changes may &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/alzheimers-exercise-study-11691515" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;increase the buildup of harmful proteins like beta-amyloid&lt;/a&gt;, which are linked with neurodegenerative conditions like Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It’s Associated with Heart Disease &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A sedentary lifestyle can increase the risk of dementia in part due to its connection with cardiovascular disease.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Prolonged sitting and low physical activity levels are linked to increased risk of hypertension (high blood pressure), stroke and other cardiovascular diseases, all of which are major risk factors for vascular dementia,” explains Robinson.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Chronically elevated blood pressure strains the heart and damages blood vessels, including the small vessels that supply the brain. Over time, this can lead to strokes and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/sneaky-signs-of-cognitive-decline-11767736" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;cognitive decline, including difficulty with memory and thinking&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It May Reduce Brain Volume &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Spending too much time sitting may also increase dementia risk by gradually &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/habits-that-are-aging-your-brain-11717608" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;shrinking brain volume in areas tied to memory and learning&lt;/a&gt;. Studies have found that &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/activity-to-limit-for-reduced-risk-dementia-8548330" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;sedentary behaviors are linked to reduced gray matter&lt;/a&gt; in brain regions like the hippocampus, which plays a crucial role in forming memories and recalling past experiences.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; What’s even more surprising is that being physically active may not offset the risks of spending the rest of the day sedentary. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For example, one study found that high amounts of sedentary time were linked to greater cognitive decline, even among those who exercised regularly. The risk was even higher in people with the APOE-e4 gene variation, a known risk factor for dementia.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; This highlights the importance of not only exercising regularly, but &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8074778/habit-to-break-for-a-longer-life/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;minimizing sitting time throughout the day&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Fortunately, there are ways you can &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/dementia-risk-doubling-study-8776659" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;lower your risk of dementia&lt;/a&gt;. Robinson shares the following &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/things-doctors-do-every-day-for-better-brain-health-11678638" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;daily habits you can incorporate into your routine&lt;/a&gt; to help keep your mind sharp.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get Moving. &lt;/strong&gt;Be intentional with movement, and exercise regularly. “For example, use stairs instead of the elevator, park farther away and walk during meetings or phone calls. Aim to engage in 150 minutes of moderate physical activity per week and break up long periods of sitting with light movement,” says Robinson.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Try the MIND Diet. &lt;/strong&gt;The &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290813/mind-diet-best-foods-to-eat-to-keep-your-brain-young/" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;MIND diet&lt;/a&gt; is a blend of the Mediterranean and DASH diets, which are eating patterns that may reduce the risk of dementia. “Studies show that the MIND diet is associated with a lower risk of cognitive decline or impairment. Even moderate adherence to the MIND diet could significantly lower a person’s risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease,” explains Robinson.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Munch on Berries. &lt;/strong&gt;If there’s one group of fruits that is consistently celebrated for its brain&lt;strong&gt;-&lt;/strong&gt;boosting benefits, it’s berries. Robinson emphasizes that “berries are rich in antioxidants, which can help fight oxidative stress that contributes to age-related memory decline. Research shows that regular berry consumption (especially blueberries, strawberries and blackberries) may delay cognitive aging and decrease the risk of dementia.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; She suggests tossing them into smoothies, oatmeal or yogurt for a brain-smart start to the day.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-sc-block-adslot-inline"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eat Healthy Fats. &lt;/strong&gt;A few of the top sources of &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-nutrient-for-brain-health-as-you-age-11739345" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;brain-healthy fats are nuts, olive oil and fatty fish&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;“Include nuts most days, cook with extra-virgin olive oil and eat fatty fish (like salmon or sardines). These foods provide omega-3 fatty acids and vitamin E, which are protective against cognitive decline,” Robinson shares.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Our lifestyle habits play a powerful role in shaping the future of our brain health. One often-overlooked factor for dementia is a sedentary lifestyle, which is associated with insulin resistance, cardiovascular disease and reduced brain volume. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

A new scientific study, published this month in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-61033-4"&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/a&gt;, has revealed that the pandemic may have accelerated brain aging in people even if they were never infected with the coronavirus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Researchers at the University of Nottingham in the UK analyzed brain images captured before and after the onset of the health crisis. The scientists found that the brains of those who lived through the pandemic appeared to age faster over its duration compared to those whose brains were only scanned prior to March 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;“What surprised me most was that even people who hadn’t had Covid showed significant increases in brain aging rates,” said Ali-Reza Mohammadi-Nejad, a coauthor of the study, in a &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/news/covid-19-brain-age" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/news/covid-19-brain-age"}' href="https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/news/covid-19-brain-age" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; on the university’s website. “It really shows how much the experience of the pandemic itself, everything from isolation to uncertainty, may have affected our brain health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-VgtPr ekoLDG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;The team used longitudinal data from the &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/about-our-data/" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/about-our-data/"}' href="https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/about-our-data/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;UK Biobank&lt;/a&gt;, a huge dataset that is periodically collecting biological information from roughly half a million people over a long period of time and which includes MRI scans of nearly 1,000 adults. Of these people, some had received two scans before the pandemic (the control group), while others had one before and one after confinement and health restrictions had been implemented in response to the viral outbreak (the “pandemic” group).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;“The longitudinal MRI data acquired before and after the pandemic from the UK Biobank gave us a rare window to observe how such a major life event can affect the brain,” said Stamatios Sotiropoulos, professor of computational neuroimaging at the University of Nottingham and a coauthor of the study, in a &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/news/covid-19-brain-age" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/news/covid-19-brain-age"}' href="https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/news/covid-19-brain-age" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;To estimate each person’s “brain age,” the researchers trained a machine-learning model on more than 15,000 healthy volunteers without chronic diseases to allow them to determine how much older or younger a brain looked relative to its chronological age. They then used this tool to assess the ages of the MRI brain scans in the two Biobank groups. When looking at the second scans in each group, the mean difference between chronological and measured age was 5.5 months higher in the pandemic group compared to the control group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;The researchers also found that this acceleration of brain aging was more marked in older people, men, and those from disadvantaged socioeconomic backgrounds, such as those with low educational levels, precarious jobs, or housing and health difficulties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;“This study reminds us that brain health is shaped not only by illness but by our everyday environment,” said Dorothee Auer, lead author of the study, in in &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/news/covid-19-brain-age" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/news/covid-19-brain-age"}' href="https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/news/covid-19-brain-age" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a statement&lt;/a&gt; released by the University of Nottingham. “The pandemic put a strain on people’s lives, especially those already facing disadvantage.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Although brain aging was seen universally among those living through the pandemic, only those infected went on to show measurable cognitive impairment, a symptom of Covid that has been documented in the past. The study found that those in the pandemic group who had Covid between the two scans experienced a drop in performance in mental flexibility and processing speed tests. In contrast, those who were not infected showed no significant cognitive changes, suggesting that structural aging does not always translate into visible functional symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;However, the authors acknowledge that there are some important limitations to this observational study, which could bias the results. These include the interval of time between people’s scans differing between the two groups, as well as the UK Biobank lacking representation from the most marginalized sectors of the British population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;The researchers also highlighted the possibility of reversibility, as only brain scans from two time points were analyzed, meaning that there may be neurological recovery in these people in subsequent years. “We don’t yet know if the observed changes can be reversed, but it is an encouraging idea,” Auer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story originally appeared on&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://es.wired.com/articulos/la-pandemia-acelero-el-envejecimiento-del-cerebro-incluso-en-personas-que-nunca-se-enfermaron-de-covid"&gt;WIRED &lt;em&gt;en Español&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;and has been translated from Spanish.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WIRED</author><pubDate>Tue, 29 Jul 2025 16:52:21 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiogFBVV95cUxQaVdQbDljUHZRelhkTzVfdFYxVkRYSGVSblM1OVJpcVozNXN2dXgtOGQ1RkFOd3pMcW4tU1ExZXU0RlpqaEpqMjZ1bHZ4RmE1Nk5YVG5QeVlXNnpyTnBLVkdtV0wyR3l4UnVrbVRLV1d3bnlYdFpRalFzNWhLZ3J1cVlZTXJKb1RCZlllSHdvVUJybm8tc21yRXJ4eHd6U05IaHc</guid></item><item><title>大麻使用障碍口腔癌风险增加三倍-加州大学圣地亚哥分校今天</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihAFBVV95cUxOamVqQnY5bWNWT1JMV2xPeWhZWjlLOHJOYnJYSkxGNmZfQ2RCNml5Tk9qcVdDQ3NwZm1LVlFSVnBudDFmTGNDNEUxakREY2lmR1I4NzRJNU9EQXotSjJiN3BGcXZRZ2NwMm16ZkhUSXcyTHptM3NpUXREU2owQkJoOTJZTUo?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="modal-body px-6-5 pb-7"&gt;

While no one ever claimed sugar was &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; for you, it turns out that consuming sugar in some forms is actually healthier than others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent scientific review published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2161831325000493" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Advances in Nutrition;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Advances in Nutrition&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;had researchers analyzing the different ways people consume sugar and found that drinking your sugar is worse than simply eating it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, it's nearly impossible to avoid all sugar, but the study does suggest that people should be choosy about the way they consume sugar in the future. Here’s why.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meet the experts:&lt;/strong&gt; Dena Champion, RDN, a dietitian at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center; Jessica Cording, RD, CDN, author of The Little Book of Game-Changers; Tara Gidus Collingwood, RDN, a sports nutrition consultant and owner of Tara Gidus Nutrition Consulting; Lisa Moskovitz, RD, CDN, CEO of NY Nutrition Group&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What did the review find?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the review, researchers crunched data from more than half a million people across the world who participated in 29 different studies, looking at their sugar consumption habits and overall health. The researchers found that people who had sugar through beverages (think: soda and &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a46595751/fruit-juice-linked-to-weight-gain-study/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:juice;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;juice&lt;/a&gt;) consistently had a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes than those who didn't drink as much sugar. But people who ate sugar didn’t have the same link.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results were pretty wild. For every 12-ounce serving someone had of sugar-sweetened beverages a day, the risk of developing type 2 diabetes jumped up by 25 percent. For every 8-ounce serving of fruit juice they had a day, the risk increased by 5 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These findings suggest that dietary sugar consumed as a beverage (sugar sweetened beverages and fruit juice) is associated with incident type 2 diabetes risk,” the researchers wrote in the conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is sugar bad for your overall health?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The big concern here is &lt;em&gt;excess &lt;/em&gt;sugar, says &lt;a href="https://wexnermedical.osu.edu/mediaroom/expertslisting/dena-champion" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dena Champion;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Dena Champion&lt;/a&gt;, RDN, a dietitian at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center. “Excess sugar can lead to increased weight gain and leave less room for healthy options,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excess sugar also raises the risk of heart disease, dental issues, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, says Tara Gidus Collingwood, RDN, a sports nutrition consultant and owner of &lt;a href="https://dietdiva.net/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Tara Gidus Nutrition Consulting;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Tara Gidus Nutrition Consulting&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it’s okay to have a little sugar, says Lisa Moskovitz, RD, CDN, CEO of &lt;a href="https://www.nynutritiongroup.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:NY Nutrition Group;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;NY Nutrition Group&lt;/a&gt; and author of &lt;em&gt;The Core 3 Healthy Eating Plan&lt;/em&gt;. “While consuming sugar sporadically and in smaller portions poses no risk for the average healthy person, excessive consumption of added and refined sugar could affect your health over time,” she says. Not only can it cause the issues we already mentioned, but it can also increase the risk of bodily inflammation, which is &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11592557/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:linked;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;linked&lt;/a&gt; to a host of serious health conditions, like cancer, autoimmune diseases, and cardiovascular issues, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why is drinking sugar worse than eating it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the researchers established the link between type 2 diabetes risk and drinking sugary beverages, they didn’t dive into that exact cause-effect relationship. But there are some theories. “A lot has to do with the lack of protein, fat, and fiber,” says Jessica Cording, RD, CDN, author of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Little-Book-Game-Changers-Managing/dp/163228068X?tag=syn-yahoo-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5Bartid%7C2140.a.65533393%5Bsrc%7Cyahoo-us" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The Little Book of Game-Changers;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;The Little Book of Game-Changers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. “If you’re drinking sugar, which is usually in the context of a sugar-sweetened beverage or juice, there’s nothing to slow down the breakdown of it.” Cue the blood sugar spike and crash. It’s also easy to have a lot of sugar in a short period of time when you drink it, she points out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're drinking soda, you’ll likely take in more sugar at a faster rate than if you were to say, eat some ice cream, says Collingwood. And then there are serving sizes to consider. “Beverages often contain more sugar than a typical serving of a sweet food,” Collingwood says. “A 20-ounce soda can have 15 to 18 teaspoons of sugar.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the worst sugary drinks to avoid?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study called out sugar-sweetened beverages like soda and juice, points out Champion. “It may be wise to consume both with caution,” she says. Cording agrees. “I don’t recommend having a big sugar-sweetened soda, energy drink, or fruit juice, especially on its own,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of drinking fruit juice, Champion recommends eating the whole fruit (which is also more filling). “Avoid sodas, lemonade, or fruit punch whenever possible,” she says. If you’re craving something fizzy but want to avoid the sugar of soda, Champion suggests experimenting with sparkling water, fruit, and herbs. “Berries and mint go well together,” she points out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, while it's probably not great to drink soda or juice regularly, Moskovitz says it's okay to drink it in moderation.

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A team of Canadian scientists has discovered a surprising new way to improve blood sugar levels and reduce liver damage: by trapping a little-known fuel made by gut bacteria before they wreak havoc on the body.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                &lt;p class="w-100 my-4 d-print-none"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;The findings, &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-metabolism/fulltext/S1550-4131(25)00328-6" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Cell Metabolism&lt;/i&gt;, could open the door to new therapies to treat &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/metabolic+diseases/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;metabolic diseases&lt;/a&gt; like type 2 diabetes and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/fatty+liver+disease/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;fatty liver disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers at McMaster University, Université Laval and the University of Ottawa showed that a molecule produced by microbes in the gut can sneak into the bloodstream and fuel the liver to make more glucose and fat than necessary. But when researchers developed a way to trap this molecule in the gut before it enters the body, they saw dramatic improvements in blood sugar control and fatty liver disease in mice with obesity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This is a new twist on a classic metabolic pathway," says Jonathan Schertzer, senior and corresponding author and professor in the Department of Biochemistry and Biomedical Sciences at McMaster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We've known for nearly a century that muscles and the liver exchange lactate and glucose—a process called the Cori cycle. What we've discovered is a new branch of that cycle, where &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/gut+bacteria/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;gut bacteria&lt;/a&gt; are also part of the conversation."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1947, married scientists Carl Ferdinand Cori and Gerty Theresa Cori were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their work showing how muscles in the body generate lactate that fuels the liver to produce &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/blood+glucose/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;blood glucose&lt;/a&gt;, which then cycles back to fuel the muscle.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;The work laid the foundation to explain how muscles use a form of lactate (L-lactate), and the liver uses blood glucose to communicate and exchange fuel with each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Canadian team found that obese mice—and even people with obesity—have higher levels of a lesser-known molecule, D-lactate, in their blood. Unlike the more familiar L-lactate made by muscles, most of the D-lactate comes from gut microbes and was shown to raise blood sugar and liver fat more aggressively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To stop this, the researchers created a "gut substrate trap"—a safe, biodegradable polymer that binds to D-lactate in the gut and prevents it from being absorbed. Mice fed this trap had lower blood glucose, less insulin resistance, and reduced liver inflammation and fibrosis—all without changing their diet or body weight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This is a completely new way to think about treating metabolic diseases like type 2 diabetes and fatty liver disease. Instead of targeting hormones or the liver directly, we're intercepting a microbial fuel source before it can do harm," says Schertzer, a member of the Center for Metabolism, Obesity, and Diabetes Research (MODR) and Farncombe Family Digestive Health Research Institute at McMaster. Schertzer holds a Canada Research Chair in Metabolic Inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research highlights the growing importance of the microbiome in chronic diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

While no one ever claimed sugar was &lt;em data-node-id="2.5"&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; for you, it turns out that consuming sugar in some forms is actually healthier than others. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="3" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;A recent scientific review published in the journal &lt;em data-node-id="3.1"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2161831325000493?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2161831325000493?via%3Dihub" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Advances in Nutrition" data-node-id="3.1.0" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Advances in Nutrition&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;had&lt;em data-node-id="3.3"&gt;&lt;/em&gt; researchers analyzing the different ways people consume sugar and found that drinking your sugar is worse than simply eating it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="4" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Of course, it's nearly impossible to avoid all sugar, but the study does suggest that people should be choosy about the way they consume sugar in the future. Here’s why.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="6" class="body-tip css-18qyn7q emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="6.0"&gt;Meet the experts:&lt;/strong&gt; Dena Champion, RDN, a dietitian at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center; Jessica Cording, RD, CDN, author of The Little Book of Game-Changers; Tara Gidus Collingwood, RDN, a sports nutrition consultant and owner of Tara Gidus Nutrition Consulting; Lisa Moskovitz, RD, CDN, CEO of NY Nutrition Group&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-did-the-review-find" data-node-id="7" class="body-h2 css-1eo7s1x emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="7.0"&gt;What did the review find?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="8" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;For the review, researchers crunched data from more than half a million people across the world who participated in 29 different studies, looking at their sugar consumption habits and overall health. The researchers found that people who had sugar through beverages (think: soda and &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a46595751/fruit-juice-linked-to-weight-gain-study/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a46595751/fruit-juice-linked-to-weight-gain-study/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="juice" data-node-id="8.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;juice&lt;/a&gt;) consistently had a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes than those who didn't drink as much sugar. But people who ate sugar didn’t have the same link.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="9" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;The results were pretty wild. For every 12-ounce serving someone had of sugar-sweetened beverages a day, the risk of developing type 2 diabetes jumped up by 25 percent. For every 8-ounce serving of fruit juice they had a day, the risk increased by 5 percent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="10" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;“These findings suggest that dietary sugar consumed as a beverage (sugar sweetened beverages and fruit juice) is associated with incident type 2 diabetes risk,” the researchers wrote in the conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="12" class="body-text css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;br data-node-id="12.0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-is-sugar-bad-for-your-overall-health" data-node-id="13" class="body-h2 css-1eo7s1x emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="13.0"&gt;What is sugar bad for your overall health?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="14" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;The big concern here is &lt;em data-node-id="14.1"&gt;excess &lt;/em&gt;sugar, says &lt;a href="https://wexnermedical.osu.edu/mediaroom/expertslisting/dena-champion" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://wexnermedical.osu.edu/mediaroom/expertslisting/dena-champion" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Dena Champion" data-node-id="14.3" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Dena Champion&lt;/a&gt;, RDN, a dietitian at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center. “Excess sugar can lead to increased weight gain and leave less room for healthy options,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="15" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Excess sugar also raises the risk of heart disease, dental issues, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, says Tara Gidus Collingwood, RDN, a sports nutrition consultant and owner of &lt;a href="https://dietdiva.net/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-node-id="15.1" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://dietdiva.net/" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Tara Gidus Nutrition Consulting" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Tara Gidus Nutrition Consulting&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="16" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;But it’s okay to have a little sugar, says Lisa Moskovitz, RD, CDN, CEO of &lt;a href="https://www.nynutritiongroup.com/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.nynutritiongroup.com/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="NY Nutrition Group" data-node-id="16.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;NY Nutrition Group&lt;/a&gt; and author of &lt;em data-node-id="16.3"&gt;The Core 3 Healthy Eating Plan&lt;/em&gt;. “While consuming sugar sporadically and in smaller portions poses no risk for the average healthy person, excessive consumption of added and refined sugar could affect your health over time,” she says. Not only can it cause the issues we already mentioned, but it can also increase the risk of bodily inflammation, which is &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11592557/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11592557/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="linked" data-node-id="16.5" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;linked&lt;/a&gt; to a host of serious health conditions, like cancer, autoimmune diseases, and cardiovascular issues, she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="why-is-drinking-sugar-worse-than-eating-it" data-node-id="17" class="body-h2 css-1eo7s1x emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="17.0"&gt;Why is drinking sugar worse than eating it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="18" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;While the researchers established the link between type 2 diabetes risk and drinking sugary beverages, they didn’t dive into that exact cause-effect relationship. But there are some theories. “A lot has to do with the lack of protein, fat, and fiber,” says Jessica Cording, RD, CDN, author of &lt;em data-node-id="18.1"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Little-Book-Game-Changers-Managing/dp/163228068X?tag=womenshealth-auto-20" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.amazon.com/Little-Book-Game-Changers-Managing/dp/163228068X" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The Little Book of Game-Changers" data-vars-ga-product-id="11bb313a-a7bd-493a-9c71-0403cdc2f565" rel="nofollow" data-node-id="18.1.0" data-href="https://www.amazon.com/Little-Book-Game-Changers-Managing/dp/163228068X" data-product-url="https://www.amazon.com/Little-Book-Game-Changers-Managing/dp/163228068X" data-affiliate="true" data-affiliate-url="https://www.amazon.com/Little-Book-Game-Changers-Managing/dp/163228068X?tag=womenshealth-auto-20" data-affiliate-network='{"afflink_redirect":"/_p/afflink/wtom/amazon-s-little-book-game-changers-managing-dp-163228068x","site_id":"6b499c58-dc46-4f93-80b3-25265395e77a","network":{"name":"Amazon"},"metadata":{"links":{"default":"https://www.amazon.com/Little-Book-Game-Changers-Managing/dp/163228068X?tag=womenshealth-auto-20","sem":"https://www.amazon.com/Little-Book-Game-Changers-Managing/dp/163228068X?tag=wh-lift-20","social":"https://www.amazon.com/Little-Book-Game-Changers-Managing/dp/163228068X?tag=wh-soc-lift-20"}}}' data-vars-ga-product-price="$16.71" data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id="9a94a843-a907-4f6c-be8a-de1503b6a504" data-vars-ga-link-treatment="sale | (not set)" class="body-link product-links css-7bauu1 e1aq0z090"&gt;The Little Book of Game-Changers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. “If you’re drinking sugar, which is usually in the context of a sugar-sweetened beverage or juice, there’s nothing to slow down the breakdown of it.” Cue the blood sugar spike and crash. It’s also easy to have a lot of sugar in a short period of time when you drink it, she points out. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="19" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;If you're drinking soda, you’ll likely take in more sugar at a faster rate than if you were to say, eat some ice cream, says Collingwood. And then there are serving sizes to consider. “Beverages often contain more sugar than a typical serving of a sweet food,” Collingwood says. “A 20-ounce soda can have 15 to 18 teaspoons of sugar.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-are-the-worst-sugary-drinks-to-avoid" data-node-id="21" class="body-h2 css-1eo7s1x emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="21.0"&gt;What are the worst sugary drinks to avoid?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="22" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;This study called out sugar-sweetened beverages like soda and juice, points out Champion. “It may be wise to consume both with caution,” she says. Cording agrees. “I don’t recommend having a big sugar-sweetened soda, energy drink, or fruit juice, especially on its own,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="23" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Instead of drinking fruit juice, Champion recommends eating the whole fruit (which is also more filling). “Avoid sodas, lemonade, or fruit punch whenever possible,” she says. If you’re craving something fizzy but want to avoid the sugar of soda, Champion suggests experimenting with sparkling water, fruit, and herbs. “Berries and mint go well together,” she points out. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="24" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Still, while it's probably not great to drink soda or juice regularly, Moskovitz says it's okay to drink it in moderation. So, if you want to treat yourself, go for it.

When the mitochondria in neutrophil cells detect this lactate, they &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chom.2025.02.003" target="_blank" data-url="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chom.2025.02.003" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;start signaling&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for the cell to get rid of the NETs that have entrapped bacteria. Once the bacteria are released outside the cell, other immune cells can kill them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we blocked the mitochondria's ability to sense lactate, neutrophils &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chom.2025.02.003" target="_blank" data-url="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chom.2025.02.003" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;failed to produce NETs effectively&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. This meant bacteria were more likely to escape capture and proliferate, showing how crucial this mechanism is to immune defense. This process highlights an intricate dialogue between the bacteria's metabolism and the host cell's energy machinery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What makes this finding surprising is that the mitochondria within cells are able to detect bacteria trapped in phagosomes, even though the microbes are enclosed in a separate space. Somehow, mitochondrial sensors can pick up cues from within these compartments — an impressive feat of cellular coordination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="targeting-mitochondria-to-fight-infections-3"&gt;Targeting mitochondria to fight infections&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our study is part of a growing field &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41423-022-00840-x" target="_blank" data-url="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41423-022-00840-x" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;called immunometabolism&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which explores how &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://theconversation.com/what-is-metabolism-a-biochemist-explains-how-different-people-convert-energy-differently-and-why-that-matters-for-your-health-211816" target="_blank" data-url="https://theconversation.com/what-is-metabolism-a-biochemist-explains-how-different-people-convert-energy-differently-and-why-that-matters-for-your-health-211816" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;metabolism&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and immune function are deeply intertwined. Rather than viewing cellular metabolism as strictly a means to generate energy, researchers are now recognizing it as a central driver of immune decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mitochondria sit at the heart of this interaction. Their ability to sense, respond to and even shape the metabolic environment of a cell gives them a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tcb.2020.01.006" target="_blank" data-url="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tcb.2020.01.006" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;critical role&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in determining how and when immune responses are deployed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, our findings provide a key reason why patients with a chronic autoimmune disease called &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK535405/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK535405/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;systemic lupus erythematosus&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; often suffer from recurrent infections. Mitochondria in the neutrophils of lupus patients &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chom.2025.02.003" target="_blank" data-url="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chom.2025.02.003" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;fail to sense bacterial lactate&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; properly. As a result, NET production was significantly reduced. This mitochondrial dysfunction could explain why lupus patients are more vulnerable to bacterial infections — even though their immune systems are constantly activated due to the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This observation points to mitochondria's central role in balancing immune responses. It connects two seemingly unrelated issues: immune overactivity, as seen in lupus, and immune weakness like increased susceptibility to infection. When mitochondria work correctly, they help neutrophils mount an effective, targeted attack on bacteria. But when mitochondria are impaired, this system breaks down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our discovery that mitochondria can sense bacterial lactate to trigger NET formation opens up new possibilities for treating infections. For instance, drugs that enhance mitochondrial sensing could boost NET production in people with weakened immune systems. On the flip side, for conditions where NETs contribute to tissue damage — such as in severe COVID-19 or autoimmune diseases — it might be beneficial to limit this response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, our study raises the question of whether other immune cells use similar mechanisms to sense microbial metabolites, and whether other bacterial byproducts might serve as immune signals. Understanding these pathways in more detail could lead to new treatments that modulate immune responses more precisely, reducing collateral damage while preserving antimicrobial defenses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mitochondria are not just the powerhouses of the cell — they are the immune system's watchtowers, alert to even the faintest metabolic signals of bacterial invaders. As researchers' understanding of their roles expands, so too does our appreciation for the complexity — and adaptability — of our cellular defenses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This edited article is republished from &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="http://theconversation.com/" target="_blank" data-url="http://theconversation.com/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Conversation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; under a Creative Commons license.

There is a new walking routine going viral these days. 6-6-6 walking routine has been making rounds on social media lately, and for the right reasons. This simple exercise can help you keep yourself fit, primarily because it helps you shed the extra kilos. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While there is no shortage of fitness challenges on social media, the 6-6-6 walking routine has gained traction. Here's everything you need to know about it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Is The 6-6-6 Walking Routine? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.healthline.com/health-news/666-walking-trend-weight-loss" rel="noindex,nofollow"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Healthline&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the 6-6-6 walking routine is a workout that involves "walking for 60 minutes, either at 6 a.m. or 6 p.m. It additionally includes a 6-minute warm-up at a slow pace to help you ease into walking and a 6-minute cool-down to aid in recovery."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than a workout, the 6-6-6 routine is more like a lifestyle shift that activates your metabolism, promotes heart health, and aids in weight management - all while being gentle to your joints. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-personalisation---lifestyle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

found a direct link between exposure to wildfire smoke and a sharp rise in dementia diagnoses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The findings raise new concerns about the long-term neurological impacts of worsening air quality fueled by increasingly severe wildfires. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Currently, about 42 percent of Americans over 55 are expected to develop dementia, with annual cases &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-14279053/Americans-dementia-disease-underestimated.html"&gt;projected to nearly double from 514,000 in 2020 to one million by 2060&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers pinpointed wildfire smoke as especially harmful because it contains tiny toxic particles known as PM2.5, microscopic pollutants roughly 30 times thinner than a human hair. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Unlike typical city smog or car exhaust, t&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/sciencetech/article-14765103/air-quality-canada-wildfires-michigan-minnesota-wisconsin.html"&gt;hese particles can enter the bloodstream &lt;/a&gt;and travel to the brain, causing inflammation that increases the risk of memory loss and cognitive decline. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;PM2.5 particles can also weaken the blood-brain barrier, the brain's protective shield, making it vulnerable to damage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/sciencetech/article-14907953/air-quality-emergency-new-york-michigan-minnesota-illinois-vermont.html"&gt;Amid one of the most intense wildfire seasons on record&lt;/a&gt;, over 4,000 fires scorching nearly 200,000 acres in California as of mid-July 2025, this threat is growing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A new study reveals that wildfire smoke, is directly linked to a sharp rise in dementia diagnoses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Wildfire smoke is an unpredictable and highly toxic mix of burned vegetation, plastics, metals, and chemicals from destroyed homes and vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It forms at higher temperatures and lingers longer in the air, making it far more damaging per microgram than pollution from factories or traffic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study found that a mere one-microgram increase in wildfire-related PM2.5 per cubic meter of air raises the risk of a dementia diagnosis by 21 percent over three years, nearly 20 times the risk posed by the same amount of PM2.5 from other pollution sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Holly Elser, neurologist and lead author from the University of Pennsylvania, &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-6048497/California-wildfire-smoke-set-cause-lung-issues-nationwide.html"&gt;said, 'Air pollution from wildfires now makes up more than 70 percent of total PM2.5 on poor air quality days in California.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'These findings highlight the urgent need for stronger wildfire prevention policies and better smoke mitigation strategies.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To measure long-term exposure, researchers combined satellite data with ground air quality monitors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study, published in the Journal of the Alzheimer's Association, focused on cognitively healthy individuals over 60 and controlled for income, smoking, health conditions, and race.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As wildfires worsen, experts warn that addressing this silent threat is critical to protecting brain health for millions of Americans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption" data-gramm="false"&gt;By mid-July 2025, over 4,000 fires had already burned nearly 200,000 acres in California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers also found the worst health effects in low-income and minority communities, groups more likely to live in high-smoke areas and less likely to have access to indoor air filtration or protective equipment like N95 masks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Joan Casey, a senior author of the study and assistant professor in the Department of Environmental and Occupational Health Sciences at the University of Washington, Seattle: 'These findings underscore that clinical and health policies seeking to prevent dementia-associated disparities should include efforts to reduce exposure to long-term wildfire and non-wildfire PM2.5.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For decades, pollution has been linked to heart and lung disease, but this study adds to growing evidence that it also harms the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Claire Sexton of the Alzheimer's Association, said: 'We've thought about pollution as a lung and heart issue for decades, but now we are seeing its effects on memory, cognition, and aging, and it's deeply troubling.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As wildfire seasons stretch longer, &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-11426259/Americas-growing-wildfire-crisis-lead-wave-health-issues-years-come-heres-why.html"&gt;sometimes from May through December, and heatwaves worsen&lt;/a&gt; across the western US, scientists warned that the neurological impact of poor air quality could be the next major public health crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended staying indoors on days when the Air Quality Index (AQI) hits 100 or higher, using high-efficiency furnace filters (rated MERV 13 or above), and wearing certified N95 masks if outdoor exposure is unavoidable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These warnings come as the overall risk of dementia continues to rise nationwide.

							&lt;p&gt;The cat who changed everything arrived during the second year of lockdown, when touch had become dangerous and algorithms determined who we could love. Tom found her—a tortoiseshell with one white paw—behind a dumpster in Queens, brought her home to the apartment he shared with Sarah, and named her Mochi. Within a week, she'd chosen Sarah completely, definitively, with the kind of certainty that dating apps promise but never deliver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now Tom kneels on their kitchen floor at 6 AM, holding salmon treats in one hand and speaking in the high-pitched voice we reserve for creatures we desperately want to love us back. Mochi sits perfectly still, green eyes locked not on him but on the doorway where Sarah will eventually appear. When she does—hair messy, still in pajamas—the cat transforms. Stone becomes water. Mochi flows between Sarah's legs, purring like something mechanical and necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"She hates me," Tom says, not for the first time, dropping the rejected treats back in the bag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sarah scoops up Mochi, who immediately nestles into her collarbone. "She doesn't hate you."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we all know what Tom knows: in a world where we swipe through faces hoping for mutual selection, where algorithms sort us into desirable and undesirable, where even our cats seem to have standards we can't meet, rejection hits different now. Mochi has made her choice with the kind of absoluteness that no amount of data science can replicate. And it wasn't him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The algorithm of the heart&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started collecting these stories after Tom first told me about Mochi, and they're everywhere once you start looking. The golden retriever at my local dog park who walks past his owner to follow a stranger who resembles his first human. My neighbor's African grey parrot who learned thirty words from their daughter but remains silent when anyone else approaches. The therapy dog who, despite training that should make him love everyone equally, spends every free moment beside one particular resident at the nursing home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want simple explanations: whoever feeds the pet becomes the favorite, or animals prefer whoever spends the most time with them. But the evidence tells a different story. Tom feeds Mochi every morning. He plays with her, cleans her litter box, paid the vet bills for that eye infection last spring. By any algorithmic measure—time invested, resources provided, care demonstrated—he should be her chosen person. Yet Mochi waits by the door each evening for Sarah, who works sixty-hour weeks and sometimes doesn't get home until after the cat's bedtime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What makes this particularly resonant now is how it mirrors our broader cultural moment. Young adults navigating dating apps report that rejection sensitivity—the tendency to anxiously expect, readily perceive, and intensely react to rejection—has become a defining feature of modern romance. We've gamified love, turned it into a series of binary decisions, yes or no, swipe left or swipe right. But animals don't swipe. They just know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tom tells me he's started thinking of Mochi's preference as "analog rejection"—no ghosting, no mixed signals, no "it's not you, it's me." Just clear, consistent choice. "In a weird way, it's almost refreshing," he says. "At least I know where I stand."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The biology of being chosen&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's what actually happens when Mochi sees Sarah: both of their brains release oxytocin, the same hormone that bonds mothers to infants. When researchers at Azabu University in Japan studied &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1261022"&gt;dog-human interactions&lt;/a&gt;, they discovered this interspecies oxytocin loop—mutual gazing increased the hormone in both parties by up to 300%, creating what scientists call a "positive feedback loop" of attachment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But oxytocin isn't just about creating bonds; it's about creating &lt;em&gt;selective&lt;/em&gt; bonds. &lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1322868111"&gt;Research from Duke University's Canine Cognition Center&lt;/a&gt; found that when dogs were given oxytocin, they didn't become indiscriminately affectionate. Instead, the hormone made them more discerning, increasing their preference for people who matched their energy and emotional state. Female dogs, in particular, showed heightened selectivity—choosing to gaze longer at their owners while becoming more wary of strangers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This selectivity operates below conscious awareness. A &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-93922-1"&gt;2021 study comparing pet dogs with pack-living dogs and wolves&lt;/a&gt;revealed that only household pets showed oxytocin spikes during human interaction. Despite being hand-raised by humans, pack animals maintained their own social hierarchies. The difference? Pet dogs live embedded in our daily rhythms, sharing our schedules, our spaces, our emotional weather.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tom's anxiety about being rejected—his tentative approaches, his slight tension when he reaches for Mochi—may actually be pushing her toward Sarah's calmer presence. Studies of attachment in shelter animals show that &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5451941/"&gt;cats and dogs are remarkably attuned to human stress signals&lt;/a&gt;, often preferring people whose cortisol levels are lower. The science suggests our pets aren't just choosing who they like best; they're choosing who makes them feel most regulated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I used to think I was doing everything right," Tom says. "But maybe trying so hard was exactly what I was doing wrong."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The certainty crisis&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sarah works in user experience design, building the invisible architectures that guide our choices online. When I ask her about Mochi's preference, she laughs. "At work, we spend millions trying to predict and influence user behavior. We A/B test button colors, optimize conversion funnels, build machine learning models to anticipate what people want before they know they want it. Then I come home to this cat who decided within three days that I was her person, based on... what? My smell? The way I didn't try too hard? Some ineffable cat algorithm we'll never decode?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She's touching on something profound about our current moment. Dating app algorithms now sort potential matches based on everything from facial symmetry to linguistic patterns in our profiles—while claiming to connect people based on deeper compatibility. The very platforms designed to reduce the uncertainty of romantic connection have instead amplified it. Every match might be the algorithm manipulating you. Every rejection might be the code deciding you're not optimal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Mochi's choice feels different precisely because it's illegible to our optimization-obsessed age. There's no API for a cat's affection, no way to hack your way into being chosen. This illegibility feels like resistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During lockdown, when everyone's cortisol levels were spiking, this regulatory function became even more crucial. Pets weren't just companions; they were co-regulation partners. And like all intimate relationships, the match had to be right. Chemistry, even between species, can't be forced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The privilege of rejection&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A friend who works at a Brooklyn shelter tells me the saddest stories involve returns. "Someone adopts a dog, expecting instant love, and when the dog bonds with their roommate or their kid instead, they bring it back. As if the animal failed some test." She pauses. "The weird thing is, these are often the same people who complain about dating apps being superficial. They want authentic connection but can't handle when authentic connection doesn't choose them."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there's a darker edge to these dynamics that becomes visible when you look across economic lines. Research on pet ownership during economic hardship reveals that financially stressed pet owners are more likely to risk their own health and safety for their animals, especially when the bond is strong. The same connection that provides comfort can become a vulnerability when resources are scarce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tom and Sarah can afford to find Mochi's rejection amusing, even endearing. They have the economic cushion to treat it as a quirky household dynamic rather than a source of genuine distress. But for someone who's lost everything else—job, home, human relationships—being rejected by the creature you've saved can hit different. The very intensity of human-animal bonds means they carry real stakes, and those stakes aren't equally distributed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I volunteer at the shelter sometimes," Tom tells me. "You see people who have nothing, whose dog is everything to them. If that dog preferred someone else? I don't think they could laugh it off like I do."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Learning from the unchosen&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Six months after our first conversation, something has shifted in Tom and Sarah's apartment. Tom no longer approaches Mochi with treats and desperate hope. He simply exists in the space, reading on the couch while she sits on Sarah's lap. And sometimes—not often, but sometimes—Mochi walks across the couch to sniff his book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I stopped trying to make her love me," Tom says. "I figured if I rescued her, gave her a good home, that should be enough. Even if she picked Sarah as her person."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The irony is that this acceptance has actually improved their relationship. Without the pressure of Tom's expectations, Mochi has begun to show small signs of acknowledgment—a slow blink here, a brief head bump there. Research on feline behavior suggests that cats are more likely to approach humans who ignore them, a phenomenon that &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6826447/"&gt;Japanese researchers call the "cat paradox"&lt;/a&gt;. She'll never be his cat the way she's Sarah's cat, but she's beginning to recognize him as part of her chosen person's pack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This shift in Tom's approach mirrors something larger about how we might navigate connection in an algorithmic age. "I've stopped taking it personally," he tells me. "Like, genuinely stopped. And weirdly, that's made me think differently about online dating too. Some matches won't text back, some cats won't choose you, and that's just... how choice works."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Beyond the algorithm&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stories I've collected reveal patterns that resist datafication. The elderly woman whose cat hides from everyone except the grocery delivery person who reminds him of his first owner. The couple whose dog chose their neighbor, leading to a joint custody arrangement that became a friendship none of them expected. The child whose hamster will only eat when she's in the room, a preference so specific it reorganized the family's entire dinner routine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These choices create what Sarah calls "desire paths"—the routes worn by actual use rather than planned design. In UX, desire paths show where users actually want to go, regardless of where designers thought they should go. Mochi's preference carved a desire path through their household, reorganizing the emotional landscape in ways no amount of planning could have predicted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent neuroscience research suggests these preferences might be encoded at levels we're only beginning to understand. A &lt;a href="https://bmcpsychiatry.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12888-022-04199-1"&gt;2023 study on interspecies attachment&lt;/a&gt; found that animals form mental maps of their social world as complex as our own, with preferred individuals occupying privileged positions in their cognitive geography. When Mochi chose Sarah, she wasn't just selecting a food provider—she was mapping her emotional universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The gift of arbitrary love&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe this is what we're actually seeking when we talk about authentic connection: not the guarantee of being chosen, but the reality of choice itself. In a world where algorithms increasingly mediate our relationships, where machine learning tries to predict compatibility based on data points, the arbitrary certainty of an animal's preference feels like resistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tom and Sarah's apartment has become a living experiment in acceptance. Mochi still waits by the door for Sarah. She still purrs louder when Sarah holds her. But she also now acknowledges Tom as part of her territory, someone worthy of the occasional head bump, the rare slow blink that cat behaviorists call a "kitty kiss."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"You know what's changed most?" Tom reflects. "I'm not performing for her anymore. I'm just... here. And apparently, that's enough for her to occasionally remember I exist."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This opacity might be the real gift our pets offer us. In an age of radical transparency, where our preferences are tracked, stored, analyzed, and sold, the mystery of animal choice remains uncolonized by data. We can't A/B test our way to a cat's affection or optimize our way into a dog's heart. We can only be present, patient, and open to the possibility that love—real love—doesn't always choose us back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pets in our homes are running ancient software on hardware refined by millions of years of evolution. When Mochi chose Sarah, she wasn't making a decision based on optimization or compatibility scores. She was responding to something older than algorithms, deeper than data, more mysterious than any machine learning model we've yet built.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps that's why these stories of animal favoritism captivate us now more than ever. They remind us that in a world of manufactured connections and predicted preferences, some choices remain wild. Arbitrary. Absolute. Even if we're not the ones chosen, we get to witness choice itself—pure, inexplicable, and certain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next time you see a pet clearly playing favorites, resist the urge to take it personally. Instead, marvel at what you're witnessing: millions of years of evolution culminating in this precise moment, when one small mammal looks at one specific human and says, in all the ways they can: "You. It's you."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if it's not you, there's something profound in being present for that choosing—in seeing love declare itself, mysterious and sure, in a world that's forgotten what certainty feels like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Mediterranean diet helps support healthy aging and longevity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Top foods dietitians recommend include leafy greens, low-fat dairy, beans, nuts and fish.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Women over 50 should eat plenty of calcium, vitamin D, protein, fiber and omega-3 fats.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For women over 50 looking to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8055902/healthy-habits-to-help-you-live-longer/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;support long-term health and longevity&lt;/a&gt;, the Mediterranean diet offers a delicious, sustainable way of eating based on whole, nutrient-dense foods. “I can say from both personal and professional experience that what we eat in our 50s—and beyond—matters more than ever. These are the years when we start to feel the effects of hormonal shifts, bone loss and changes in muscle mass and metabolism,” says &lt;a href="https://www.lizshealthytable.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Liz Weiss, RDN&lt;/a&gt;. She emphasizes the importance of not just living longer, but living better, which includes feeling strong, sharp and energized throughout the years. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Fortunately, the Mediterranean diet has been linked to a longer, healthier life.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; It centers around minimally-processed plants, healthy fats and plenty of fiber.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-1-leafy-greens"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 1. Leafy Greens &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Leafy greens—such as spinach, kale, arugula, lettuce and chard—are powerful foods for brain and heart health. “The MIND Diet, which combines the Mediterranean and DASH eating patterns, ranks leafy greens as one of its top food groups for cognitive protection,” says Weiss. She points to a 2018 study showing that older adults who ate 1–2 servings of leafy greens daily experienced slower cognitive decline—equivalent to being 11 years younger than those who rarely ate them.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The authors credit the brain-supporting benefits of leafy greens to their rich nutritional profile, including a wide range of vitamins, minerals and antioxidants.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://realnutritionnyc.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Amy Shapiro, MS, RD&lt;/a&gt;, adds, “rich in calcium, vitamin K, magnesium and antioxidants, leafy greens are important for maintaining bone strength and reducing inflammation.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Fortunately, leafy greens are easy to add to your diet. Weiss recommends &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/7899673/kale-spinach-smoothie/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;blending baby spinach into smoothies&lt;/a&gt;, adding arugula to sandwiches and grain bowls and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/8037286/super-green-pasta/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;making pesto with kale&lt;/a&gt; for a flavorful topping on fish or pasta. Shapiro suggests sautéing greens with garlic and lemon for a quick side dish, or using them as the base for any salad or adding to soups, omelets and grain bowls.  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-2-beans"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 2. Beans  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Beans are a cornerstone of the Mediterranean diet and offer many health benefits—such as &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7939797/the-top-mediterranean-foods-for-better-blood-sugars/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;better blood sugar regulation&lt;/a&gt;, a healthier gut and heart and increased longevity—thanks to their rich fiber and nutrient content.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; In societies like the Blue Zones—five regions around the world, including parts of the Mediterranean, where people often live past 100—beans are a daily staple, adds Weiss.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “These humble pulses are packed with plant-based protein, iron, potassium and fiber, which helps to reduce LDL cholesterol and supports digestive regularity,” she says.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Beans are also an excellent way to boost fiber intake—something most people fall short on. Their fiber supports a healthy gut and keeps blood sugar steady. Because they’re digested slowly, beans produce a lower glycemic response and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/ways-to-reduce-insulin-resistance-for-better-blood-sugar-8750433" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;improve insulin sensitivity&lt;/a&gt;. The fiber and protein in beans make them especially filling, which can support weight maintenance.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Shapiro emphasizes the importance of getting enough of both, as digestion and muscle health become more important with age.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To add more beans to your diet, try canned varieties—they’re versatile, budget-friendly and convenient. Weiss recommends draining and rinsing canned beans to reduce sodium by up to 40%, making them a quick and heart-smart option. “Add chickpeas to grain bowls or salads, stir black beans into soups or tacos or puree white beans into dips and sauces for extra creaminess and nutrition,” she says. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-3-cottage-cheese-or-low-fat-strained-greek-style-yogurt"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 3. Cottage Cheese or Low-Fat Strained (Greek-Style) Yogurt &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Nearly half of women over 50 have some form of low bone mass,” says Weiss. After menopause, declining estrogen levels can accelerate bone loss, increasing the risk of osteoporosis—a condition where bones become weaker and more prone to fractures.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To support bone health, both Weiss and Shapiro recommend foods that offer a combination of calcium and protein, which are key components of strong, healthy bones. Two excellent low-fat options within the Mediterranean diet are strained (Greek-style) yogurt and cottage cheese. For example, one cup of Greek yogurt offers about 20 grams of protein and 220 mg of calcium, while one cup of cottage cheese provides 24 grams of protein and 227 mg of calcium.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Shapiro enjoys &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-high-protein-upgrade-for-your-morning-toast-11681776" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;cottage cheese on toast&lt;/a&gt; with sliced tomatoes and fresh pepper, with berries and nuts or as a substitute for sour cream or mayo in recipes. Weiss suggests using strained (Greek-style) yogurt or cottage cheese in smoothies, as a base for savory dips or in breakfast parfaits.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-4-nuts"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 4. Nuts  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Another Mediterranean staple, nuts are valued for their rich flavor and impressive nutrient profile, making them a delicious and healthy addition to your diet. “Nuts offer healthy fats, fiber and plant-based protein,” says Weiss. “They also provide vitamin E (a potent antioxidant linked to cognitive health), magnesium (important for bone health), and, in the case of walnuts, plant-based omega-3 fats,” says Weiss. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Beyond their nutrient content, nuts can also support weight management—a common challenge with age. In fact, one study found that higher nut consumption was associated with lower body fat, likely due to increased satiety.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; However, given their high-calorie content, it’s important not to overdo it. Weiss recommends consuming a small handful (around one ounce) of nuts daily. “Sprinkle them onto leafy green salads, stir into cooked oatmeal, or finely chop and mix with breadcrumbs to create a crisp, flavorful coating for baked chicken or fish. Toasting them first really enhances flavor,” she says.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-5-fatty-fish"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 5. Fatty Fish &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Fatty fish, a major star of the Mediterranean diet, can reduce your risk of cognitive decline and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7920294/foods-to-eat-every-day-for-brain-health/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;support brain health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Fatty fish are a top source of &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/foods-with-as-many-omega-3s-as-salmon-11681920" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;omega-3 fatty acids&lt;/a&gt;, especially EPA and DHA. These fats are “linked to better brain function, reduced inflammation and lower risk of cardiovascular disease,” says Weiss. However, “women do not get enough omega-3s,” Shapiro adds, emphasizing the need to make these fats a regular part of the diet. That’s why Weiss recommends that women include SMASH fish—salmon, mackerel, anchovies, sardines and herring—at least twice a week to help meet their omega-3 needs. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “They also provide vitamin D, which is crucial for calcium absorption,” Shapiro adds. Together, these nutrients support strong, healthy bones and can be challenging to get through diet.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To add more fatty fish to your diet, visit a local seafood market for the catch of the day or try convenient, budget-friendly canned varieties that are just as nutritious.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The Mediterranean diet is a great way for women over 50 to promote long-term health. It includes foods like leafy greens, beans, low-fat dairy, nuts and fish, which provide key nutrients for this stage of life—such as calcium, vitamin D, fiber, protein and omega-3 fatty acids. They’re also accessible and convenient choices. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Shapiro reminds us that, “Consistency in your food choices matters more than perfection. Eating well isn’t about restriction, it’s about making smart, nourishing choices most of the time that fit into your life and support how you want to feel and function every day.” She adds, “Don’t underestimate the power of hydration, regular movement and sleep. These work hand in hand with nutrition to support healthy aging.”&lt;br&gt;

People in coastal areas tend to live longer than the national average, while those in urban areas near inland rivers or lakes may live slightly shorter lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why is the ocean different from inland water?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; Coastal areas offer milder temperatures, better air quality, more recreation, and higher income—all of which support longevity. In contrast, inland urban waterways are often linked to pollution, poverty, and flood risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Are rural areas near water any different?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; Rural residents near water appear to gain some health and lifespan benefits, though not as consistently as coastal dwellers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;A new study shows that living near the ocean may be linked to a longer life—while living near inland rivers or lakes in urban areas may actually shorten it. Researchers analyzed data from over 66,000 U.S. census tracts and found coastal residents live, on average, at least a year longer than the national average.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Benefits may be tied to cleaner air, better weather, and increased physical activity near coastlines, while inland water areas—especially in cities—were associated with pollution, poverty, and increased health risks. The findings suggest not all “blue spaces” are equal when it comes to your lifespan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Longevity Boost:&lt;/strong&gt; Coastal residents may live one year longer than the U.S. average.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Urban Inland Risk:&lt;/strong&gt; City dwellers near rivers or lakes may have &lt;em&gt;lower&lt;/em&gt; life expectancy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Environmental Divide:&lt;/strong&gt; Air quality, temperature, and socioeconomic conditions likely explain the difference.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Ohio State University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Living within miles of the ocean breeze may be linked to a longer life, but you shouldn’t count on the same benefits if you live in a riverside city, suggests a recent study.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers from The Ohio State University analyzed population data — including life expectancy — in more than 66,000 census tracts throughout the U.S. and compared it based on proximity to waterways. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their study was published online in the journal &lt;em&gt;Environmental Research&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A correlation between longer life expectancy and water was clear for those who live within about 30 miles of an ocean or gulf. But for those who live in urban settings and near an inland body of water larger than 4 square miles, the opposite was true.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rural residents who live near water may also reap some lifespan advantages, according to the research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Overall, the coastal residents were expected to live a year or more longer than the 79-year average, and those who lived in more urban areas near inland rivers and lakes were likely to die by about 78 or so. The coastal residents probably live longer due to a variety of intertwined factors,” said lead researcher Jianyong “Jamie” Wu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analysis suggested that milder temperatures, better air quality, more opportunities for recreation, better transportation, less susceptibility to drought, and higher incomes could all be contributors to a better outlook for coastal residents compared to those who live inland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“On the other side, pollution, poverty, lack of safe opportunities to be physically active and an increased risk of flooding are likely drivers of these differences,” said Yanni Cao, a postdoctoral researcher who worked on the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most critical difference the researchers found is that coastal areas experience fewer hot days and lower maximum temperatures compared to inland water areas. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous research has found a connection between living near water and better health measures, including higher physical activity levels, lower obesity rates and improved heart health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That prompted Wu to wonder if there could be a link between “blue space” living and longer lives, and how that relationship might differ depending on the type of neighborhood people call home, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We thought it was possible that any type of ‘blue space’ would offer some beneficial effects, and we were surprised to find such a significant and clear difference between those who live near coastal waters and those who live near inland waters,” said Wu, an assistant professor of environmental health sciences at The Ohio State University College of Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We found a clear difference — in coastal areas, people are living longer,” said Wu, adding that the study is the first to comprehensively and systematically examine the relationship between various types of “blue space” and longevity in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cao said she was especially curious about how this data might provide insights into the trends in life expectancy in the U.S. compared to other wealthy nations. In the past several years, the U.S. experienced a sharper decline and a slower rebound in life expectancy than peer countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s likely that various social determinants of health, including complex environmental factors, that contribute to health inequities are playing a key role in the differences we saw,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ria Martins, a graduate student in public health, was also a co-author.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this longevity and neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#e78495868982c9d6d6a7889492c9828392" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Misti Crane&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://osu.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Ohio State University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Misti Crane – Ohio State University&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2025.121981" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Unveiling complexity in blue spaces and life expectancy&lt;/a&gt;” by Jianyong “Jamie” Wu et al. &lt;em&gt;Environmental Research&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unveiling complexity in blue spaces and life expectancy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although growing evidence supports the positive impact of blue spaces on human health, research on their association with life expectancy remains limited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study examines the association between coastal and inland waters and life expectancy across 66,263 census tracts in the United States, incorporating socioeconomic, demographic, and geographic factors through multiple linear and multi-level regression as well as spatial regression models, supplemented by sensitivity analyses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our findings indicate that proximity to coastal waters is positively associated with life expectancy, whereas proximity to inland waters is negatively associated. We used the mutual information model to identify key factors contributing to these differences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through a comparative analysis of coastal and inland water environments, we found that longer life expectancy near coastal waters may be linked to more favorable environmental and socioeconomic conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These include milder temperatures, better air quality, enhanced recreational opportunities, improved transportation, lower drought susceptibility, and higher income levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The urban–rural analysis further reveals that proximity to coastal waters is positively associated with life expectancy in both settings, whereas inland waters show differing associations, being negative in urban areas and positive in rural areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to examining these blue space patterns, this study also considers broader socioeconomic and environmental factors related to life expectancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings highlight the importance of integrating blue spaces and other key environmental and socioeconomic factors into urban planning, residential development, and healthcare environment design to improve life expectancy and health equity.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 29 Jul 2025 12:36:44 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMickFVX3lxTE1Kci1QWFNXUmlYSWxYOHNjT3pscmxtc0FuMzk5QzV6UmVkcEJwalAtbjU3UlExZXRoWDRIWmEwVDlvOUVBX3FrNmM2bFlUMkFxRHYwTDM2N1plY0YyejB4ZUtnXzFwVmNYMkVsME1uaVoydw</guid></item><item><title>体内糖尿病的7个早期征兆-印度时报</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi0gFBVV95cUxQN01fN0JFTWh1S2ZaMVZUbUFQOFhRVGUxb1Rma041S0Q1Zy1jbGp2RGVISlp5RkVRVjBieWtnRm9BRmRfOExzU1dqR0UtM1dBOXJZMG05LXBYX1FZbW80Q2xCS1k4Y0pnU094S1JPWk1hVDBuUDlZTFZZQmZROFdaX0JSel9SdEJzUG9XT1Q5ZjZyWVJLbVJYbnRRVGx3Z1JJTEpCMDZLb0x5eHNreDJDclF6TE81T2ZfZWZtZHpWRmxmX280WXZXR29lLU54QTAtcVE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="COQxt" data-ua-type="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the more serious and early signs of diabetes is nerve damage, also called diabetic neuropathy.

This is caused by high blood sugar levels that silently damage the nerve endings. If left undetected or untreated, it can even lead to permanent nerve damage in the long run.

This makes it crucial to understand the warning signs of this kind of cancer and who it commonly occurs in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“It’s typically detected in post-menopausal women, so women after the age of menopause, after they’ve not had a cycle for greater than one year,” said Hoskins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Uterine cancer is most common in this population, which tends to be women over the age of 50. In women who have gone through menopause, the sign of uterine cancer is often post-menopausal bleeding, she noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“If they suddenly start bleeding, they should call their gynecologist or their health care provider and say, ‘This is what’s going on,’ and that doctor, then, in turn, should see and examine the patient,” added Vaidya.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Pelvic pain or discomfort is also a red flag, Hoskins said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; Maskot / Getty Images/Maskot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The doctor may order testing to look at the uterus, such as an ultrasound, and will likely also do a biopsy on tissue from the uterus, said Vaidya.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Those are the ways that, if someone’s having symptoms, that we can try to test and look for it,” Vaidya said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The cancer isn’t as common in pre-menopausal women, but it can still happen, said Hoskins. Symptoms in this group include irregular heavy bleeding or bleeding between periods, Hoskins added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;This doesn’t mean that any period irregularity or heavy bleeding is cancer, though, so, don’t panic, said Vaidya. There can be many common reasons for heavier or irregular periods such as fibroids or a polyp, she noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“But it does make sense for women to think about their body, to notice if there’s a change, and especially when we think of pre-menopausal women ... it is good, if you’re familiar with your normal [cycle] to then be able to report an abnormal [cycle],” Vaidya said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Certain people are at higher risk of uterine cancer.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/jillhamilton/happy-ending-massage-for-women?utm_source=yahoo-recirc-links" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:I’m A Middle-Aged Woman.

Hoskins explained what that means: “Any woman with a uterus needs to have estrogen and progesterone — that helps counterbalance any type of effect on the endometrium,” Hoskins said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;It’s common for women to &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/menopause/in-depth/hormone-therapy/art-20046372" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:take hormone therapy;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;take hormone therapy&lt;/a&gt; to counteract menopause symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“I think most providers know that you need to not just prescribe estrogen, but estrogen and progesterone to protect the uterus, if they’re using any type of hormone replacement,” Hoskins noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;If you are prescribed hormone replacement pills, be sure to follow the directions from your provider, and don’t skip out on your progesterone medication, Hoskins added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Black women, particularly, have higher rates of death from uterine cancer.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; JGI/Tom Grill / Getty Images/Tetra images RF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Recent research &lt;a href="https://aacrjournals.org/cebp/article-abstract/34/7/1156/763042/Projected-Trends-in-the-Incidence-and-Mortality-of?redirectedFrom=fulltext" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:out of Columbia University;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;out of Columbia University&lt;/a&gt; and published in the American Association for Cancer Research used current data and modeling tools to predict what uterine cancer rates and mortality may look like in 30 years — and it paints a bleak picture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“I thought it was scary,” said Hoskins. In 2050, it’s expected that uterine cancer incidence and deaths will increase. Uterine cancer cases are expected to &lt;a href="https://www.cuimc.columbia.edu/news/uterine-cancer-rates-predicted-rise-especially-among-black-women" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:increase by 50% in Black women in 2050;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;increase by 50% in Black women in 2050&lt;/a&gt; and 29% in white women when compared to 2018 data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Currently, “Black women may be diagnosed at the same rate as white women, but are two times more likely to die,” according to Hoskins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The exact reasons why Black women are at higher risk aren’t known, but Hoskins has a few ideas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; MementoJpeg / Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/hannahloewentheil/mundane-behaviors-impact-health?utm_source=yahoo-recirc-links" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk='slk:Medical Professionals Are Sharing "Mundane" Things That Actually Make So Many People Sick;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas' class="link "&gt;Medical Professionals Are Sharing "Mundane" Things That Actually Make So Many People Sick&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“In endometrial cancer, there’s about eight different subtypes [and] Black women tend to have cancers that are more aggressive,” said Hoskins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Systemic racism could also be a reason — maybe the patient wasn’t heard by their doctor, Hoskins noted, or perhaps they didn’t have swift access to care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“There are some things that I do think need to be studied more, but we should discuss it, and that may be use of relaxers ... as a potential risk,” said Hoskins, referring to recent research showing that the chemicals in hair-straightening relaxers &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/chemical-hair-products-cancer_l_63500ffae4b08e0e6089dd1a" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:put folks at higher risk of uterine cancer;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;put folks at higher risk of uterine cancer&lt;/a&gt;.

It is a weak estrogen, and fat cells don’t produce the balancing hormone progesterone at all. So for patients who are obese, who are over their ideal body weight, those patients will have estrone in their body that stimulates the lining of the uterus, and because they don’t have the balanced progesterone from those same fat cells over time, those are women that are at increased risk for developing this endometrial pre-cancer and endometrial cancers,” explained Vaidya.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;It’s important to note that obesity itself isn’t an indicator of one’s health, but there are cases, like this one, when it can impact chances of developing certain diseases. And in this case, Vaidya added that the more overweight someone is, the higher their risk is for uterine cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;This all may sound scary, but understanding the risk factors and the signs of uterine cancer can help you take control of your health and know when to bring a specific issue to your doctor’s attention. &lt;em&gt;This article originally appeared on&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/uterine-cancer-rates-increasing-black-white-women_l_6880dea5e4b0f277db4544ae" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:HuffPost.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;em&gt;HuffPost.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Also in Goodful: &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/hannahloewentheil/trends-people-wont-partake-in?utm_source=yahoo-recirc-links" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk='slk:19 "Garbage" Modern Trends People Refuse To Partake In Despite Their Popularity;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas' class="link "&gt;19 "Garbage" Modern Trends People Refuse To Partake In Despite Their Popularity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Also in Goodful: &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/alanavalko/unhinged-microfeminisms?utm_source=yahoo-recirc-links" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:&amp;quot;He Thinks This Is Hostile And He Is Correct&amp;quot; — Women Are Sharing The &amp;quot;Unhinged&amp;quot; Ways They Practice Microfeminism That Reaally Grind A Small Man's Gears;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;"He Thinks This Is Hostile And He Is Correct" — Women Are Sharing The "Unhinged" Ways They Practice Microfeminism That Reaally Grind A Small Man's Gears&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Also in Goodful: &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/lizmrichardson/doctors-shocking-things-bad-for-your-health?utm_source=yahoo-recirc-links" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk='slk:17 "Bad" Habits That Are Seriously Harming Your Health, Straight From Doctors And Scientists;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas' class="link "&gt;17 "Bad" Habits That Are Seriously Harming Your Health, Straight From Doctors And Scientists&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/jillianwilson/uterine-cancer-rates-increasing-women?utm_source=yahoo-recirc-links" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Read it on BuzzFeed.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Read it on BuzzFeed.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo Home</author><pubDate>Tue, 29 Jul 2025 11:16:02 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifkFVX3lxTE9pS3FCRHdHWVE3ZGZ2eGc2Q3R5VjlwcUt1TS1IWWcwUWctM2FWUVhTakpfamRzQ3Z2RGRGajdVMVZtREMtMmxpamVYcE1JeVlnQkhkLUU4dTV1Z1EyS2ZNNzBQbWh5c3h1T1Y1SXI5TS1IbnBiMHdjTVpCN2xJUQ</guid></item><item><title>这种癌症类型在所有女性中都在上升，其中一个群体应该特别担忧- BuzzFeed</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilAFBVV95cUxQdjZMeGhBWFFPVW51dktWSHFjNWl3NnZWODhsYjZaVDd6S29lc2ppbUVXME1VX1c0eHhDc1dNaE5BaUoxcXdnSU9yWl9jTG1ocU0yY1lNYVUzMjR0Ul9YTVNYWlEyMXRNWHpTRmxrdGxpQXVHcC13dGZkeWEyM2VpeTE4Tm1FTjJmUDRNWnV3M0l1WlNR?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="subbuzz buzz-width--standard__subbuzz buzz-type--long__subbuzz subbuzz-text

&lt;p&gt;There were nearly 70,000 cases of uterine cancer in 2024, &lt;a href="https://seer.cancer.gov/statfacts/html/corp.html" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7914767" data-affiliate="true"&gt;according to the National Cancer Institute&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Uterine cancer involves cancer of what many folks think of as the womb, “or the place where a pregnancy is housed and grows,” said &lt;a href="https://doctors.hackensackmeridianhealth.org/provider/ami-p-vaidya/1318087" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7914767" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Dr. Ami Vaidya&lt;/a&gt;, a gynecological cancer doctor at Hackensack Meridian Health in New Jersey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The uterus has two components; there’s a muscle wall and there’s a lining, an inner portion of the uterus that consists of glandular tissue,” Vaidya explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“And I mentioned these two different areas because very different cancers can start in the two different areas of the uterus,” she noted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s more common to see cancer in the lining, which is known as endometrial cancer, Vaidya said. “And although there are several different types within that category, as a group, that is more common than the cancers that can start in the muscle wall — the cancers that start in the muscle wall are called sarcomas or leiomyosarcomas,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://foundationforwomenscancer.org/gynecologic-cancers/gynecologic-cancer-types/uterine-endometrial-cancer-gtd/" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7914767" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Uterine cancer&lt;/a&gt; rates are rising, said &lt;a href="https://www.medstarhealth.org/doctors/ebony-r-hoskins-md" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7914767" data-affiliate="true"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dr. Ebony Hoskins&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a gynecologic oncologist in Washington, D.C., and member of the &lt;a href="https://www.sgo.org/about-sgo/" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7914767" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Society of Gynecologic Oncology&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rates of endometrial cancer, specifically, have actually surpassed ovarian cancer rates.

Here’s what to know:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There isn’t currently a screening test, but there are symptoms you should look out for.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

							&lt;p&gt;Have you ever found yourself in a conversation where the other person just won't look at you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe they're staring at their phone, gazing out the window, or studying their shoes like they're the most fascinating thing in the room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's unsettling, isn't it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your mind starts racing—Are they bored?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Angry?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hiding something?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did I say something wrong?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used to think people who avoided eye contact were just being rude or disinterested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But after diving into the psychology behind this behavior, I realized there's usually much more going on beneath the surface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The truth is, when someone can't meet your gaze, their brain is often working overtime—processing emotions, managing stress, or navigating complex social dynamics that have nothing to do with you personally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding what's really happening in those moments can completely shift how you interpret these interactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let's explore the eight most common thoughts running through someone's mind when they're looking everywhere but at you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. They're feeling socially anxious about being judged&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever notice how some people seem to shrink away during conversations, their eyes darting anywhere but your face?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a good chance they're battling social anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As noted by researchers at &lt;a href="https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/news/2023/04/why-avoid-my-gaze"&gt;Universiteit Leiden&lt;/a&gt;, people high in social anxiety avoid eye contact in real-life conversations to dial down feared negative evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think about it—when you're worried about being judged, direct eye contact can feel incredibly vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's like opening a window to your soul when you'd rather keep the curtains drawn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their averted gaze isn't about you being intimidating or uninteresting. Instead, they're trying to create a buffer zone where they feel safer and less exposed to potential criticism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. They're trying to hide a lie&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember that time you asked your teenager where they were last night and suddenly they became fascinated with the kitchen counter?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turns out, there's solid psychology behind this behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers found that liars are more likely to avert their gaze, and forcing eye contact actually &lt;a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/let-their-words-do-the-talking/202009/3-simple-techniques-detect-deception"&gt;boosts lie detection&lt;/a&gt;—suggesting gaze avoidance is a sneaky self-protection move.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When someone is being deceptive, maintaining eye contact feels risky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's like they instinctively know that their eyes might give them away, so they look elsewhere to maintain their story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, not everyone who avoids eye contact is lying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if you notice this behavior combined with other signs like fidgeting or inconsistent details, their mind might be working overtime to keep their deception intact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3. They're feeling ashamed or embarrassed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's something particularly vulnerable about eye contact when you're carrying shame or embarrassment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think about the last time you had to admit a mistake to someone, or when you were caught off-guard by a question about something you'd rather not discuss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your instinct was probably to look down or away, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shame has a way of making us want to hide, and avoiding eye contact is one of the most immediate ways to create that sense of concealment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's like their brain is saying, "If I can't see the judgment in your eyes, maybe it's not really there."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This response is deeply human and often automatic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When someone feels exposed or regretful about something, looking away becomes a protective mechanism—a way to maintain some dignity while they process their emotions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4. They're showing you respect according to their cultural background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's something that completely changed my perspective on eye contact: what feels rude to you might actually be a sign of deep respect to someone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cross-cultural research found that in some East Asian and Caribbean cultures, sustained eye contact is &lt;a href="https://www.weforum.org/stories/2015/02/the-impact-of-making-eye-contact-around-the-world/"&gt;considered rude&lt;/a&gt;, so people avert their gaze to show respect—not disinterest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I learned this the hard way during my corporate days when I misinterpreted a colleague's behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought she was being dismissive during our meetings because she rarely looked directly at me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later, I discovered that in her culture, maintaining eye contact with authority figures or during serious conversations was seen as confrontational.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a humbling reminder that our social norms aren't universal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What feels like avoidance to you might actually be their way of honoring the conversation and showing you the utmost courtesy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes the most respectful thing someone can do is look away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;5. They're feeling overwhelmed by the intensity of the moment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes avoiding eye contact isn't about what someone is thinking—it's about what they're feeling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you ever been in a conversation that felt too heavy, too emotional, or just too much?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe someone was sharing deeply personal news, or you were having one of those heart-to-heart talks that cuts straight to the core.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In moments like these, direct eye contact can feel like staring into a spotlight when you're already feeling exposed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The emotional intensity becomes almost too much to bear, so looking away provides a necessary breather.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not that they don't care about what you're saying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, it might be the opposite—they care so much that they need to create some emotional distance just to stay present in the conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think of it as their way of regulating their feelings so they can actually absorb what's happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;6. They're distracted by something else entirely&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's be honest—sometimes the reason has nothing to do with psychology and everything to do with a wandering mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe they're mentally rehearsing an important presentation they have later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps they're worried about a family situation or trying to remember if they locked the front door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or maybe that notification sound from their phone completely derailed their train of thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We live in a world full of distractions, and our brains aren't always great at compartmentalizing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When someone's mind is elsewhere, maintaining eye contact becomes surprisingly difficult because they're not fully present in the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This doesn't necessarily mean they don't value your conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It might just mean they're human, dealing with the same mental juggling act we all face daily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;7. They need mental space to process something difficult&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you ever noticed how people look up at the ceiling when you ask them a tough question?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or how they stare off into the distance when trying to remember something important?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn't absent-mindedness—it's actually their brain being incredibly smart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experiments showed that adults (and even 8-year-olds) look away when &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.3758/BF03195338.pdf"&gt;answering tough questions&lt;/a&gt; because averting gaze frees up mental bandwidth for problem-solving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think of eye contact as mentally demanding. When someone is trying to work through a complex thought, calculate something in their head, or recall a specific memory, their brain needs all available resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking away is like closing unnecessary browser tabs on a computer—it frees up processing power for the task at hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if someone breaks eye contact mid-conversation, they might just be giving your question the thoughtful attention it deserves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;8. They're trying to maintain emotional boundaries&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes people avoid eye contact as a way of protecting their emotional space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This might happen when they're going through something difficult and don't want to invite questions or concern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or maybe they're in a professional setting where they need to keep things business-focused rather than personal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eye contact creates connection, but not everyone is ready for that level of connection in every moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking away can be their way of saying, "I'm here, I'm participating, but I need to keep some walls up right now."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not necessarily about rejecting you or the conversation. Instead, it might be about self-preservation—maintaining the emotional energy they need to get through their day without becoming too vulnerable or invested in every interaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next time someone avoids eye contact with you, take a deep breath before jumping to conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More often than not, their wandering gaze has absolutely nothing to do with you and everything to do with what's happening in their internal world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether they're managing anxiety, processing complex thoughts, or simply navigating their own cultural norms, there's usually a very human reason behind the behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This awareness has completely changed how I approach these situations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of feeling rejected or wondering what I did wrong, I try to extend a little grace and patience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I'll even adjust my own approach—maybe I'll speak a bit more gently if I sense anxiety, or give them extra time to think if they seem to be wrestling with something difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the psychology behind eye contact avoidance doesn't just make us better communicators—it makes us more compassionate people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in a world where we're quick to misinterpret each other's actions, that's something we could all use a little more of.&lt;/p&gt;

It can lead to long COVID, hospitalization and even death,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“COVID is dangerous, and particularly dangerous for folks who have immunosuppression, other chronic medical illnesses, or people who are older, and these medications can help reduce those risks,” Coles added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;COVID symptoms can look a lot like the symptoms of other upper respiratory infections, which makes testing important.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think with every new variant, there is this narrative that suggests that we could tell if someone has COVID based on their symptoms, and that the symptoms are significantly different or unique, but all in all, they appear to be undistinguishable from any other upper respiratory infection,” Harmony said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, congestion can happen whether it’s COVID or a cold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I would encourage everyone to test if you’re symptomatic,” added Coles.

And, again, if you’re high-risk or have concerning symptoms, get medical attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There are several things you can do to stay healthy, too.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;To keep yourself from getting infected, “wear a high-quality mask, like an N95, in crowded indoor places ... wash [your] hands regularly and make sure that the folks around [you] are feeling well,” Coles said, and added that if a loved one tells you they have the sniffles, consider rescheduling that get-together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even before all of those preventative measures, make sure you have the latest COVID shot. “Vaccination is still, by far, the best way to protect yourself and your loved ones,” said Coles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who are at high risk of developing COVID can get a second dose of the current COVID vaccine to stay protected during the current summer increase in cases, Coles noted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry-support-huffpost-mid-article" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title default-title"&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--first"&gt;20 Years Of&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--second"&gt;Free&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--third"&gt;Journalism&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-once-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-canceled-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message-container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message support-huffpost__message--main"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Only after I’ve guaranteed his anonymity — Jeff is not his real name — does he share the whole story: “I was in my early-to-mid-30s, and there was significant bleeding from my &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/2022/12/the-year-i-spent-with-my-butt-out.html"&gt;butt&lt;/a&gt; after a bowel movement.” That had never happened before, and Jeff had no idea &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; it was happening. Panicked, he raced to the ER. “They told me I had internal hemorrhoids and one had become inflamed,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdn7yrjy001o3b79ogibo4ls@published" data-word-count="187"&gt;In a sense, we all have hemorrhoids. The term refers to both the anal ailment and the anatomy it affects: the cushiony rings of veins that line the anal canal and swell and expand to prevent stool from leaking before we’re ready to release it. “You can also think of them like a gasket in an engine or a rubber ring in a water faucet,” says &lt;a href="https://profiles.mountsinai.org/sanghyun-a-kim"&gt;Dr. Sanghyun Kim&lt;/a&gt;, associate professor of surgery at the Icahn School of Medicine and site chief of colon and rectal surgery at Mount Sinai. When hemorrhoids are taxed beyond their limit — from too much pressure — they swell &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; much, bulging like a kinked hose. That’s when hemorrhoids become varicose veins in your butt (or just outside it). And they are ubiquitous. “I would say we are absolutely seeing an increased incidence in hemorrhoids,” says &lt;a href="https://weillcornell.org/feliceschnoll"&gt;Dr. Felice Schnoll-Sussman&lt;/a&gt;, director of the Jay Monahan Center for Gastrointestinal Health at NewYork-Presbyterian and Weill Cornell Medicine, who explained that since the recommended age for a first &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/2021/11/president-kamala-harris.html"&gt;colonoscopy&lt;/a&gt; was recently changed from 50 to 45, more people are being diagnosed with them than ever.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdn9w016000m3b78wn4w51uz@published" data-word-count="85"&gt;Research shows that one in three people in America who undergo a colonoscopy are diagnosed with hemorrhoids and that hemorrhoids account for 4 million doctor’s-office and emergency-room visits annually. Doctors expect this number to continue to rise. It’s estimated that at least &lt;a href="https://www.marketresearchfuture.com/reports/us-hemorrhoids-treatment-market-16261?utm_source=chatgpt.com"&gt;$1.7 billion&lt;/a&gt; is spent on medical hemorrhoid treatments each year, a figure projected to increase another billion dollars by 2034. (In 2017, sales of Preparation H — which can temporarily ease hemorrhoid pain but does not solve the problem — totaled &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7075634/#R7"&gt;$136 million&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdnafm8t001n3b78bsd7giea@published" data-word-count="102"&gt;Given the nightmare health scenarios that bloody stool can portend (colon cancer, inflammatory bowel disease), a diagnosis of hemorrhoids was a relief for Jeff. He vowed to stop reading on the toilet (which he’d done all his life and which he was told may have caused his hemorrhoids) and to eat more fiber and drink more water so as to strain less. A bowel movement should occur swiftly and effortlessly; some experts &lt;a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/how-long-should-it-take-you-to-have-a-bowel-movement"&gt;say&lt;/a&gt; it should take no more than &lt;a href="https://www.healthpartners.com/blog/healthy-poop-chart/"&gt;two&lt;/a&gt; minutes. Back before his Trump-toadying days, Dr. Mehmet Oz famously &lt;a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/02/04/the-operator"&gt;remarked&lt;/a&gt; that poop should hit the bowl “like a diver from Acapulco.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdn7yrm0001q3b79mpy0z2x0@published" data-word-count="232"&gt;Typically, this is where a hemorrhoid story ends. If your only symptom is occasional blood or intermittent discomfort, doctors often advise that after getting checked out, you wait for things to improve on their own, which they generally do. This is how things transpired for Lana (also not her real name) after she noticed “some minor itchiness and then a weird lump” along with “blood in my poop.” Her doctor told her, “Oh, you probably have hemorrhoids; if they don’t bother you, don’t worry about it.” She made some lifestyle changes, though she admits that toilet-scrolling remained a treasured pastime (“Because phones are interesting,” she tells me). Meanwhile, Jeff hewed to his doctor’s counsel: “Lots of fiber, lots of hydration. Just doing everything I could,” he says. But hemorrhoids are mercurial menaces — sometimes easily vanquished, sometimes not. Though Lana was lax and Jeff meticulous, her hemorrhoids resolved while his persisted, eventually causing him brutal pain on top of the bloody mess he would ashamedly clean up each time he moved his bowels. On Reddit, many others have shared their private ordeals with their own intractable hemorrhoids. “Is anybody else severely depressed because of these things?” one &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hemorrhoid/comments/1liwi6x/anybody_else/"&gt;asked&lt;/a&gt; in r/hemorrhoid. Another answered, “It’s all I think about all day.” A woman going by u/misssorebutt &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hemorrhoid/comments/13d7gaf/hemorrhoids_are_ruining_my_life/"&gt;called&lt;/a&gt; her hemorrhoids “the worst pain imaginable.” The title of her post is “Hemorrhoids are ruining my life.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdn7ys18001s3b79h1l7j1j1@published" data-word-count="69"&gt;Some reasons for this problem are becoming clearer. Many of us are doing our damnedest to let hemorrhoids flourish: We sit too much, eat too poorly, drink too little water, work out too hard, poop too aggressively, bidet too ferociously, and, perhaps most prevalently these days, stick around too long — chronically scrolling on the toilet is as surefire a path to hemorrhoids as one could hope to find.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdn7ys2e001t3b7992ith5nn@published" data-word-count="92"&gt;A 2021 &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/93-of-young-people-admit-to-using-their-phones-on-the-toilet-according-to-new-survey-301302005.html"&gt;survey&lt;/a&gt; revealed that 73 percent of people bring their phone with them into the bathroom; among respondents ages 18 to 29, that number climbed to 93 percent. While it’s possible that these people are just lugging their phones along for safekeeping, it seems unlikely given a more recent small &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/using-your-phone-on-the-toilet-may-dramatically-increase-risk-of-hemorrhoids"&gt;survey&lt;/a&gt;, which found that of the survey subjects who reported having hemorrhoids, 93 percent admitted to using their phones while on the toilet at least once a week. The correlation between increasingly ubiquitous toilet-based phone usage and hemorrhoid prevalence seems clear.&lt;/p&gt;

His hemorrhoids began to protrude, and he could no longer push them back. Jeff saw a specialist who attempted a rubber-band ligation, or RBL. For decades, this has been the most common — and, in many gastroenterology practices, the only — nonsurgical treatment for hemorrhoids. It’s a five-minute procedure in which a rubber band is placed at the base of a hemorrhoid, cutting off its blood supply to shrink it. Patients are often told that the procedure isn’t that painful since the rubber band is placed at a part of the hemorrhoid &lt;a href="https://oregansystem.com/online-guides/hemorrhoid-banding/"&gt;without any pain sensors&lt;/a&gt;. In practice, however, many patients report otherwise. (“I am in agony,” &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hemorrhoid/comments/he5s2r/so_much_pain_from_rubber_band_ligation/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; a post-RBL redditor. “Nothing is helping.”) Says Jeff, “He tried to band a couple of them to see how that would go, with the idea that possibly the rest could be banded as well. But the biggest one was too sensitive — I could feel it being pulled at, and it was painful. So the doctor said it wasn’t a good idea, and surgery was recommended.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdn7z85x002f3b792tzylcb0@published" data-word-count="85"&gt;Hemorrhoidectomies — in which hemorrhoids are excised, or, in a stapled hemorrhoidopexy, stapled to choke their blood supply — are effective &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/procedures/hemorrhoidectomy"&gt;95 percent &lt;/a&gt;of the time. But they have long suffered from a serious PR problem: It’s common knowledge that recovery is painful and long, lasting weeks. “I’ve been doing old-fashioned hemorrhoidectomies for 25 years,” says Kim. “And there is not too much we can do to make the pain better. It does hurt, no matter what we do, because it’s a very sensitive area.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdn7z85y002g3b796cflgwdx@published" data-word-count="67"&gt;For Jeff, recovery from surgery was far worse than he could have anticipated. It started out okay, he says, “because they give you a nerve block so you don’t feel much after.” But all good painkillers must come to an end, and once Jeff’s did, the full picture of what his anus had undergone became clear. “It’s incredibly agonizing to shit through an open wound,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdn7z85y002h3b79q5b4o161@published" data-word-count="142"&gt;To help with the pain, Jeff was given oxycodone, an opiate — a common side effect of which is constipation. This is how the task of defecating became downright life-threatening for him. When he finally had a bowel movement, his bleeding became profuse. Jeff’s wife ran out to buy adult diapers so the pair could go to the ER. It turned out that Jeff had &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6331745/#:~:text=12%E2%80%9315%5D.-,Delayed%20post%2Dhemorrhoidectomy%20bleeding%20(DPHB)%20is%20a%20rare%20but,risk%20factors%20associated%20with%20DPHB."&gt;delayed post-hemorrhoidectomy bleeding&lt;/a&gt;, which affects as many as 10 percent of patients and is more common in men. After a night in the hospital and a quick patch-up of his wound, he underwent blood tests over several months to monitor the severe anemia he suffered thanks to the blood loss. During this period, he was weak, easily fatigued. The surgery was in February; it took until June for Jeff to return to his normal level of activity.&lt;/p&gt;

But fresh avenues for treatment are emerging with some promising to be game-changing.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdn7zo5r00353b79ag8q89n1@published" data-word-count="158"&gt;A newer procedure that Kim favors is &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/transanal-hemorrhoidal-dearterialization"&gt;transanal hemorrhoidal dearterialization&lt;/a&gt;, in which a device is inserted into the anus to locate the artery feeding blood to your hemorrhoids, before another device is inserted to tie that artery off with sutures. “I’ve compared traditional hemorrhoidectomy to THD, and the return-to-work rate was 20 days for hemorrhoidectomy and only three with THD,” Kim says. But because THD can leave deflated skin dangling from the anus, causing cleanliness issues and irritation, Kim has added what he calls an “anal lift.” He uses a barbed tie popularly deployed in face-lifts in Korea, his mother country, called V-Loc sutures. “The sutures have tiny hooks on them with a one-way spike so that when the hook goes in, it won’t come out,” he says. “I can use that to decrease the prolapsed skin.” However, Kim explains, the procedure is sometimes denied by insurance companies for being either too experimental or more expensive than RBL.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdn7zo5s00363b79qjlaiwha@published" data-word-count="146"&gt;That’s a recurring theme I encountered while researching procedures beyond RBL and traditional hemorrhoidectomy: They exist, and they are well proven, but because they are neither familiar nor cheap, they present more challenges in terms of coverage. I spoke with &lt;a href="https://www.med.unc.edu/radiology/people/david-m-mauro/"&gt;Dr. David Mauro&lt;/a&gt;, a vascular surgeon in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, who often &lt;a href="https://healthtalk.unchealthcare.org/embolization-is-a-new-treatment-option-for-hemorrhoids/"&gt;performs&lt;/a&gt; a low-recovery hemorrhoid procedure known as hemorrhoid artery embolization. The procedure involves snaking a catheter through a tiny hole in the groin or wrist down to the artery feeding the hemorrhoid, then delivering typically a combination of tiny metal coils and particles into the blood vessel to block the hemorrhoid’s supply of blood. “There’s a significant subset of patients that recur after banding,” says Mauro, “or banding fails or is intolerable. And that’s where I think hemorrhoidal embolization has a role.” However, a failed banding is often a painful hurdle to clear.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdn7zo5t00373b79r9bovngu@published" data-word-count="147"&gt;A new medtech company is hoping to interrupt this pattern of muscling through banding and surgery before getting effective (but somewhat more experimental) treatment. For the past few years, a company called HemWell has sought to popularize what it describes as a “painless” outpatient procedure that has been approved for use by the FDA. Essentially, a low current from an electrode inserted into the anus causes nearby blood vessels to narrow, shrinking hemorrhoids within minutes. I ask &lt;a href="https://gi.md/reed-hogan-iii/"&gt;Dr. Reed Hogan III&lt;/a&gt;, a gastroenterologist at the GI Associates &amp;amp; Endoscopy Center in Madison, Mississippi, who has performed many Hemwellectomies, to tell me more. “While the patient is asleep,” he says, “the electrode is inserted, and its current creates a chemical reaction within the hemorrhoid blood vessel that shuts down the blood flow coming in but still allows blood to flow out. This decreases the size of the hemorrhoid.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdn7zo5u00383b79vpuplzcm@published" data-word-count="160"&gt;I ask Hogan if the procedure is really as remarkable as it seems: Patients are comfortably sedated, and supposedly the recovery time is nonexistent, while clinical efficacy (more than &lt;a href="https://www.dhcoftx.com/dhc-procedures/hemwell/#:~:text=Why%20choose%20to%20have%20a,sigmoidoscopy%2C%20depending%20on%20individual%20circumstances."&gt;90 percent&lt;/a&gt;) is apparently more predictable than in RBL (&lt;a href="https://heritagesurgicalgroup.com/rubber-band-ligation-bergen-county/"&gt;between 70 to 90 percent&lt;/a&gt;). “I think this is a paradigm shift for hemorrhoid treatment,” he tells me. “I think it should be offered in every GI clinic across the country because it’s so well tolerated by patients.” Hogan sings HemWell’s praises so profusely that I ask point-blank if he is being paid to spread its gospel. He assures me that he has not received a dime. He now performs Hemwellectomies on 90 percent of his hemorrhoid patients, and his father, also a gastroenterologist in the practice, is a fellow convert. “Normally I hate to use the term &lt;em&gt;painless&lt;/em&gt;, but in two years of doing these, I’ve had about five people need an Advil or a Tylenol,” the senior Hogan tells me.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdn7zo5u00393b79gw7faq30@published" data-word-count="52"&gt;As with other nontraditional therapies, HemWell is theoretically covered by insurance but often only if you’ve exhausted the standard options. And if you don’t happen to live near a physician who’s using the procedure — I found only about a dozen across the country — you may have to stick with RBL.&lt;/p&gt;

A pregnant person’s blood volume &lt;a href="https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/encyclopedia/content?contenttypeid=134&amp;amp;contentid=9#:~:text=Varicose%20veins%20occur%20when%20veins,the%20pelvis%2C%20altering%20blood%20flow"&gt;increases&lt;/a&gt; by as much as &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/pregnancy-week-by-week/in-depth/pregnancy/art-20045977"&gt;50 percent,&lt;/a&gt; which can enlarge those veins. Hormones released during pregnancy can relax the walls of their blood vessels, making them more susceptible to swelling. Pregnancy also causes constipation. Then there’s the final boss of anorectal straining, vaginal delivery, which leaves many new moms with hemorrhoids postpartum.&lt;/p&gt;

Her luck ran out when she became pregnant with her first child. “Before pregnancy,” she says, “I’d have a lump I’d barely pay attention to, and it would resolve itself. But during pregnancy, they got worse, and they’ve never gone away. They’re just hanging out” — literally and figuratively — “and they’re probably a permanent fixture, because no &lt;em&gt;way&lt;/em&gt; am I having surgery.” Though Lana’s hemorrhoids are a nuisance when it’s time to wipe (“They make the topography more complicated,” she says), they still don’t hurt. For unknown thousands, this is the status quo: a lifelong anatomical annoyance one must learn to live around.&lt;/p&gt;

Timely treatment (albeit paid for out of pocket) increases the odds of avoiding surgery.&lt;/p&gt;

Few parts of the body are more freighted with taboo and disgust than the human anus. It is, after all, where poop comes out, poop being among the ultimate embodiments of &lt;em&gt;the abject &lt;/em&gt;— all the stuff, according to critical theory, that’s so horrifying and odious it has the power to disrupt the very social order if not hidden or contained. That’s a lot of pressure on one little ring of muscle.&lt;/p&gt;

However, what may seem minor or routine could, in fact, be an early sign of something far more serious: a heart attack.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Early signs of a heart attack&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Dinesh stressed that early detection and immediate intervention can dramatically improve outcomes of a heart-related ailment—yet this is often hindered by the vague or atypical ways symptoms present themselves, especially in younger populations. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="inlineIMG"&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;img data-src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2024/12/23/original/pexels-towfiqu-barbhuiya-3440682-14569658_1734957756809.jpg" class="lazy" src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/550x309.jpg" alt="All chest pain originates from the heart.

Gastrointestinal, muscular, or respiratory causes can also produce similar sensations. (Pexels)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Not every heart attack begins with crushing chest pain. In fact, many people, particularly women and those under 50, may experience subtler symptoms,” he stressed. He suggested some early signs to look out for:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Discomfort or tightness in the chest&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pain that radiates to the arm, neck, jaw, or back&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Shortness of breath&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Unexplained fatigue&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cold sweats&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Feeling of light-headedness&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Some individuals may only feel a mild heaviness or pressure in the chest, which comes and goes. Because the pain is not always severe or continuous, it is frequently dismissed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Dinesh cautioned, “It is worth noting that not all chest pain originates from the heart. Gastrointestinal, muscular, or respiratory causes can also produce similar sensations. However, given the potential consequences, it is always safer to rule out a cardiac cause first.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He recommended simple diagnostic tools like an electrocardiogram (ECG), blood tests for cardiac enzymes, and non-invasive imaging, which can provide clarity within minutes. “The cost of ignoring symptoms far outweighs the time or effort involved in getting evaluated,” he added.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;What causes a heart attack?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Per Dr Dinesh, a heart attack, or myocardial infarction, occurs when blood flow to a part of the heart is suddenly blocked, usually by a clot in one of the coronary arteries. This prevents oxygen from reaching the heart muscle, which can cause permanent damage or death if not treated promptly. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="inlineIMG"&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;img data-src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/07/29/550x309/2149485806_1753785122594_1753785131041.jpg" class="lazy" src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/550x309.jpg" alt="Lifestyle risk factors—poor dietary habits, lack of exercise, high stress levels, inadequate sleep, and tobacco use—are significant contributors.

(Freepik)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Challenges faced in detecting underlying heart issues&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In the Indian context, the challenge is compounded by rising cases of cardiovascular disease among younger adults. Lifestyle risk factors—poor dietary habits, lack of exercise, high stress levels, inadequate sleep, and tobacco use—are significant contributors,” Dr Dinesh explained.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Moreover, in urban India, a growing number of individuals in their 30s and 40s are being diagnosed with premature coronary artery disease. Many of them are unaware of their underlying risk, including conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, or high cholesterol, per Dr Dinesh.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to him, another critical factor is delayed response. “Despite experiencing symptoms, people often choose to wait, hoping the discomfort will subside on its own. They may self-medicate with antacids or painkillers, misreading cardiac discomfort as acidity or muscle strain,” he explained.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, this delay can be fatal. “The initial hours after the onset of a heart attack—the so-called ‘golden hours’—are vital. The sooner a blocked artery is reopened, the better the chance of preserving heart muscle and avoiding complications such as heart failure or arrhythmias,” he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Prevention is better than a cure&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stressing that prevention is equally important, Dr Dinesh said that while some risk factors—such as genetics or age—cannot be changed, others can be actively managed. He suggests:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Regular health check-ups&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Maintaining optimal blood pressure and blood sugar levels&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cholesterol control&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Balanced nutrition&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Quitting tobacco&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Regular physical activity&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Effective stress management&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Even small, consistent changes in daily routines can help reduce the likelihood of future cardiac events.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Awareness also plays a vital role,” Dr Dinesh added. “Understanding that heart disease can present differently in different people is crucial. Family members, caregivers, and peers should also be able to recognise the signs and encourage timely medical intervention.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Early symptoms are not always significantly visible. A feeling of unease, a vague pressure, or an unusual fatigue should not be underestimated, particularly if there are other coexisting risk factors,” the cardiologist cautioned.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the end, Dr Dinesh stresses that chest discomfort should never be regarded casually. “While not every episode indicates a heart attack, the cost of inaction can be irreversible. In a condition where time is muscle, prompt medical evaluation is the most powerful tool for survival and recovery. If there is even a slight suspicion that symptoms may be cardiac in origin, seeking medical attention without delay can make all the difference. In cardiac emergencies, time is not just precious—it is life-saving. Let that be reason enough to never ignore what the body is trying to say,” he stated.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This article is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.

 &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Research suggests that walking quickly for just 15 minutes a day could slash the risk of suffering heart disease by up to almost 20 per cent&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over a follow-up of just under 17 years, the researchers discovered that walking fast for as little as 15 minutes per day reduced the risk of all cause mortality by nearly 20 per cent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Writing in the &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.ajpmonline.org/"&gt;American Journal of Preventive Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, they found the effect was most pronounced for cardiovascular disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to Professor Wei Zeng, lead investigator and expert in lifestyle factors and diseases, fast walking could reduce cardiovascular mortality by improving how efficiently the heart works and reducing obesity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This style of exercise has previously been shown to increase &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14931757/juice-heart-attack-risk.html"&gt;VO2-max&lt;/a&gt; — a measure of how much oxygen the body can process during exercise. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A high VO2 max is associated with better physical fitness and lower risk of cardiovascular disease, indicating that the body is efficiently extracting and using oxygen from the blood. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Professor Zeng concluded: 'Brisk walking offers a convenient, accessible and low-impact activity that individuals of all ages and fitness levels can use to improve general health and cardiovascular health specifically.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The experts, lead by Professor Lili Liu, lead author and trainee epidemiologist, are now urging health officials to encourage fast walking within all communities — especially those with limited access to healthcare — and address barriers to daily walking such as safety concerns. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They added: 'Public health campaigns and community-based programmes can emphasise the importance and availability of fast walking to improve health outcomes. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;NHS data shows a rise in the number of younger adults suffering from heart attacks over the past decade. The biggest increase (95 per cent) was recorded in the 25-29 year-old demographic, though as numbers of patients are low even small spikes can look dramatic &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Individuals should strive to incorporate more intense physical activity into their routines, such as brisk walking or other forms of aerobic exercise.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The scientists, however, acknowledged&lt;span&gt; that because physical activity data was only collected at the beginning of the study, changes in activity levels could not be considered. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The paper also had some limitations, they said, including the fact daily walking levels were self-reported. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sedentary lifestyles in the UK, with Brits spending their workhours deskbound, then sitting in a train or car on their way home to sit down in front of the TV, have been estimated to kill thousands each year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The WHO puts the annual global death toll from physical inactivity at around two million per year, making it in the running to be among the top ten leading causes of global death and disability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Physical inactivity has been long linked to health problems like cardiovascular disease as well contributing to health problems like obesity, itself linked to an increased risk of type 2 diabetes and some cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cases of heart attacks, heart failure and strokes among the under-75s had tumbled since the 1960s thanks to plummeting smoking rates, advanced surgical techniques and breakthroughs such as stents and statins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But now, other factors such as slow ambulance response times for category 2 calls in England — which includes suspected heart attacks and strokes — as well as long waits for tests and treatment have also been blamed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

While traditionally associated with muscles and the liver, glycogen appears to accumulate abnormally in neurons affected by Alzheimer’s and other tau-related disorders. Scientists found that this buildup may worsen neurodegeneration by disrupting how cells manage energy and oxidative stress. Their findings, published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42255-025-01314-w" target="_blank"&gt;Nature Metabolism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, suggest that breaking down glycogen could help protect neurons and offer a promising new direction for treating or preventing dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease is a progressive neurological condition that impairs memory, thinking, and behavior. It is the most common cause of dementia, especially among older adults. The disease is marked by two key biological abnormalities in the brain: plaques made of amyloid-beta protein and tangles made of another protein called tau. These protein accumulations disrupt normal cell function, leading to inflammation, cell death, and brain shrinkage over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite extensive research, effective treatments for Alzheimer’s remain elusive. Most drug development has focused on clearing amyloid or tau from the brain, with limited success. Many researchers now believe that other factors, such as energy metabolism, inflammation, and oxidative stress, may play a role in determining who develops the disease and how quickly it progresses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Alzheimer’s disease, first identified over a century ago, remains one of the most challenging neurodegenerative conditions. Despite decades of research and numerous clinical trials aimed at targeting these aggregates, success has been limited,” said study author Pankaj Kapahi, a professor at the Buck Institute for Research on Aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Surprisingly, many people with these protein buildups show little or no cognitive decline, and not everyone with hereditary risk factors develops the disease. This has led scientists to suspect that other overlooked factors may contribute to the onset and progression of Alzheimer’s.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Recent research has started to shine a light on the role of environmental and lifestyle factors—particularly diet—in shaping brain health. That question sparked our curiosity: could a rich diet influence the development of Alzheimer’s?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Glycogen is the storage form of glucose, a sugar that serves as a vital source of energy. The liver and muscles contain most of the body’s glycogen, which is broken down when energy demands increase. The brain, though highly energy-dependent, contains only small amounts of glycogen, mainly in support cells called astrocytes. Neurons—the primary information-processing cells of the brain—have long been thought to store very little glycogen and to rely mainly on a continuous glucose supply from the bloodstream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, recent studies have hinted that neurons might store more glycogen than previously thought, especially in disease states. The Buck Institute researchers were interested in whether abnormal glycogen metabolism might be a hidden driver of Alzheimer’s and related tauopathies, and whether correcting it could slow or prevent the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team used both fruit fly models and human stem cell-derived neurons to study tauopathies—diseases characterized by tau protein accumulation. In the fly experiments, they used genetic tools to overexpress human tau protein, including a mutant version linked to frontotemporal dementia. These flies developed signs of neurodegeneration, such as shortened lifespan, brain cell death, and structural damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers compared flies fed a normal, protein-rich diet to those fed a low-protein, calorie-restricted diet, known to extend lifespan in many species. They also tested the effects of drugs and genetic changes that promote glycogen breakdown. In parallel, they studied neurons derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), including cells with two different tau mutations associated with dementia. These human neurons were grown in the lab and analyzed using fluorescent markers to assess glycogen accumulation, oxidative stress, and related metabolic activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that tau-expressing neurons—both in flies and in human-derived cells—accumulated large amounts of glycogen. This buildup appeared to be linked to the tau protein itself, which physically interacted with glycogen and prevented its breakdown. The result was a toxic cycle: tau caused glycogen to build up, and the glycogen buildup made the tau accumulation worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the researchers restored activity of an enzyme called glycogen phosphorylase (GlyP), which initiates glycogen breakdown, the effects were striking. In both flies and human neurons, breaking down glycogen reduced oxidative stress, lowered tau burden, and prevented cell death. It also extended the lifespan of tau-expressing flies by nearly 70 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather than fueling energy production through glycolysis, the glycogen-derived glucose was diverted into the pentose phosphate pathway. This pathway produces antioxidant molecules like NADPH and glutathione, which protect cells from damage caused by reactive oxygen species. The researchers confirmed that oxidative stress levels dropped sharply in cells with active glycogen breakdown. Blocking this pathway erased the protective effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team also found that dietary restriction increased glycogen phosphorylase activity through a well-known signaling mechanism involving cyclic AMP and protein kinase A. Treating flies with a drug that mimics this pathway had similar effects to calorie restriction, reducing cell death and extending lifespan. This may help explain why drugs used to treat diabetes and promote weight loss—such as GLP-1 agonists—show early signs of benefit in Alzheimer’s trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Sugar metabolism in neurons is different from what was previously believed,” Kapahi told PsyPost. “We found that stored sugars in brain cells can help reduce reactive oxygen species—harmful byproducts of normal metabolism. However, when these sugars accumulate too much, they can bind to toxic protein buildups and make the condition worse. We identified a pathway that breaks down this sugar buildup in neurons.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Proteomic and metabolomic analyses supported these findings. The researchers identified dozens of metabolic and mitochondrial genes affected by diet, tau, and glycogen metabolism. Importantly, they found similar changes in brain tissue from Alzheimer’s patients, including upregulation of enzymes involved in glycogen metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Using a fruit fly model, our team uncovered a powerful link between a rich diet and the progression of Alzheimer’s-like symptoms,” Kapahi explained. “Under the leadership of postdoctoral researcher Dr. Sudipta Bar, we made a fascinating discovery: neurons in Alzheimer’s patients accumulate an unusual amount of glycogen—a complex sugar molecule not typically found in large quantities in healthy brain cells. Because of its complex structure, glycogen can attach to toxic proteins and may accelerate their aggregation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Even more intriguing, Dr. Bar found that neurons metabolize glycogen differently than other organs, hinting at a unique metabolic vulnerability in the brain. He also identified key upstream proteins and signaling pathways that may be harnessed to prevent or reverse this harmful process. This unexpected connection between diet, sugar metabolism, and protein aggregation opens exciting new avenues for Alzheimer’s research and potential therapies.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the results are promising, the study has several limitations. Most of the experiments were conducted in fruit flies or lab-grown neurons, which do not fully replicate the complexity of the human brain. While human data were used for comparison, more work is needed to confirm whether glycogen metabolism plays the same role in living patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is also unclear whether glycogen accumulation is a cause or a consequence of neurodegeneration, or whether it occurs early enough in the disease process to serve as a useful therapeutic target. Long-term studies in animal models and clinical trials will be needed to explore whether enhancing glycogen breakdown can slow cognitive decline or improve brain health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers plan to continue exploring how glycogen interacts with tau and other proteins, and whether certain diets or medications can modify this process. “Our long-term goal is to develop therapeutic strategies based on our findings,” Kapahi said. “In addition, we aim to explore the many questions this study has raised, such as: How does glycogen breakdown help rescue disease pathology? Which metabolic pathways are altered by glycogen breakdown? And how does glycogen bind to toxic proteins?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We would like to acknowledge the valuable contributions of Prof. Lisa Ellerby, Prof. Birgit Schilling, and Prof. Tara Tracy from the Buck Institute, as well as Prof. Nicholas Seyfried from Emory University, along with their lab members, for their support and collaboration in this study.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s42255-025-01314-w" target="_blank"&gt;Neuronal glycogen breakdown mitigates tauopathy via pentose-phosphate-pathway-mediated oxidative stress reduction&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Sudipta Bar, Kenneth A.

					&lt;p&gt;Ah, &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/daily-habits-lower-belly-fat-women-over-50/" target="_blank"&gt;belly fat&lt;/a&gt;—the uninvited visitor that stops by during middle age and never wants to leave. We feel your pain and spoke with a fitness pro about one of the best ways to shrink belly fat without getting on the floor: &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/standing-exercises-burn-belly-fat/" target="_blank"&gt;standing exercises&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What makes &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/standing-core-workouts-no-crunches/" target="_blank"&gt;standing moves&lt;/a&gt; rise above the crowd? “Standing moves often use more muscle groups at once, especially your legs, glutes, and core, which helps you burn more calories overall. They also tend to raise your heart rate more than isolated floor work, which increases fat burn. Plus, they mimic real-life movement better, so you build functional strength while trimming your waist,” explains &lt;b&gt;Stephen Sheehan&lt;/b&gt;, certified personal trainer at &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://www.garagegymreviews.com/author/stephensheehan" target="_blank"&gt;Garage Gym Reviews&lt;/a&gt;—and it makes perfect sense.&lt;/p&gt;

  
&lt;p&gt;A standing position requires your core to work harder to keep you upright and stable, most especially when you’re reaching, twisting, or balancing movements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This dynamic engagement trains the muscles around your midsection in a more active, real-world way. It also gets your deep core muscles involved, which helps tighten and flatten your waist over time,” Stephen adds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, let’s explore the best standing exercises that will slim down your belly and get it into shape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;5 Standing Moves That Shrink Belly Fat Without Getting on the Floor&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These exercises alone won’t spot-reduce belly fat, but when paired with good nutrition and consistency, they’ll help shrink your waistline while keeping you off the floor,” Stephen says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This exercise fires up your obliques and challenges balance and stability. “It’s a simple way to get core engagement and light cardio in one shot,” Stephen points out.&lt;span aria-hidden="true"&gt;6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="karma_unit karma_unit--distinct inline karma_unit--mobile hide-desktop karma_unit--sliding htlad-lazy-mob-square-fixed karma_unit--halfpage"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Begin standing tall with your hands behind your head.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lift one knee as you crunch the elbow on the same side toward it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Return to the start position.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Repeat on the other side, continuing to alternate.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stand tall with your feet hip-distance apart and arms at your sides.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lift your right knee up toward your chest, as high as you’re able to.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alternate sides at a fast pace like you’re jogging in place.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This move works your obliques and transverse abdominis while incorporating the shoulders and hips,” Stephen explains. “It mimics rotational movements that build real-world strength and help carve your waist.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="karma_unit karma_unit--distinct inline karma_unit--mobile hide-desktop karma_unit--sliding htlad-lazy-mob-square-fixed"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stand tall with your feet shoulder-distance apart, holding a dumbbell or medicine ball above one shoulder.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Breathe in, chopping the weight diagonally toward your opposite foot and bending your knees.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reverse the motion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Repeat on the other side.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This exercise offers cardio and core engagement. “Twisting from the torso activates your waist muscles, while the fast pace keeps your heart rate up for fat burn,” Stephen says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stand tall with your feet hip-distance apart and arms overhead.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Drive your knee up toward the opposite elbow in a smooth twisting movement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quickly alternate.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The lunge hits your glutes and legs, and the rotation works your core,” Stephen points out. “This combo move builds strength and coordination while trimming your waist.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stand tall.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Step back with one leg into a gentle lunge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rotate your torso toward the front leg.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Return to standing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Repeat on the other side.&lt;/li&gt;

            Dr. Uri Manor feels like much of his early life was blessed by fate.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdhpkp2t0004356nkn8il11p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Born with genetic hearing loss that enables him to hear only about 10% of what others might, Manor was diagnosed at age 2, when he&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;happened to be living in Wichita, Kansas – the home of what he describes as “one of the most advanced schools for children with hearing loss, maybe in the world.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdhpkp2t0005356nowbwihe1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It wasn’t clear if I would ever learn language, if I would ever be able to speak clearly,” said Manor, now 45. “So I was very lucky, really weirdly lucky, that we were living in Wichita, Kansas, at the time.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdhpkp2t0006356nok6hh8o3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Working in Wichita with experts at the Institute of Logopedics, now called &lt;a href="https://foundation.wichita.edu/heartspring-and-wsus-cassat-clinic-will-be-neighbors-in-wichitas-downtown-healthcare-corridor/" target="_blank"&gt;Heartspring&lt;/a&gt;, Manor learned to speak.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdhueo1g0000356nbsh1q46w@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That same sort of serendipity led Manor into an unexpected career studying hearing loss himself, first at the US National Institutes of Health and, now, leading his own lab at the University of California, San Diego, where his research into ways to restore hearing was supported by a major five-year NIH grant.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdhugjep0002356nazomgram@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But that’s where Manor’s luck ran out. His grant was terminated in May by the Trump administration as part of its policies targeting diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, initiatives; Manor’s funding had been awarded through a program that aimed to promote workforce diversity, for which he qualified because he has hearing loss.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdhummlp0005356ns9rxc0uo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Now, Manor’s research is in limbo, like that of thousands of other scientists whose work is supported in large part by the federal government and who’ve been affected by grant terminations. And the halt comes as research into hearing loss, which affects as many as 15% of American adults and 1 in 400 children at birth, had recently shown signs of rapid advancement.
    &lt;/p&gt;



  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdhpkp2t0007356nsdi059v7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It was intense curiosity about the world that led Manor into a career in science, where early on, fate seemed to strike again. As a researcher at the &lt;a href="https://www.training.nih.gov/research-training/grads/gpp/institutional/jhu/" target="_blank"&gt;NIH and Johns Hopkins&lt;/a&gt; working toward his Ph.D., Manor hoped to find an adviser interested in how magnetic fields could influence cells – an obsession that stemmed from a fascination with animals’ ability to navigate using magnetic fields of the Earth.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdhpkp2t0008356nj8med8jg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I was describing that to a physicist PI [primary investigator] at the NIH, and he goes, ‘Yeah, I can’t support that project, but what you’re describing sounds a lot like the hair cells of the inner ear. You should go talk to this PI, who studies hair cells,’” Manor recalled.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdhqnq9x00013b6n1q35497v@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Despite spending much of his time at the &lt;a href="https://www.asha.org/public/who-are-audiologists/#:~:text=Audiologists%20are%20experts%20who%20can,that%20may%20need%20further%20evaluation." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;audiologist’s&lt;/a&gt; office, he said, “I’d never thought about the ear.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdhpkp2t0009356nliz5veng@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That PI, &lt;a href="https://www.nidcd.nih.gov/about/staff/bechara-kachar" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Bechara Kachar&lt;/a&gt;, showed him microscope images of hair cells in the inner ear, which enable us to hear, and Manor remembers being stunned.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdhpkp2t000a356n0subg9dg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I fell in love with the hair cell, these mysterious cells in our ear, because the system was so amazing, how it all comes together and how it all works,” Manor said. “I got goosebumps. I have hearing loss, and I never thought about studying it. But now I was in this room falling in love with this system. I was like, ‘What if this is like my destiny? What if this is what I’m supposed to be doing?’”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdhpkp2t000b356ng075x8fd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In 2023, Manor received his first R01 grant from the NIH, a major five-year &lt;a href="https://reporter.nih.gov/search/IIT2zo7phUKCNgF_giEmrA/project-details/10678569" target="_blank"&gt;award&lt;/a&gt; that would support his lab’s work on ways to restore hearing. Again, serendipity had struck; the R01 grant process is intensely competitive, &lt;a href="https://report.nih.gov/nihdatabook/category/10" target="_blank"&gt;funding&lt;/a&gt; only a fraction of the applications the biomedical research agency gets. Young researchers are advised to apply to research funding programs where they may have a unique edge, to improve their odds, Manor said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdhpkp2t000c356n60j4n542@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There was one that seemed a perfect fit; he was encouraged by mentors to apply to a program at the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders that aimed to promote workforce diversity. It was specifically &lt;a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-DC-23-001.html" target="_blank"&gt;designed&lt;/a&gt; to support early-stage researchers “from diverse backgrounds, including those from underrepresented groups,” such as people with disabilities. Manor qualified because he has “congenital severe-to-profound hearing loss,” he said. “It felt right.”
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdhpkp2t000d356naec9q0cv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Even at the time, Manor said, he acknowledged the risk that government initiatives supporting DEI may not always be popular. His biggest concern, though, was that he might not be able to renew his grant through the same program after its five years were up.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdhpkp2t000e356nejsbh74i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But his luck turned.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;In late May, he received notification from the NIH that, only two years in, his five-year grant had been canceled. The reason: The Trump administration was &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/26/business/dei-fcc-media"&gt;targeting&lt;/a&gt; programs promoting DEI.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdhpkp2t000f356ne3m8i7h6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Research programs based primarily on artificial and non-scientific categories, including amorphous equity objectives, are antithetical to the scientific inquiry, do nothing to expand our knowledge of living systems, provide low returns on investment, and ultimately do not enhance health, lengthen life, or reduce illness,” the notice read. “It is the policy of NIH not to prioritize such research programs.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdhpkp2t000g356npek7s02v@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            No more funding would be awarded, it continued, and all future years on the grant had been removed.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdhpkp2t000h356nl570g624@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “No one ever imagined that a grant could be canceled in the middle of an award period,” Manor said. “It might be naïve and incorrect, but when you get a five-year grant from the NIH, that’s a five-year contract, and you make plans based on five years. … That’s really kind of rocked our world.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdhpiwzt0000356n0krjh1dk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A spokesperson for the NIH told CNN: “The study itself has value, however unfortunately it was funded under an ideologically driven DEI program under the Biden Administration. In the future, NIH will review, and fund research based on scientific merit rather than on DEI criteria.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdhpkp2t000i356nf7fd38ir@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Manor spent the next two weeks sleeping two to three hours a night, writing new grant proposals to try to replace the lost funds. But the termination meant his lab had to stop experiments, some of which had taken years to set up. Manor took that measure in an attempt to avoid having to lay off&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;staff members – which he ultimately had to do as well.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Hearing loss &lt;a href="https://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/statistics/quick-statistics-hearing" target="_blank"&gt;affects&lt;/a&gt; more than 30 million people in the US, with prevalence rising as people age. Recently, the field has taken leaps forward, with trials of gene therapies, which deliver working copies of genes to make up for mutated ones that cause deafness, helping &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(23)02874-X/abstract" target="_blank"&gt;children&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/positive-phase-12-clinical-trial-data-investigational-gene" target="_blank"&gt;hear&lt;/a&gt; for the first time.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdhpkp2t000l356nq6vejrp7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We’re at the threshold of a brave new world, so to speak,” said &lt;a href="https://oto.hms.harvard.edu/people/charles-liberman" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Charles Liberman&lt;/a&gt;, a senior scientist and former director of the Eaton-Peabody Laboratories at Mass Eye and Ear, one of the largest hearing research laboratories in the world.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;“It’s pretty incredible, the progress that’s been made in the last 10 or 15 years, on understanding what goes wrong in the ear and having a pretty good handle on what kinds of approaches might work to cure sensorineural hearing loss.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdhpkp2t000m356n2rgs1c4m@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Liberman anticipates breakthroughs in the next five to 10 years in slowing age-related hearing loss as well and, “perhaps farther in the future, to actually reverse age-related hearing loss.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdhpkp2t000n356njlijry2s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Liberman said Manor – with whom he’s collaborated in the past – is contributing to the field’s advancements.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdhprgq70017356n9wd2bqck@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “He has not been in the field for terribly long, but he’s already made a big impression because of the incredible sort of computational approaches he takes to analyzing data from the inner ear,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdhpkp2t000o356n59g2vmsm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “His grant got cut because it was a diversity initiative,” Liberman continued, “but Uri’s research is top quality, and I’m sure it would have been funded just on its own merit.”
    &lt;/p&gt;



  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdhpkp2t000q356ncg22t349@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Manor’s was one of thousands of NIH grants cut by the Trump administration, amounting to almost $3.8 billion in lost funding, &lt;a href="https://www.aamc.org/media/83996/download" target="_blank"&gt;according&lt;/a&gt; to the Association of American Medical Colleges. Others canceled under the banner of combating DEI ideology include those focused on HIV, where researchers reported receiving notification &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/25/health/nih-science-funding-states-kff-health-news/index.html"&gt;identical&lt;/a&gt; to Manor’s.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdhpkp2t000r356n1r2qc5bi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But recently, Manor’s fortunes seemed to have changed again. A federal judge &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/16/health/nih-grant-cuts-ruling"&gt;ruled&lt;/a&gt; in June that it was illegal for the Trump administration to cancel several hundred research grants in areas including racial health disparities and transgender health. Manor’s is among the grants included, and he received notice that the funding should come through.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdhpkp2t000s356nx80nda4x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Still, he said he worries about whether that decision will hold through future court challenges. And he, like so many other scientists affected by the administration’s drastic cuts to research funding, warns about the effects on scientific progress.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdhpkp2t000t356nigo265g9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “No matter what your political leanings are, you have a 1 in 400 chance of having a child with hearing loss,” he said. Anyone dealing with medical conditions “will benefit from the amazing advances of science and our biomedical research force.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdhpkp2t000u356nd3ud7oj1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But he also emphasized the importance of recognizing that research like his is supported by taxpayers, some of whom “are struggling to pay their own bills, who are struggling to pay their kids’ doctors bills.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdhpkp2t000v356nvsjqg36y@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “And some of their taxpayer dollars are coming to my lab,” he said. “That’s a huge responsibility and privilege, and we have to make sure we’re doing good with it. For me, that’s a really powerful motivating factor, and I would like to believe that we’re doing it.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Dr. Uri Manor feels like much of his early life was blessed by fate.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdhpkp2t0004356nkn8il11p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Born with genetic hearing loss that enables him to hear only about 10% of what others might, Manor was diagnosed at age 2, when he&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;happened to be living in Wichita, Kansas – the home of what he describes as “one of the most advanced schools for children with hearing loss, maybe in the world.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdhpkp2t0005356nowbwihe1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It wasn’t clear if I would ever learn language, if I would ever be able to speak clearly,” said Manor, now 45. “So I was very lucky, really weirdly lucky, that we were living in Wichita, Kansas, at the time.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdhpkp2t0006356nok6hh8o3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Working in Wichita with experts at the Institute of Logopedics, now called &lt;a href="https://foundation.wichita.edu/heartspring-and-wsus-cassat-clinic-will-be-neighbors-in-wichitas-downtown-healthcare-corridor/" target="_blank"&gt;Heartspring&lt;/a&gt;, Manor learned to speak.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdhueo1g0000356nbsh1q46w@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That same sort of serendipity led Manor into an unexpected career studying hearing loss himself, first at the US National Institutes of Health and, now, leading his own lab at the University of California, San Diego, where his research into ways to restore hearing was supported by a major five-year NIH grant.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdhugjep0002356nazomgram@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But that’s where Manor’s luck ran out. His grant was terminated in May by the Trump administration as part of its policies targeting diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, initiatives; Manor’s funding had been awarded through a program that aimed to promote workforce diversity, for which he qualified because he has hearing loss.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdhummlp0005356ns9rxc0uo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Now, Manor’s research is in limbo, like that of thousands of other scientists whose work is supported in large part by the federal government and who’ve been affected by grant terminations. And the halt comes as research into hearing loss, which affects as many as 15% of American adults and 1 in 400 children at birth, had recently shown signs of rapid advancement.
    &lt;/p&gt;



  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdhpkp2t0007356nsdi059v7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It was intense curiosity about the world that led Manor into a career in science, where early on, fate seemed to strike again. As a researcher at the &lt;a href="https://www.training.nih.gov/research-training/grads/gpp/institutional/jhu/" target="_blank"&gt;NIH and Johns Hopkins&lt;/a&gt; working toward his Ph.D., Manor hoped to find an adviser interested in how magnetic fields could influence cells – an obsession that stemmed from a fascination with animals’ ability to navigate using magnetic fields of the Earth.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdhpkp2t0008356nj8med8jg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I was describing that to a physicist PI [primary investigator] at the NIH, and he goes, ‘Yeah, I can’t support that project, but what you’re describing sounds a lot like the hair cells of the inner ear. You should go talk to this PI, who studies hair cells,’” Manor recalled.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdhqnq9x00013b6n1q35497v@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Despite spending much of his time at the &lt;a href="https://www.asha.org/public/who-are-audiologists/#:~:text=Audiologists%20are%20experts%20who%20can,that%20may%20need%20further%20evaluation." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;audiologist’s&lt;/a&gt; office, he said, “I’d never thought about the ear.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdhpkp2t0009356nliz5veng@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That PI, &lt;a href="https://www.nidcd.nih.gov/about/staff/bechara-kachar" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Bechara Kachar&lt;/a&gt;, showed him microscope images of hair cells in the inner ear, which enable us to hear, and Manor remembers being stunned.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdhpkp2t000a356n0subg9dg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I fell in love with the hair cell, these mysterious cells in our ear, because the system was so amazing, how it all comes together and how it all works,” Manor said. “I got goosebumps. I have hearing loss, and I never thought about studying it. But now I was in this room falling in love with this system. I was like, ‘What if this is like my destiny? What if this is what I’m supposed to be doing?’”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdhpkp2t000b356ng075x8fd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In 2023, Manor received his first R01 grant from the NIH, a major five-year &lt;a href="https://reporter.nih.gov/search/IIT2zo7phUKCNgF_giEmrA/project-details/10678569" target="_blank"&gt;award&lt;/a&gt; that would support his lab’s work on ways to restore hearing. Again, serendipity had struck; the R01 grant process is intensely competitive, &lt;a href="https://report.nih.gov/nihdatabook/category/10" target="_blank"&gt;funding&lt;/a&gt; only a fraction of the applications the biomedical research agency gets. Young researchers are advised to apply to research funding programs where they may have a unique edge, to improve their odds, Manor said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdhpkp2t000c356n60j4n542@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There was one that seemed a perfect fit; he was encouraged by mentors to apply to a program at the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders that aimed to promote workforce diversity. It was specifically &lt;a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-DC-23-001.html" target="_blank"&gt;designed&lt;/a&gt; to support early-stage researchers “from diverse backgrounds, including those from underrepresented groups,” such as people with disabilities. Manor qualified because he has “congenital severe-to-profound hearing loss,” he said. “It felt right.”
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdhpkp2t000d356naec9q0cv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Even at the time, Manor said, he acknowledged the risk that government initiatives supporting DEI may not always be popular. His biggest concern, though, was that he might not be able to renew his grant through the same program after its five years were up.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdhpkp2t000e356nejsbh74i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But his luck turned.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;In late May, he received notification from the NIH that, only two years in, his five-year grant had been canceled. The reason: The Trump administration was &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/26/business/dei-fcc-media"&gt;targeting&lt;/a&gt; programs promoting DEI.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdhpkp2t000f356ne3m8i7h6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Research programs based primarily on artificial and non-scientific categories, including amorphous equity objectives, are antithetical to the scientific inquiry, do nothing to expand our knowledge of living systems, provide low returns on investment, and ultimately do not enhance health, lengthen life, or reduce illness,” the notice read. “It is the policy of NIH not to prioritize such research programs.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdhpkp2t000g356npek7s02v@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            No more funding would be awarded, it continued, and all future years on the grant had been removed.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdhpkp2t000h356nl570g624@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “No one ever imagined that a grant could be canceled in the middle of an award period,” Manor said. “It might be naïve and incorrect, but when you get a five-year grant from the NIH, that’s a five-year contract, and you make plans based on five years. … That’s really kind of rocked our world.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdhpiwzt0000356n0krjh1dk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A spokesperson for the NIH told CNN: “The study itself has value, however unfortunately it was funded under an ideologically driven DEI program under the Biden Administration. In the future, NIH will review, and fund research based on scientific merit rather than on DEI criteria.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdhpkp2t000i356nf7fd38ir@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Manor spent the next two weeks sleeping two to three hours a night, writing new grant proposals to try to replace the lost funds. But the termination meant his lab had to stop experiments, some of which had taken years to set up. Manor took that measure in an attempt to avoid having to lay off&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;staff members – which he ultimately had to do as well.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdhpkp2t000k356ns95o2jv2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Hearing loss &lt;a href="https://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/statistics/quick-statistics-hearing" target="_blank"&gt;affects&lt;/a&gt; more than 30 million people in the US, with prevalence rising as people age. Recently, the field has taken leaps forward, with trials of gene therapies, which deliver working copies of genes to make up for mutated ones that cause deafness, helping &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(23)02874-X/abstract" target="_blank"&gt;children&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/positive-phase-12-clinical-trial-data-investigational-gene" target="_blank"&gt;hear&lt;/a&gt; for the first time.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdhpkp2t000l356nq6vejrp7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We’re at the threshold of a brave new world, so to speak,” said &lt;a href="https://oto.hms.harvard.edu/people/charles-liberman" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Charles Liberman&lt;/a&gt;, a senior scientist and former director of the Eaton-Peabody Laboratories at Mass Eye and Ear, one of the largest hearing research laboratories in the world.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;“It’s pretty incredible, the progress that’s been made in the last 10 or 15 years, on understanding what goes wrong in the ear and having a pretty good handle on what kinds of approaches might work to cure sensorineural hearing loss.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdhpkp2t000m356n2rgs1c4m@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Liberman anticipates breakthroughs in the next five to 10 years in slowing age-related hearing loss as well and, “perhaps farther in the future, to actually reverse age-related hearing loss.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdhpkp2t000n356njlijry2s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Liberman said Manor – with whom he’s collaborated in the past – is contributing to the field’s advancements.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdhprgq70017356n9wd2bqck@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “He has not been in the field for terribly long, but he’s already made a big impression because of the incredible sort of computational approaches he takes to analyzing data from the inner ear,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdhpkp2t000o356n59g2vmsm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “His grant got cut because it was a diversity initiative,” Liberman continued, “but Uri’s research is top quality, and I’m sure it would have been funded just on its own merit.”
    &lt;/p&gt;



  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdhpkp2t000q356ncg22t349@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Manor’s was one of thousands of NIH grants cut by the Trump administration, amounting to almost $3.8 billion in lost funding, &lt;a href="https://www.aamc.org/media/83996/download" target="_blank"&gt;according&lt;/a&gt; to the Association of American Medical Colleges. Others canceled under the banner of combating DEI ideology include those focused on HIV, where researchers reported receiving notification &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/25/health/nih-science-funding-states-kff-health-news/index.html"&gt;identical&lt;/a&gt; to Manor’s.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdhpkp2t000r356n1r2qc5bi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But recently, Manor’s fortunes seemed to have changed again. A federal judge &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/16/health/nih-grant-cuts-ruling"&gt;ruled&lt;/a&gt; in June that it was illegal for the Trump administration to cancel several hundred research grants in areas including racial health disparities and transgender health. Manor’s is among the grants included, and he received notice that the funding should come through.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdhpkp2t000s356nx80nda4x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Still, he said he worries about whether that decision will hold through future court challenges. And he, like so many other scientists affected by the administration’s drastic cuts to research funding, warns about the effects on scientific progress.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdhpkp2t000t356nigo265g9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “No matter what your political leanings are, you have a 1 in 400 chance of having a child with hearing loss,” he said. Anyone dealing with medical conditions “will benefit from the amazing advances of science and our biomedical research force.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdhpkp2t000u356nd3ud7oj1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But he also emphasized the importance of recognizing that research like his is supported by taxpayers, some of whom “are struggling to pay their own bills, who are struggling to pay their kids’ doctors bills.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdhpkp2t000v356nvsjqg36y@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “And some of their taxpayer dollars are coming to my lab,” he said. “That’s a huge responsibility and privilege, and we have to make sure we’re doing good with it. For me, that’s a really powerful motivating factor, and I would like to believe that we’re doing it.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="2.0"&gt;They went to a Las Vegas conference this month that promised pathways to an “unlimited lifespan.” But at least two attendees left in ambulances and were hospitalized in critical condition, requiring ventilators to breathe.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="3.0"&gt;The two women, who are recovering, fell ill after receiving peptide injections at a conference booth. The doctor who ran the booth was a Los Angeles physician specializing in “age reversal” therapies who did not have permission to practice medicine or dispense prescriptions in Nevada. Public health investigators are trying to determine if anyone else who attended the Revolution Against Aging and Death Festival experienced a similar illness.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="4.0"&gt;The investigation comes as peptides grow in popularity, thanks in part to Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s promotion of the amino acid chains as a way to fight aging and chronic disease. Since becoming Health and Human Services secretary, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sODZSAuxTTw"&gt;Kennedy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sODZSAuxTTw"&gt; has vowed&lt;/a&gt; to end the Food and Drug Administration’s “&lt;a href="https://x.com/RobertKennedyJr/status/1849925311586238737"&gt;war on peptides&lt;/a&gt;” and other alternative health therapies. Kent Holtorf, the doctor overseeing the booth where the women became ill, also has called for less regulation of alternative therapies and has criticized the FDA for blocking compounds he sees as lifesaving.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="6.0"&gt;Holtorf told ProPublica he is cooperating with the investigation. “Of course, I want to get to the bottom of it. But almost assuredly it will come out that it was not the peptides.”&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                        
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="8.0"&gt;He said he became convinced the peptides weren’t the cause of the severe reactions after plugging everything he knows about the incident into an artificial intelligence app, which he said gave him a 57-page report that “basically says that it is impossible it was the peptides.” He refused to comment on what the report attributed the illnesses to.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="9.0"&gt;“I don’t think it was the peptides, but I don’t want to try and push the blame and say it wasn’t us,” he said. “We are reassessing everything we are doing.”&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="11.0"&gt;Holtorf acknowledged he is not licensed in Nevada but said he hired a practitioner who is and did not personally write prescriptions or administer therapies at his booth. “I knew what was going on but was not hands on,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="12.0"&gt;He described the situation as “horrific” and “unacceptable” and said he’s “terribly sorry.”&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="13.0"&gt;The FDA has approved dozens of peptide-based medications for treating serious health problems such as cancer, obesity and diabetes. But peptide therapies for anti-aging and regenerative health are largely made by compounding pharmacists who use peptide components to formulate drugs that aren’t commercially available or approved for that particular use. Compounded drugs are not reviewed for safety and efficacy by the FDA. The agency also has found “significant safety risks” with at least 18 of the most popular peptide compounding components.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="14.0"&gt;“Anyone who undergoes any sort of medical treatment, no matter how benign, needs to be very wary that even the most benign intervention can have fatal side effects,” said Dr. Amy Gutman, a Florida emergency room doctor who speaks about metabolic research and ketogenic diets and appeared at RAADFest. “And if you are in a hotel and don’t have lifesaving equipment near you, then that is a risk you have to be aware of.”&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="15.0"&gt;The two women, a 38-year-old from California and a 51-year-old from Nevada, received injections on July 13 at RAADFest, which is organized by an Arizona-based nonprofit that has built a community hoping to cheat death. According to a police report, both were injected at a booth run by Holtorf, who is licensed in California but not Nevada. Holtorf’s advocacy for alternative therapies has invited controversy in the past, including his criticism of the H1N1 swine flu vaccine in a Fox News interview in 2009. More recently, his practice was &lt;a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/warning-letters/covid-19-letter_to_holtorf_medical_group.pdf"&gt;advised by the Federal Trade Commission&lt;/a&gt; to cease making claims on its website that his peptide therapies could treat or prevent COVID-19. Holtorf said he removed the claims from his website even though he still believes certain peptides can be beneficial in treating COVID-19 and other viral infections.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                        
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="17.0"&gt;Both the Southern Nevada Health District and the Nevada Board of Pharmacy confirmed they are investigating what led to the hospitalizations after being notified by the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police that possibly as many as seven people at the conference were hospitalized. According to the police report, detectives were unable to confirm whether additional attendees got sick.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="18.0"&gt;Investigators are examining whether the illnesses were caused by an infection, contamination related to the injections or an issue with the medication itself, according to documents obtained by ProPublica. The two women who were taken by ambulance to the hospital reported feeling as if their tongues were swelling and had trouble breathing and increased heart rates. By the time they reached the hospital, one was already intubated and the other had lost muscle control in her neck and couldn’t open her eyes or communicate with doctors, according to the police report.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="19.0"&gt;Holtorf said he was “so freaked out” by what happened because none of the women’s symptoms “made any sense.” In 30 years of providing such treatments, he said he’s never seen such a reaction.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="20.0"&gt;Event organizer James Strole, an Arizona businessman who has built a 50-year career selling the promise of eternal life to followers, said the two patients are recovering after several days in the hospital. He said “it’s not clear the people got sick as a result of treatment from Dr. Holtorf,” adding he’s “anxious” for the illnesses to be “deeply investigated.” He said nothing similar has happened in the 10 years he has been producing RAADFest.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="21.0"&gt;This is the first year Holtorf offered therapies at the conference, Strole said. He added that Holtorf provided the therapies to 60 people at the event and has attempted to reach them to learn whether they experienced any problems. Holtorf said only six patients received peptides.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="22.0"&gt;Strole said the coalition’s science board scrutinizes therapy providers before granting them permission to operate a booth in the conference’s exhibition hall, which organizers referred to as a clinic.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="23.0"&gt;“The big concern is safety,” he said. “We look at who is doing the administering, whether it’s an injection or supplement. We look at the person and the company itself, what the efficacy is, how they operate, their safety measures. We look at all that.”&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="24.0"&gt;Strole said peptides are considered “generally safe” when taken under the direction of a doctor, adding that he takes them regularly. Holtorf also said he believes they are safe and that they saved his life when he was a young man suffering from a severe illness.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="25.0"&gt;A review by ProPublica of both the pharmacy and medical board license databases showed no Nevada licenses for Holtorf or his medical practice. Out-of-state doctors who come to provide care at a conference such as RAADfest are required to obtain a special event license from the Nevada Board of Medical Examiners. (As of Friday, 103 doctors had obtained such a license.) To dispense or possess pharmaceuticals, practitioners must also be licensed by the Nevada Board of Pharmacy. RAADFest’s organizers, however, said they were unaware that Holtorf is not licensed to provide medical care or dispense medications in the state.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="26.0"&gt;“In order to practice medicine in the state, you must be licensed,” said David Wuest, executive secretary of the Nevada Board of Pharmacy.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="27.0"&gt;The Nevada Legislature has passed stricter laws as alternative therapies have become popular outside traditional medical settings. In 2017, for example, the state banned so-called Botox parties, requiring the anti-wrinkle injections only be administered in a medical office or spa equipped to deal with life-threatening emergencies. But beyond its standard medical licensing requirements, the state doesn’t have rules governing an event like RAADFest, where attendees receive an array of anti-aging therapies including gene therapies, peptide injections, dialysis-like blood detoxification, bone scans and light therapy.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                        
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="29.0"&gt;Strole said he wasn’t aware that providers need a special in-state license to provide the type of therapies Holtorf offered, which he described as “neutraceuticals.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="29.1"&gt;“I’ve never heard they had to get from the state permission to do that under the auspices of giving a treatment of that nature, that’s not actually treating some disease or something,” Strole said.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="30.0"&gt;According to the police report, Holtorf contracted with a Nevada-licensed nurse practitioner, who administered the injection to one of the women. He also contracted with another doctor, who mixed the vials and administered the injection to the second woman, the report said. That doctor does not appear to have the necessary Nevada licenses.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="31.0"&gt;Holtorf declined to comment on the practitioners he hired for the event, other than to say he had worked with the doctor in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="32.0"&gt;Wuest said multiple providers might be investigated, but he wouldn’t confirm whether Holtorf is a subject of the probe. The board also is investigating whether the therapy provided to the patients required a medical or pharmaceutical license. The FDA is assisting in the investigation to determine what was in the injections, including whether it was a manufactured pharmaceutical or a compounded medication, Wuest said.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="33.0"&gt;Holtorf’s medical practice and the peptide company he founded are affiliated with an organization, Forgotten Formula, that asserts a constitutional right to provide treatments as they see fit. On its website, the private membership association warns “all bodies in the public sector” that they “do not have any jurisdiction” over their doctors. “All doctors, healers, and members are protected under the shield of this organization,” the website says. “We operate member to member. Ignoring this disclaimer can lead to legal consequences against the party at fault.”&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="34.0"&gt;According to the police report, Holtorf told officers he obtained the peptides dispensed at the festival from Forgotten Formula. In the interview with ProPublica, however, he denied that, saying he’s not sure which of the many manufacturers he works with provided the peptides used at the booth.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="35.0"&gt;The women received different peptide concoctions, according to the police report. Both included at least one component described by the FDA as posing significant risks when compounded. Holtorf said it is difficult to keep up with which peptides are banned and which are still acceptable for compounding.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="36.0"&gt;“There is so much gray area,” he said. “People know they just get patients better.”&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="37.0"&gt;Despite the FDA warnings, peptides were popular among RAADFest attendees who were promised “beautiful life-saving therapies” at the event’s clinic. Event organizers touted that 70 longevity experts would be on hand during the four-day event at the Red Rock Casino Resort Spa but did not list the vendors providing treatments on the event website.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="38.0"&gt;“We have a RAAD clinic, where people will be able to come in at discounted prices and try and do these therapies safely with doctors,” Strole told &lt;a href="https://www.ktnv.com/morningblend/influencer-press-7-8-25"&gt;a Las Vegas TV news program&lt;/a&gt; while promoting the event.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="39.0"&gt;Strole is executive director of the Scottsdale, Arizona-based Coalition for Radical Life Extension, one of a cluster of for-profit and nonprofit entities devoted to helping people achieve immortality founded by Strole and two “immortalist” business partners. Of the three co-founders, only Strole, who is in his 70s, is still alive.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="40.0"&gt;Charles Brown, the original founder, claimed to have had a spiritual experience in the 1950s that showed him the path to immortality and proclaimed he could share that path with others, according to &lt;a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/scottsdale/2014/11/16/people-unlimited-scottsdale-charles-paul-brown-immortality/19152253/"&gt;an Arizona Republic story&lt;/a&gt;. Brown died of Parkinson’s disease in 2014. His wife, Bernadeane “Bernie” Brown, who operated the for-profit People Unlimited with Strole, died of breast cancer in 2024. Her body is said to have been &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C8DAyMuy1Qc/"&gt;cryogenically preserved&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                                  
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="42.0"&gt;The nonprofit organizes the annual anti-aging festival, which charges more than $400 for a ticket, while People Unlimited offers monthly memberships for as much as $255 a month, according to its website. Members get access to weekly meetings, where Strole delivers motivational sermons on immortality and age reversal, as well as talks by guest speakers on wellness, discounts on “longevity protocols” and access to a community of people who “want you to live as much as they want to live.”&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                        
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="44.0"&gt;Gutman, the Florida emergency room doctor, spoke at the event earlier this month, her first time attending RAADFest. She left before the last day, when the two women were hospitalized, and hadn’t heard about the incident before a reporter called. But she said their symptoms — swollen tongue, trouble breathing, increased heart rate — sounded like an allergic reaction, which she said isn’t terribly common in peptide injections. But she cautioned that before injection the drugs are mixed with an agent that can sometimes pose problems.&lt;/p&gt;

 Hoyas, often known as wax plants, have a reputation for thriving on “benign neglect”. They flower best when slightly stressed, as this triggers their reproductive mode. Regular watering and abundant nutrients will encourage leaf growth rather than blooms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="d3a38f79-5bf2-4ca2-b39a-fa21910e451b" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":3,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"Houseplant clinic: how important is ‘plant hygiene’?","elementId":"d3a38f79-5bf2-4ca2-b39a-fa21910e451b","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/jul/15/houseplant-clinic-how-important-is-plant-hygiene"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":10,"display":0,"theme":4}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prescription&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 Allow the soil to completely dry out between waterings – typically, every two to four weeks in autumn and winter, and more often in warmer months. Limit fertiliser applications, as hoyas flower better in nutrient-poor conditions. Ensure bright but indirect sunlight, as too much direct sunlight or a lack of darkness at night can disrupt their flowering cycle. Conversely, some people recommend “sun-stressing” their hoyas. Also, consider a slight drop in temperature overnight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prevention&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 Maintain a balance between attentive care and minimal interference. Aim for indirect lighting, cooler night-time temperatures, and less frequent feeding and watering. The mild stress should boost flowering potential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Got a plant dilemma?
