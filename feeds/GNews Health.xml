Cardiovascular diseases account for 17.9 million deaths worldwide in 2023. Diet plays a crucial role in heart health and in reducing the risk of heart disease. A recent study examined the relationship between heart disease and diet and has identified one that benefits the heart. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A large study by researchers at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health found that the quality of the food matters more than cutting carbs or fat. The findings will be presented at &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://nutrition2025.eventscribe.net/index.asp?presTarget=3036520" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;NUTRITION 2025&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, the flagship annual meeting of the American Society for Nutrition, which will be held in Orlando this week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Quality over quantity&lt;br&gt;      &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new study found that when it comes to protecting the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/toi-plus/health/how-silent-heart-attacks-are-killing-seemingly-fit-indians/articleshow/121410648.cms" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;heart&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, the types of foods one eats may be more important than whether they follow a low-carbohydrate or low-fat diet. To understand what works in favour of the heart, the researchers followed almost 200,000 people for several decades, and observed that the quality of food consumed matters as much as following a low-carbohydrate or low-fat diet. The findings suggested that choosing healthy, high-quality foods is key to protecting the heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previously, low-carbohydrate and low-fat diets have been endorsed by health experts for their potential health benefits, such as weight management and improved blood sugar and cholesterol levels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the impact of these diets on reducing heart disease risk has remained an ongoing debate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We found that what you eat on low-carb or low-fat diets matters just as much as the diet itself. Healthy versions of these diets—those rich in plant-based foods and whole grains—were linked to better heart health outcomes and improved metabolic function. In contrast, low-carb and low-fat diets emphasizing unhealthy foods were associated with a higher risk of heart disease,” said Zhiyuan Wu, PhD, a postdoctoral fellow in the lab of Qi Sun, MD, ScD, at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, said in a release. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The study&lt;br&gt;      &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand the link, the researchers analyzed data from three large cohorts: 43,430 men in the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study (1986–2016), 64,164 women in the Nurses’ Health Study (1986–2018), and 92,189 women in the Nurses’ Health Study II (1991–2019). The scientists followed these nearly 200,000 participants for several decades, tracking their dietary habits and whether they developed heart disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants completed detailed food frequency questionnaires over time, allowing researchers to score their diets based on the quality of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins consumed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers classified carbohydrates, fat,s and proteins from foods such as whole grains, fruits, vegetables, nut,s and legumes as high-quality nutrients, or healthy, while carbohydrates from potatoes and refined grains, as well as saturated fats and proteins from animal-based foods, were categorized as low-quality, or unhealthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more than 10,000 participants, the team also examined blood metabolites to understand how diet quality influenced metabolic health. “This approach allowed us to better understand the biological effects of these diets and strengthened our findings,” Wu said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Take away&lt;br&gt;      &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that the participants who followed a healthy low-carbohydrate or low-fat diet had a lower risk of developing coronary heart disease, while those on unhealthy versions saw an increased risk. These healthy diet patterns, whether a low-carbohydrate or low-fat diet, lowered the risk of developing heart disease by about 15%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;You Clean Your Diet, But What About Your Company? Sadhvi Bhagawati Saraswati's Powerful Truth&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; “Our findings suggest that improving food quality is crucial for improving heart health. Regardless of whether someone follows a low-carbohydrate or low-fat diet, emphasizing whole, minimally processed and plant-based foods and limiting refined grain, sugar, and animal foods, can significantly reduce the risk of coronary heart disease,” Wu added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;What to do &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;To keep heart diseases at bay, the researchers suggest incorporating more whole grains, fruits, vegetables, nuts and legumes while cutting back on processed meats, refined carbs and sugary foods. Pro tip? Check food labels and be mindful of added low-quality ingredients, such as added sugars in juices and processed snacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Jun 2025 01:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi8AFBVV95cUxQQmRZZVk0R05wSUNleGR6U1lqNmttMlNRckxzem9TNjF0aENwS05XNWtEbGZuRXRsZkVCbkhGbndJNGpPVVdta25ZQUgxYjJvQVpicHF0ZzJrNnFtaUhDZGZxWFgtWjEzSUlFbDZBclNjY3locXVrZWtzMlVZdTQtU2VKV3VrZnhPUXlOV05HWHdhZWh4TnEtODEtTXBKMU5wa251dXkzZWtOZGJ4WGZhblNkRlNvTlN2ekVnYS1ySk5DbENwcUNxN1JWLURUenJraVRjN19QS1JKV0gydUtpSWNVM242a2ljMDlQdWlLNWc</guid></item><item><title>科罗拉多斯普林斯确诊麻疹，公众要求留意症状- KKTV | Measles confirmed in Colorado Springs, public asked to watch for symptoms - KKTV</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimwFBVV95cUxOTllSeXpSSmk5VTU5QTFCN3BuNTNVa0ZoWjBxZ2FIQ09ncDN2UFowTmx4LU01SS1nTjJYRUljVlR2RDQ1QjZGOWVnb0JqWDNVblVPU2VudUVqVnJEdG1wUzRpMDA3Y1lvalM5RS1wWHh4cFFxU1RBUHZ3cHM3cGlrdkpNRkJUN0VjbTRGMHBaV0FpNGtPMWQyekVMWdIBrwFBVV95cUxPal9wWFc5T1YwVlVqRVBWNjhzbnp4VUMxYnlVaEFqNFRaNDlDMW1CM2gwVlprT1pwb182NFRFX1NMY1lqdDRYeXNEYlhUc2RmeTdWUzZlbHljZ0g0em96Y1pEZ2EtdjV4S2NMeHpjVjFacGhIRnhDRDd3YUhyV3o0T1pGcTRxSkJwLVJvbW5TUGZScGpHREpuMC1qaEpUekd2RHgzWVU1d0h1YUpqSThr?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body | article w-100"&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo.

On the other hand, people are dying because they can't access these life-saving drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;A new study by the non-profit Global Antibiotic Research and Development Partnership (GARDP) looked at access to antibiotics for nearly 1.5 million cases of carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative (CRGN) infections across eight major low- and middle-income countries, including India, Brazil and South Africa. CRGN bacteria are superbugs resistant to last-line antibiotics - yet only 6.9% of patients received appropriate treatment in the countries studied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;India bore the lion's share of CRGN infections and treatment efforts, procuring 80% of the full courses of studied antibiotics but managing to treat only 7.8% of its estimated cases, the&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(25)00108-2/fulltext" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt; study&lt;/a&gt; in The Lancet Infectious Diseases journal reports. (A full drug course of antibiotics refers to the complete set of doses that a patient needs to take over a specific period to fully treat an infection.)  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Common in water, food, the environment and the human gut, Gram-negative bacteria cause infections such as urinary tract infections (UTIs), pneumonia and food poisoning. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;They can pose a serious threat to newborns and the elderly alike. Especially vulnerable are hospital patients with weakened immunity, often spreading rapidly in ICUs and proving difficult - and sometimes impossible - to treat. Treating carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacterial infections is doubly difficult because those bacteria are resistant to some of the most powerful antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"These infections are a daily reality across all age groups," says Dr Abdul Gaffar, infectious disease consultant at Apollo Hospital in India's Chennai city. "We often see patients for whom no antibiotic works - and they die."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The irony is cruel. While the world tries to curb antibiotic overuse, a parallel tragedy plays out quietly in poorer nations: people dying from treatable infections because the right drugs are out of reach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250529-103858-de9d27ef1-web-2.22.3-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/542d/live/6bda9a50-3c64-11f0-bd09-85867b04fa4e.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/542d/live/6bda9a50-3c64-11f0-bd09-85867b04fa4e.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/542d/live/6bda9a50-3c64-11f0-bd09-85867b04fa4e.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/542d/live/6bda9a50-3c64-11f0-bd09-85867b04fa4e.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/542d/live/6bda9a50-3c64-11f0-bd09-85867b04fa4e.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/542d/live/6bda9a50-3c64-11f0-bd09-85867b04fa4e.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/542d/live/6bda9a50-3c64-11f0-bd09-85867b04fa4e.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/542d/live/6bda9a50-3c64-11f0-bd09-85867b04fa4e.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images Medical staff attend to Covid-positive patients in the ICU ward at the Holy Family hospital on May 06, 2021 in New Delhi, India" class="sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq"&gt;Gram negative bacteria spread rapidly in places like hospital ICUs&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"For years, the dominant narrative has been that antibiotics are being overused, but the stark reality is that many people with highly drug-resistant infections in low- and middle-income countries are not getting access to the antibiotics they need," says Dr Jennifer Cohn, GARDP's Global Access Director and senior author of the  study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The study examined eight intravenous drugs active against carbapenem-resistant bacteria - ranging from older antibiotics including Colistin to newer ones such as Ceftazidime-avibactam. Of the few available drugs, Tigecycline was the most widely used. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Researchers blame the treatment gap on weak health systems and limited access to effective antibiotics. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;For example, only 103,647 full treatment courses were procured of Tigecycline across eight countries - far short of the 1.5 million patients who needed them, the study found. This highlighted a major shortfall in the global response to drug-resistant infections. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;What prevents patients with drug-resistant infections in India from getting the right antibiotics? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Physicians point to multiple barriers - reaching the right health facility, getting accurate diagnostic tests, and accessing effective drugs. Cost remains a major hurdle, with many of these antibiotics priced far beyond the reach of poorer patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250529-103858-de9d27ef1-web-2.22.3-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/58e3/live/de109430-3c64-11f0-bd09-85867b04fa4e.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/58e3/live/de109430-3c64-11f0-bd09-85867b04fa4e.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/58e3/live/de109430-3c64-11f0-bd09-85867b04fa4e.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/58e3/live/de109430-3c64-11f0-bd09-85867b04fa4e.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/58e3/live/de109430-3c64-11f0-bd09-85867b04fa4e.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/58e3/live/de109430-3c64-11f0-bd09-85867b04fa4e.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/58e3/live/de109430-3c64-11f0-bd09-85867b04fa4e.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/58e3/live/de109430-3c64-11f0-bd09-85867b04fa4e.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Universal Images Group via Getty Images Colorized scanning electron micrograph showing carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae interacting with a human neutrophil" class="sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU"&gt;Universal Images Group via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq"&gt;A electron micrograph of carbapenem-resistant bacteria&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"Those who can afford these antibiotics often overuse them; those who can't, don't get them at all," says Dr Gaffar. "We need a system that ensures access for the poor and prevents misuse by the well-to-do."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;To improve access, these drugs must be made more affordable. To prevent misuse, stronger regulation is key. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"Ideally, every antibiotic prescription in hospitals should require a second sign-off - by an infection specialist or microbiologist," says Dr Gaffar. "Some hospitals do this, but most don't. With the right oversight, regulators can ensure this becomes standard practice."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;To fix the access problem and curb misuse, both smarter policies and stronger safeguards are essential, say researchers. But access alone won't solve the crisis - the pipeline of new antibiotics is drying up. The decline in antibiotic R&amp;amp;D - and the limited availability of existing drugs - is a global issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;India bears&lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-63059585" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt; one of the world's heaviest burdens of antimicrobial resistance &lt;/a&gt;(AMR), but it may also hold the key to combating it - both at home and globally, researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"India is also one of the largest markets for new antibiotics and can successfully advocate for the development and access of new antibiotics," says Dr Cohn. With a strong pharmaceutical base, the country is emerging as a hub for AMR innovation, from &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c80vrjkkrero" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;promising new antibiotics&lt;/a&gt; to advanced diagnostics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Dr Cohn says India can strengthen its antibiotic response by generating local data to better estimate needs and pinpoint gaps in the care pathway. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;This would allow for more targeted interventions to improve access to the right drugs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Innovative models are already emerging - Kerala state, for instance, is using a "hub-and-spoke approach" to support lower-level facilities in managing serious infections. Coordinated or pooled procurement across hospitals or states could also reduce the cost of newer antibiotics, as seen with cancer drug programs, researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Without access to the right antibiotics, modern medicine begins to unravel - doctors risk losing the ability to safely perform surgery, treat complications in cancer patients, or manage everyday infections. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"As an infectious disease doctor, I see appropriate use as one part - but only one part - of access," says Dr Gaffar. "When we get new antibiotics, it's important to save them on one hand - and save them for right patients." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Clearly, the challenge is not just to use antibiotics wisely, but to ensure they reach those who need them most.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jun 2025 21:34:31 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWkFVX3lxTE5uTEhXQmVfNlVYa0pDWVFBM1V4VzNkZGIwM1dZOXRsNF9GNTM2R1kzU1Nva3BKWWJnWXg0U2lHeS15bHFyRnhTOUh3MjVjc212UnlsUV9lRmVjZ9IBX0FVX3lxTFBRYkZPZXJHTXQzb3ZsdG5FTDhodlNaZU90WXZKSE9qN3FTb0NXOWVaUjh4TVhjRmw5bmwwdndDbVhOTGF2NVJmUW1xUlpjQWl1Zzg3OFctbk1YSWNqU0tB</guid></item><item><title>研究显示，运动可提高结肠癌患者的生存率- KSL新闻 | Exercise boosts survival rates in colon cancer patients, study shows - KSL News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipwFBVV95cUxPUHV1RlhaSkI4UVpHS3JBdGNFdzVpbWN5bHBaVzllbEdPdGR5YzVjQ0w2c1p4S2hHY3FYeE11a3NRMXlwdG5YcVN4Y3dhSmprNFNuQUVWSXJBbXBwRHJ0SzU1aWNIVDBjdnREa2lobVJkREpUakxWMUxxUHpuOHpVX3RXU3hSY0p3cVc3ZzByUlFsWjZqMkQ2ay1tN0o3QU05YzZrUXM1Zw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;

                                            minutes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="articleContainer"&gt;&lt;p&gt;KINGSTON, Canada — A three-year exercise program improved survival in colon cancer patients and kept disease at bay, a first-of-its-kind international experiment showed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the benefits rivaling some drugs, experts said cancer centers and insurance plans should consider making exercise coaching a new standard of care for colon cancer survivors. Until then, patients can increase their physical activity after treatment, knowing they are doing their part to prevent cancer from coming back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's an extremely exciting study," said Dr. Jeffrey Meyerhardt of Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, who wasn't involved in the research. It's the first randomized controlled trial to show a reduction in cancer recurrences and improved survival linked to exercise, Meyerhardt said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior evidence was based on comparing active people with sedentary people, a type of study that can't prove cause and effect. The new study — conducted in Canada, Australia, the United Kingdom, Israel and the United States — compared people who were randomly selected for an exercise program with those who instead received an educational booklet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is about as high a quality of evidence as you can get," said Dr. Julie Gralow, chief medical officer of the American Society of Clinical Oncology. "I love this study because it's something I've been promoting but with less strong evidence for a long time."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2502760" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;findings&lt;/a&gt; were featured Sunday at the American Society of Clinical Oncology's annual meeting in Chicago and published by the New England Journal of Medicine. Academic research groups in Canada, Australia and the U.K. funded the work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;'We were just astounded'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers followed 889 patients with treatable colon cancer who had completed chemotherapy. Half were given information promoting fitness and nutrition. The others worked with a coach, meeting every two weeks for a year, then monthly for the next two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coaches helped participants find ways to increase their physical activity. Many people, including Terri Swain-Collins, chose to walk for about 45 minutes several times a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is something I could do for myself to make me feel better," said Swain-Collins, 62, of Kingston, Ontario. Regular contact with a friendly coach kept her motivated and accountable, she said. "I wouldn't want to go there and say, 'I didn't do anything,' so I was always doing stuff and making sure I got it done."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After eight years, participants in the structured exercise program not only became more active than those in the control group but also experienced 28% fewer cancers and 37% fewer deaths from any cause. There were more muscle strains and other similar problems in the exercise group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When we saw the results, we were just astounded," said study co-author Dr. Christopher Booth, a cancer doctor at Kingston Health Sciences Centre in Kingston, Ontario.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;'Exercise causes improvements in survival'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exercise programs can be offered for several thousand dollars per patient, Booth said, "a remarkably affordable intervention that will make people feel better, have fewer cancer recurrences and help them live longer."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers collected blood from participants and will look for clues tying exercise to cancer prevention, whether through insulin processing or building up the immune system or something else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Swain-Collins' coaching program ended, but she is still exercising. She listens to music while she walks in the countryside near her home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That kind of behavior change can be achieved when people believe in the benefits, when they find ways to make it fun and when there's a social component, said paper co-author Kerry Courneya, who studies exercise and cancer at the University of Alberta. The new evidence will give cancer patients a reason to stay motivated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Now we can say definitively exercise causes improvements in survival," Courneya said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>KSL News</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jun 2025 20:59:50 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipwFBVV95cUxPUHV1RlhaSkI4UVpHS3JBdGNFdzVpbWN5bHBaVzllbEdPdGR5YzVjQ0w2c1p4S2hHY3FYeE11a3NRMXlwdG5YcVN4Y3dhSmprNFNuQUVWSXJBbXBwRHJ0SzU1aWNIVDBjdnREa2lobVJkREpUakxWMUxxUHpuOHpVX3RXU3hSY0p3cVc3ZzByUlFsWjZqMkQ2ay1tN0o3QU05YzZrUXM1Zw</guid></item><item><title>研究显示，运动可提高结肠癌患者的生存率-美联社新闻 | Exercise boosts survival rates in colon cancer patients, study shows - AP News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqwFBVV95cUxPWkNlR1kxZE9qSzdKV3NnSFdaSFJtRTFlREtiMmdQOWlaeDdEcVltUmlhd2RRVElqQVZaN1o0TFJWa1E0eGZOdmtUakpBdUVrRFExWmg2eG1OSW9QMTA2bTFYdG40M3NkaUtjOElNXzFQWVg3b1E0ZVRSZjluWklCU2gxV0ZIN3pQNjhRWC1ScGRhSm80N2RTTE5vdHJRT2N3TmU2dUZxUllWbjQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AP News</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jun 2025 19:34:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqwFBVV95cUxPWkNlR1kxZE9qSzdKV3NnSFdaSFJtRTFlREtiMmdQOWlaeDdEcVltUmlhd2RRVElqQVZaN1o0TFJWa1E0eGZOdmtUakpBdUVrRFExWmg2eG1OSW9QMTA2bTFYdG40M3NkaUtjOElNXzFQWVg3b1E0ZVRSZjluWklCU2gxV0ZIN3pQNjhRWC1ScGRhSm80N2RTTE5vdHJRT2N3TmU2dUZxUllWbjQ</guid></item><item><title>根据健康专家的说法，服用维生素D以最大限度吸收的最佳时间-雅虎 | The Best Time to Take Vitamin D for Maximum Absorption, According to Health Experts - Yahoo</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif0FVX3lxTFBoOGVBYTVsOVlvZGhoWVpmRU53UWZycmFfS0VOLWxqX0RXNEp4TmVLc2p6N2FrLUJNTHIxS1hzQW83Tk5BZ3lua3dsYk1xNlY4Zmg0dUpiMTJjeXhvZTBTak1CcXlPMndCbkZmSDRDek5faWZJSmgxSWNVOWxrelE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="" data-article-body="true"&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reviewed by Dietitian Sarah Pflugradt, Ph.D., RDN, CSCS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;Key Points&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul class="mb-4"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;It can be challenging to meet your vitamin D needs through diet alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;It doesn't matter whether you take vitamin D in the morning or evening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Take vitamin D with a meal or snack containing fat to enhance absorption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;When it comes to the supplement aisle, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8024998/what-happens-to-your-body-when-you-take-a-multivitamin-every-day/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:multivitamins;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;multivitamins&lt;/a&gt;, omega-3s and probiotics might score the most real estate on the shelf. However, if that multi doesn’t come with a dose of vitamin D, your doctor might recommend adding another pill to your routine. Known as the "sunshine vitamin," vitamin D is something most of us aren't getting enough of, and if you're wondering what time of day you should take it, we're here with the answer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;What Is Vitamin D?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/author/roxana-ehsani/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Roxana Ehsani, M.S., RD, CSSD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Roxana Ehsani, M.S., RD, CSSD&lt;/a&gt;, explains that &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8034163/benefits-vitamin-d/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:vitamin D;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;vitamin D&lt;/a&gt; is one of four fat-soluble vitamins (A, E and K are the others). Our bodies make vitamin D after being exposed to the sun, and we can also get it through our diet. It plays “many important roles in our body,” adds Ehsani. These include &lt;a class="link " href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-supplements-for-immune-health-8781386" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:supporting your immune system;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;supporting your immune system&lt;/a&gt;, muscle and nerve function, your body’s ability to absorb calcium and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Even though vitamin D is critical for overall health, research suggests that an estimated 25% of Americans are deficient in it. This could be because there are &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/foods-with-more-vitamin-d-than-an-egg-8732396" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:few food sources of vitamin D;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;few food sources of vitamin D&lt;/a&gt;, and many people don’t see sunshine during winter, live in regions with limited sunlight, and/or keep their skin covered while al fresco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The average older adult’s recommended Daily Value of vitamin D is 20 micrograms, which is equal to 800 international units (IU). For reference, one egg and a 3-ounce can of tuna each have above 1 mcg, 3 ounces of sockeye salmon delivers around 12 mcg, and 3 ounces of trout offers around 14 mcg. Unless you’re taking a spoonful of cod liver oil (34 mcg) or eating salmon or trout daily, it can be challenging to meet that mark through food alone, since most food sources of vitamin D offer small amounts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In the U.S., people get most of their &lt;a class="link " href="https://www.eatingwell.com/2024-vitamin-d-recommendations-8659678" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:dietary vitamin D from fortified milk;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;dietary vitamin D from fortified milk&lt;/a&gt;, which contains around 100 IU per 8-ounce serving.

As a general rule, though, “the ‘best’ time is what works best for you,” Ehsani says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;With or Without Meals&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“The timing of when to take the vitamin D supplement shouldn’t matter, but it should be taken with food,” Davidson says. “Because it’s a fat-soluble vitamin, food, specifically healthy fats, will help with the absorption of vitamin D.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;For example, if you tend to have almond-butter toast each morning, “consider taking it with that meal, as almond butter contains healthy fats,” Ehsani advises. Or, if you like to serve dinner with a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/275930/pear-gorgonzola-walnut-salad/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:side salad topped with a handful of walnuts;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;side salad topped with a handful of walnuts&lt;/a&gt; and drizzled with a vinaigrette, take your vitamin D before you sit down to dig in. You could also choose to take your vitamin D with a glass of whole milk or a yogurt drink—you'll get the addition of calcium from the dairy and the vitamin D will help your body absorb the calcium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“It may be impractical for you to take it with meals if you eat a majority of your meals away from home and can’t realistically carry the vitamin D supplement with you everywhere you go,” Ehsani acknowledges. So, if that’s not a realistic proposition, tell a health care professional about your schedule and when you think it might better fit, and ask for their runner-up recommendation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;Type of Vitamin D&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;There are two types of vitamin D: D2 and D3. UV-grown plants, fungi and fortified foods deliver D2, while we get D3 from sunlight and animal-based ingredients. While both are important and beneficial, &lt;a class="link " href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-time-to-take-vitamin-d-supplement-8620841" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:vitamin D3 is more bioavailable;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;vitamin D3 is more bioavailable&lt;/a&gt; than vitamin D2. This means that your body uses vitamin D3 more efficiently, so you might need a higher dose of vitamin D2 to achieve the same effects as you might with a supplement that includes just D3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Before starting any new supplement regimen, talk to a health care professional about the best form of vitamin D for you. And if you already take a vitamin D supplement, confirm with them that you’re taking the right form.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-to-look-for-in-a-supplement-8645052" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:7 Things You Should Look for When Buying a Supplement, According to Dietitians;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;7 Things You Should Look for When Buying a Supplement, According to Dietitians&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Our Expert Take&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The best time to take a vitamin D supplement is when it fits well into your day—and when you can remember to take it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;When choosing a vitamin D supplement, consider opting for vitamin D3 over D2 so your body can use it more efficiently. Additionally, Ehsani and Davidson confirm that, ideally, you should take your vitamin D supplement with a meal that contains fat to help with absorption. For instance, if you like to take vitamin D first thing in the morning, well before you typically eat breakfast, or prefer to pop your supplements just before bed, think about doing so with a handful of nuts or a spoonful of nut butter, Ehsani says. That way, you’ll enjoy two wellness wins in one: better vitamin D absorption and all the &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8027688/are-nuts-good-for-you/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:health benefits of nuts;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;health benefits of nuts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/supplements-not-to-take-dietitian-11735821" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:5 Supplements You Shouldn't Be Taking, According to a Dietitian;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;5 Supplements You Shouldn't Be Taking, According to a Dietitian&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-time-to-take-vitamin-d-for-maximum-absorption-11743667" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:EATINGWELL;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;EATINGWELL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jun 2025 19:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMif0FVX3lxTFBoOGVBYTVsOVlvZGhoWVpmRU53UWZycmFfS0VOLWxqX0RXNEp4TmVLc2p6N2FrLUJNTHIxS1hzQW83Tk5BZ3lua3dsYk1xNlY4Zmg0dUpiMTJjeXhvZTBTak1CcXlPMndCbkZmSDRDek5faWZJSmgxSWNVOWxrelE</guid></item><item><title>根据健康专家的说法，服用维生素D以最大限度吸收的最佳时间- EatingWell | The Best Time to Take Vitamin D for Maximum Absorption, According to Health Experts - EatingWell</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijwFBVV95cUxOSTBNUDQ0YmZXM3cwRFpGQU13QkJuMi1ibWU3ZG1rNFRJYUlFRmV2a3JpVlRTMW1sRWhRVzJmNExaWlFDT1hxanR4STRBVGpkdjVrU0RIUTFFcFdKaEg0cHdiWE5TbjE2Q2J3VWVTeVpvajlDYkNTRHhDMUFQeEtYMHZBamZ1RVF2ZXVqOGZLSQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-callout--summary mntl-sc-block-universal-callout--tips mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-summary callout--bordered" data-text="Key Points" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When it comes to the supplement aisle, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8024998/what-happens-to-your-body-when-you-take-a-multivitamin-every-day/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;multivitamins&lt;/a&gt;, omega-3s and probiotics might score the most real estate on the shelf. However, if that multi doesn’t come with a dose of vitamin D, your doctor might recommend adding another pill to your routine. Known as the "sunshine vitamin," vitamin D is something most of us aren't getting enough of, and if you're wondering what time of day you should take it, we're here with the answer.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/author/roxana-ehsani/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Roxana Ehsani, M.S., RD, CSSD&lt;/a&gt;, explains that &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8034163/benefits-vitamin-d/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;vitamin D&lt;/a&gt; is one of four fat-soluble vitamins (A, E and K are the others). Our bodies make vitamin D after being exposed to the sun, and we can also get it through our diet. It plays “many important roles in our body,” adds Ehsani. These include &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-supplements-for-immune-health-8781386" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;supporting your immune system&lt;/a&gt;, muscle and nerve function, your body’s ability to absorb calcium and more.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Even though vitamin D is critical for overall health, research suggests that an estimated 25% of Americans are deficient in it.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; This could be because there are &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/foods-with-more-vitamin-d-than-an-egg-8732396" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;few food sources of vitamin D&lt;/a&gt;, and many people don’t see sunshine during winter, live in regions with limited sunlight, and/or keep their skin covered while al fresco. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The average older adult’s recommended Daily Value of vitamin D is 20 micrograms, which is equal to 800 international units (IU).&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; For reference, one egg and a 3-ounce can of tuna each have above 1 mcg, 3 ounces of sockeye salmon delivers around 12 mcg, and 3 ounces of trout offers around 14 mcg.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Unless you’re taking a spoonful of cod liver oil (34 mcg) or eating salmon or trout daily, it can be challenging to meet that mark through food alone, since most food sources of vitamin D offer small amounts.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In the U.S., people get most of their &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/2024-vitamin-d-recommendations-8659678" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;dietary vitamin D from fortified milk&lt;/a&gt;, which contains around 100 IU per 8-ounce serving. But you'd need to drink a quart or more of milk daily to reach the DV—and milk consumption has been declining in recent years, a factor that some experts cite when discussing increased vitamin D deficiency.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

These include osteoporosis or osteopenia, depression, kidney or liver disease and having a family history of neurological conditions, to name a few. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; According to &lt;a href="https://www.northshore.org/apps/findadoctor/physicians/david-jeremy-davidson" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;David Davidson, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, it’s especially important for “people with absorption issues, like inflammatory bowel disease or post-gastric bypass surgery” to work with their doctors to dial in their dose and receive personalized guidance about when to take vitamin D. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Body size can also alter absorbency and dosing, so be sure to ask your doctor for an individual recommendation before you set off to shop for supplements.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you notice any nausea, constipation, noticeable appetite shifts or other &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/how-much-vitamin-d-per-day-is-too-much-8605769" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;adverse symptoms&lt;/a&gt; after taking your supplement, be sure to chat with your doctor.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Regardless of why you’re including a vitamin D supplement in your regimen, it’s important to consider your routine. It’s difficult to reap the health benefits of vitamin D if you forget to take it most of the time.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Many people do well with “habit stacking” or pairing the routine of taking vitamin D with something else they do daily on autopilot. Keep this in mind as you consider when to take your supplements.  Ehsani shows how to put this into practice: “If you always brush your teeth in the morning after breakfast, for instance, can you place your vitamin D supplements next to your toothbrush to remind you to take it each day?”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As with any new medication or supplement, it’s important to check with a health care professional to determine the best time for you. As a general rule, though, “the ‘best’ time is what works best for you,” Ehsani says.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “The timing of when to take the vitamin D supplement shouldn’t matter, but it should be taken with food,” Davidson says. “Because it’s a fat-soluble vitamin, food, specifically healthy fats, will help with the absorption of vitamin D.”

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For example, if you tend to have almond-butter toast each morning, “consider taking it with that meal, as almond butter contains healthy fats,” Ehsani advises. Or, if you like to serve dinner with a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/275930/pear-gorgonzola-walnut-salad/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;side salad topped with a handful of walnuts&lt;/a&gt; and drizzled with a vinaigrette, take your vitamin D before you sit down to dig in. You could also choose to take your vitamin D with a glass of whole milk or a yogurt drink—you'll get the addition of calcium from the dairy and the vitamin D will help your body absorb the calcium.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “It may be impractical for you to take it with meals if you eat a majority of your meals away from home and can’t realistically carry the vitamin D supplement with you everywhere you go,” Ehsani acknowledges. So, if that’s not a realistic proposition, tell a health care professional about your schedule and when you think it might better fit, and ask for their runner-up recommendation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Type of Vitamin D &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_49-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There are two types of vitamin D: D2 and D3. UV-grown plants, fungi and fortified foods deliver D2, while we get D3 from sunlight and animal-based ingredients. While both are important and beneficial, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-time-to-take-vitamin-d-supplement-8620841" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;vitamin D3 is more bioavailable&lt;/a&gt; than vitamin D2.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; This means that your body uses vitamin D3 more efficiently, so you might need a higher dose of vitamin D2 to achieve the same effects as you might with a supplement that includes just D3. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_50-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_51-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Before starting any new supplement regimen, talk to a health care professional about the best form of vitamin D for you. And if you already take a vitamin D supplement, confirm with them that you’re taking the right form. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_52-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_54-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-our-expert-take"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_55-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Our Expert Take &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_56-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The best time to take a vitamin D supplement is when it fits well into your day—and when you can remember to take it. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_57-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_58-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When choosing a vitamin D supplement, consider opting for vitamin D3 over D2 so your body can use it more efficiently. Additionally, Ehsani and Davidson confirm that, ideally, you should take your vitamin D supplement with a meal that contains fat to help with absorption. For instance, if you like to take vitamin D first thing in the morning, well before you typically eat breakfast, or prefer to pop your supplements just before bed, think about doing so with a handful of nuts or a spoonful of nut butter, Ehsani says. That way, you’ll enjoy two wellness wins in one: better vitamin D absorption and&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;all the &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8027688/are-nuts-good-for-you/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;health benefits of nuts&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

Without it, there would be no point in going to the gym.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Healthline &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.healthline.com/health-news/how-much-protein-per-day-build-muscle"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that active people need to consume between '1.2 to two grams of protein per kilogram of body weight' to build muscle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;So as well as eating high-protein &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/food-and-drink"&gt;foods&lt;/a&gt;, like chicken, steak, fish, and eggs, protein powders are an ideal supplement which helps you reach your target.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-image_articleImage__eyzAn"&gt;&lt;cite class="image-credit_imageCredit__YMlqS"&gt;Protein powder is very much part of the 'gym-bro' life (Getty Stock Images)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;You just mix it in with a bit of water or milk, and you've got yourself a pretty tasty drink.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;But while one scoop usually offers between 10 to 30 grams of protein, powders often contain additional ingredients like sugars, artificial flavourings and thickeners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;It comes after Harvard Health previously &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/the-hidden-dangers-of-protein-powders"&gt;issued&lt;/a&gt; a bit of protein powder warning back in 2022&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Kathy McManus, director of the Department of Nutrition at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital, said: "I don't recommend using protein powders except in a few instances, and only with supervision."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Back then, McManus claimed that we don't know the long-term effects of regular protein powder use because there is 'limited data'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"People with dairy allergies or trouble digesting lactose [milk sugar] can experience gastrointestinal discomfort if they use a milk-based protein powder," she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-image_articleImage__eyzAn"&gt;&lt;cite class="image-credit_imageCredit__YMlqS"&gt;A protein warning has been issued by the consumer health information division of Harvard Medical School (Getty Stock Images)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;The Harvard publication then cited a &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cleanlabelproject.org"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; about toxins in protein powders, put together by researchers of non-profit group Clean Label Project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;134 products and 130 types of toxins were looked at and the study found that 'many protein powders contained heavy metals (lead, arsenic, cadmium, and mercury), bisphenol-A (BPA, which is used to make plastic), pesticides, or other contaminants with links to &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/cancer"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; and other health conditions'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"Some toxins were present in significant quantities.

&lt;p&gt;According to studies, girls who get their &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/04/09/health/ive-had-my-period-for-1000-days-a-cute-clue-explains-why/"&gt;menstrual cycles&lt;/a&gt; at a young age are more susceptible to long-term health problems. As a result, one mom is trying to prevent her young daughter’s body from maturing too soon. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2024/05/29/early-menarche-jama-study-average-age-first-period/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Stat News&lt;/a&gt;, over the past 55 years, young girls in the US have been getting their &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/03/27/health/your-heavy-period-could-be-a-sign-of-this-blood-disorder/"&gt;periods&lt;/a&gt; earlier and earlier. Nowadays, the average age is 11 years and nine months. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As if that age was startling enough, 16% of girls are getting their cycle before they even celebrate their 11th birthday. &lt;/p&gt;

100vw, 885px"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Nowadays, the average age for a young girl to get her first period is 11 years and nine months.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;zakalinka – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The concerning part is that, according to the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5052133/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;National Library of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, females who start their period at this young age have a 23% higher risk of developing different cancers — like breast, endometrial and ovarian — later on in life. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from the increased risk of being diagnosed with serious illnesses down the road — another concern about early puberty is that young girls are forced to endure the emotional and physical toll periods can have before their brains and bodies are fully developed.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;“…modern teens have to deal with painful periods, the risk of getting pregnant and sometimes actually getting pregnant well before their brains and bodies are actually mature enough,” Elena Bridgers, a mom of two and a wellness and mental health writer, said in a &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DJR2aKioYaw/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;recent Instagram reel.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Because of this alarming news, moms like Rebecca Kinderman are trying to delay their daughter’s first period by following a holistic lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I believe that if we can delay this part of ‘growing up,’ especially when their brains are not developed enough to be able to handle everything that they could be exposed to online, we are allowing our girls to stay young for longer,” Kinderman told &lt;a href="https://www.newsweek.com/moms-are-trying-delay-daughters-first-period-experts-say-theyre-right-2075902" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Newsweek.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The 36-year-old posted a &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DI98Is-TP4G/?igsh=ZjM5MmYwdmh3Z2Ez" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;viral Instagram reel&lt;/a&gt; where she explained her thought process in helping her daughter live a long, healthy life.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Believing household toxins and poor diets are contributing factors to early periods, Kinderman stressed in her post that feeding your family whole foods without seed oils and artificial ingredients is major. &lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;And in the era of parents raising “iPad kids,” the mom also stressed the importance of removing kids from their tech devices and encouraging them to get outside and play.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And it seems that Kinderman might have a point — especially regarding diets and lifestyle choices.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I think that that is very reflective of the obesity epidemic that we are seeing,” Aviva Sopher, a professor of pediatrics at Columbia University, Irving Medical Center, told Stat News. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“To me, this is concerning as well, this kind of confluence of obesity and earlier puberty and more irregular cycles,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;

Part of this relationship was mediated by irritability and impulsivity. The research was published in the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2025.03.200"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Journal of Affective Disorders&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Childhood abuse refers to harmful or threatening treatment of a child, which can be physical, emotional, or sexual, or can involve neglect. Physical abuse includes hitting, shaking, or otherwise causing physical harm. Emotional abuse involves behaviors that harm a child’s self-worth, such as constant criticism, rejection, or humiliation. Sexual abuse includes any sexual activity with a child, including inappropriate touching, exposure, or exploitation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neglect is the failure to meet a child’s basic needs, such as food, shelter, medical care, education, or emotional support. Abuse can seriously affect a child’s development, leading to long-term mental health issues like anxiety, depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, and difficulties in relationships. Brain development may also be impacted, especially in areas related to stress response and emotion regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study author Zhengyi Liu and his colleagues aimed to explore the links between childhood abuse experiences and addictive behaviors. They hypothesized that childhood abuse could make an individual more prone to addictive behaviors both directly and indirectly by increasing irritability and impulsivity. The study particularly focused on smoking, drinking, and internet addiction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study participants were 1,601 high school students from a vocational school in Zhejiang Province, China. Students were in grades 10 and 11. Of the participants, 757 were girls. Their ages ranged from 15 to 19 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants completed assessments of childhood abuse (the Childhood Abuse Questionnaire), impulsivity (the Dual-Mode of Self-Control Scale), irritability (the Brief Irritability Scale), substance use (the Global School-based Student Health Survey), and internet addiction (the Internet Addiction Disorder Diagnostic Scale for middle school students).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results showed that girls tended to be slightly more impulsive and irritable than boys, but boys smoked and drank more. There were no significant gender differences in childhood abuse experiences or the severity of internet addiction symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As expected, participants reporting more severe childhood abuse experiences tended to score higher on measures of irritability and impulsivity. They were also more likely to display symptoms of internet addiction, to smoke more tobacco, and to drink more alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers tested a statistical model proposing that childhood abuse increases impulsivity and irritability, which in turn increase the likelihood of engaging in addictive behaviors. The results supported this model, but also indicated that impulsivity and irritability do not fully explain the link between childhood abuse and addiction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study sheds light on how early adversity may shape vulnerability to addiction. However, it is important to note that all data were self-reported, and childhood abuse data were retrospective (i.e., based on participants’ memories). This leaves room for reporting bias and memory inaccuracies to have influenced the results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2025.03.200"&gt;The association between childhood abuse and addictive behaviors in adolescents: Understanding the role of impulsivity and irritability&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Zhengyi Liu, Yunyi Xiao, Yingying Ye, Yifan Li, Zijian He, Nanshu Peng, and Xiao Zhou.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jun 2025 16:06:02 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqgFBVV95cUxNV2dsdm5lcFhaOE0xMGdlUkRwMEhiYnhJbm1GUlY3ck53MnZqVmlERTgxTnVhWmx1cGU3bkRkYzlWeHlrNWpKTFZkTDVQS1lrZnBsbC1hMmhEcktqdzU0bjlMX210ZEQ4RTdQM2dfc3lxem1ack5lYkk0dURPb0lDZklGS2xYX0NRZjJfLThrMzhKVk5RaW9RN2FvUVRxeUdJeHVZVlhFWm1OZw</guid></item><item><title>丹尼斯·奥斯汀（ Denise Austin ）解决顽固性腹部脂肪的5个习惯-吃这个不是那个 | Denise Austin’s 5 Habits to Tackle Stubborn Belly Fat - Eat This Not That</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiakFVX3lxTE5SNkRrZXMtcVhnNHl6dGxhaDF6dWRJeHFkd2ZkYjY3R19CYTZIUkFURFR4MmhJTUFOd1FlUzhFWDhpRG1ITVNncnFHd05LSHM4VHBVZFliSEk1WFBHaW5pdk1BOUMteXNlY0E?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="content single-post-content"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/ways-to-maximize-walking-for-weight-loss/" target="_blank"&gt;walking&lt;/a&gt; doesn’t appear to be an intense workout, it could be your key to belly fat loss.&lt;/p&gt;

  
&lt;p&gt;“Walking for just 30 minutes per day is all you need to reap the benefits of physical activity,” Denise writes on &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://www.deniseaustin.com/blog/walk-off-belly-fat-" target="_blank"&gt;her website&lt;/a&gt;. “It can be as effective (if not more so) than jogging. While walking, you can burn fat, boost your metabolism, and/or lose weight. Exactly how much you get out of it will depend on the intensity of your walks and what other healthy habits you’re practicing during the rest of your time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Denise even has a workout program specifically dedicated to walking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My 4-Week Walking Challenge encourages you to walk every day for 30 minutes, along with quick, mini-workouts to tone up your whole body—it’s one of my most popular challenges, so join today for free!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to increase the intensity of your walks to speed up the fat burn, consider performing bodyweight exercises, wearing a rucksack or ankle weights, switching up the terrain, and including inclines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="karma_unit karma_unit--distinct inline karma_unit--mobile hide-desktop karma_unit--sliding htlad-lazy-mob-square-fixed karma_unit--halfpage"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Certain workouts specifically fire up your abdominal region and address stubborn belly fat.&lt;span aria-hidden="true"&gt;6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In general, belly fat wraps around your organs like the liver and belly, and is called &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/how-to-increase-visceral-fat-burn-while-walking/" target="_blank"&gt;visceral fat&lt;/a&gt; (as opposed to subcutaneous fat, which is closer to your skin),” Denise explains. “To tackle this visceral fat, you need to add some targeted moves to your workouts. You will want to add core moves that both elongate and constrict the abdominal muscles.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="karma_unit karma_unit--distinct inline karma_unit--mobile hide-desktop karma_unit--sliding htlad-lazy-mob-square-fixed"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Denise suggests giving her 6-Minute Amazing Abs Pilates Workout and 10-Minute Belly Blasting Workout a shot. Once you progress, check out Denise’s Shape, Strengthen and Sculpt Kit, which features many targeted exercises for the belly, upper, and lower body.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She writes on &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://www.deniseaustin.com/blog/blast-belly-fat-with-yoga" target="_blank"&gt;her blog&lt;/a&gt;, “Yoga is especially helpful for targeting the belly and belly fat—yoga moves target tone the abs without sit ups, and works all parts of the midsection—the abs, waistline, and the deep fat within the belly area. So try this yoga workout and watch the belly fat melt away!”&lt;/p&gt;

I have requested a transfer from my job so we can get out of this podunk shithole ASAP. Do you have any advice for dealing with the rude quips from the local yokels until then?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="91" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbbag7dl001i3b76u0kl90ff@published"&gt;If you really don’t care about these opinions, stay committed to that attitude. Let them talk. Either ignore them or tell them that you don’t care. Know that they’re wrong and instead of worrying yourself about the principle of the way they’re treating you and your girlfriend, focus on the practice that will complicate your lives the least. You could even offer solidarity: “I’m slutty, too” or, “I know, isn’t she amazing?” This may put the target on you for mockery as well, but again, who cares what these people think?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="133" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbbag7ge001j3b768z1sd7we@published"&gt;You could also take the drag-queen route and read them right back. Try clap-backs along the lines of: “Wow, you must really have nothing going on in your life that you’re concerned about my girlfriend’s teenage sex life,” or “You’re a little overly concerned with a teen’s sex life, don’t you think?,” or “Jealous, much?” Of course, this would serve to escalate the situation while dragging you down to their level. Because this could cause further complications and on the principle that it would actively bring more ugliness into the world, I’d tread lightly but you could do it. Many people won’t let things go beyond words and you will soon never see these people again so shutting them up aggressively might feel good and not be very complicated at all, after all.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="54" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbbag7m2001l3b76uaftnr0b@published"&gt;I have an embarrassing penis problem. I am 66 now. I have always been a “grower”—that is, I add a lot of length and girth when I get hard. As I have aged—and now moved to a hot climate—my ball sack has just grown larger. I thought it was a myth, but apparently not.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="106" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbbag7ou001m3b767b3kup0s@published"&gt;Now when I sit the wrong way, or exercise the wrong way, my penis pretty much disappears into the ball sack. And it feels terrible. I end up adjusting myself all the time. I can move my penis to one side and my ball sack to the other, but if I move around more it hurts. I’ve tried several types of underwear: pouches, boxer briefs, and regular boxers. But nothing helps for long. Anything that holds my genital area ends up smushing (technical term) my penis. Can your experts think of anything to fix this? Cock rings work, but I can’t wear them all the time.&lt;/p&gt;

You seem to be describing a condition known as &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/16291-buried-penis"&gt;buried penis&lt;/a&gt;. There are some non-invasive treatments for it like weight loss and steroid creams for those who experience buried penis as a result of tight skin around the penis, but for some, surgery may be the only effective treatment option. Sometimes this surgery can come in the form of a tummy tuck or suction lipectomy, which removes fat from around the genital region. There is also the possibility of removing scrotal tissue when that is the culprit of buried penis, as it is in your case. It’s unclear what’s causing your discomfort, but that’s not uncommon with buried penis and sometimes is the result of &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/lichen-sclerosus/symptoms-causes/syc-20374448"&gt;lichen sclerosus&lt;/a&gt;, a condition that can result in thin, patchy, and/or discolored skin that is typically treated with ointment.&lt;/p&gt;

In an email, he told me that it “seems a little too convenient to blame this on just the weather,” and indeed buried penis is typically caused by weight gain or “some sort of intrascrotal process like a hydrocele making the scrotum grow bigger and envelop the penis.” The doctor’s recommendation? See a doctor. Granted, this may seem daunting given your embarrassment, but doctors see issues like this all the time. It’s worth sucking it up to ameliorate your discomfort and, yes, potential embarrassment moving forward. If telling one person could save you years of grief, that seems like a no-brainer trade off.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="46" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbbag86e001s3b76so8kfi2r@published"&gt;My wife and I have been married for more than 20 years. We love each other and are extremely happy together. Recently, she went through some health and work issues, and our sex life waned, but now that both are resolved, it’s picked back up again.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="70" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbbag896001t3b76bvqiu3eq@published"&gt;We’ve had many conversations over the years about our shared belief in ethical nonmonogamy and giving it a try. They’ve escalated lately. About a decade ago, with my permission, she slept with a longtime acquaintance. Until recently, that was it. In the past few months, it became apparent a mutual friend was interested in her, and with our spark back, I encouraged her to go for it if she wanted.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="77" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbbag8c0001u3b76g9xd26v8@published"&gt;She did, and she loved the experience. I’m happy for her! She’s now encouraging me to try it, too. She’s particularly excited about it because she’s the only sexual partner I’ve ever had (I grew up in a strict household, and in a religion that instilled a lot of shame, and I was a shy, unconfident, late bloomer). She keeps telling me: “I don’t want to be the only person you ever have sex with!” Great, right?&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="122" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbbag8ev001v3b766v0zixrt@published"&gt;The problem is, while I’m eager to try it, I have no idea where to start. Because she loves me and is attracted to me, she doesn’t realize there is a big opportunity gap between us. She is beautiful, outgoing, witty, charming, and easily attracts people. As I’ve aged, I’ve gained weight and lost hair. She regularly is thought to be 15 years younger, while I definitely look my age. Plus, I’m just naturally more shy and reserved. She tells me often that I’m a kind, thoughtful person and that I’m good in bed, but I do not exude (sexual) energy like she does, and do not have acquaintances coming up to me asking if we’re open and can we sleep together.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="101" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbbag8jj001w3b76v6pbgech@published"&gt;I know this is going to require work on my part to get out of my comfort zone and put myself out there. But it seems likely to me that if I do this, it’s probably going to start with someone I don’t know yet (which she’s OK with). So, I’m wondering if you can suggest some apps or websites (or just give me any useful insight) on how to meet some like-minded people? We’ve discussed, down the road, perhaps trying threesomes or partner-swapping, but for now, I’m just trying to figure out how to get my “body count” to two.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="74" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbbag8rw001z3b76bypdvp4k@published"&gt;Some of what you’re worried about is easy enough to work on. If you aren’t exercising regularly, that’s a great place to start. It can help with your mental as well as physical health and affect your body composition. Working out may also give you the kind of glow that many find attractive as it silently telegraphs health. In addition to the gains, you may find your confidence lifted, which can also attract people.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="238" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbbag8up00203b76824ix9z4@published"&gt;I think that’s key here: You need a boost of that kind of self-esteem. It can be learned via a fake-it-till-you-make-it approach. Even if you don’t feel confident, carry yourself like you are and you may start to be naturally, once you feel the effects of this disposition. Confidence begets confidence. Also, you’re a guy, which means you have a bit more wiggle room in terms of looking your age and still being considered attractive. That’s male privilege, and while beauty standards are changing for men, things like crows feet and thinning hair are not held against men’s appearance to the extent that they are women’s. It’s not fair, but it’s the way things are at the moment. If nothing else, tuck that in your back pocket and use it so as not to be hard on yourself. The other side of the gender norms is that men are still largely expected to be the pursuers of sex. That’s changing, too, but it could explain a bit as to why your wife is being hit on when you are not. Sure, she may be hot, but in your letter, I see you repeatedly talking down to yourself. Realism is important and self-awareness is a rare commodity, but negative self-talk can get in the way of you trying to move forward on your ENM path here. I’m just trying to dismantle some of the blockades you have set up.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="61" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbbag8xi00213b76bntrbwto@published"&gt;Feeld is the go-to app for ethical non-monogamy. If you have kinks, consider Fetlife (though you’re likely to have luck on Feeld, as well, given the amount of kinksters on it). Tinder has a meat-market reputation, so that may work for you, and sites like OKCupid and &lt;a href="http://match.com"&gt;match.com&lt;/a&gt; have been around for so long that they cover ENM bases as well.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="168" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbbag90e00223b7685eelnrl@published"&gt;You could also try threesomes or partner-swapping as opposed to finding new partners on your own. Your wife is more experienced, and you claim she’s hotter, so you might have better luck looking for extra partners together. Group sex isn’t for everyone, and there are plenty of ENM couples that play separately, but unless you have good reasons for doing it that way (beyond the tit-for-tat reason that she’s already experienced it solo and so should you), I recommend cruising together. On apps like Feeld, you can link profiles with your partner so that the interested can check both of you out to see what they’re getting. You may also consider swingers clubs/groups or sex clubs. These spaces can be overwhelming, sure, but they can also allow you to feel out vibes and kind of get in the ENM headspace. You don’t have to have sex when you go—you can just hang out and watch. That might be the easiest way for you to dip your toe in.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="80" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbbagu3d002a3b76edzfpw6t@published"&gt;I don’t have a problem with porn, but I’m realizing I have a problem with the way my husband watches it. Last week, I asked him to play some music from his phone by pairing it with the TV, and a porn video sprang up. I immediately lurched to cover our 8-year-old’s eyes, but the incident stuck with me. I think he’s watching way more porn than I know, and probably lying to me about it. &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2023/08/porn-addiction-signs-husband-watching-advice.html"&gt;What should I do?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Of these people, more than half reported suffering from rectal bleeding, a warning sign of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Timothy Cannon, the medical oncologist who led the research, told DailyMail.com that the results were higher than what doctors would expect in the general population and warranted further investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said that any long-distance runners experiencing warning signs of colon cancer, such as rectal bleeding, should get tested for the disease, regardless of age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study was observational so it is not clear if distance running raises the risk of if other lifestyle factors like diet play a role. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But Dr Cannon suggested it could be because running long periods causes blood to be directed away from the colon to the legs, raising the risk of cell death and damaging mutations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Shown above is colon cancer patient Phil Decker in January 2025, pictured running a marathon with Alecia Allen. He was getting ready to run a marathon when he was diagnosed with stage four colon cancer &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Radwah Oda never thought she could get cancer as we was in 'excellent health' at the time of her diagnosis at age 33. She was working out five times a week&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said: '&lt;span&gt;As a colon cancer oncologist, I had seen several patients die of colon cancer that were in their 30s that ran ultramarathons, which were 50km or higher runs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We did this study because we were concerned that these runners were/are diverting all their blood flow to their legs during runs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'And [then are having] infarcts in their colon, and a lot of cell turnover; the cells die and then turn over very quickly [meaning] there may be more risk of cancer causing mutations.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Infarcts are area of dead tissue caused by a loss of blood supply. When blood flow is blocked or severely reduced —usually by a clot, embolism, or narrowed vessels — the affected tissue doesn't get the oxygen and nutrients it needs, and it dies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is just the latest explanation being put forward by scientists to explain the &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14761627/colon-cancer-rates-linked-alcohol-smoking-young-people.html"&gt;surge in colon cancer cases among those under 50 years old&lt;/a&gt;, with those born in the 1980s now having double the risk of being diagnosed with the cancer compared to their parents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is not clear whether long-distance running may also be linked to a higher risk of other cancers that are rising in young people, like in the pancreas. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Many young colon cancer patients &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13784061/marathon-runner-pancreas-cancer-deadly-symptoms-ignored-harmless.html"&gt;have been shocked by their diagnosis&lt;/a&gt;, saying they are young, healthy and - they thought - were doing everything right. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Patients include Laurie Koshers, a vegetarian who ran every day, but was diagnosed with colon cancer at age 44 years, and marathon runner John B. Johnson, who was diagnosed at 35 years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The latest study was carried out in memory of two patients - Josh Wadlington and Spencer 'Trigg' Robbins - who both battled colon cancer despite running marathons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The research was presented at ASCO 2025 in Chicago, Illinois, the world's largest gathering of cancer researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Lee Rawlinson, who previously ran marathons, learned that his grandfather had pancreatic cancer and he carries a 'dodgy gene'. It is not clear whether there is a link between long-distance running and other early-onset cancers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Holly Shawyer, 35, was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer last year despite being in peak shape and training for a marathon. It is not clear whether there is a link between long-distance running and other early-onset cancers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;'I have always been pretty health conscious – watching what I eat and regularly exercising. I rarely got sick, maybe once every few years I would get a stomach bug,' Ms Shawyer said&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Patients aged 35 to 50 years old who were ultramarathon runners were recruited for the study. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This was defined as people who had completed at least two marathons of 50 kilometers (31 miles) or more, or five marathons of at least 42km (26.2miles) or longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People who had inflammatory bowel disease or other conditions linked to colon cancer were excluded from the analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Overall, participants had an average age of 42 years, 55 percent were female and they reported running around 32 to 64km (20 to 40 miles) every week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Between October 2022 and December 2024, patients underwent a colonoscopy - a screening for colon cancer where a flexible tube with a small camera on the end is placed into the colon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Cannon said they were still investigating other factors that may have put them at risk of developing pre-cancerous polyps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Preliminary results had shown that runners ate at least five energy bars and also consumed gels daily - which are highly processed foods, with foods in this category previously being linked to a higher risk of colon cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Laurie Koshers (left) was diagnosed with colon cancer after 'doing everything right'. She is a vegetarian and also would run every day&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Colon cancer cases are rising among under 50 year olds, even as they fall in older age groups&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Cannon added: 'I think that i would get a colonoscopy if you have blood from your stool, even if you are not at the age yet where colonoscopies are approved - or at least i would ask your doctor for one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I think bleeding from the rectum in runners is dismissed because it is a known entity, runners colitis is known, and it hasn't been known to be associated with cancer, so it is often dismissed by doctors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'But my hope is that, with more awareness, people who run long distance and have bleeding will go get a colonoscopy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'In our study, most of the people who were having advanced adenomas were having blood in their stools.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The American Cancer Society &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-6574107/Colorectal-cancer-rates-deaths-soaring-especially-young-adults.html"&gt;estimates over 154,000 Americans will be stuck by colorectal cancer this year, including about 20,000 under 50.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While this is roughly in line with two decades ago, the disease is rising sharply in younger groups.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the latest data, early-onset colon cancer diagnoses in the US are expected to &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-6306175/Bowel-cancer-rates-rise-younger-people-Europe.html"&gt;rise by 90 percent in people 20 to 34 years old between 2010 and 2030&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In teens, rates have surged 500 percent since the early 2000s. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jun 2025 15:49:53 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikAFBVV95cUxQUWh0T3ppbnhacXEtZldVTVlKOG4wYUNBdFN0R2diNUhCRHkwNjF4Z19Dc2I3aEVXQ29pSURUOEVtek9OcTVDdW1LTTRjb1FFdFNGUG83QXZwbzFsbGhuQ3d0clg2TlAtLVdDdTVuYXNkR29FQUVKQ2tyOHlxMlU2c1dTa1hHQnhaTHZZUGdMRko</guid></item><item><title>与心脏损伤重大风险直接相关的任何形式的大麻使用- Earth.com | Cannabis use in any form directly linked to significant risk of heart damage - Earth.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipwFBVV95cUxOYlNhN1RlQWtVUTZPOHZLSzRhbXBISlNqTkk4czJnNnFaVTZIdk1teU1iZ3FtSE44QlJjbW1yeG1nazNsd29oOVN2ZXNMaTVVUVhkYnR4cEJGR2NETnItYWdNM0xCSVdqTzlFdlZfQkY0djdmTXRKVVlBaEswOHdHdklnbElzVVN4b3NJLWpvaWdOMUVwOGZ5aVlOMU9PMWxTa3Vta0tPNA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page_content__AwOj6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marijuana has long been debated as a safer alternative to traditional cigarettes. Some people view it as a benign stress-reliever with fewer hazards than tobacco products. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evidence from a recent study challenges that assumption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was led by first author Leila Mohammadi, MD, PhD, and senior author Matthew L. Springer, PhD, at the &lt;a href="https://www.ucsf.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of California, San Francisco&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-cannabis-users-and-heart-damage"&gt;Cannabis users and heart damage&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study followed 55 participants who were already cannabis users or individuals who did not use any nicotine &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/dopamine-changes-from-cannabis-last-at-least-one-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;products&lt;/a&gt;. Each cannabis user had a habit of consuming it at least three times a week for at least one year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The group included smokers who averaged around 10 years of use and those who used &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/tetrahydrocannabinol" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;tetrahydrocannabinol&lt;/a&gt; in edible form with around five years of use. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The nonsmoking control group showed healthier cardiovascular indicators than any of the cannabis-using groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers uncovered decreased blood vessel function in participants who either smoked marijuana or took edibles containing the psychoactive compound in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/cannabis-sativa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cannabis sativa&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found vascular function in those using either type of cannabis was roughly half that of nonusers. This was linked to higher chances of &lt;a href="https://stanfordhealthcare.org/medical-conditions/blood-heart-circulation/endothelial-dysfunction.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;endothelial dysfunction&lt;/a&gt;, which refers to impaired operations of the cells lining blood vessels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-cannabis-linked-blood-vessel-damage"&gt;Cannabis-linked blood vessel damage&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When blood vessels lose flexibility or responsiveness, that can heighten the likelihood of conditions such as heart attacks and hypertension. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some previous &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/01.cir.103.23.2805" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;findings&lt;/a&gt; have also associated marijuana use with possible triggers for cardiovascular complications. The current study adds more data to consider for those who routinely depend on cannabis for relaxation or pain relief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The potential link between endothelial dysfunction and cannabis use raises concerns about early development of vascular disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This condition involves impaired nitric oxide production and reduced elasticity in the arteries, both of which influence how well blood moves around the body. If this process falters too much, people may face a spike in heart-related &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/cbd-reduces-the-unwanted-side-effects-of-thc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;risks&lt;/a&gt; over the years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-smoking-cannabis-and-heart-health"&gt;Smoking cannabis and heart health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investigators noticed that marijuana smokers had distinct changes in their blood serum that were harmful to cells lining blood vessels. Those taking edibles, however, did not display the same harmful shift in serum properties. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This might indicate that the act of burning and inhaling &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/high-potency-cannabis-use-linked-to-epigenetic-changes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;cannabis&lt;/a&gt; smoke triggers certain biochemical pathways not activated by ingesting THC in food or beverage form. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both methods still resulted in diminished vessel function, but the underlying mechanisms appeared to vary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This discovery opens the door for closer evaluation of how inhaled cannabis influences nitric oxide and other chemicals in the bloodstream. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts have tried to pinpoint how THC might harm vessels, but these findings suggest there are yet-to-be-mapped pathways involved. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They highlight the need for more research to understand how different routes of use impact the cardiovascular system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-eating-cannabis-and-heart-health"&gt;Eating cannabis and heart health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12412838/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;scientists&lt;/a&gt; have drawn parallels between marijuana smoking and tobacco use when it comes to cardiovascular strain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both involve inhaling combusted materials that may generate oxidizing particles and other toxins. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study found that while chronic users of edibles also showed diminished endothelial function, it did not seem tied to changes in blood serum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts have suggested that &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/cbd-reduces-the-unwanted-side-effects-of-thc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;THC&lt;/a&gt; may cause adverse cardiovascular effects through interactions with cannabinoid receptors in the heart or blood vessels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Edible users might be experiencing those effects in a way that bypasses the bloodstream’s immediate signaling changes linked to smoking. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings also hint that inhalation may carry a bigger immediate impact on serum factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-does-all-of-this-mean"&gt;What does all of this mean?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people view &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/medicinal-cannabis-helped-patients-feel-better-for-a-full-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;edibles&lt;/a&gt; as a safer alternative to smoking. Edibles do avoid the dangers of inhaling combusted matter, yet the overall vascular function among both smoking and non-smoking users in the study was still notably reduced compared to nonusers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s a cautionary sign for anyone who feels that avoiding smoke means avoiding all serious health risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medical or recreational users might want to stay alert to these issues. Some individuals turn to cannabis for relief from pain or anxiety, but this research indicates a need for awareness about cardiovascular health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regular check-ups with a healthcare provider could be wise, especially for those with a family history of heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-heart-health-cannabis-and-the-future"&gt;Heart health, cannabis, and the future&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study team noted that the specific mechanisms behind THC’s effect on blood vessels remain somewhat unclear. They observed that smoking marijuana affects blood vessel function in ways distinct from ingesting THC. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This means new research should aim to pin down which components of smoke, vapor, or other byproducts may be most harmful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists are likely to explore whether occasional marijuana use carries the same risk as chronic use. More data on dosage levels and individual differences could help the medical community develop more precise guidelines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Current work sets the stage for larger population studies that can track cardiovascular parameters over longer timeframes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cardiovascular health is a lifelong matter. This research shows that both edible users and smokers should keep an eye on how cannabis might impact their heart and blood vessels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caution makes sense until medical professionals reach a clearer understanding of how best to reduce any risks linked to routine use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamacardiology/article-abstract/2834540" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;JAMA Cardiology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jun 2025 15:16:54 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipwFBVV95cUxOYlNhN1RlQWtVUTZPOHZLSzRhbXBISlNqTkk4czJnNnFaVTZIdk1teU1iZ3FtSE44QlJjbW1yeG1nazNsd29oOVN2ZXNMaTVVUVhkYnR4cEJGR2NETnItYWdNM0xCSVdqTzlFdlZfQkY0djdmTXRKVVlBaEswOHdHdklnbElzVVN4b3NJLWpvaWdOMUVwOGZ5aVlOMU9PMWxTa3Vta0tPNA</guid></item><item><title>铁天然存在于这10种食物中-印度时报 | Iron is naturally present in these 10 foods - Times of India</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;amp-story-grid-layer class="recircular" id="rcontent" template="vertical"&gt;&lt;div class="letterbox"&gt;&lt;p class="mid-heading"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;You may also like&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="rc3 pa"&gt;​10 reasons why spinach deserves a spot ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="rc5 pa"&gt;9 fast and easy mini-workouts to reduce ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/amp-story-grid-layer&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jun 2025 15:04:28 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>在埃及石棺中发现的银河系最古老的描绘- Earth.com | Oldest depiction of the Milky Way galaxy discovered in an Egyptian sarcophagus - Earth.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirAFBVV95cUxOeFBJXzRiUDBZU2ZNYUxrZF9Rc2V1emY1M2VRaEVDMWs4Q1c3QlVlTUNQdFVGaHJLRE9saDVHOGo2ckNQUDlNNTJ3dmhocVlwUzdzOFdlUDJfbWRQUVNhYnMyTDZRay1vT0FwZVZCNm9jSzJQTW1nYmxzc0dlVjdySngzRTlOcWdMM3NkdnB3SEZlOUZKV21KU1NFbWcyNk1zUzM3MjdHbkNSWnZ2?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page_content__AwOj6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The oldest known depiction of our galaxy may come from a coffin that once held an ancient Egyptian priestess. Thousands of years ago, early observers around the Nile watched the night sky and recorded what they saw in ways that still surprise people today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their cosmic understanding went beyond casual observation, given the care they took in mapping stars and planetary positions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These efforts shaped myths and religious beliefs that included powerful deities who represented the sky itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The presence of such a depiction was proposed by &lt;a href="https://www.port.ac.uk/about-us/structure-and-governance/our-people/our-staff/or-graur" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Or Grauer&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href="https://www.port.ac.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Portsmouth&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He explored museum collections for images of Nut, the Egyptian goddess of the sky, and found an unexpected detail on a coffin belonging to &lt;a href="https://www.academia.edu/83189270/Inner_coffin_of_Nesitaudjatakhet_from_the_collection_of_the_National_Museum_of_the_Republic_of_Tatarstan_Kazan_" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Nesitaudjatakhet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-egyptians-and-the-night-sky"&gt;Egyptians and the night sky&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ancient &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/ancient-high-tech-machinery-used-to-build-egypt-step-pyramid-djoser-study-claims/"&gt;Egyptian&lt;/a&gt; society thrived along the banks of the Nile, where seasonal floods influenced farming and daily life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The night sky became a reference point for these rhythms, prompting the Egyptians to begin making &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/ancient-high-tech-machinery-used-to-build-egypt-step-pyramid-djoser-study-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;detailed observations&lt;/a&gt; of celestial patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Priests tracked the rising and setting of stars to guide religious events, marking out constellations with local symbolism. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Astrophysicists and historians now suggest these same patterns shaped how the Egyptians understood their gods and the wider firmament.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In one striking coffin scene, &lt;a href="https://egyptianmuseum.org/deities-nut" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Nut’s figure&lt;/a&gt; arches over the earth, with an undulating curve traced from her fingertips to her toes. This dark curve cuts through the stars on her body, leaving some above and others below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A comparison with a photograph of the Milky Way shows the striking similarity between the wavy curve that runs through Nut’s body and the wavy curve created by the dark nebulae that make up the Great Rift,” said Dr. Grauer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It appears to match &lt;a href="https://epod.usra.edu/blog/2024/04/the-great-rift.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;the Great Rift&lt;/a&gt;, which is the band of interstellar dust that seems to bisect the Milky Way. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-deepening-our-view-of-nut"&gt;Deepening our view of nut&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Nut was often pictured as the entire Egyptian night sky, she did not always show a visible reference to the Milky Way. Many coffin artworks depict her naked or clothed but typically avoid that wavy band.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The feature in Nesitaudjatakhet’s coffin stands out because the curve is thick, dark, and divides her starry form. This is why some experts now consider it the earliest known artistic sign of the Milky Way in &lt;a href="https://fisher.library.utoronto.ca/fisher-blog/iconography-ancient-egyptian-funerary-objects-cartonnage-papyri-fisher" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Egyptian funeral iconography&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much of Nut’s representation involved the path of the Sun and stars as she swallowed them at dusk and birthed them at dawn. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Egyptians also described the sky in texts that link it to a “Winding Waterway,” which some believe could be a name for our galaxy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The faint dust clouds that form the Great Rift are easy to notice under dark skies, so it is possible that ancient astronomers saw this feature splitting the glow of the Milky Way. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether they specifically labeled it as a cosmic river or associated it with Nut’s form remains a point of discussion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-connecting-religion-and-astronomy"&gt;Connecting religion and astronomy&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The knowledge carved and painted into these burial items reflects a society that saw religion and astronomy as one connected system. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/blue-lotus-unraveling-an-egyptian-psychedelic-mystery/"&gt;Egyptian&lt;/a&gt; night sky lore spanned the Sun, Moon, planets, and stars, with deities representing cosmic forces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nut’s cosmic curve is just another reminder of how carefully people watched the heavens in earlier times. Today, it serves as both a historical clue and a symbol of human curiosity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;a href="https://cff2.earth.com/uploads/2025/06/01084423/egyptian-sarcophagus_Ramesses-VI_oldest-milky-way-drawing_credit-Francis-Dzikowski_1m.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://cff2.earth.com/uploads/2025/06/01084430/egyptian-sarcophagus_Ramesses-VI_oldest-milky-way-drawing_credit-Francis-Dzikowski_1s.webp" alt="The Book of the Day from the tomb of Ramesses VI (KV 09).

In classical Greece, it was called the “Galaxy,” rooted in legends of milk sprayed across the sky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/ancient-egyptian-mummies-still-carry-their-original-scents/"&gt;Egyptian&lt;/a&gt; approach put the galaxy within a goddess’s silhouette, linking cosmic wonder to stories of birth and rebirth. This bond between visual art and faith explains why coffins became a central place for these images.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-does-any-of-this-matter"&gt;Why does any of this matter?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts point to the 21st and 22nd Dynasties as times of vibrant coffin designs, combining older funerary customs with new artistic ideas. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Burial sets often had layers, each with religious scenes that showed various deities and protective formulas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A person like Nesitaudjatakhet, who served as a musician and chantress, held a high rank in temple society. The images around her final resting place likely merged theology with cosmic symbolism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-egypt-and-the-ancient-night-sky"&gt;Egypt and the ancient night sky&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who research early astronomy continue to wonder if Egyptian priests fully understood the galaxy’s shape or only noticed its brighter patches. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The presence of the Great Rift suggests they recognized distinct zones in the band of light crossing the night sky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This raises the question of whether the “&lt;a href="https://grahamhancock.com/phorum/read.php?1,71210,71223" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Winding Waterway&lt;/a&gt;” refers to that dark split within the glowing path. Though we may never know their exact thoughts, the coffin detail hints that they observed far more than modern assumptions might suggest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even without telescopes, ancient stargazers formed complex ideas about &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/first-ever-recorded-planetary-engulfment-event-captured-by-webb/"&gt;planetary&lt;/a&gt; alignments and seasonal changes. They excelled at linking natural cycles to myths, weaving them into every aspect of life and the afterlife.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nut’s starry figure and that striking curve demonstrate how ancient theology and observation blended into a single story. It is an unusual view of the sky that still holds our attention today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the &lt;a href="https://dds.sciengine.com/cfs/files/pdfs/view/1440-2807/CF0632CF1DDF408F8BA140B965EF95B6.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Journal of Astronomical History and Heritage&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jun 2025 14:51:53 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirAFBVV95cUxOeFBJXzRiUDBZU2ZNYUxrZF9Rc2V1emY1M2VRaEVDMWs4Q1c3QlVlTUNQdFVGaHJLRE9saDVHOGo2ckNQUDlNNTJ3dmhocVlwUzdzOFdlUDJfbWRQUVNhYnMyTDZRay1vT0FwZVZCNm9jSzJQTW1nYmxzc0dlVjdySngzRTlOcWdMM3NkdnB3SEZlOUZKV21KU1NFbWcyNk1zUzM3MjdHbkNSWnZ2</guid></item><item><title>试验发现，锻炼“优于药物”以阻止癌症在治疗后复发-《卫报》 | Exercise ‘better than drugs’ to stop cancer returning after treatment, trial finds - The Guardian</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiwAFBVV95cUxPWVJLTjlVX0VpYWgtanFSWm8xRE9XSmdmS1F6bGdCY0lDamsxRGQ3SWJNaG1TVFZUVVVLbmtJOTlzQUVqUFlWZTNBbWFaMGJoTmRKNHd6TzlmTnJtdjVNYjZ2aV8wcDNkeGdDejJrSXJ3b080ZGx5NlhVZEl2dFBPSjFvUVdGWDBpSFFhakxjMmJNZmY2OTYzUUdJLTZUbHM3bFppVTZPRnBQWXlxc0w2NmpTRGtsXzVlTlFSZkQ0c0Y?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body-commercial-selector article-body-viewer-selector dcr-11jq3zt"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Exercise can reduce the risk of cancer patients dying by a third, stop tumours coming back and is even more effective than drugs, according to the results of a landmark trial that could transform health guidelines worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;For decades, doctors have recommended adopting a healthy lifestyle to lower the risk of developing cancer.

I would have retitled it Better than a Drug, because you don’t have all the side-effects.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“It’s the same magnitude of benefit of many drugs that get approved for this kind of magnitude of benefit – 28% decreased risk of occurrence, 37% decreased risk of death. Drugs get approved for less than that, and they’re expensive and they’re toxic.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“When I started three decades ago it was still the era where we’d be gentle and say, don’t overdo yourself when you’re on chemo. We’ve reversed that,” she added. “I would say [exercise is] better than a drug.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="b8ceac9a-c41c-473e-93c4-4acb9557946f" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":10,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"Bowel cancer rising among under-50s worldwide, research finds","elementId":"b8ceac9a-c41c-473e-93c4-4acb9557946f","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/dec/11/bowel-cancer-rising-under-50s-worldwide-research"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":0,"display":0,"theme":0}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In the trial, researchers enrolled 889 colon cancer patients between 2009 and 2023. Most (90%) had stage three disease. Patients were randomly assigned to take part in a structured exercise programme (445) or to just receive a healthy lifestyle booklet (444).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Those in the exercise group worked with a personal trainer twice a month for coaching sessions and supervised exercise sessions, and later once a month, for a total of three years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The exercise group were coached and supported to help them achieve set exercise goals. Their weekly target was the equivalent of three to four walks of between 45 and 60 minutes, but patients could choose how they got more active. Some went kayaking or skiing, for instance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;After five years, patients in the exercise group had a 28% lower risk of recurrent or new cancers than those in the other group. After eight years, the same patients also had a 37% lower risk of dying than those just handed the healthy lifestyle booklet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“After completing surgery and chemotherapy, about 30% of patients with high-risk stage two and stage three colon cancer will eventually experience recurrence of their disease,” said the study’s lead author, Dr Christopher Booth, of Queen’s University in Kingston, Canada. “As oncologists, one of the most common questions we get asked by patients is ‘what else can I do to improve my outcome?’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“These results now provide us with a clear answer: an exercise programme that includes a personal trainer will reduce the risk of recurrent or new cancer, make you feel better and help you live longer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Prof Charles Swanton, the chief clinician of &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/cancer" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Cancer&lt;/a&gt; Research UK, which funded the UK arm of the study, said: “This fascinating study captures the power of exercise to transform people’s health and boost their chances of surviving cancer after treatment. For an intervention that isn’t a drug, exercise offers remarkable benefits for patients.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="0aa03320-9adf-4260-8bee-308ac224c504" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":18,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"Early morning and evening activity could ‘reduce bowel cancer risk by 11%’","elementId":"0aa03320-9adf-4260-8bee-308ac224c504","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/nov/06/early-morning-and-evening-activity-could-reduce-bowel-cancer-risk"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":0,"display":0,"theme":0}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;For some patients, “physical activity can be a gamechanger that shifts the course of their recovery”, Swanton added. “The findings suggest that oncologists should consider recommending a structured exercise programme after surgery to improve people’s chances of survival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“But it’s important to remember that exercise isn’t the best option for everyone. My advice to cancer patients is to speak to your doctor before taking on any new physical activity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The findings are likely to change global practice, with doctors worldwide urged to discuss exercise regimens with their patients following treatment, oncologists in Chicago said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;While this study followed only colon cancer patients, Gralow said there was no reason to think the findings would not be applicable across other cancers. Booth said trials for other cancers would be needed, but added that data from this study suggested there were lower breast and prostate cancer occurrences in the exercise group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Exercise as an intervention is a no-brainer and should be implemented broadly,” said Dr Pamela Kunz, of Yale School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Responding to the findings, Prof Sir Stephen Powis, the national medical director of NHS England, said it was “really exciting” that tailored exercise after treatment could be “life-changing”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“These landmark findings suggest that focused steps to exercise, from walks to workouts, could help turbocharge the body’s ability to prevent cancer returning after treatment and help save more lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Being more active can have significant benefits in helping maintain a healthy weight, strengthen the immune system, reduce inflammation and lift mood – and it’s now really encouraging to see that exercise really could have the power to help more people survive cancer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jun 2025 14:51:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiwAFBVV95cUxPWVJLTjlVX0VpYWgtanFSWm8xRE9XSmdmS1F6bGdCY0lDamsxRGQ3SWJNaG1TVFZUVVVLbmtJOTlzQUVqUFlWZTNBbWFaMGJoTmRKNHd6TzlmTnJtdjVNYjZ2aV8wcDNkeGdDejJrSXJ3b080ZGx5NlhVZEl2dFBPSjFvUVdGWDBpSFFhakxjMmJNZmY2OTYzUUdJLTZUbHM3bFppVTZPRnBQWXlxc0w2NmpTRGtsXzVlTlFSZkQ0c0Y</guid></item><item><title>坚果、植物油中的ω-6脂肪酸能降低心脏病和糖尿病的风险吗？ -今日医学新闻 | Can omega-6 fatty acids in nuts, vegetable oils lower heart disease and diabetes risk? - Medical News Today</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiuwFBVV95cUxOOGx5R3B0ai1sTjlWWll5cEdxbFR2dWc5aVJfTDRBN0F3TU9IMVhhekhQa0tJNjRPX1lLbEF3LVpEdTFwa2s4ZndRdXRzb1pHTFlNSG9TTFNWTzdjV0pjVXIxaWl3T2JPa3dLSUFUOG1DT0d6VUdpa0xVTU9fMzR0YjlWUXItT05nUFEwUXN0UXFsazZ1NGZZTDk0andGU3JwelVKaDczbjNVRVNHVENwaUVCOV9hczFNVGFF?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-12va8w7"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;figure class="css-yhe8zq"&gt;&lt;span class="css-rwmw5v"&gt;&lt;span class="css-mjp0j9"&gt;&lt;picture class="css-16pk1is"&gt;&lt;source srcset="https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/06/oil-bottle-shadow-1296x728-header-1024x575.jpg 750w" media="(min-width: 1190px)"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source srcset="https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/06/oil-bottle-shadow-1296x728-header-1024x575.jpg 750w" media="(min-width: 990px)"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source srcset="https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/06/oil-bottle-shadow-1296x728-header-1024x575.jpg 879w" media="(min-width: 768px)"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img src="https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/06/oil-bottle-shadow-1296x728-header-1024x575.jpg" alt="The bottom of a vegetable oil bottle casts a shadow on a flat surface" class="css-1jytyml"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;hl-share-overlay class="css-1mqo1cs"&gt;&lt;a class="icon-hl-pinterest css-11oz8gb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" data-event="Any Page|Image Pinterest Click|Icon Clicked" data-element-event="OPEN|CONTENTBLOCK|Any Page|Article Body|BUTTON|Image Widget Pinterest Click|" href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.medicalnewstoday.com%2Farticles%2Fomega-6-fatty-acids-nuts-vegetable-oils-may-lower-heart-disease-diabetes-risk&amp;amp;media=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.post.rvohealth.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F3%2F2025%2F06%2Foil-bottle-shadow-1296x728-header-1024x575.jpg&amp;amp;description=Seed%20oils%3A%20Omega-6%20fatty%20acids%20may%20lower%20diabetes%2C%20heart%20disease%20risk" title="Share on Pinterest" data-pin-custom="true" data-share-url="https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/06/oil-bottle-shadow-1296x728-header-1024x575.jpg"&gt;&lt;span class="css-z1zfa"&gt;Share on Pinterest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-share-overlay&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;figcaption class="css-13b3g0x"&gt;Higher linoleic acid levels may help lower heart disease and diabetes risk, a new study finds.

Study participants had an average age of 50, an average &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/323586" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;body mass index (BMI)&lt;/a&gt; of 29, and more than half identified as female and non-Hispanic White. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists focused on the amount of linoleic acid found in the serum in the blood of all participants. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are seed oils bad?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Linoleic acid is found mainly in &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11374968/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;vegetable oils&lt;/a&gt; that are used in cooking and are ingredients in many food products. Recently, there has been a great deal of controversy surrounding ‘&lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/what-are-seed-oils" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;seed oils&lt;/a&gt;’ such as corn oil and soybean oil.

There are also studies showing that drugs that reduce inflammation lower risks for heart attack and stroke.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are omega-6 fatty acids inflammatory?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings do not support the view that higher linoleic acid intake is associated with more inflammation. In fact, they are more consistent with the opposite view because higher linoleic acid was associated with lower levels of inflammatory biomarkers.”&lt;br&gt;— Kevin C. Maki, PhD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Some caution is needed because this was not an intervention study, so we cannot say that this association is cause and effect,” Maki added. “We can only say that we found the opposite of what would be predicted if linoleic acid was having a pro-inflammatory effect.” &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, researchers found these same participants with more linoleic acid in their serum also experienced more favorable levels of BMI and biomarkers of glucose homeostasis, or even blood sugar levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Higher BMI, along with higher fasting levels of glucose and insulin are risk factors for type 2 diabetes. Previous studies have shown that a higher circulating level of linoleic acid is associated with lower risk for developing type 2 diabetes. Our results are consistent with those, since they show lower levels of risk factors for type 2 diabetes in those with higher levels of linoleic acid in the blood.”&lt;br&gt;— Kevin C. Maki, PhD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While we have to be cautious about interpretation of the results, our findings are consistent with favorable effects of linoleic acid consumption on cardiometabolic risk factors and not with unfavorable effects, as has been claimed by some online influencers,” Maki said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Intervention studies will be needed to further investigate the influence of changing intake of linoleic acid on the risk factors we studied,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;MNT&lt;/em&gt; had the opportunity to speak with &lt;a href="https://www.memorialcare.org/providers/cheng-han-chen" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Cheng-Han Chen, MD&lt;/a&gt;, a board certified interventional cardiologist and medical director of the Structural Heart Program at MemorialCare Saddleback Medical Center in Laguna Hills, CA, about these studies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“This research found that increased blood levels of linoleic acid (an omega-6 fatty acid) were associated with lower blood glucose levels and lower levels of inflammatory markers such as high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and glycoprotein acetyls,” Chen commented. “These findings are in line with our understanding of linoleic acid — found in vegetable oil, nuts, and seeds — as likely being beneficial to cardiometabolic health.” &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Heart disease continues to be one of the major disease burdens in our society. Lifestyle modifications such as diet improvements are essential in helping us improve cardiometabolic health in our patients and are a necessary part of improving health outcomes,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Future research should prospectively study the impact of increased linoleic intake in the diet on the development of cardiovascular disease,” he added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For readers who are now thinking about increasing their linoleic acid intake to possibly improve their cardiometabolic health, &lt;a href="https://eatrightrx.com/about-monique-richard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Monique Richard, MS, RDN, LDN&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian nutritionist and owner of Nutrition-In-Sight, urged them to remember that the biomarkers measured in the studies are influenced by a variety of factors and nutrition science is complex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why nutrition is more than one ‘magic’ ingredient&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Nutrition science is rarely about one nutrient in isolation — context is everything. Nutrition is about patterns, not just parts. Linoleic acid is an essential omega-6 fatty acid, and like all nutrients, its benefit depends on the company it keeps. Foods that naturally contain linoleic acid — like &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/sunflower-seeds" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;sunflower seeds&lt;/a&gt;, walnuts, &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/278340" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;tofu&lt;/a&gt;, eggs, and fish — come packaged with fiber, protein, vitamins, and minerals, not just isolated fats.” &lt;br&gt;— Monique Richard, MS, RDN, LDN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Consider linoleic and other fatty acids to be an accessory or an assistant in helping bring out the food’s flavor, such as in a saute, marinade, sauce, or a vehicle to add spice, herbs, or enhance mouthfeel and moisture,” she continued. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Chronic low-grade inflammation can be exacerbated from poor dietary sources of linoleic acid, so those that have conditions such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and metabolic syndrome do need to be aware of overall patterns, quality of ingredients, and amounts,” Richard added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Omega-3 vs. omega-6 ratio important&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is important to note the necessary and optimal balance of the ratio of omega-6 to &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/325179" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;omega-3 fatty acids&lt;/a&gt; (is) something a registered dietitian nutritionist (RDN) can assist in assessing.”&lt;br&gt;— Monique Richard, MS, RDN, LDN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Medical News Today</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jun 2025 14:34:30 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiuwFBVV95cUxOOGx5R3B0ai1sTjlWWll5cEdxbFR2dWc5aVJfTDRBN0F3TU9IMVhhekhQa0tJNjRPX1lLbEF3LVpEdTFwa2s4ZndRdXRzb1pHTFlNSG9TTFNWTzdjV0pjVXIxaWl3T2JPa3dLSUFUOG1DT0d6VUdpa0xVTU9fMzR0YjlWUXItT05nUFEwUXN0UXFsazZ1NGZZTDk0andGU3JwelVKaDczbjNVRVNHVENwaUVCOV9hczFNVGFF</guid></item><item><title>3小时的睡眠，没有疲劳？科学家揭开天然短睡眠者的秘密-印度时报 | 3 hours of sleep and no fatigue?

From doctors to wellness influencers, the message has echoed across platforms, backed by countless studies linking insufficient sleep to heart disease, diabetes, depression, cognitive decline, and early mortality. But what if this universal advice doesn’t apply to everyone?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enter a rare, fascinating group of people who are redefining what it means to be well-rested. Known as natural short sleepers, these individuals thrive on just three to four hours of sleep per night — and not because they’re skimping on rest. Rather, they are biologically wired to require less of it. These are not productivity-obsessed workaholics running on caffeine and willpower. They are genetically programmed to complete all the vital functions of sleep in a fraction of the time, waking up refreshed, alert, and high-functioning without any of the side effects typical of sleep deprivation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This condition, called Familial Natural Short Sleep (FNSS), is exceedingly rare and largely misunderstood, but recent breakthroughs in neuroscience and genetics are helping demystify it. From groundbreaking studies to the potential for revolutionizing sleep medicine, the science of short sleepers is gaining momentum — and it may just unlock answers to one of biology’s greatest enigmas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How some people function perfectly on 3.5 hours of sleep&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Natural short sleepers are often highly energetic, productive, and resistant to common health issues associated with insufficient sleep. According to neuroscientist Dr. Ying-Hui Fu at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), these individuals don’t experience the cognitive fog, irritability, or health decline that plagues typical short sleepers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Natural short sleep isn’t a result of lifestyle, stress, or overcommitment. It’s genetically driven and often runs in families, hence the term familial in FNSS. In most cases, these individuals sleep between 3.5 to 5 hours a night — every night — and report feeling completely rested and mentally sharp. They don't rely on naps or stimulants to compensate. Their bodies simply don't seem to need more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though estimates vary, only about 1% of the population may possess this trait, making it an incredibly rare but fascinating subject of study in the world of sleep research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Why some people need just 4 hours of sleep: The genetic blueprint&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientific journey into FNSS began with Dr. Fu’s landmark study published in Science in 2009, where her team identified a mutation in the DEC2 gene in members of a family who consistently slept for just 4 to 6 hours a night without adverse effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since then, Dr. Fu and colleagues have discovered five key mutations across four different genes involved in regulating sleep, including DEC2, NPSR1, ADRB1, and most recently, SIK3. Each mutation alters the sleep architecture of the brain, effectively condensing the sleep process without compromising its restorative benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a 2022 study published in Neuron, researchers used genetically engineered mice to test the impact of the SIK3 mutation. The mice exhibited significantly reduced sleep times without observable physical or cognitive impairment. These findings strongly suggest that FNSS is not just a fluke — it’s a biologically viable alternative to conventional sleep patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;While each mutation alone only slightly reduces sleep needs, stacking them together may have cumulative effects, a hypothesis currently under investigation. If confirmed, this could pave the way to replicating FNSS-like effects safely in individuals with sleep disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Can short sleep genes treat insomnia&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The implications of this research extend far beyond curiosity. Sleep disorders like insomnia, narcolepsy, and sleep apnea affect hundreds of millions globally. Understanding the biological mechanisms that allow short sleepers to thrive on less sleep could revolutionize sleep medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Fu’s team believes that, in the future, therapies could be developed to mimic or activate these gene mutations in people suffering from insomnia or irregular sleep cycles. This would allow them to achieve restorative sleep in shorter durations, potentially improving quality of life for those who cannot sustain long sleep hours due to work schedules, health issues, or neurological conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Clifford Saper, a renowned sleep scientist at Harvard Medical School, supports this line of inquiry, emphasizing that we are only scratching the surface of sleep genetics. “If we can understand how to safely ‘accelerate’ the sleep process, we could one day provide relief to millions who struggle with poor sleep,” he notes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The dark side of sleeping less (if you’re not genetically wired)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the allure of being able to function optimally on minimal sleep, it’s crucial to underscore that Short Sleep Syndrome is not something you can train yourself into. Most people who sleep less than six hours a night accumulate sleep debt, which can lead to severe health consequences over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 2022 UK Biobank study involving over 7,800 participants found that individuals in their 50s who slept less than five hours per night were 20% more likely to develop multiple chronic conditions, including:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cardiovascular disease&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Type 2 diabetes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Depression&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Obesity&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dementia&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, sleep deprivation is associated with weakened immune function, poor memory, mood instability, and a higher risk of accidents. So unless you’re genetically tested and confirmed to be a natural short sleeper, cutting back on sleep can be dangerous — not admirable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="59"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="60"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Why sleep matters: The body’s restoration cycle&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="61"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand why most people need 7–8 hours of sleep, it’s important to know what happens during that time. Sleep is not a passive state; it’s a dynamic biological process governed by our circadian rhythm, the body’s internal 24-hour clock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="63"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sleep consists of multiple stages:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="65"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="66"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Light Sleep (N1 and N2) – Helps the body relax and transition.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Deep Sleep (N3) – Critical for physical restoration, tissue repair, and immune function.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;REM Sleep – Vital for learning, memory consolidation, and emotional processing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="67"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;During a typical night, we cycle through these stages four to six times. For natural short sleepers, research suggests that their bodies compress these cycles, achieving full restoration in a shorter window.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="71"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;They may experience a more efficient distribution of deep sleep and REM stages, allowing them to complete the “tasks” of sleep at high speed — like a compressed file that contains all the data in less space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="73"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="74"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Are you a natural short sleeper?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="75"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wondering if you might be part of this rare elite group? According to sleep researchers, natural short sleepers exhibit several consistent traits:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="77"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="78"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sleep just 3–5 hours per night and wake up feeling fully rested&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Never feel the need to nap or “catch up” on weekends&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Show no signs of fatigue, brain fog, or irritability&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Maintain excellent health and cognitive function&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Often display high energy, optimism, and productivity&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="79"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, self-diagnosis is not recommended. If you suspect you might be a natural short sleeper, consult a sleep specialist and undergo polysomnography or genetic testing to confirm. Many people mistakenly believe they’re short sleepers but are, in fact, sleep-deprived.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="83"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="84"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The future of sleep: Genetic engineering or natural evolution?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="85"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;With genetic research accelerating, it’s not far-fetched to imagine a future where gene-editing technologies like CRISPR could give people FNSS-like traits. But such advancements are years — if not decades — away, and ethical considerations abound.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="88"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, scientists are using the study of FNSS to understand how sleep works at the molecular level, which could have applications in fields ranging from neurodegenerative disease treatment to space travel, where managing sleep in constrained environments is vital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="90"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, natural short sleepers challenge one of the most fundamental assumptions of modern medicine — that all humans have the same biological need for rest. And in doing so, they open the door to a future where sleep is not just a necessity, but a personalized experience based on genetics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="92"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jun 2025 14:22:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilgJBVV95cUxPWmlvMnFpbXRnS2o2bmNPMGsxYjBXN1RFaHA1QkZITmxOa3VOQ1NTWXE1YnJ1Snl6Y1RWT00wZktJQndXU2VybGNBRXdKaW5jaElhN05rZUJMWkNCbDlRWExzUl8zZjVMTFUwSjZMMktRQzY5TV8zaFc4TkhqY0ZfU2VGaVJuWlRFQWZRX2w2Wm1jMTFjZzA2eEpGM0VPNGpQZGFxa2ptXy1WOURHTGFwOWo3OXZ5alBHLUFUcnd3YnVuTFl4ZEp0ODhCd1FPbUlkZE02Rm1RTG1vM25MbF9yVTZ4OWp6SGNLWW8ydDFQRzN6ZlBXRGoxb2ZKZDJKSmdKSEVmbVRNdWdUdGx6aWRWQlljQV82dw</guid></item><item><title>卫星首次测量河流波浪--《华盛顿邮报》 | Satellite measures river flow waves for the first time - The Washington Post</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijgFBVV95cUxPSGZBNEU3bU9Ib1JERzA3NmdIdktWdXFJQWktcFF4cVJIdzRPQTlyeFZaWjRMdTZBSUF5bE5VZDBLd3ktcVpCa1JfU3c0dDZ6Z0FSNWpBYXBncHQ4MzNiTHktMkdLcW51ejYtSzA1SEVuZUNuTWt1UGx3cnREd0FfaFl2VUNTOWo0a2g5RHJn?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="meteredContent grid-center"&gt;&lt;div class="teaser-content"&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="5ANLMHNKTZFD7MC3L23IT7AUIU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Long river waves, known as flow waves, have been measured by satellite for the first time, researchers announced May 14, a breakthrough that could expand understanding of river dynamics, floods and the other hazards sometimes present when the waves form.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-subscribe-cta" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="VQ7ZILS7CJGK5LF2L4GDFLWCDU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1029/2024GL113875" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; in Geophysical Research Letters, the researchers found that the long waves can be spotted and studied using data from a NASA-French space agency satellite designed to study Earth’s water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="UEKR5WO72BAJ7KYQTI2VRDOVUI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The study used satellite data from the &lt;a href="https://swot.jpl.nasa.gov/science/overview/?page=0&amp;amp;per_page=40&amp;amp;order=position+asc&amp;amp;search=&amp;amp;hover=false&amp;amp;show_institution=true&amp;amp;show_email=false&amp;amp;category=214" target="_blank"&gt;Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT)&lt;/a&gt; mission.

The hormone doesn’t just raise or lower self-esteem—it actually changes how much social evaluation influences a person’s moment-to-moment feelings of self-worth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research sheds light on how testosterone shapes what psychologists call “state self-esteem”—a person’s temporary sense of self-worth that fluctuates in response to social cues. The results could help explain why men with lower self-esteem sometimes show increased vulnerability to mood disturbances or antisocial behavior. The study also opens the door to potential new treatment strategies that combine hormonal and behavioral approaches to boost mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Self-esteem isn’t static. While people often talk about self-esteem as a fixed trait, psychologists distinguish between trait self-esteem, which reflects someone’s overall self-worth, and state self-esteem, which can rise or fall in response to recent experiences. These fluctuations can have real consequences. People with low or unstable self-esteem are more likely to experience anxiety, depression, and even aggressive behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Men’s self-esteem, in particular, may be more sensitive to changes in social status or perceived rejection. Previous research has suggested that testosterone, a sex hormone known to influence dominance behavior and sensitivity to status, might also affect self-esteem. But the evidence has been mixed. Some studies have shown that testosterone increases self-esteem in certain groups, such as men with low baseline levels, while others have found no clear link.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study was designed to provide more precise evidence by focusing on how testosterone changes the process of self-esteem updating. In other words, do men on testosterone respond differently when they receive approval or disapproval from others?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers recruited 120 healthy young men, aged 18 to 26, and randomly assigned them to receive either a dose of testosterone gel or a placebo. The study used a double-blind, placebo-controlled design, meaning neither the participants nor the researchers knew who received the real hormone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After applying the gel, participants waited three hours to allow testosterone levels to rise. They then completed a task designed to mimic real-world social evaluation. Before the experiment, each participant provided personal information used to create a profile. They were told that 184 strangers would view this profile and either approve or disapprove of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the task, participants predicted whether they would receive approval from each “rater” and then received feedback in the form of a thumbs-up, thumbs-down, or no response. After every few trials, they rated how good they felt about themselves at that moment. This rating served as a measure of state self-esteem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unbeknownst to the participants, the feedback they received was pre-programmed. Raters were grouped into categories with different approval probabilities: very likely (85% approval), somewhat likely (70%), somewhat unlikely (30%), or very unlikely (15%).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers discovered that testosterone changed how participants formed expectations about social feedback. Men who received testosterone were more optimistic when anticipating approval from high-approval raters, but also more pessimistic with raters known to give negative feedback. In other words, testosterone sharpened the contrast between positive and negative social expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More importantly, testosterone also made men more sensitive to the feedback itself. When men in the testosterone group received positive feedback, their self-esteem increased more than it did in the placebo group. But when they received negative feedback, their self-esteem dropped more sharply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To better understand these patterns, the researchers used computational modeling. They applied a model that treats self-esteem updating as a learning process—similar to how people adjust their beliefs based on feedback in other situations, like predicting rewards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The model showed that participants on testosterone gave more weight to two key components: their expectation of social approval and the difference between what they expected and what they actually received, also known as a prediction error. This suggests that testosterone enhances the brain’s attention to social outcomes, making people more responsive to the highs and lows of social evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, while testosterone increased sensitivity to both approval and disapproval, it did not affect the basic learning rate—that is, how quickly people adjusted their beliefs based on prediction errors. Instead, testosterone influenced the importance participants assigned to the feedback and their expectations when forming self-esteem judgments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings help explain why testosterone is often linked with behaviors related to social dominance or status. If testosterone heightens sensitivity to approval and rejection, it could amplify the motivation to seek positive social outcomes—or avoid negative ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results also support the idea that self-esteem functions like a “sociometer,” tracking how accepted or rejected someone feels. Testosterone appears to modulate this system, increasing the emotional impact of social signals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study has clinical implications too. Low self-esteem is linked to a variety of mental health issues, including depression, anxiety, and social withdrawal. In some cases, testosterone therapy has been used to treat mood symptoms in men with low testosterone. This study suggests that combining testosterone with positive social environments or feedback-based therapies might improve self-esteem more effectively than either approach alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the study had some limitations. All participants were young men, so it’s unclear whether the findings would generalize to women or to older adults. Some studies have found that testosterone affects men and women differently, especially in social and emotional contexts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also did not measure participants’ natural testosterone levels before the experiment. Since baseline levels may influence how people respond to additional testosterone, future studies could examine whether individual differences in hormone levels change the effect of treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another limitation is the artificial nature of the task. While the social feedback was designed to mimic real-world interactions, participants knew they were in a study and may have reacted differently than they would in daily life. Nonetheless, the task captured meaningful fluctuations in self-esteem and allowed for precise measurement of the psychological processes involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future research could explore how testosterone affects social learning in more natural settings or in people with mental health conditions linked to low self-esteem. It could also investigate whether similar effects occur with other hormones or in response to different kinds of feedback, such as praise from peers or criticism from authority figures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bpsc.2025.02.008" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Testosterone Administration Increases the Computational Impact of Social Evaluation on the Updating of State Self-Esteem&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Jixin Long, Junsong Lu, Yang Hu, Philippe N.

This has benefits that go beyond letting you feel less wiped out doing everyday activities, says Jo. “A large bank of evidence shows that people who have higher cardiorespiratory endurance or aerobic fitness resist chronic disease and have a lower mortality rate.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="1" class="body-text css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;VO₂ max is the amount of oxygen your body is able to use when you’re exercising— the higher the number, the healthier your heart and lungs are. Most of us can improve this number by exercising more, fueling ourselves with healthful foods, and embracing habits that allow our bodies to recover well. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="2" class="body-text css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;That may sound like a heavy lift, but your whole body could benefit from your efforts. “One of the really cool aspects of aerobic fitness is that things that are good for your heart and blood vessels are really good for your brain too,” says Jo. “So all the things you do to try to improve your stamina also improve your brain health.” Plus, being able to do more feels good physically and emotionally. This month, follow these steps to take your endurance to the next level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="have-fun-and-create-a-plan" data-node-id="4" class="body-h2 css-14d214d emevuu60"&gt;Have fun and create a plan&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="5" class="body-text css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;“I think one mistake people make is doing something they don’t enjoy,” says Jo. “That is probably the quickest way to quit something.” For instance, she says, if you have a goal of increasing your stamina by walking more and yet you hate walking in your neighborhood, it’ll be difficult to muster the motivation to get outside. Before you set your goal, try several activities this week and observe your level of fatigue during each. Then pick one you love and figure out how to add it to your existing routine. For instance, if you’re a morning person and you really enjoy kickboxing, see whether a local gym offers early classes. If you get bored easily and prefer home workouts, check out high-intensity interval classes from a few different instructors on YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="amp-things-up-bit-by-bit" data-node-id="6" class="body-h2 css-14d214d emevuu60"&gt;Amp things up bit by bit &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="7" class="body-text css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;“No matter where you’re starting, whether you feel winded after walking up a flight of stairs or you want to run a faster 5K, gradual progression is what’s going to safely and effectively get you where you want to go,” says Jo. She suggests increasing either the time spent doing an activity or the intensity of the activity by about 10% every week until you reach your goal. Say your baseline is walking for 30 minutes—try to extend every walk to 33 minutes this week, 36 minutes next week, and 40 minutes the week after. Or if you wish to focus on speed and you normally walk a mile in 20 minutes, aim to do it in 18 minutes this week, 16 minutes and 12 seconds next week, and 14 minutes and 35 seconds the following week. Jo says a 10% change is helpful because it’s an improvement but not an overreach—your body can tolerate it. “Your body will change and adapt over the four weeks to allow you to actually get to a whole different fitness level by the time you’re done,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="be-smart-about-rest-days" data-node-id="8" class="body-h2 css-14d214d emevuu60"&gt;Be smart about rest days  &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="9" class="body-text css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;When you pay extra attention to revving up your workouts, recovery time becomes even more important. “The body uses recovery days to heal and come back stronger,” says Jo. “Exercise is a stressor, and the body must adapt and get ready for the next stress you’re going to place on it—if you never take a day of rest, it doesn’t get a chance to do that.” Resting also gives your mind the break it needs to keep you from burning out. Jo recommends taking a recovery day after every day on which you do your chosen activity, but that doesn’t mean sitting on the couch. For a marathoner, rest might be a walk, and for a walker it might be gentle yoga. Being active, even lightly, on off days will keep oxygenated blood flowing to muscles and help joints stay lubricated, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="tweak-your-other-habits" data-node-id="10" class="body-h2 css-14d214d emevuu60"&gt;Tweak your other habits &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="11" class="body-text css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;First up: the food on your plate. “If you think about nutrition as fuel for your activity, being low on nutrition quality or quantity could impact how you feel,” says Jo. “It could affect your energy levels and not only how you feel when you’re doing the activity but also your motivation to get started.” She recommends loading up on vegetables, fruits, lean protein, whole grains, and water. And it probably comes as no surprise that the other big lifestyle habit that can affect your stamina is sleep. Your body needs at least seven hours of high-quality sleep every night to perform at its best.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-exclude="true" id="journey-inline" class="css-ciejky e1ye6jr30"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Prevention</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jun 2025 13:38:39 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiigFBVV95cUxPZ3lOQlVjM0JiaDlQTmJmWjYwYXdOOEpUNjNWR2dQdDNZNFJob2JNM1dBOU5OQUJ5ci0tajlaU3oyMTRnazR3RjNPVHYzX0FkX0Q4N2F0N0ZlUEJQV1pMTVg0YURpSjR2SEF1dzVCaU0yRW10VWU2TWVrc2g1NEFhTThnZVg2N0VELVE</guid></item><item><title>红外隐形眼镜使人类能够在黑暗中看到- DW | Infrared contact lens enables humans to see in dark - DW</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijAFBVV95cUxPbnZWSkNMTjE0OGo2S3FhLVZYU3NRa1psN0R2SUdiMF9yQWVoaXVwalV3YldSOV8wX2huallPaU1YWm1aYW9RN1gtT2dfeGpaR0R5b1BBN1F1OFA1X2tRQWhxZlh6WnM1RlVyLUFhV1BFZUNsNDJBN0hQNEp5Tzc2UVJ0U3d1bDkzWTE1RtIBjAFBVV95cUxQaWU1U25RX2ZmQ3VLdnpxTl90M1FmT0VOdnNQbW0xNXVWV0t0TG9uRGs5SDJUcjBzUHlUZ1FPYnZTV3h3YjVwYUZFdVl2Y3A2SnM3eE1wcVdidEdJc0dfclRta0VGTjRLbkhWREhqREJQWUVPeHF5LTJoSW9JTGlYdWZ2VGR0TXlienU3cA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="cc0m0op s1ebneao rich-text t1it8i9i r1wgtjne wgx1hx2 b1ho1h07"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Light consists of individual particles that propagate in waves. The wavelength determines the color and energy of the light.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The human eye can only perceive a small section of this spectrum, approximately the range between 400 and 700 nanometers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of that, we humans are unable to see the infrared range, with its longer wavelengths of 750 nanometers to one millimeter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So in order to see infrared light, we have needed comparatively bulky night-vision goggles or night-vision devices with their own energy source — until now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Infrared contact lenses from China&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Researchers at the University of Science and Technology in Hefei, eastern &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/china/t-18480887"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;, have now &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/eyeing-sustainability-contact-lenses-vs-glasses/a-68732079"&gt;developed a contact lens&lt;/a&gt; that converts infrared light into visible light, enabling humans to see in the dark.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yuqian Ma and his team have combined conventional soft contact lenses with 45 nanometer particles consisting of gold, sodium gadolinium fluoride, ytterbium and erbium ions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The upconversion contact lenses (UCLs) convert infrared light with wavelengths between 800 and 1,600 nanometers into visible light, the team wrote in the scientific journal &lt;em&gt;Cell&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The nanoparticles enrich the long infrared light waves with energy. In doing so, they convert infrared light into three primary colors, making them visible to the human eye.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="vjs-wrapper embed big"&gt;&lt;h2 aria-label="Embedded video — In Good Shape — Look me in the eyes!" class="headline"&gt;&lt;svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewbox="0 0 20 20"&gt;&lt;g fill-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;path d="M14.114 7.599H13.5l.002 4.706h.601l4.582 3.25-.005-11.11zM11.084 4.444l-9.007.002-1.336.797.002 9.514 1.334.793 9.007.006 1.509-.799-.004-9.516z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/g&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;In Good Shape — Look me in the eyes!&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;video id="video-71539087" controls playsinline="" preload="none" poster="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mNkYAAAAAYAAjCB0C8AAAAASUVORK5CYII=" data-id="71539087" data-posterurl="https://static.dw.com/image/57488401_605.webp" data-duration="26:04"&gt;&lt;source src="https://hlsvod.dw.com/i/dwtv_video/flv/igs/igs20250207_gesamtNEU_,AVC_480x270,AVC_512x288,AVC_640x360,AVC_960x540,AVC_1280x720,AVC_1920x1080,.mp4.csmil/master.m3u8" type="application/x-mpegURL"&gt;&lt;source src="https://tvdownloaddw-a.akamaihd.net/dwtv_video/flv/igs/igs20250207_gesamtNEU_AVC_1920x1080.mp4" type="video/mp4"&gt;&lt;track src="https://www.dw.com/media/subtitles/71561079" srclang="en" label="ENGLISH" default&gt;&lt;p class="vjs-no-js"&gt;To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that &lt;a href="https://videojs.com/html5-video-support/" target="_blank"&gt;supports HTML5 video&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/track&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/video&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One drawback is that the resulting images are very blurred because the nanoparticles in the lenses scatter the light, which the team was able to partially compensate for by adding additional lenses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the infrared contact lenses are still nowhere near as powerful as night vision goggles, which amplify weak infrared signals, making them visible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Even better vision with eyes closed&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The team first injected nanoparticles into the retinas of mice and their behavior showed that they could see in the dark.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The newly developed contact lenses are much more practical because they are non-invasive — meaning no injections into our retinas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In tests, humans were able to recognize patterns, letters and flashing infrared signals in the dark. And the infrared lenses work even better with closed eyes, because the infrared light can easily penetrate the eyelids and image generation is not disturbed by normal visible light.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span data-slot-id="Article_InContent-1" class="rich-text-ad"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Animal infrared capabilities&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several animal species are able to perceive infrared light, which is extremely helpful when hunting in the dark. They do not see infrared light as "light" in the sense of human vision. Instead they perceive the heat radiation emitted by objects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="image-gallery embed" data-id="46086225"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This helps some cold-blooded reptiles such as snakes (rattlesnakes and pit vipers), certain fish (&lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/pet-savages-bet-you-never-knew-piranhas-were-shy-easily-startled-and-conservative/a-19263199"&gt;piranhas&lt;/a&gt; and cichlids), some amphibians (bullfrogs) and some blood-sucking insects (mosquitoes and bugs) with orientation or hunting in the dark.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Warm-blooded animals — such as humans, other mammals and birds — cannot see infrared light because their eyes do not have the appropriate receptors and their body's own heat radiation would also interfere with the perception of infrared light.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-vendor-cmp-id="c44391" data-lang-code="en" data-id="68339716" class="embed dw-widget"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Big question about the benefits&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As fascinating as the Chinese innovation is, it remains to be seen how it could be used in everyday life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the developers, the lenses could be used in surgical procedures, in the field of encryption or &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/cryptocurrency/t-64077796"&gt;cryptography&lt;/a&gt;, or for counterfeit protection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is because infrared light is what makes invisible features or inks visible on documents, for example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lenses could also be used to rescue people in poor visibility conditions because they make heat-emitting objects visible. However, many critics doubt this, as night vision devices are much easier to use, and are also significantly more powerful.&lt;/p&gt;

The Biden administration &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/avian-influenza-bird-flu/hhs-awards-moderna-176-million-develop-mrna-h5-avian-flu-vaccine" rel&gt;awarded&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; the contract last year, through a special government program designed to fund preparation for future public health threats.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Moderna was trying to use its know-how from COVID to invent a vaccine platform it could deploy rapidly against several types of influenza, including the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/avian-influenza-bird-flu/cdc-review-two-more-us-h5n1-viruses-similar-earlier-assessments" rel&gt;H5N1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; bird flu—a version of which, if you haven’t heard, has spread to the United States and is ravaging poultry farms. But it’s not the price of eggs keeping infectious-disease doctors up at night. It’s the possibility that a strain mutates, jumps species, and ends up in humans, who then start transmitting it to each other.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It’s happened before, in mostly isolated outbreaks, with mortality rates that &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/spotlights/h5n1-response-03192025.html#:~:text=Historically%2C%20the%20mortality%20rate%20from,date%20has%20resulted%20in%20death." rel&gt;reached 50 percent&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. That dwarfs the comparable figure for COVID-19, which in most countries was in the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/mortality" rel&gt;low single digits&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; and yet still killed more than &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://data.who.int/dashboards/covid19/deaths" rel&gt;7 million people around the world&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, including &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#trends_totaldeaths_select_00" rel&gt;more than a million in the United States&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;That death toll would have been even higher if not for speedy development of COVID vaccines, including Moderna’s, whose secret sauce is mRNA technology that generally allows for much quicker production.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; That’s why two of the scientists most responsible for the breakthrough won the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/2023/press-release/" rel&gt;Nobel Prize in Medicine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. And it’s why that bird flu contract went to Moderna, whose early tests on the bird flu vaccine have already produced promising &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://firstwordpharma.com/story/5967069" rel&gt;results&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But the contract was through the Department of Health and Human Services, which thanks to Donald Trump is under the leadership of Kennedy, the longtime &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thebulwark.com/p/dont-be-fooled-rfk-jr-kennedy-is-still-talking-down-vaccines-hhs-cuts-measles-cdc" rel&gt;vaccination critic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; whose egregious lies about the COVID shot include grossly &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2025/05/rfk-jr-misleads-about-safety-of-covid-19-vaccine-in-children/" rel&gt;exaggerating&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; the prevalence of side effects and claiming it offers &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2023/08/scicheck-rfk-jr-s-covid-19-deceptions/" rel&gt;no protection&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; against severe disease.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-attrs='{"url":"https://www.thebulwark.com/p/rkf-jr-kennedy-hhs-may-have-just-ruined-our-best-weapon-against-bird-flu-moderna-mrna-covid-boosters-cdc?utm_source=substack&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_content=share&amp;amp;action=share","text":"Share"}' data-component-name="CaptionedButtonToDOM" class="captioned-button-wrap"&gt;&lt;div class="preamble"&gt;&lt;p class="cta-caption"&gt;Zip this newsletter into somebody’s inbox or zap it onto social media:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-attrs='{"url":"https://www.thebulwark.com/p/rkf-jr-kennedy-hhs-may-have-just-ruined-our-best-weapon-against-bird-flu-moderna-mrna-covid-boosters-cdc?utm_source=substack&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_content=share&amp;amp;action=share","text":"Share"}' data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton" class="button-wrapper"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thebulwark.com/p/rkf-jr-kennedy-hhs-may-have-just-ruined-our-best-weapon-against-bird-flu-moderna-mrna-covid-boosters-cdc?utm_source=substack&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_content=share&amp;amp;action=share" rel class="button primary"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Share&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy didn’t trot out any of these lines when canceling the Moderna contract. In fact, he didn’t say anything at all. But an HHS spokesperson told reporters like me that the Moderna decision was “about safety, integrity, and trust” and described mRNA technology as “under-tested”—even though the mRNA COVID shots went through extensive, randomized clinical trials before approval, and have been closely monitored for adverse effects ever since.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;That last part is no small thing. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://dean.sph.brown.edu/dean" rel&gt;Ashish Jha&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, dean of the Brown University School of Public Health, told me in a phone interview he estimates as many as 1 billion people have gotten at least one dose of an mRNA vaccine, with only rare reports of serious side effects.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I would argue that this has been extraordinarily well studied,” Jha said, “and turns out to be one of the safest vaccine platforms we have.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jha, who served as the government’s COVID-19 coordinator during the Biden administration, went on to call the under-testing argument “absurd.” That’s pretty much the consensus among mainstream scientists, as I heard when I put the question to several more of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://medschool.umich.edu/profile/83/adam-lauring" rel&gt;Adam Lauring&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, chief of infectious diseases at the University of Michigan and a leading researcher into the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://lauringlab.wordpress.com/" rel&gt;biology and evolution of viruses&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, said “these vaccines have probably been studied more intensively over the last five years than pretty much any other vaccines.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.adamratnermd.com/" rel&gt;Adam Ratner&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, a nationally recognized pediatric infectious diseases physician in New York City, told me via email that the “mRNA COVID vaccines have been extensively tested and have an excellent safety record.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Ratner, who is the author of the book &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/670274/booster-shots-by-adam-ratner-md-mph/" rel&gt;Booster Shots&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;, said he could not fathom why Kennedy would be cutting off development of a treatment that might offer the surest, quickest way to prevent a potentially catastrophic spread of bird flu—let alone slow progress on a treatment that holds out the promise of fighting a lot more than infectious disease.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This decision,” Ratner said, “represents an unforced error of potentially epic proportions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CANCELLATION OF THE MODERNA CONTRACT was not the only vaccine-related news that Kennedy made last week. He also announced a major shift in the official recommendation about who should get COVID booster shots and when.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike the Moderna announcement, however, that decision may have been as remarkable for the way it was made and publicized as for what it actually dictated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The announcement came on &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/05/27/covid-shots-pregnant-women-children-recommendation-change-hhs-secretary-kennedy/" rel&gt;Tuesday morning&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, when Kennedy said in a 60-second social media video that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) would stop recommending boosters for healthy children and healthy non-elderly adults, including pregnant women.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The decision had been rumored for weeks, and even many of those who would prefer to keep the old recommendation for kids concede the risk-versus-reward calculation is open to debate.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; But the case for pregnant women getting boosters is a lot more clear-cut, as my &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bulwark&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; colleague &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thebulwark.com/p/rfk-jrs-war-on-vaccines-is-here-covid-health-trump-maha" rel&gt;Andrew Egger&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; noted last week.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Studies have &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/coronavirus/in-depth/pregnancy-and-covid-19/art-20482639#:~:text=Pregnant%20people%20with%20severe%20COVID,high%20blood%20pressure%20or%20preeclampsia." rel&gt;linked&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; COVID during pregnancy to pre-term births, preeclampsia, and other complications, as well as long-term damage to the mother’s kidneys, heart, and other systems. Vaccinating pregnant mothers is the surest way to protect newborns and infants, who are highly vulnerable to infection and its most serious effects—and who, for the first few months of life, rely on whatever antibodies they got in utero because they cannot get the shots.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Kennedy’s announcement prompted a blistering &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.acog.org/news/news-releases/2025/05/acog-statement-on-hhs-recommendations-regarding-the-covid-vaccine-during-pregnancy" rel&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, plus lots of questions about exactly who made the decision and why—especially because two top FDA officials had &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsb2506929" rel&gt;indicated&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; in a much-ballyhooed article a week earlier that their agency still thought pregnancy was a valid reason for boosters.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“If you look at the data and the science, it does show that COVID vaccination is important for pregnant women—we should be doing everything that we can to not only prevent COVID, but mitigating the severity of disease for people who still get it,” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://bsky.app/profile/krutikakuppalli.bsky.social" rel&gt;Krutika Kuppalli&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, a U.S.-based infectious-disease physician and researcher who worked on COVID response for the World Health Organization, told me in a phone interview. “I’m not really understanding how this decision came about.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Normally, CDC issues vaccine guidelines by following a clear, methodical process that starts with government scientists at CDC and other agencies collecting and analyzing data, which then goes to an advisory committee of outside scientists who meet and discuss the evidence in public. The CDC director presides over those meetings and makes a recommendation, which in turn requires a (usually perfunctory) signoff from the HHS secretary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;That clearly didn’t happen here, because the advisory committee hasn’t met yet. Even if it had, there would have been no permanent or acting CDC director to preside or follow up with a recommendation. As best as anybody can tell—and, yes, it’s totally bonkers that this is even an open question—the person currently performing the CDC director’s duties is the chief of staff, who among other things is not a scientist. He’s &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/about/leadership/cos.html" rel&gt;a lawyer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; with a background in aviation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;That might explain why, as the&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt; Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/05/28/vaccines-cdc-rfk-jr-covid/" rel&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, CDC staff learned about the decision the same way the public did: by watching that Tuesday video, in which Kennedy was, bizarrely, flanked by directors of two other health agencies but nobody from the CDC.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHAT CAME NEXT was even weirder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Two days went by with no more official communication, except for a “&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25955651-memo-on-covid-vaccines/" rel&gt;directive&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;” with Kennedy’s signature that circulated internally and eventually landed in the inboxes of reporters like me. It was just one page without HHS letterhead or other trappings of official documentation, and it contained what looked to me like a typo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; that seemed to contradict Kennedy’s central message.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;CDC finally updated its online vaccine information on Thursday night, though the new material didn’t line up with what Kennedy had outlined in the video. Under the new guidelines, CDC has completely withdrawn the recommendation of COVID vaccine boosters for &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/imz-schedules/downloads/adult/adult-combined-schedule.pdf" rel&gt;pregnant women&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, but it has given some support for boosters among &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/imz-schedules/child-adolescent-age.html" rel&gt;healthy kids&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, albeit with a caveat suggesting parents consult their doctors through “shared decision-making.” CDC has done so even though the case for giving boosters to healthy kids is weaker than it is for giving boosters to pregnant women.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;And just to make things even more confusing, the HHS media office has responded to media queries (again, including mine&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;) by saying “the old COVID-19 vaccine recommendations for healthy children under 18 and for pregnant women have been removed from the CDC vaccine schedule.” That makes it sound like CDC is treating the two groups the same way, when the online guidance for them is plainly different.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The ambiguous, conflicting messages and shambolic, unprofessional presentations will not surprise you if you have been watching the Trump administration closely these past few months—or if you read last week’s exposé by &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.notus.org/health-science/make-america-healthy-again-report-citation-errors" rel&gt;two NOTUS reporters&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; showing Kennedy’s highly touted “Make America Healthy Again” report contained &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thebulwark.com/p/rfks-health-report-is-a-mess" rel&gt;bogus and sometimes misleading citations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But the saga around the boosters provides something new: the clearest evidence yet that Kennedy was lying when he promised congressional overseers—and the American people—that his goals were to increase transparency and scientific accountability rather than impose his own agenda. “I don’t think people should be taking medical advice from me,” he &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/jUcDvNfYQDU?si=7fb1zbKAumAgpgUp&amp;amp;t=3927" rel&gt;told a House committee&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; in May.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“What you have here is the secretary—not even the CDC director, because there is no CDC director—the secretary jumping in and saying the way he interprets the science is &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;, and so he’s going to make a decision unilaterally to preempt any decision or recommendation that [the advisory committee] would make,” University of Michigan law professor &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://michigan.law.umich.edu/faculty-and-scholarship/our-faculty/samuel-r-bagenstos" rel&gt;Sam Bagenstos&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;—who served as HHS general counsel during the Biden administration—told me. “That’s a completely irregular process.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full effect of the revised COVID booster guidance is impossible to know at this point—in part because its meaning still isn’t totally clear. But there’s a real possibility that it will affect people’s access to the vaccines, making it difficult for people who want or need them to get them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The “shared decision” recommendation for kids would be enough to keep boosters on the list of vaccines insurers must cover, under the Affordable Care Act’s preventative care requirement, experts told me. But it could at the very least complicate the process for people who would get shots at pharmacies, where consultations aren’t always easy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;As for the lack of guidance on pregnant women, that could give insurers more freedom to drop full coverage. On the other hand, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/30/health/cdc-covid-vaccines-children-pregnant-women.html" rel&gt;other CDC webpages&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; continued to recommend the shot for pregnant women as late as Friday night. And some insurers might opt to keep covering the boosters regardless of the recommendation—especially for pregnant women, given the high cost of treating serious COVID complications should they occur.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But CDC recommendations have implications that go beyond legal requirements for insurers. They influence public attitudes. CDC recommendations also serve as guidance for physicians all over the country, many of whom don’t have time—or specific technical background—to spend days weighing research evidence on their own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you’re a primary-care physician and you’re trying to decide what to recommend to your patient, it gets to the point where you can’t necessarily trust the recommendations that are being made by HHS and CDC anymore,” Bagenstos said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-attrs='{"url":"https://www.thebulwark.com/p/rkf-jr-kennedy-hhs-may-have-just-ruined-our-best-weapon-against-bird-flu-moderna-mrna-covid-boosters-cdc?utm_source=substack&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_content=share&amp;amp;action=share","text":"Share","action":null,"class":null}' data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton" class="button-wrapper"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thebulwark.com/p/rkf-jr-kennedy-hhs-may-have-just-ruined-our-best-weapon-against-bird-flu-moderna-mrna-covid-boosters-cdc?utm_source=substack&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_content=share&amp;amp;action=share" rel class="button primary"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Share&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And even for experts following the research more closely, Jha said, “the usual process has a few advantages, because it’s super transparent. Everybody has seen the data. You can disagree with the decisions, but at least you’ve seen the data on which it is based, and the CDC scientists have had a chance to share that data in a public function.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In short, Kennedy is introducing &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://bsky.app/profile/adamkeiper.com/post/3lqgdrvofas2a" rel&gt;more uncertainty&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; into everyday medicine while undercutting CDC’s institutional credibility. And he’s doing so in a way that could render this particular decision vulnerable to a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/06/health/judge-orders-fda-to-make-morning-after-pill-available-over-the-counter-for-all-ages.html" rel&gt;court challenge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, Bagenstos noted, because administrative law prohibits federal agencies like CDC from arbitrary or capricious action. That’s one reason officials deliberate so methodically and so publicly—or did in non-Trumpian times, at any rate.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But litigation takes time. And even if Kennedy’s guidance on COVID boosters eventually falls in court, he’s sent a message about how unreliable federal support for vaccines has become and will be. The companies that manufacture vaccines are sure to notice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;They have other ways to make money, after all, and other places to do it too. That includes China, whose government has been &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.biopharmadive.com/news/us-china-biotech-report-commission/744718/" rel&gt;investing heavily&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/06/health/judge-orders-fda-to-make-morning-after-pill-available-over-the-counter-for-all-ages.html" rel&gt;biotech&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; at precisely the time when—thanks again to Trump and Kennedy—the U.S. government is &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/trump-administration-cut-18-billion-nih-grants-rcna205568" rel&gt;cutting back&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/31/world/asia/us-science-cuts.html" rel&gt;support&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; for medical research. Put it all together, and it’s easy to see how vaccine development and production could slow or move overseas, or maybe both.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With any of those scenarios, Americans could find themselves waiting longer for help in a future pandemic. And if it’s bird flu or a new COVID strain or some other yet-to-be-seen pathogen, waiting longer for a vaccine could mean not surviving the outbreak at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-attrs='{"url":"https://www.thebulwark.com/p/rkf-jr-kennedy-hhs-may-have-just-ruined-our-best-weapon-against-bird-flu-moderna-mrna-covid-boosters-cdc/comments","text":"Leave a comment","action":null,"class":null}' data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton" class="button-wrapper"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thebulwark.com/p/rkf-jr-kennedy-hhs-may-have-just-ruined-our-best-weapon-against-bird-flu-moderna-mrna-covid-boosters-cdc/comments" rel class="button primary"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Leave a comment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-attrs='{"url":"https://www.thebulwark.com/?utm_source=substack&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_content=share&amp;amp;action=share","text":"Share The Bulwark","action":null,"class":null}' data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton" class="button-wrapper"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thebulwark.com/?utm_source=substack&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_content=share&amp;amp;action=share" rel class="button primary"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Share The Bulwark&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Bulwark</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jun 2025 12:48:07 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMizgFBVV95cUxQVzNIVGhXanIwYmxkYnJ1MW1Rak0yWkR4c1BWOTF4N2NLOGlreWV0QjRFaExfUURaN0VFb21qU2s3TGlydFRDdjBPQVhZVkZrUmRXc0xDd2wtazNCWlZ4OTQ2WU1NODd4VjgxNmI4Sl9UdW5lRUVjQXNCTUhQUVlQMnBQY0xoQ04ybVZUbzdJdUVIVHkwb1VQcjJfT3pmbktpbXJVeHg0cEVvUUJ1SmU1NG5CWnZTcjR5R1ZGNGx0ZHc4d1BtNlYwOFBObVJ2Zw</guid></item><item><title>发现生活在健康大脑中的T细胞-神经科学新闻 | T Cells Found Living in Healthy Brains - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibEFVX3lxTE1LZFdLT2ptOFNFYm5RZ3VPQ3gwNWpmMFB3YnpDTEJDTnZhdTllMzdaVW1KZ3dpQ3M5QmxJYjdnTC1hcHR0SWVmMnlFN0E4WnVmNnIyYXNwOGxHdGpqWDl1c3dZMW5Taml6c0NIdA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;Contrary to long-standing beliefs, T cells—key immune cells—have been discovered in the healthy brains of both mice and humans. These cells, previously thought to only enter the brain during disease, were most concentrated in a region that regulates hunger and thirst.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study suggests that T cells travel from the gut to the brain, potentially delivering real-time updates about the body’s status. This groundbreaking discovery reveals a new dimension of the gut-brain axis, where immune cells may serve as messengers shaping behavior and health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unexpected Presence:&lt;/strong&gt; T cells inhabit healthy brains, particularly in the subfornical organ.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gut-Brain Immune Link:&lt;/strong&gt; T cells originate in the gut and are influenced by the gut microbiome.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Behavioral Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; Removing brain T cells alters food-seeking behavior in mice.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Yale&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The brain is a unique place. It is shielded from much of the body by the blood-brain barrier, meaning it’s protected from pathogens and potentially dangerous substances that might be in our blood. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And historically, many scientists believed that separation extended to the immune system as well: The brain has its own specialized immune cells called microglia, but immune cells present in the rest of the body were long thought to steer clear of the brain unless there was a disease or other problem requiring their presence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, a team of scientists from Yale School of Medicine (YSM) has shown that immune cells known as T cells reside in the healthy brains of mice and humans, trafficked there from the gut and fat. This is the first time T cells have been shown to inhabit the brain under normal, non-diseased conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings were published May 28 in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The presence of T cells in the healthy brain and evidence that they travel between the brain and other parts of the body upend the field’s dogma about the role of T cells in the brain, the study authors say. Pathologists have seen T cells in the brain before, but it was assumed they were there responding to current or previous infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We think of T cells as something that fights off infection and causes autoimmune disease, but the surprise of this study is that T cells have a different role in biology that we were unaware of,” says David Hafler, MD, William S. and Lois Stiles Edgerly Professor of Neurology at YSM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“With this paper, we’ve definitively shown that their presence is not just disease-related but part of normal physiology, and that changes everything.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found T cells most densely concentrated in a small region called the subfornical organ, which is nestled deep inside the brain and is known to regulate thirst and hunger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team found the cells in the subfornical organs of laboratory mice and of people who had died and donated their brains to science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This part of the brain also has a slightly leaky blood-brain-barrier, which researchers believe allows cells in this brain region to more readily receive signals from the blood to know when its host animal needs to drink or eat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This makes it all the more interesting that immune cells are also there, presumably to provide some kind of signal about the body’s normal state,” says Tomomi Yoshida, a YSM doctoral student and first author of the study. Yoshida led the work along with Andrew Wang, MD, PhD, associate professor of internal medicine and immunobiology, and Hafler.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Relaying signals from the gut to the brain&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;T cells perform many different functions, and researchers often categorize this broad class of immune cells into finer subclasses based on the kinds of proteins they display on their surfaces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking at the brain’s T cells through this lens, the YSM researchers found that they were different from the T cells present in the membrane that surrounds the brain and were most similar to those that reside in the gut and fat tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In mice, altering the gut microbiome affected the transport of these T cells to the brain. The researchers found that when baby mice weaned and started on solid food, the corresponding shift in their gut microbiomes kicked off T cells’ travel from gut to brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mice reared in a germ-free environment, with no gut microbiomes, didn’t have T cells in their brains. And depleting the animals of the brain T cells changed their food-seeking behavior when the mice were offered food following a short fast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers believe that the immune cells may be signaling the status of the body to the brain through a previously undiscovered form of gut-brain communication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The highway of information between the digestive system and the brain, also called the gut-brain axis, plays many important roles in our health and well-being, but previous studies had not uncovered a direct route for immune cells to enter the brain from the gut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other means of gut-brain communication include the vagus nerve, which directly connects the brain to the intestines, and small molecules secreted into the blood. Relying on the diffusion of molecules in the blood struck Wang as an inefficient method of communication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“From a design principle, it seems kind of a risky way to send information,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“How cool would it be if you actually reprogrammed an immune cell to represent the state of the gut and you then send that cell to the brain, where it can tell the brain what it saw and allow the brain to adapt based on that information?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s exactly what Wang and his colleagues think is happening. The T cells could be telling the brain about the body’s nutrition status, but they could also be conveying other important signals such as the state of the gut microbiome, the researchers hypothesize.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wang believes they might be stopping in fat tissue on their way from the gut to the brain as a sort of quality-control checkpoint, but that remains to be tested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientists next want to look at how the T cells know to move from the gut to the brain as well as what happens to these cells in neurological diseases such as multiple sclerosis or Parkinson’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This study raises more questions than it answers,” says Yoshida. “But they’re all interesting questions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;The research reported in this news article was supported by the National Institutes of Health (awards R01AI162645, R01AR080104, P01AI073748, R01AI22220, UM1HG009390, P01AI039671, P50CA121974, R01CA227473, 1F31NS130957-01A1, DP1DA050986, and R37AR40072) and Yale University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The content is solely the responsibility of the authors and does not necessarily represent the official views of the National Institutes of Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was also supported by the Smith Family Foundation, the Colton Center for Autoimmunity at Yale, the Food and Allergy Science Initiative, the PEW Charitable Trusts, the Mathers Family Foundation, the Ludwig Family Foundation, the Knights of Columbus, Race to Erase MS, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative and the National MS Society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://medicine.yale.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Rachel Tompa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://medicine.yale.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Yale&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Rachel Tompa – Yale&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09050-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;The subfornical organ is a nucleus for gut-derived T cells that regulate behaviour&lt;/a&gt;” by David Hafler et al. &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The subfornical organ is a nucleus for gut-derived T cells that regulate behaviour&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specialized immune cells that reside in tissues orchestrate diverse biological functions by communicating with parenchymal cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The contribution of the innate immune compartment in the meninges and the central nervous system (CNS) is well-characterized; however, whether cells of the adaptive immune system reside in the brain and are involved in maintaining homeostasis is unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here we show that the subfornical organ (SFO) of the brain is a nucleus for parenchymal αβ T cells in the steady-state brain in both mice and humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using unbiased transcriptomics, we show that these extravascular T cells in the brain are distinct from meningeal T cells: they secrete IFNγ robustly and express tissue-residence proteins such as CXCR6, which are required for their retention in the brain and for normal adaptive behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These T cells are primed in the periphery by the microbiome, and traffic from the white adipose and gastrointestinal tissues to the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once established, their numbers can be modulated by alterations to either the gut microbiota or the composition of adipose tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In summary, we find that CD4 T cells reside in the brain at steady state and are anatomically concentrated in the SFO in mice and humans; that they are transcriptionally and functionally distinct from meningeal T cells; and that they secrete IFNγ to maintain CNS homeostasis through homeostatic fat–brain and gut–brain axes.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            Colorectal cancer is the second most common cause of cancer deaths in the United States, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/colon-rectal-cancer/about/key-statistics.html" target="_blank"&gt;American Cancer Society&lt;/a&gt;. This year, the organization estimates that more than 150,000 Americans will be diagnosed with it and nearly 53,000 will die from it.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbd0z2xq00003b6mygdumboq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            New studies presented at the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, or ASCO, in the last few days offer promising findings for both pharmaceutical and lifestyle interventions, including the impact of diet and exercise.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbcj3v1e00053b6mkmbsux8h@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Diagnoses of colorectal cancer have been decreasing overall for decades, the American Cancer Society says, thanks in large part to better screening. But case rates are rising among younger adults, and &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/24/health/colorectal-cancer-young-age-mystery"&gt;research &lt;/a&gt;estimates that colorectal cancer will become the leading cause of cancer death among adults ages 20 to 49 by 2030.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbcj3v1e00073b6mwjgkf0zn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Earlier research has suggested that &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/24/health/colon-cancer-exercise-wellness"&gt;regular exercise&lt;/a&gt; can improve survival rates for colorectal cancer patients, and a new study – published in the New England Journal of Medicine and presented at the ASCO conference on Sunday – confirmed those findings with robust clinical trial data.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbcj3v1e00083b6mj83awgmk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Between 2009 and 2024, researchers followed nearly 900 colon cancer patients who had completed chemotherapy – half of whom received an informational booklet that encouraged them to adopt a healthy lifestyle with good nutrition and exercise the other half of whom were also matched with a physical activity consultant for three years.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbcj3v1e00093b6mkyy9gqe5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            They found that there was a 28% reduction in the risk of recurrence or new cancer for patients on the exercise program, with a five-year disease-free survival rate of 80% for the group with an exercise consultant compared with 74% for the group who just received the booklet.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbcj3v1e000a3b6mf89d2s1l@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In other words, the exercise program was found to prevent 1 out of every 16 patients from developing recurrent or new cancer.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbcj3v1e000b3b6m9m2cz2c5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “That magnitude is comparable to – and in many cases exceeds – the magnitude of benefit offered by a lot of our very good standard cancer drugs,” said Dr. Christopher Booth, a professor of oncology with Queen’s University and co-author of the new study. “Exercise really should be considered an essential component of treatment of colon cancer.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbcj3v1e000c3b6mr1f8bh4m@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Work is still being done to understand why exercise can help reduce the risk of cancer, but experts say that it may have something to do with the ways exercise helps reduce inflammation in the body.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbcj3v1e000d3b6mqesnc4n5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Another new &lt;a href="https://meetings.asco.org/abstracts-presentations/244419" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; presented at the ASCO conference on Sunday found that anti-inflammatory diets also helped improve survival rates for people with stage 3 colon cancer.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbcj3v1e000e3b6mvb9cpfp9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Patients who consumed more anti-inflammatory diets – including coffee, tea and vegetables such as leafy greens – and engaged in higher levels of physical activity had a 63% lower risk of death compared to patients who consumed the most inflammatory diets – including things like red meat, processed meat, refined grains and sugar-sweetened beverages – and engaged in lower levels of physical activity, the study found.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbcj3v1e000f3b6ml3iz34ip@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Actively, as a field, we’re learning about the role of the immune system in cancer development, and inflammation is an immune response,” said Dr. Sara Char, a clinical fellow in Hematology and Oncology at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and lead author of the study, and the rise of colorectal cancer cases in younger people suggests it’s a critical piece of the puzzle.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbcj3v1e000g3b6md2k4f34q@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “When we look at the incidence of colon cancer in younger individuals … that really suggests to us that there is something in the environment – either in the foods we eat, our lifestyles, the chemicals that could be in our foods, all sorts of different things – that are outside of just genetics alone that could be driving these rates,” she said. “So it is incredibly important for us, as a field, to be thinking about how our diet and lifestyle impacts not just our risk of developing this cancer, but then how people fare after it.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbcj3v1e000h3b6mi7bfcoz8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Both Booth and Char said that colorectal cancer patients are often seeking ways to proactively manage their risk.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbcj3v1e000i3b6ma0mugc7a@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I think that’s it’s very empowering for patients,” Booth said. “It’s also achievable for patients. This is a commitment, but it’s something that patients can achieve.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbcj3v1e000j3b6mok7uwtp1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In his study, an “exercise prescription” was developed based on each individual’s starting point. Most people were able to reach their target increase if they went for a brisk walk for about an hour three or four days per week, Booth said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbcj3v1e000k3b6mw5g7xq1c@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Lifestyle interventions like exercise and diet are also “sustainable for health systems,” he said, but it’s key that the system helps support patients in accessing the resources needed for behavioral interventions.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbd1163l00023b6m4hor6zj1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Another new study showed promising results that might represent a new standard-of-care for certain patients with advanced colon cancer.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbcj3v1e000l3b6mq6pzopzx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            On Friday, drugmaker Pfizer presented &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2501912" target="_blank"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt; on a colorectal cancer drug, Braftovi,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;used in combination with a standard chemotherapy and an antibody drug. During the trial, the drug combo was shown to double the length of time patients with an aggressive form of colorectal cancer lived with treatment: an average of 30 months compared with 15 months using currently available treatments.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbcj3v1e000m3b6myxj3ye32@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Braftovi targets a mutation in a specific protein that can lead to abnormal cell growth, and it’s already approved by the US Food and Drug Administration to treat some forms of cancer. The study, which was funded by Pfizer, published Friday in the &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2501912" target="_blank"&gt;New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbcj3v1e000n3b6m0s8hajvw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s a targeted cancer therapy that really depends on knowing what’s driving patients’ cancer,” Pfizer CEO Dr. Albert Bourla told CNN. These targeted therapies are one of the biggest advancements in cancer treatment over the past two decades, he said, and it’s easy to diagnose whether cancer patients have the specific mutation that Braftovi can treat.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbcj3v1e000o3b6map65qocy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The latest data on treatment for colorectal cancer a “very, very important finding,” Bourla said, and the drugmaker plans to seek additional approval to add the new indication to the drug’s label.
    &lt;/p&gt;

measles outbreak has revealed how her son's infection left her fearing he could suffer permanent brain damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alex, from Lubbock, near Gaines County,&lt;span&gt; revealed her baby erupted in the hallmark red and splotchy measles rash and developed a dangerously high fever after he was exposed at daycare to the virus — the most infectious in the world.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At eight months old, he was too young to have received the &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14713031/rfk-jr-moment-congress-hearing-erupts-vaccines-testimony.html"&gt;measles vaccine &lt;/a&gt;— which is normally administered for the first time at 12 months old — but there is a high proportion of unvaccinated people in the area, which is experiencing a record-high case count. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Earlier this month, the US officially reported 1,000 measles cases in 2025 — marking only the second time case counts have crossed this threshold since the disease was &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-6801577/Measles-cases-soar-nearly-eclipsing-2018s-total.html"&gt;declared eradicated in 2000&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And officials are warning if the disease continues to spread unabated, the US could lose its measles elimination status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alex said her son was exposed to measles on April 3, after another parent sent their child to daycare despite having another child at home who was infected with the virus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: 'If you're not going to vaccinate, at the very least, don't send your sick kids to daycare. My baby now has measles.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Alex said she posted her son's illness online to warn others over the dangers of the measles&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She was alerted to the infection by the daycare, and immediately isolated her baby — thinking for the first few days that they were in the clear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Then, on April 10, the little boy developed a mild fever, became sluggish and had congestion and a cough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After she took him to see a doctor on April 13, she was told they could see small, white spots on the inside of his cheeks — a sign of a measles infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The next day an angry, red rash erupted, which spread down from his hairline to his face before eventually overtaking his whole body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The worried mother-of-two posted videos of her son's rash online, where her baby appeared tearful, listless and completely covered in the rash. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alex was extremely concerned her son's infection could turn fatal or leave him with lasting side effects.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said on her &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@hereforworkoutvideos"&gt;TikTok&lt;/a&gt;: 'Apart from brain swelling, I’m mostly concerned about secondary &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/pneumonia/index.html" id="mol-5429fc70-3caa-11f0-a211-0308852b4ca6" class=""&gt;pneumonia&lt;/a&gt;.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Measles can cause brain inflammation, also known as encephalitis. It is a serious side effect of the virus and can cause permanent brain damage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The CDC reports it occurs in about one in 1,000 cases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, pneumonia can lead to septic shock, respiratory failure and even kidney and lung damage.  &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Measles is the most infectious disease in the world, with an infected person able to pass the disease to nine out of 10 people exposed who are unvaccinated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is particularly dangerous to young children, with the CDC saying one in 20 unvaccinated children who are infected develop pneumonia while one in 1,000 suffer from encephalitis — swelling of the brain that can cause permanent damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One to three in every 1,000 unvaccinated children who are infected die from the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Many people commenting on Alex's videos were quick to say the disease did not appear to be a mild illness, with some even saying it motivated them to get their children vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One wrote: 'My mother told me measles wasn't that bad when I told her I won't travel with my baby because of the outbreak. I sent her this and she changed her mind. My heart hurts for your baby.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A second said: 'I'm so sorry your little angel is going through this. My son got his six months shots today, and I elected to get the MMR early because of your video.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Texas is in the grips of America's &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-7075977/US-measles-outbreak-worst-1994-900-infected-26-states-CDC-reveals.html"&gt;biggest measles outbreak in two decades&lt;/a&gt; — mostly among young children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Two young and unvaccinated girls, ages six and eight, have died as a result of the outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Measles is the most infectious disease in the world, with an infected person able to pass the disease to nine out of 10 people exposed who are unvaccinated&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After two days of the rash, Alex posted it was beginning to calm down — saying she felt they were now over the worst of the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her son was not hospitalized for the disease, but was treated at home to help reduce the symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In another video, she detailed what she gave to her son to help with the infection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She gave him Tylenol and Motrin for the fever and budesonide, a prescription drug used to reduce inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He also received antibiotics to head-off any secondary infections, because measles weakens the immune system — raising the risk of other illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The mother only let her baby sleep lying down on her chest throughout the illness, and kept using cool baths and washcloths to try to lower his temperature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She also gave him the probiotic Ther-Biotic Baby for his gut, and cod liver oil - an unproven remedy touted by Robert F Kennedy Jr - to boost his levels of Vitamin A and D. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her baby had mostly recovered by April 17, with his rash having disappeared. Alex showed him crawling and smiling again. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The mother said she posted her son's illness online to warn others over measles, with doctors being quick to comment saying this was the first modern case recorded publicly that they had seen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alex has another child who has been vaccinated against measles, and she said she was not pro- or anti-vaccine, but felt it was important for everyone to work together to stop the disease from spreading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jun 2025 11:26:04 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirAFBVV95cUxNQktJTDB2QWNNZzczOVRmR3JzOTNZd0tHZ1VGd1h3RWx3WXhjSVFLNUhMT0ZtZEZ2NklvWnN1WjN6ODVKWXI0NWxtWVpFSVRFRmJfSXdPY2VwQnh2ZjVvN1R1TER0TUlaZmJPalU1cl9lSlVESjRTRTdBcVlDUC1admpDZFE4ZzlXb3A0RFVwWlBCb2FVS3VDOUcyZVBTREFMMXpadG54VmFTYnF00gGyAUFVX3lxTE80QzdhWW56eWtPT05sLW5GSmpIMGJzaEFRSHk3dVc4TGpKNEFpRFNBTDU3Zk5DbERXdHQxZEd0blFHSElmdFotVjFIcmlFVTRoYWJwZW5ieFhNMklOQVhYYkV0N05sM3d0VUdqQm0yNlVCTnBqaVoyb0l4N0g0dTAwQnladGdoYlFVTUdYMlZ0S2VqdzYweXVYWHdPRVBWS0RNOGp3QWZKRGZ3RHNKLXg5N3c</guid></item><item><title>祖父被诊断为四期肺癌，免疫治疗后无疾病-好消息网 | Grandfather Diagnosed With Stage Four Lung Cancer Becomes Free of Disease After Immunotherapy - Good News Network</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMixAFBVV95cUxQTVRXWktzdllVZ1BrSTExeldhekpPbFlwOWRIcG02bzR4clozTnJYSEFEb093YzVwZExhVnFUanBJemc3OXcwQWRSblo2Mk5NcVEwVjFQQjllU2ZaTi1fMmZoMXl1UnowR3BzVlNaclVBdlJZNWl1UUhzeXZBMUJnQUgtRFZUSW5FbnFTZUdDal9YYnh6bktLWmp4RUswQTZnQlIxNmIzdjFLZjlNY1pfQmE2dmZQV3pwTzk2NEFhMWJlcHdS?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="td-post-content"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A grandad diagnosed with advanced lung cancer which often leaves patients dead within four months has become free of the disease after being treated with a new immunotherapy drug.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeff Cook was told he had stage four cancer in 2019 after seeking treatment for a sore on his chest that wasn’t getting any better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around 50% of people who are diagnosed with stage four cancer die within four months of their diagnosis and only 5% of patients will still be alive five years later, according to Cancer Research UK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 76-year-old was advised to get radiation therapy to target the tumor directly—but was also told he could try a new treatment called pembrolizumab (sold under the brand name Keytruda).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A type of immunotherapy, pembrolizumab is a monoclonal antibody that targets and blocks the PD-1 receptor on the surface of our T cells, which then enables the immune system to find and kill the cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pgs-dpg-flex" data-pgs-partner-id="good-news-network"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The drug was previously deemed too expensive as it would cost around £84,000 per patient ($113k), but an agreement was reached with the manufacturer by the British National Health Service (the publicly funded healthcare system in the UK) to reduce the cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After receiving the treatment for around two years, Jeff was told that he is officially cancer free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Considering I had such an advanced cancer, and the survival statistics were not in my favor, I feel like the pembrolizumab has been a medical miracle,” said the grandfather-of-two. “I’m able to live life to the full as a result.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_218552" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-218552" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-218552" src="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Jeff-Cook-scans-before-and-after-cancer-treatment-1024x547.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Jeff-Cook-scans-before-and-after-cancer-treatment-1024x547.jpg 1024w, https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Jeff-Cook-scans-before-and-after-cancer-treatment-326x174.jpg 326w, https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Jeff-Cook-scans-before-and-after-cancer-treatment-768x410.jpg 768w, https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Jeff-Cook-scans-before-and-after-cancer-treatment-696x372.jpg 696w, https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Jeff-Cook-scans-before-and-after-cancer-treatment-1068x571.jpg 1068w, https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Jeff-Cook-scans-before-and-after-cancer-treatment-786x420.jpg 786w, https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Jeff-Cook-scans-before-and-after-cancer-treatment-530x283.jpg 530w, https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Jeff-Cook-scans-before-and-after-cancer-treatment.jpg 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-218552" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Jeff Cook’s scans – SWNS&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeff, who has two sons, gave up smoking more than 20 years ago, but towards the end of 2018, he realized that he had a sore on the left side of his chest which wasn’t getting better—despite being prescribed antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BEARS CAN RECOVER TOO!&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a title="Bear Shocks Vets By Going into Remission From Terminal Cancer After Taking Meds in Honey–a Rare Treat That Delights Her" href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/bear-shocks-vets-by-going-into-remission-from-terminal-cancer-after-taking-meds-in-honey-a-rare-treat-that-delights-her/" rel="bookmark"&gt;Bear Shocks Vets By Going into Remission From Terminal Cancer After Taking Meds in Honey–a Rare Treat That Delights Her&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was referred to a chest specialist at Leighton Hospital in Cheshire, where he later received the terminal diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. David Woolf then suggested that Jeff could try the pembrolizumab treatment, which was fairly new at the time—and comes with various possible side effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The pembrolizumab was kind to my body, and I had no noticeable side effects from the treatment,” Jeff said in an article from SWNS news agency. “After three or four treatments, I was leading a normal life again.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeff is now taking vacations with his wife of over 50 years and is active in sports again at his local cricket club.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m incredibly grateful to Dr. Woolf and all the NHS staff who have helped me during my treatment—and to the scientists and researchers who helped to develop such a wonderful life-saving drug.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr Woolf says he’s “delighted” that Jeff has had such a positive response to the treatment and is now cancer-free six years after his diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Stage four lung cancer remains very serious with average survival figures of less than a year. However, new treatments such as immunotherapy are a game changer for some of our patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We still need to do better at diagnosing patients earlier though, and continuing to develop new and better treatments.”&lt;/p&gt;

and blood sugar in control, it can be hard to know what is just a healthy diet and what is dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s so hard to spot that even professionals can have trouble spotting it — they kind of question, like, is this person just really healthy, or is [it] bordering on a disorder?” Auguste noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Below, Auguste and Heise share the signs that you may be crossing into orthorexia territory and what to do if you’re concerned about your eating habits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You have extreme food restrictions (that aren’t related to an allergy or suggestion from a doctor).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;″[Orthorexia] can show up some of the same ways that anorexia shows up, where it can be restricting — not eating certain food groups, having a lot of anxiety if you are not having full control over the food that you’re eating and the source that it comes from,” Auguste said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may find yourself creating rigid rules regarding your food intake, Heise added. Like, maybe you tell yourself you can only eat brown rice and can never make exceptions for white rice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It winds up becoming less about healthy eating, which is usually what it starts out as, and more about an unhealthy obsession with food purity or ‘clean eating,’ or ‘proper eating,’” Heise said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It messes with your social life.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When it crosses the line is when it starts to interfere with your activities of daily living,” Auguste said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If your stress about food interferes with your social engagements, like you turn down plans because you aren’t sure of the food situation, it could be cause for concern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When it impacts your ability to live socially in the world, comfortably, then it’s a problem that you should address,” Auguste added.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It winds up being less about the average person concerned about healthy food, and more just really obsessing about it where it’s almost your personality,” Heise said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: skynesher via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;skynesher via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;Orthorexia, or a preoccupation with healthy eating, is becoming more common in society.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You spend lots of time analyzing ingredient lists.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s normal to check the ingredient lists and nutrition labels on food from time to time, especially if you have an allergy or a specific nutrition goal you’re trying to hit. But, for someone with orthorexia, they may find that they’re “compulsively, all the time, analyzing all the ingredients,” Heise said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;This may turn into hours and hours spent meal planning or researching the nutrition of every ingredient that’s going into your food, she noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When you break your food rules, you feel anxious or guilty.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think the line comes when you start to feel like you’re thinking about [healthy eating] all the time,” Heise said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you feel like you &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/life/topic/anxiety" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="have anxiety" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="683887bfe4b06202aa9171cc" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="/life/topic/anxiety" data-vars-target-content-type="feed" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="7"&gt;have anxiety&lt;/a&gt; ... you’re nervous about eating something ... and you feel like that more often than not, then that could be a sign that maybe you’re thinking about it too much,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same goes for if you feel guilty after breaking any of your food rules, Heise added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Auguste added that if your thoughts about food are disrupting your mental health at all, you should consider talking to someone. Auguste also said if it interferes with your physical health, it’s absolutely a red flag.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here’s what to do if this sounds like you.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;With support from either a dietitian or mental health professional, you can determine whether your healthy eating is simply that — or something more. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s really important to talk to somebody like a dietitian who specializes in disordered eating, a therapist who specializes in it, who can help you figure out [if this is a problem for you],” Auguste said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dietitians generally take insurance, noted Auguste, and they can help you make sure you’re on the right track with your eating, whether or not you have specific concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You can definitely recover from orthorexia if you have the right support,” said Heise, “so, as soon as you feel those feelings, address it as early as possible so that it doesn’t turn into something that rules your life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Healthy eating is a lifelong process and isn’t meant to be perfect.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to what you eat, your nutrition needs likely differ from your partner’s, your neighbor’s and your favorite social media influencer’s. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, don’t put too much stock in social media nutrition trends or what diet a friend is raving about, Heise said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of obsessing over the latest food trend, focus on realistic goals — “so, not focusing on whether or not a food is clean, but focusing on whether or not you have variety in your meals,” Heise said. “Are you getting a variety of different foods? Are you getting a variety of different nutrients? Because that’s where true nutrition comes in.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Auguste said it’s important to let go of all-or-nothing thinking when it comes to eating, which includes rules around following one specific diet or a rigid plan to lose weight. “I have so many patients that do that, and then it’s not sustainable to be 100% all of the time,” Auguste added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, when they fall off of the diet, they feel like a failure and give up, she noted. “I feel like that is a downside for somebody with orthorexia, is that you are afraid of letting go of the 100%, and you’re afraid that if you let go, that you fall back into that nothing,” Auguste said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s important to find the middle ground and remind yourself that you don’t have to be perfect, added Auguste. “You can say to yourself, ‘I usually eat healthy.’ You don’t have to say, ‘I always eat healthy,’” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you use “always” language, you “introduce that concept of failure and judging yourself,” Auguste noted. And it’s perfectly OK, and not a failure, to have that salty snack or sweet treat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The more practice you can get of letting yourself find the middle, where you’re not ‘always,’ you’re just ‘usually’ doing something, I think the better,” Auguste said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you work on all of this, have compassion for yourself. Society does not make it easy to be forgiving about food choices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost hidden hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title default-title"&gt;20 Years Of Free Journalism&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-once-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-canceled-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message-container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message support-huffpost__message--control"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth. &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/support" class="cli-support-huffpost__message__link js-entry-link" data-vars-item-name="Support our mission" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="main" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="/support" data-vars-target-content-type="feed" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="10"&gt;Support our mission&lt;/a&gt; to keep us around for the next 20 — we can't do this without you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message variation contributor-once-variation"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We remain committed to providing you with the unflinching, fact-based journalism everyone deserves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you again for your support along the way.

Walking 2,337 or more steps each day lowered the risk of death from cardiovascular disease, which includes both heart disease and stroke. Researchers also discovered that walking 1,000 more steps each day saw a 15% lower risk of all-cause mortality and that increasing walks by 500 steps each day brought a 7% lower risk of death from cardiovascular disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of this is a welcome piece of news as most people struggle to hit that 10,000-step goal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“The problem has been that the recommended 10,000 steps per day and the definition of physical inactivity of less than 5,000 steps per day has been really difficult for most patients to achieve ... it almost leads to a sense of fatalism that many members of the public feel that they can’t reach these recommendations,” said &lt;a href="https://medicine.tulane.edu/departments/medicine-cardiology-clinical-tips-advisory-committee-tips-mentor/faculty/keith-c" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Keith Ferdinand" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68388803e4b06202aa917265" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://medicine.tulane.edu/departments/medicine-cardiology-clinical-tips-advisory-committee-tips-mentor/faculty/keith-c" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="2"&gt;Dr. Keith Ferdinand&lt;/a&gt;, the chair of preventative cardiology at Tulane University School of Medicine in New Orleans.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research “does not mean that the 10,000 steps per day recommendation is wrong, it just gives the public some confidence that moderate activity is better than none,” said Ferdinand, who was not affiliated with the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, the more you walk, the better your well-being. The research found that people who walked more steps had the lowest risk of premature mortality. Specifically, those who walked 20,000 steps or more each day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“If you can’t achieve 10,000 steps per day, don’t despair. Some activity is better than none. But then, on the other hand, if you can safely achieve those 10,000 steps per day, you may even have greater benefit in terms of mortality,” Ferdinand added.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: boonchai wedmakawand via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;boonchai wedmakawand via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;“This does not mean that the 10,000 steps per day recommendation is wrong, it just gives the public some confidence that moderate activity is better than none," said Dr. Keith Ferdinand.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;How To Get Your Steps In&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The American Heart Association suggests 150 minutes of moderate activity, and it’s not just getting those 10,000 steps. It could be things that we often don’t think of as exercise,” Ferdinand said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This includes moderate housekeeping, gardening, walking with your kids and walking your dog, he said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“It doesn’t have to be a purposeful going to a gym or purposeful walking program, but being physically active for that 150 minutes ... appears to be healthy,” Ferdinand explained.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if you do want to go for a walk, he said consider going with a buddy for safety’s sake and be sure to be mindful of the weather — it has been a hot summer throughout much of the country, which can be dangerous for walkers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can try talking a walk inside of a shopping mall or around an unused basketball court at you local community center, he said. &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/indoor-walking-tips-fall-winter_l_6346dd84e4b08e0e607f1505" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="You can also consider " data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68388803e4b06202aa917265" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="6346dd84e4b08e0e607f1505" data-vars-target-content-type="buzz" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="3"&gt;You can also consider &lt;/a&gt;walking up and down the stairs in your house, creating a loop to walk inside your home or visiting a grocery store for a stroll.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ferdinand said that after reading the study, his focus is on motivating people 60 and older to get out for a walk since one of the steepest benefits was seen when study participants got in 6,000 to 10,000 steps per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whatever you decide to do, it’s clear that movement of any sort is valuable. “M&lt;span&gt;ore is better, but some is better than none,” Ferdinand noted.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though a lower-than-expected daily step count resulted in a benefit in terms of cardiovascular health and overall mortality risks, this does not mean you should cut yourself off once you hit that lower number.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We want to make sure the lay public who gets this information from this meta-analysis doesn’t get the unintended consequence of ‘Well, I can just do 2,000 steps or 4,000 steps and call it a day.’ If you can do more safely and in an environment which has some degree of comfort, then that is even better,” Ferdinand said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Looking for the best walking shoes?

It comes in men's sizes 4-17 and in multiple colors, including black, orange, black/purple, gray/mint and white. It has a sock-like fit and a "boosting" feature, a super responsive midsole that makes it easier to take steps. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Promising review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Extraordinarily comfortable shoe. I have flat feet, getting older with hip creaks here and there. My legs and joints feel great when wearing these shoes.

Any no-tie, slip-on or Velcro design that allows easy on and easy off is also great for seniors who have a hard time bending over," she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The adjustable strap closure allows you to get a more customized fit. The design also has a protective toe box that can help prevent pain from toe stubbing. It comes in white and pink and in women's sizes 4-12 with wide and extra-wide options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Promising review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I have problems with width in shoes. This fits better than expected. Comfortable in toe box and I even have a skip in my step thanks to the heel shock absorbing the bounce. Easy to put on with the velcro strap as the sole support to hold the shoe in place. Do not skip owning these shoes!" — &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://r.bttn.io?btn_ref=org-677cb81987ed72f9&amp;amp;btn_url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R14FMKI0NVJFGV?tag=thehuffingtop-20%26ascsubtag%3D68388803e4b06202aa917265%252C-1%252C-1%252Cd%252C0%252C0%252Chp-fil-am%253D0%252C0%253A0%252C0%252C0%252C0" target="_blank" data-a-size="small" role="link" data-amazon-link="true" data-aps-asin="null" data-aps-asc-tag="null" data-aps-asc-subtag="null" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="snoopymaven" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68388803e4b06202aa917265" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://r.bttn.io?btn_ref=org-677cb81987ed72f9&amp;amp;btn_url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R14FMKI0NVJFGV?tag=thehuffingtop-20%26ascsubtag%3D68388803e4b06202aa917265%252C-1%252C-1%252Cd%252C0%252C0%252Chp-fil-am%253D0%252C0%253A0%252C0%252C0%252C0" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="" data-vars-position-in-subunit="34"&gt;snoopymaven&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="listicle-item-container wrapped " data-vars-affiliate="Vionic"&gt;&lt;div class="listicle-item image"&gt;&lt;p class="title-container"&gt;Vionic Walker classic shoe&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="caption-container"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stamped with the American Podiatric Medical Association Seal of Acceptance, this Vionic shoe is another recommendation from Perkins. It's breathable, has a podiatrist-designed footbed, cushioned outsole and a rubber outsole built for steady traction. It comes in several color options and is available in women's sizes 5-12 and men's sizes 7-14. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Promising review: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I received Vionic sneakers for Christmas.

It comes in multiple colors and in women's sizes 5-12 and men's sizes 7-15, both with wide options available. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Promising review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Bought these shoes for my mom.

								&lt;p&gt;For years, we've known that not all bacteria are enemies — some are actually good for us, and belong inside us. That understanding sparked a boom in probiotics science and a multibillion dollar probiotics industry. But viruses? They still get a bad rap, despite quietly occupying our insides —and sometimes even helping us.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not that scientists even agree on &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2022/12/26/are-alive-why-a-seemingly-simple-biology-question-prompts-heated-debate-among-scientists/" target="_blank"&gt;whether viruses are alive or not&lt;/a&gt;. There's so much we don't know, including just what they are doing in our bodies. What we do know, though, is that viruses are not, in fact, all out to get us. Not only are they not uniformly &lt;em&gt;bad&lt;/em&gt; news for our health, but many viruses actually live with us in a symbiotic and evolutionary relationship. Viruses exist in healthy people, and some are even actively beneficial for human health. Not to mention that about 8% of our very own genome consists of &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2018.02039/full" target="_blank"&gt;ancient viral genes&lt;/a&gt;. So basically, viruses are in us, and &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; us. Although we have known a lot about a small number of heavily-studied "bad" viruses for decades, the vast diversity of these weird little guys that co-exist in humans is mostly unmapped, just waiting to be discovered and understood. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s quite clear that humans are exposed to all kinds of viruses throughout our lives. And I think we’re only starting to figure out why they’re there, what they’re doing, and what impact they have on our health,” Ken Cadwell, associate director at the University of Pennsylvania Perrelman School of Medicine’s Center for Molecular Studies in Digestive and Liver Diseases and director of its Gnotobiotic and Naturalized Mouse Core Facility, told Salon in a video interview.  Cadwell studies how the human (and mouse, his usual model organism) immune system has adapted to the various microbes we encounter through our lifetimes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2014, Cadwell and two colleagues made the amazing discovery of a virus – specifically, a norovirus, that pathogen notorious for sweeping nursing homes and daycares, causing terrible upset at both ends – that &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25409145/"&gt;can actually restore the healthy condition of the intestines&lt;/a&gt;, just as “good” bacteria do, for example if you take a probiotic supplement to restore your microbiome after wiping it out with bacteria-killing antibiotics. That bit of good news about a virus you’d normally not want to touch with a sterilized ten-foot pole was an early finding in Cadwell's quest to understand what turns out to be a huge diversity of viruses living in, with, and on us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="right_quote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"&lt;span&gt;I think we’re only starting to figure out why they’re there, what they’re doing, and what impact they have on our health.&lt;/span&gt;"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps it's time for viruses to take their turn in the limelight. The NIH's Human Virome Program aims to fill the great gap in our knowledge about viruses that "call us home". The main focus is on beneficial viruses that are persistent in the human body, not on those that cause disease (noroviruses, like Cadwell studied, wouldn't be part of this, &lt;a href="https://commonfund.nih.gov/humanvirome/general-faq" target="_blank"&gt;the Program FAQ says&lt;/a&gt;, because they are transient). Among 16 institutions that received funding through this program is VAST (Viromes Across Space and Time), a major longitudinal Weill Cornell Medicine/Stanford project &lt;a href="https://news.weill.cornell.edu/news/2025/04/a-vast-new-view-of-viruses" target="_blank"&gt;to learn what a healthy human virome looks like&lt;/a&gt;. This project, among others underway, ought to tell us more than most of us have ever wanted to know about those weird little things. But it's knowledge that could improve our health, even save our lives one day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The undiscovered diversity of viruses&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You, me, and everyone else has, it's thought, about &lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/articles/s41579-021-00536-5" target="_blank"&gt;as many viral particles living in or on each of us&lt;/a&gt; as there are bits on a computer hard disk in 2024 — ten trillion, or roughly a third of the total amount of cells in our bodies.  The total number of viral particles on the planet, though, is insane: a bit less than the mass of the Sun in kilograms, or 10 followed by 31 zeroes, an incomprehensible number that makes &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7148134/#:~:text=I%20review%20the%20history%20of,less%20or%20much%20more%20than" target="_blank"&gt;viruses the most abundant biological stuff on Earth&lt;/a&gt;. Perhaps 320,000 different types of viruses infect mammals. The statistical &lt;a href="https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/mbio.00598-13" target="_blank"&gt;study that came up with that estimate&lt;/a&gt; based its analysis on the dozens of different viruses from 9 virus families all found in a single Indian Flying Fox, &lt;em&gt;Pteropus giganteus. &lt;/em&gt;And indeed, most emerging infectious diseases in humans are zoonotic — meaning they come to us from another animal — and most of them are viruses. So if this estimate is even remotely accurate, we're looking at hundreds of thousands of potential new viruses as we increasingly mingle with animals via large-scale agriculture and the destruction, fragmentation, and human colonization of animal habitats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;hr /&amp;gt;&lt;br&gt;

&amp;lt;hr /&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Viruses understandably evoke a bad connotation because we know all the harm associated with viruses," Cadwell said. We have very good reason to surveil infections — H5N1 bird flu, for example — in our mammal and other animal friends &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2025/04/30/bird-flu-isnt-as-silent-as-we-think--experts-caution-the-is-still-growing/" target="_blank"&gt;in hopes of heading off a disastrous adaptation&lt;/a&gt; enabling human-to-human transmission of a virus that spreads easily and kills or maims many of those it infects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, as we've seen, not all viruses are out to get us. It's possible that some of them are only out to get some of us, some of the time. Others are totally benign, just hanging out inside or on-side us without doing any harm. Still others are on our team, taking down bacterial invaders before &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; can infect us or otherwise do us dirty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170222003057" target="_blank"&gt;8% of our genome that is made up of ancient virus DNA&lt;/a&gt; includes both "goodies" and "baddies" (although they are fully part of our genomes, not just living inside us, &lt;a href="https://commonfund.nih.gov/humanvirome/faq" target="_blank"&gt;they are considered part of the virome&lt;/a&gt; for the purpose of the NIH's Human Virome Program, along with viruses that infect humans and viruses that reside in us but infect bacteria). The 30 distinct families of endogenous retroviruses, as that ancient viral DNA is called, in humans each represents a distinct process of colonization. An ordinary retrovirus became part of our ancestors, while going extinct in the outside world, over thousands to 3 million years of evolution, and most became part of our ancestors' genome sometime before we diverged from chimpanzees. Some are nicknamed &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/barbara-mcclintock-and-the-discovery-of-jumping-34083/" target="_blank"&gt;jumping genes&lt;/a&gt; because they literally jump around, copying and pasting themselves into different parts of our genome just as if they were still viral invaders. Some bad things they might do: some evidence suggests they could be responsible for symptoms of motor neuron disease like &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.aac8201" target="_blank"&gt;ALS in patients with HIV&lt;/a&gt; and others, and perhaps in other neurodegenerative disease (there are various ways this could occur and it's not yet clear exactly what their role might be). Ancient viral genes might also play a role in helping regular viruses get a hold in us, and in the development of some cancers and autoimmune diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then there's the good stuff. Our endogenous retroviruses &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1286457924001692#bib15" target="_blank"&gt;sometimes play important positive roles&lt;/a&gt; for our health: one gene with ancient viral origins, for example, codes for a protein involved in the development of the human placenta, another may protect a developing fetus from its mother's immune response. Others may be important for keeping human stem cells "pluripotent", or able to become any one of many different types of human cell. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1187282/" target="_blank"&gt;And these viral genes may protect us&lt;/a&gt; against other viral infections in some cases, or provide antiviral resistance, immunizing rare individuals against HIV for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the real viruses? Cadwell's 2014 finding about norovirus isn't the only evidence that suggests viruses that infect us aren't always our enemies, either. Anelloviruses, a group of viruses that are found in 90% of healthy humans, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39680506/" target="_blank"&gt;might (it's not clear yet) play a role in suppressing tumor formation&lt;/a&gt;. In other cases, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrmicro2491" target="_blank"&gt;a virus could protect you from a different pathogen&lt;/a&gt;. Take &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17507983/" target="_blank"&gt;plague, for example&lt;/a&gt;, which I think we can all agree we'd rather avoid. Studies in mice suggest that unnoticed infection with run-of-the-mill viruses like cytomegaloviruses or herpes viruses can protect against infection with the bacteria &lt;em&gt;Yersinia pestis&lt;/em&gt;, which causes bubonic plague (and, as a bonus maybe, against Listeria bacteria). &lt;a href="https://magazine.hms.harvard.edu/articles/good-viruses-do" target="_blank"&gt;Different viruses&lt;/a&gt; can cure diabetes in mice; reduce the risk of a really nasty virus, Ebola, proving fatal in humans; or prevent HIV progressing to AIDS. And phage viruses, which are viruses that infect bacteria, rather than humans, can protect us by directly attacking bacterial villains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"People have made observations in either direction [good or bad for us] with various diseases," Cadwell said. "A more causative role [in preventing or fighting disease] is supported by animal models... we lack a bit of information on what's happening in humans. But it makes sense to me that having viruses around, what we can say with a fair amount of accuracy is because viruses require the host cell to make more copies of itself, there's no way it's silent. It's interacting with us, and there's got to be immune consequences to that. And whether that's good or bad I think is going to be highly dependent on the context and the individual." &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Studying potentially symbiotic or mutually beneficial viruses the way we now avidly study bacteria for their possible helpful effects for human health — and for human bank accounts, in the case of those hawking often under-evidenced and under-regulated microbiome supplements — requires a bit of a mindset shift, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"These viruses that infect our cells, they have primarily have been studied from the lens of having bad effects on our health, but there's more and more correlations that are demonstrating that that's not necessarily the outcome," said Cadwell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not that it's an easy sell, nor a quick leap to finding "wellness viruses" on the shelves at Whole Foods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Probably the low-hanging fruit here are the oncolytic viruses," Cadwell suggested. These are viruses that invade and destroy cancer cells — using their awesome power for good rather than evil, you might say. In fact, he explained, some viruses do this really well. So for over a decade, scientists have been working to understand how they do it, and then to engineer viruses for this therapeutic purpose.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;In fact, in 2015 &lt;a href="https://www.cancerresearch.org/immunotherapy-by-treatment-types/oncolytic-virus-therapy" target="_blank"&gt;the FDA approved the first and only cancer-killing virus&lt;/a&gt;, a herpes virus used for treatment of a kind of late-stage skin cancer, where there are few conventional options. The virus was engineered to be less likely to infect healthy cells, and also, sneakily, to cause the cancer cells it infects to produce a protein that strengthens the immune system to help destroy them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And people have been exploring the potential of certain viruses as delivery vehicles for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The kind of holy grail for gene therapy is you've got to put the genetic material you want in the cell you want it to be in. So you need a delivery system...These viruses through evolution have figured out a way to get their genetic material inside a cell... we can swap in and out parts of people's genome, like let's say you're missing a proper copy of hemoglobin, we could put in the correct copy into your cell by putting it into the virus and have your cell infect the virus. That's the promise of gene targeting," Cadwell said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other applications include using viruses to deliver bone marrow cells for transplants, production of particular cell types, and more. Technology in the past didn't allow precision and raised the risk of the virus integrating into parts of the genome you don't want it to go to, but it has progressed to the point where you may soon be able to target a specific cell in a person with whatever you want to repair or add, delivered by the virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past, researchers focused on curing the diseases viruses cause, but in future, they may pay equal attention to how viruses, carefully engineered and deployed, could make us well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new trend for the wellness industry juggernaut&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So is it time to add viruses to one's microbiome-feeding regimen of probiotics and prebiotics, synbiotics (which combine the two), digestive enzymes, postbiotics (compounds produced by bacteria) and perhaps even the odd bit of actual food?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cadwell advises caution. "On the one hand there's a safety-driven concern, that if you're doing something like a fecal microbiome transplant, what else are you bringing over.. that's why it's very dangerous for people to do DIY type things with a blender, right? ...You want to really know what else is there, you don't know if it's good or bad, and just because it's good for somebody else it could be dangerous for you if you're a recipient when you have an underlying condition." &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, in principle we may well be not far from the day when we see certain viruses as valuable sidekicks — even ones we might want to supplement with: "If the thought is that infectious entities like bacteria can tune your immune system or other aspects of your physiology in ways that you want it to to prevent or treat a disease, you could certainly say the same thing about other infectious agents like viruses," Cadwell said. The proof of principle of this has been done in mouse models, by him and others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The question," he said, "is who's willing to try out these things in humans?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it might be tempting to answer: RFK Jr — and to imagine that this is why he's hard at work &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/01/us/rfk-jr-vaccine-safety-placebos-covid.html" target="_blank"&gt;reducing Americans' access to vaccines&lt;/a&gt; against dangerous viruses, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/18/health/kennedy-bird-flu.html" target="_blank"&gt;promoting spread of H5N1 bird flu&lt;/a&gt;, and shutting down&lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/trump-administration-cancels-766-million-moderna-contract-fight-future-rcna209707" target="_blank"&gt; research into antiviral mRNA vaccines that might save us from that same bird flu&lt;/a&gt;, among other viruses — the science does not remotely support the idea that adding opportunities to get infected with viruses is good for our health. On the contrary. With enough research, though, perhaps one day we will actually know how to use these often vicious, sometimes beneficial partners to our advantage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It's relatively new, this concept of the virome, and I think we're at a stage where we're going to start generating a lot of information," Cadwell said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ah, but about that&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like virtually all science and health related work in the United States, this blossoming field is at risk of being nipped in the bud by cuts to federal funding, shifting funding priorities, and outright prohibitions. In particular, virologists point to Donald Trump's May 5th executive order &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/05/improving-the-safety-and-security-of-biological-research/" target="_blank"&gt;banning gain-of-function research&lt;/a&gt; as a potential disaster that is worded in such as way that it could well be applied to an extremely wide range of research activities. Angela Rasmussen, an American virologist who teaches at the University of Saskatchewan and is a research scientist at the &lt;a href="https://www.vido.org" target="_blank"&gt;Vaccine and Infectious Disease Research Organization-International Vaccine Centre&lt;/a&gt;, says that while the Department of Health and Human Services, especially NIH director Jay Bhattacharya, minimizes the impact of the order — as if it will affect only the teensy-teensiest bit of nefarious research — the EO in fact uses a vastly expanded definition of gain-of-function research. Rasmussen says the previous version was also unclear about how it would be interpreted: the new EO is far worse in this respect. The fact is that Dr. Evil and his fellow fictional evil and/or mad scientists are far from the only biologists who make regular use of gain-of-function research, or whose work may be seriously affected by the EO, among other administration acts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"One of the parameters that is forbidden is to put an antibiotic resistance marker into a pathogen. That basically describes all molecular cloning, because we use antibiotic resistance markers to select for the clones that we develop, and we select for them by putting them into E. coli," explained Rasmussen in a phone interview with Salon. In a subtle dig at &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/how-does-us-food-safety-work-what-cuts-has-trump-made-2025-05-07/" target="_blank"&gt;the Trump administration's multiple cuts to the Food and Drug Administration&lt;/a&gt;, including to food safety assurance programs and quality control testing of certain leafy greens, Rasmussen explained that lab strains of E.coli are not like the kind you're going to get from eating contaminated lettuce. They're not that pathogenic. Still, technically they do count as pathogens just because they could cause urinary tract infections or harm people with compromised immune systems, like so many things. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"So the question then becomes, how is this going to be regulated? Does it refer to all pathogens?" Rasmussen asked. "And there's language in the executive order that says it does apply to even pathogens that aren't very pathogenic. And you know, there's many other things in that executive order that are not sufficiently described, and they could be interpreted very broadly, and that would have the effect of shutting down quite a lot of research."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cadwell agrees. "I think the issue is the language is so vague that we don't know ...Gain-of-function, depending on who you ask, could be anything that manipulates the virus," he explained. "Most things we do to a virus makes it weaker or not work as well, or maybe you're trying to engineer it for therapeutics, and I'd hate to see somebody throw cold water on that." Far from improving the fitness of a virus (gaining fitness being a very different thing from gaining function), most gain-of-function work is, Cadwell said, more like trying to make a virus green so it's easier to observe — things like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another example Rasmussen offers is from a different part of the EO where it is stated that "you're not allowed to disrupt a beneficial [immune] response. You could make the argument," Rasmussen said, "that that type of ban would prevent a lot of different kinds of vaccine research, some of which are currently critical to actually doing pre-clinical studies on vaccines and developing new vaccines."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="left_quote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"You need it for testing vaccines. You would need it to understand the basics of how this pathogen causes disease."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rasmussen said that her PhD work, which involved adapting human cold virus to infect mouse cells so that it could be studied in mice, might have been banned under another article of the EO, which prohibits altering the host range of an agent or toxin. "The way that this is written, it basically would prevent development of all rodent models," except perhaps those that exclusively use a wild-type virus or toxin. "Certainly for viruses, it's very, very common to make pathogenesis models that you would need for testing drugs. You need it for testing vaccines. You would need it to understand the basics of how this pathogen causes disease."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rasmussen, for example, has studied Ebola using mouse-adapted Ebola virus, which is a necessary adaptation in order to study the disease in mice in a way that's comparable to humans. The particular virus she used in this case was made 20 years ago, she said — by the US Army. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, she said, "the pharmaceutical industry's attitude has kind of been like, wait and see." But there are at least two different aspects of the industry that this could affect. "One is pharmaceutical development, because they do talk about the need to develop independent oversight that would apply to both federally funded labs initially, but also to any other life sciences labs that would potentially be doing this kind of work, whether they're funded by the federal government or not."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with other aspects of implementation, there's no clarity about how this will work. "The other issue that will affect industry is the risks that they talk about about nucleic acid synthesis screening." This, Rasmussen said, is the government's apparent belief that you can just call up a company that sells vital research equipment, and order a dangerous virus. "Just like, order up some smallpox," she says, as an example (in fact, you cannot and never could call up a nucleic acid synthesis company and order smallpox, and most major companies already screen orders. For example, you cannot order up a batch of the influenza virus that killed millions of people in 1918). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"So they want these sequence providers to screen orders to make sure that people aren't trying to order select agents or trying to order dangerous pathogens that they could potentially do under-the-radar gain of function research with or carry out some other type of nefarious attack with it." Since the necessary screening is already in place, Rasmussen asks what is likely to change. "What would be the compliance mechanism, who's going to [enforce it]... what are the consequences going to be?"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The executive order is written, Rasmussen says, on the (unproven) premise that the Biden administration allowed dangerous gain-of-function research with insufficient oversight and also approved federal life science research funding in countries with limited oversight or expectation of biosafety enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"And this executive order is 'necessary to prevent future lab leak pandemics', which of course, don't happen," Rasmussen said, making air quotes. "So how are they going to prevent future lab leak pandemics by cutting the federal research budget?" she asked rhetorically, going on to say that "this is going to provide both a presidential order as well as supposedly scientific justification for making a lot of those cuts to pathogen research in particular... so really, I think this executive order is meant to further justify and validate changes that are being made to pathogen research and vaccine research." She also worries about selective enforcement of the vague terms of the order to target some researchers or research projects for political or other reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rasmussen noted that many grants are now simply in limbo, with researchers whose funding applications have advanced to the point where a decision should be made, but then never seem to move on to the advisory council that makes that final call. Or they go to the council, but a notice of award never comes, or perhaps it's in process: nobody knows. Multiyear grants for projects already in motion — which includes purchase of equipment and hiring of staff — are in limbo, with their current year of funding not forthcoming, but no clarity about whether funding has been cut or merely delayed and for how long, or whether it's been cut permanently. From what Rasmussen hears from faculty members at Columbia, where she did her PhD, every single Medical Center grant has been cut, with no NIH grants preserved at the university at all. Salon reached out to two leads on the VAST project to ask if it's been affected by cuts or other changes. One did not respond; scheduling difficulties meant that Salon had not received a response to written questions posed to the other scientist, Stanford Medicine geneticist Michael Snyder, by press time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"A lot of these termination orders and work orders are illegal. It's illegal to just cancel a grant for no reason and not provide an appeals process. I mean, it's federal money. There is a peer review process for awarding these grants. And I don't know that anybody knows [what will happen] because this is so unprecedented." The uncertainty, unemployment, and fear of de-funding among her scientist colleagues are taking an immense emotional toll, Rasmussen said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Cadwell remains hopeful that despite the short-term obstacles, the future simply has to be bright for work that will bring the mysteries of this viral microbiome to light for the benefit of humanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I'm not sure what the future of [projects to fund virome research] will be, with the realignment of the NIH...but I think the community of scientists, both within and outside the field, are really excited about [studying the virome], and I'd be surprised if we can't keep up the momentum into the future," he said.&lt;/p&gt;

Having a newborn was like having a colony of new anxieties implanted in her mind. Was she feeding her child right, using the right chemical-free lotions, posing the right questions to her doctor?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Social media and text exchanges about vaccine skepticism combined to sharpen that angst. Ms. Villasana-Espinoza, 29, who lives in the Atlanta area and has a 1-year-old daughter, did not bargain for becoming a mother while, all around her, people were embracing medical skepticism with new ferocity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Ms. Villasana-Espinoza was recently at a church dinner, a weekly event in which families pay $5 and bring their children for boisterous meals with big portions of pasta or taco salad. One mother sat down at the dinner table and brought out her own glass bottle of raw milk. Ms. Villasana-Espinoza, who had grown up in a rural area and had gotten sick several times from drinking raw milk, was taken aback. Her church leans conservative, but its members have fairly conventional views on health. The raw milk seemed to her like a dog whistle for “Make America Healthy Again” — the slogan and ethos that is now also a presidential commission led by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;In the car ride home, Ms. Villasana-Espinoza and her husband discussed the raw milk moment, and whether that family was likely to be vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“The Venn diagram of people who drink raw milk and people who think vaccines are bad for you is basically a circle,” Ms. Villasana-Espinoza recalled saying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Becoming a mother now means confronting a grab bag of voices — on phone screens and on Reddit, but also at school pickup and church — that are critical of the medical establishment, including people skeptical about vaccines and fanatic about drinking raw milk. Doctors say that during the Covid-19 pandemic, large pockets of people, especially parents, lost trust in experts and started doing research into unconventional and discredited ways of caring for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-kbghgg"&gt;&lt;div class="css-121kum4"&gt;&lt;p class="css-171quhb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-asuuk5"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-7axq9l" data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true" class="css-1b5b8u1"&gt;&lt;path fill="currentColor" fill-rule="evenodd" d="M2.5 12a9.5 9.5 0 1 1 19 0 9.5 9.5 0 0 1-19 0Zm8.5 1.75v-7.5h2v7.5h-2Zm0 2v2h2v-2h-2Z" clip-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;div data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript-message" class="css-6yo1no"&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;We are having trouble retrieving the article content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dv1kvn" id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In Canada, kinesiology researchers have released a study that establishes a direct link between ultra-processed foods and poor health. Specifically, these foods trigger a response in our bodies similar to the one triggered by contact with a pathogen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-actirise-slot="top-content" class="device-mobile device-tablet ads"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Inflammatory Response to Ultra-Processed Foods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s no secret that junk food is now a significant public health issue. By the end of 2024, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) released a disturbing report. According to the report, this type of diet carries hidden health costs that total up to $8.1 trillion, which can represent up to 10% of the GDP in some countries. A major reason is the widespread shift from whole grains to processed products, among others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These processed, or rather ultra-processed, products are increasingly concerning, as highlighted by a new study published in the journal Nutrition &amp;amp; Metabolism on May 7, 2025. According to kinesiology researchers from McMaster University in Canada, there’s a strong connection between the consumption of these foods and the production of C-reactive protein (CRP). This protein is produced by the liver in response to an inflammatory or infectious state in the body.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers argue that our bodies perceive these foods as foreign objects and not as food. It’s crucial to note that these aren’t whole foods but rather substances extracted from foods or chemical solutions, causing our bodies to detect them in this manner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Displacing Healthier Food Options&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In their study, the researchers analyzed data from 6,000 individuals in Canada, covering a broad range of ages, health conditions, and socio-economic backgrounds. These participants completed a questionnaire related to a survey conducted by Health Canada, followed by a personal evaluation at mobile clinics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The findings revealed that on average, participants consumed more than three servings of ultra-processed foods per day, with the highest consumers averaging six servings per day. These high consumers were more likely to be men with lower incomes and lower educational levels. According to the researchers, ultra-processed foods tend to replace healthier options like fruits and vegetables in the diets of these individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given that ultra-processed foods currently account for nearly 45% of the daily energy intake of Canadian citizens aged 20 and older, the concern is warranted. Furthermore, while this study focuses on Canada, similar conclusions could apply to the United States and, to a lesser extent, some European and Asian countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
