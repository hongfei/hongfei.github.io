They tried &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The patient has declined to be tested, or to fully participate in our disease investigation, so we will not be able to technically confirm the illness or properly do contact tracing to warn anyone with whom the patient may have had contact,” said Dorothy Adams, the executive director of the health department. “But based on the specific symptoms reported by the healthcare provider and the limited conversation our investigators have had with the patient, this is very likely a case of measles in someone living in Salt Lake County.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The health department now asks residents to speak to public health workers if they try to contact you, and to "provide the information they’re seeking so they can properly investigate the situation and hopefully prevent further illness in our community." They say the information during such conversations is not shared with any other government agencies, but simply used to track down the source of the infection and prevent further spread. If anyone is unsure whether someone contacting them is legitimate, SLCoHD said they can ask them to send an email from their official ".gov" email address, or they can call the department at 385-468-4100 to verify by transferring them to the public health worker in question. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Measles is one of the most contagious viruses known. It is so easily spread that people who are not immune have a 90% chance of getting the disease if they are near an infected person," the health department's announcement read. "Someone with measles can spread it to others even before they know they are ill, and the virus can linger in the air for up to two hours after an infected person has left the area." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SLCoHD officials remind the public that the best defense against measles is vaccination. They gave the following recommendations: &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="rte2-style-ul"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Children should receive two doses of measles vaccine: one dose at 12 to 15 months of age and another at 4 to 6 years. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Adults born before 1957 generally do not need to be vaccinated because they are likely already immune to measles due to widespread infection and illness before the measles vaccine became available in 1963. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Adults who were vaccinated before 1968 should have a second dose because the vaccine used from 1963–1967 was less effective than the current vaccine, which became available in 1968. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Adults who were vaccinated in 1968 or later are considered fully protected whether they have one or two doses, though certain higher risk groups (college students, healthcare workers, international travelers) should have two doses. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles symptoms include: Fever, cough, runny nose, red or watery eyes, tiny white spots inside the mouth, and a rash that usually starts as "flat, red spots at the hairline or on the face" before spreading down the body, the department said. They added that about one out of five unvaccinated measles patients end up hospitalized, and young children, pregnant women and people with weakened immune systems are more susceptible to serious problems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There have been &lt;a class="Link" href="https://epi.utah.gov/measles-response/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;b&gt;59 confirmed cases of measles in Utah this year,&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; with the vast majority coming from Washington County. In the five previous years, only one case in 2023 was detected. &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Tracking your steps each day can be a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/study-reveals-the-optimal-number-of-daily-steps-to-offset-sitting-down"&gt;useful barometer of physical activity&lt;/a&gt;, but health recommendations based solely on step counts might miss some important nuance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study of more than 33,000 adults in the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Biobank"&gt;UK Biobank&lt;/a&gt; suggests that how you space out your daily steps may affect your future health outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the analysis, people who took most of their daily steps during longer strolls had a lower risk of dying from any cause than those who took most of their steps in shorter strolls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/study-reveals-the-optimal-number-of-daily-steps-to-offset-sitting-down"&gt;Study Reveals The Optimal Number of Daily Steps to Offset Sitting Down&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants who walked for longer bouts also had a lower risk of a future cardiovascular event, like a heart attack or stroke, and that was true even after adjusting for the total number of steps taken.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is a perception that health professionals have recommended walking 10,000 steps a day is the goal, but this isn't necessary," &lt;a href="https://www.scimex.org/newsfeed/the-way-you-walk-1015-minute-bouts-of-walking-better-for-your-cardiovascular-health-than-shorter-strolls"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; co-lead author Matthew Ahmadi, a public health researcher at the University of Sydney.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Simply adding one or two longer walks per day, each lasting at least 10-15 minutes at a comfortable but steady pace, may have significant benefits – especially for people who don't walk much."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sweeping analysis included adults aged 40 to 79 years who did not have cardiovascular disease or  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="179346" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; and who typically walked fewer than 8,000 steps a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a week, participants wore a fitness tracker to measure their steps. Looking back at those results, researchers found that those who took most of their daily steps in 10 to 15 minute chunks had a roughly 4 percent chance of experiencing a cardiovascular-related event, such as a heart attack or stroke, within the following decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_179372" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-179372" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/StepHeartHealth-642x409.png" alt="Heart Health Daily Steps" class="size-medium wp-image-179372" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/StepHeartHealth-642x409.png 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/StepHeartHealth-1059x675.png 1059w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/StepHeartHealth-768x490.png 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/StepHeartHealth-1536x979.png 1536w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/StepHeartHealth-600x382.png 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/StepHeartHealth.png 1594w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-179372" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The association between cardiovascular risk and daily step patterns. (del Pozo Cruz et al., &lt;em&gt;Ann. Intern. Med.&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, those who took most of their steps in spurts shorter than 5 minutes had about a 9 percent higher risk of suffering a future cardiovascular incident.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's more, for those who took longer walks, the risk of dying was less than 1 percent, compared with roughly 4 percent for those who walked for shorter bouts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The associated benefits were particularly notable among the most physically inactive participants, who walked fewer than 5,000 steps a day. Among this group, longer bouts of walking were associated with up to 85 percent lower mortality compared with shorter walks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As compelling as the figures seem, the findings are only observational and are derived from just three days to a week of physical activity data, so they should be interpreted with caution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, the sample size is large, and the idea that &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-single-one-hour-daily-walk-could-add-six-hours-to-your-lifespan"&gt;time spent exercising&lt;/a&gt; can impact health outcomes is supported by other recent studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It should also be noted that &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/short-brisk-walks-could-help-you-live-longer-than-long-slow-strolls"&gt;some of these studies&lt;/a&gt; have found the opposite association: that shorter, faster bouts of walking or better than longer, slower strolls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pace of walking was not fully assessed in the recent UK Biobank analysis, but it suggests that the total number of daily steps is not the only factor to consider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/spark-into-space-comp"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg" alt="Win a $10,000 Space Coast Adventure Holiday" class="alignnone wp-image-177074 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro.jpg 844w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cardiologists Fabian Sanchis-Gomar from Stanford University, Carl Lavie from John Ochsner Heart and Vascular Institute in New Orleans, and Maciej Banach, from Medical University of Lodz in Poland &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.7326/ANNALS-25-03529"&gt;speculate&lt;/a&gt; that longer bouts of continuous walking may promote cardiometabolic benefits, boost blood flow, or improve insulin sensitivity, effects that are "less likely to arise from brief, intermittent activity."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The editorial's writers, who weren't associated with the study, argue the investigation's authors make a "compelling case" for testing sustained walking in future randomized  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/clinical-trials" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73032" data-postid="179346" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;clinical trials&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Applied statistician Kevin McConway, who was also not involved in the study, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencemediacentre.org/expert-reaction-to-study-looking-at-steps-in-one-long-walk-vs-in-multiple-short-walks-and-cardiovascular-health/"&gt;agrees&lt;/a&gt; the paper is "intriguing" but argues we need far more research to test these results before they inform future recommendations for heart health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's too early to tell how, if at all, these new findings should feed into public health recommendations on physical activity and step counting," McConway &lt;a href="https://www.sciencemediacentre.org/expert-reaction-to-study-looking-at-steps-in-one-long-walk-vs-in-multiple-short-walks-and-cardiovascular-health/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;University of Sydney sports scientist and study author Emmanuel Stamatakis &lt;a href="https://www.scimex.org/newsfeed/the-way-you-walk-1015-minute-bouts-of-walking-better-for-your-cardiovascular-health-than-shorter-strolls"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; that until now, the emphasis has largely been on the number of daily steps or the amount of walking people do, neglecting 'how' people walk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This study shows that even people who are very physically inactive can maximize their heart health benefit by tweaking their walking patterns to walk for longer at a time, ideally for at least 10 to 15 minutes, when possible."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was published in the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.7326/ANNALS-25-01547"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Annals of Internal Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

                The adolescent brain is still developing, and the use of cannabis regularly may disrupt healthy neural development.

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Teens who start using cannabis before age 15 are more likely to use the drug often later in their lives. They are also more likely to develop mental and physical health problems in young adulthood compared to their peers who did not use the drug in adolescence.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Those are the findings of a new study in &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2840615" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;JAMA Network Open&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"This further builds the case that &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/02/03/nx-s1-5246302/vape-marijuana-weed-pesticides-chemicals" target="_blank"&gt;cannabis use in adolescence adversely&lt;/a&gt; affects the [health] trajectories of those who use it," says psychiatrist &lt;a href="https://www.columbiapsychiatry.org/profile/ryan-s-sultan-md" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Ryan Sultan&lt;/a&gt; at Columbia University, who wasn't involved in the new research.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The new study used data from the&lt;a href="https://statistique.quebec.ca/en/enquetes/realisees/quebec-longitudinal-study-of-child-development-2nd-edition-qlscd" target="_blank"&gt; Québec Longitudinal Study of Child Development.&lt;/a&gt; Researchers in Montreal, Canada, have been following more than 1,500 kids since birth into young adulthood to understand the factors that influence their development and their health. Among the various aspects of the kids' lives and habits scientists have recorded is cannabis use between ages 12 and 17.&lt;/p&gt;   
   
   

   &lt;p&gt;The researchers found that a majority of teens — 60% — didn't use cannabis in adolescence. Among the remaining 40%, half started using cannabis in their late teens and by the time they turned 17, they used the drug infrequently — less than once a month. The remaining 20% started using marijuana before they turned 15, and by age 17, they were using it at least once a month.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt; This last group was more likely to seek health care in young adulthood for both mental and physical health conditions compared to those who didn't use the drug as young teens.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The risk is concentrated among those who start early and use frequently," says psychologist and the study's main author &lt;a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/epi-biostat-occh/massimiliano-orri" target="_blank"&gt;Massimiliano Orri&lt;/a&gt; at McGill University.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Early, frequent cannabis users had a 51% higher chance of seeking care for mental health problems in young adulthood compared to those who didn't use the drug. And that risk was calculated after controlling for a range of confounding factors that are known to influence health, like bullying or lack of parental involvement.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Similarly, early and frequent users of cannabis had an 86% higher chance of needing care for physical health needs.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"We have some indication that respiratory problems were most frequently reported and also accidents and unintentional injuries," says Orri.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;These physical health problems may have to do with intoxication from cannabis, but could also be due to withdrawal symptoms, write Orri and his colleagues in the paper.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"That certainly makes sense," says psychologist &lt;a href="https://www.uwmbrainlab.com/Members" target="_blank"&gt;Krista Lisdahl&lt;/a&gt; at the University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, who also studies teenage brain development and health, but wasn't involved in the new research. "It's alarming and something that we really need to be tracking more closely here in the United States as well."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;A major strength of the study is that Orri and his colleagues controlled for so many confounding factors, adds Lisdahl.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"There are a lot of factors that are co-linked with physical health as well as mental health," says Lisdahl. And the new study controlled for many of them, including "family, parental conflict and parenting style, as well as parental monitoring of the teens." They also looked at factors at the individual level like social skills, peer relationships and whether a kid was victimized by peers.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Prior studies have also found a link between teen cannabis use and a higher risk of developing mental health symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.columbiapsychiatry.org/news/recreational-cannabis-use-teens-linked-risk-depression-suicidality" target="_blank"&gt;Sultan's recent research&lt;/a&gt; found a two to four times higher likelihood of developing psychiatric disorders for teens who used cannabis recreationally compared to adolescents who don't use the drug at all. Other studies have suggested a link between early cannabis use and psychosis in youth. He and his colleagues also found a higher risk of other impacts like poorer grades and truancy.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"The adolescent brain is continuing to develop in a very dynamic fashion during the adolescent period and all the way into young adulthood," says Lisdahl. "Using something like cannabis regularly during this period might disrupt that&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2023/05/23/1175859398/want-to-understand-your-adolescent-get-to-know-their-brain" target="_blank"&gt; healthy neural development,&lt;/a&gt; especially in areas of the brain that are related to executive functioning, which is like problem-solving, planning, maybe controlling other kinds of behaviors and impulses, but also emotion regulation," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Take for example, a teen who's prone to anxiety who turns to cannabis to feel less anxious, says Sultan. "If you start to do that on a regular basis, this is now your method for managing your anxiety," he says. "This becomes your coping skill and you become atrophied in any ability to manage it in another way."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The same thing can happen for someone who uses cannabis to manage their mood, he adds.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;So, for someone who's already predisposed to some mental health symptoms, starting cannabis use in adolescence can make it more likely those symptoms will worsen over time into mental health disorders.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;For all these reasons, Sultan — a child and adolescent psychiatrist — says he often talks to teens and parents about delaying using cannabis until they are 25, to minimize the risks of health and behavioral issues later on in life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;One tip is to keep a diary of what your spine tolerates. As a rule, pain &lt;em&gt;during&lt;/em&gt; exercise is a warning sign, pain after (delayed onset soreness) is fine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Saunas and massages to de-stress&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stress influences pain perception, and disrupts cell repair and circadian rhythms, damaging sleep. Alcohol only amplifies the problem. The best strategy is to minimise stress, but sometimes stress is unavoidable so it’s good to have some back-up strategies to cope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few times a week, I’ll use a &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/wellbeing/mental-health/cold-water-therapy-what-is-it-types-and-where-to-start/"&gt;sauna and cold plunge&lt;/a&gt; after work. They’re a wonderful way to reset. I also book a monthly massage. Manual therapies can provide short-term relief for back pain and stiffness and, combined with exercise, can help conditions like lumbar spinal stenosis. If I get a spasm or minor injury, I’ll use a muscle roller.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At home, I relax over dinner with my wife and our three children. If they fancy burgers, we’ll make a homemade version using lean mince. I avoid caffeine after midday so I can get good-quality rest, and only have the occasional glass of wine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;A cold shower before bed&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I try to be in bed by 9.30pm – it’s early but I try to get eight to nine hours of good-quality rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/wellbeing/sleep/sleeping-badly-could-be-lethal-heres-how-to-fix-it/"&gt;Sleep is when the body heals and repairs&lt;/a&gt;. It also affects the thalamus (the brain’s sensory “messaging station”), helping regulate chronic pain;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;it&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;speeds recovery and lowers your risk of neurodegenerative conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I keep the bedroom cool, dark and distraction-free, using an eye mask and ear plugs if needed. Twenty minutes before bed, I take a cool shower to lower my body temperature which helps me fall asleep, and I keep a notepad by the bed in case my mind is busy. It’s a great way to de-stress and process your thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Get good-quality sleep&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back pain at night is miserable, but be&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;cautious with sleep medication and some medications for neuropathic back pain (pain from a compressed nerve, such as sciatica). They knock you out but don’t drop you into the deep, restorative sleep your body needs. For pain, stick to non-steroidal anti-inflammatories, such as ibuprofen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/recommended/sleep/best-mattress-back-pain/"&gt;Invest in a good mattress&lt;/a&gt; and experiment with sleep positions and supports – there’s no one-size-fits-all. I like a very hard mattress with no pillow (they give me neck pain), so my wife and I use a split-density mattress, which works well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As told to Mary Comber&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;David Vaux, an osteopath, healthy ageing expert, and author of &lt;em&gt;Stronger: 10 exercises for a longer, healthier life, &lt;/em&gt;demonstrates Dr Baxter’s morning mobility exercises for a healthy back. The movements should be performed slowly and with control, avoiding any movements that cause discomfort or pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;Cat-cow&lt;/h2&gt;

And because it's so tasty, it's easy to unintentionally eat excessive amounts of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;“Ultra-processed foods are linked to numerous adverse health outcomes, including heart disease, type 2 diabetes, obesity, and even certain cancers,” says Zenker. Again—if you still choose to go with microwaved popcorn, you should be checking out those nutrition labels to make sure you aren't accidentally consuming way more of an ingredient than you want to be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="paywall"&gt;Why Air-Popped Popcorn Is Good&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;If microwaved popcorn is full of potential unknowns that you can't really control or customize to your liking, air-popped popcorn is the opposite. The only ingredient is corn—until you decide to add something else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Zenker says that popcorn is a nutrient-dense source of fiber, vitamins, and minerals. And it's lower in calories than other crunchy snacks, such as chips, while higher in fiber and protein than many of the processed foods we typically reach for—so popcorn keeps you fuller for longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;When you air-pop popcorn, you can customize it exactly how you'd like to. Add salt, seasonings, spices, olive oil, nutritional yeast, cinnamon and sugar, fresh herbs like dill, or even—as Zenker suggested and I will no doubt be soon incorporating—pickle juice. I prefer to top my popcorn with melted butter and a dash of seasoned salt, but the beauty of air-popped means that my family members can make theirs taste completely different using the same batch fresh from the popper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;You can still make it taste like the stuff from the movie theater if you're OK with using copious amounts of butter and salt. Air poppers expand the kernels using just hot air and time. They're very simple and fast to use—dump in your kernels, turn the machine on, and add butter to the top reservoir if you want the hot air to melt that too. Place a bowl down to collect your popped corn and you'll have a snack ready for movie night in no time. Best of all, it won't contain anything that you don't want it to. And if you consume microwave popcorn on a regular basis, an air popper will eventually pay for itself. Plain popcorn kernels are cheap, and they go a long way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="paywall"&gt;Air Poppers We've Tested and Liked&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div data-testid="feature-large-callout"

The county in Southern Utah has seen 43 confirmed measles cases this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;There is a reason, though, why the early dose is not suggested for every infant regardless of location, Utah health officials said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;The department said more research is needed for conclusive results, but some studies show the early dose can lessen the effect of the vaccine on the infant later in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;Charla Haley, a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services, said the chance of less protection years down the road is worth it for babies in communities seeing high measles transmission rates now, given the substantial risks they face if they are infected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;“Most medical interventions come with some degree of risk-benefit assessment,” she said. “In this scenario, the benefits of early protection against a measles infection outweighs the potential risk of suboptimal immune response to the MMR vaccine later on.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/measles-spreading-utah-arizona-outbreak-vaccines-rcna238757" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/measles-spreading-utah-arizona-outbreak-vaccines-rcna238757"&gt;NBC News reported&lt;/a&gt; that Hildale, in Washington County, and neighboring Colorado City, Arizona, are linked to the second-largest measles outbreak this year, and infections are spreading to nearby communities, like St. George and Hurricane.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;In areas of the state with less transmission, Haley added, the protection from an early dose does not outweigh the potential for decreased protection later on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;The department also recommends the early dose for infants who will travel by plane, and the Centers for Disease and Control and Prevention suggest an &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/travel/index.html" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/travel/index.html"&gt;extra dose be administered to babies&lt;/a&gt; between 6 and 11 months old before international travel. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;Under state health department guidelines, a recommendation for the early MMR dose will generally only be made if a county has three measles infections in children under 4 years old, or — as happened in Washington County — 10 infections countywide where at least one child is under 4. To trigger the recommendation, those infections must happen within 42 days, and be independent of each other without any known exposures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;In normal circumstances, the health department suggests children receive their first dose of the MMR vaccine at 12-15 months, and their second dose when they are 4-6 years old, before they begin school. If children receive an extra, early dose when they are younger than 1 year, the department still recommends they receive the two later doses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;As of Monday, Utah health officials reported Utah has seen 58 confirmed measles cases this year. Nationwide, the CDC reports, there were 1,618 confirmed cases as of Oct. 21. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Salt Lake Tribune</author><pubDate>Wed, 29 Oct 2025 12:00:59 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifEFVX3lxTE9Pdm5UamduSkE2OGo4N0s2MDdUQkhOZ1AxMVlGTF9MTkVJbkhhelJMLVpwdGFZbXVyc3B3YTlvUDh1cC1GWWlob0ZDdGZOV3RtVXVKdTdldVVvRzgtVTRDSVRHaVFnUGF6eVMtaXNWbmlSUXd4bUdUaGNveDc</guid></item><item><title>一场车祸将她送往医院—和$ 64,000债务-华盛顿邮报</title><link>https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/10/29/night-in-the-hospital-cost/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text subtype-from-the-source" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="MIZLMHC6SZF5PPAV4E2JQWSTZE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Physician Lauren Hughes was heading to see patients at a clinic about 20 miles from her Denver home in February when another driver T-boned her Subaru, totaling it.

The morning meeting is in full swing but thanks to a late night out your brain switches off at the precise moment a question comes your way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Such momentary lapses in attention are a common problem for the sleep deprived, but what happens in the brain in these spells of mental shutdown has proved hard to pin down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Now scientists have shed light on the process and found there is more to zoning out than meets the eye. The brief loss of focus coincides with a wave of fluid flowing out of the brain, which returns once attention recovers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“The moment somebody’s attention fails is the moment this wave of fluid starts to pulse,” said Dr Laura Lewis, a senior author on the study at MIT in Boston. “It’s not just that your neurons aren’t paying attention to the world, there’s this big change in fluid in the brain at the same time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Lewis and her colleague Dr Zinong Yang investigated the sleep-deprived brain to understand the kinds of attention failures that lead drowsy drivers to crash and tired animals to become a predator’s lunch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In the study, 26 volunteers took turns to wear an EEG cap while lying in an fMRI scanner. This enabled the scientists to monitor the brain’s electrical activity and physiological changes during tests in which people had to respond as quickly as possible to hearing a tone or seeing crosshairs on a screen turn into a square.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Each volunteer was scanned after a restful night’s sleep at home and after a night of total sleep deprivation supervised by scientists at the laboratory. Unsurprisingly, people performed far worse when sleep deprived, responding more slowly or not at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The lapses in attention came with striking changes. Scans revealed a wave of cerebrospinal fluid being expelled from the brain moments after attention dropped and returning a second or so after the lapse ended. Such waves are normally seen in deep sleep and are thought to help the brain flush out metabolic waste that builds up during the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Other measurements showed that the pupils of people’s eyes constricted about 12 seconds before the fluid left the brain and returned to normal after the lapse. Breathing and heart rate also fell, the researchers report in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41593-025-02098-8" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Nature Neuroscience&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;While more questions remain, the lapses seem to happen when the brain tries to juggle normal cognitive functioning with essential maintenance that is normally carried out during sleep. “It’s your brain trying to take a break,” Yang said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Prof Bill Wisden, the director of the UK &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/dementia" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Dementia&lt;/a&gt; Research Institute at Imperial College London, said the work highlighted the profound changes sleep deprivation could have on the brain. “It is not clear if these changes in brain fluid flow with sleep deprivation are good and protective in some way or bad and pathological,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Dr Ria Kodosaki, a neuroscientist at UCL, said the changes seemed to be “structured, biological events that look a lot like the onset of sleep, and the lapses in attention are not passive but organised to essentially give the brain a small rest”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;She said: “Paradoxical as it may be, these dangerous lapses may be the brain’s way of protecting itself. Think of them as forced pit stops: the brain temporarily drops its external focus to perform essential housekeeping.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Wed, 29 Oct 2025 11:08:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipAFBVV95cUxPWFZYc1BRalJFSzRDVlpJa0xUbDdtZldHd0JCRm96d1Q4aHhFeGZ2VXBDNEFzZnNDQnlMVmJGMkxKeWlLaU5PVG5JZF9TWUEyUnlzczMtMWRUaUxGSE9hWTVXSUZWRm9WVGdUNDV0QjNKODBUeVdETzRzaWJiZ3RhT0Y4MEY4RXlZUE83SnpCa3VRbVh2QmdiTlFQQ09DcnVndHREMA</guid></item><item><title>我在癌症治疗期间学会照顾我的秃头-切割</title><link>https://www.thecut.com/article/what-i-learned-caring-for-my-bald-head-during-chemotherapy.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="wwwthecut-zephr-anchor" class="article-content inline" data-editable="content"&gt;
      
        &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmh5503wa000i0ih1x47nwqia@published" data-word-count="53"&gt;In February of this year, I was diagnosed with &lt;a href="https://www.nationalbreastcancer.org/about-breast-cancer/breast-cancer-staging/"&gt;stage-three-A&lt;/a&gt; invasive ductal carcinoma, the most common type of breast cancer, which originates in the milk ducts. I freaked out, unsure if I would survive and scared of what was surely going to be hell on my body as I fought for my life.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmh5508fe000h3b78mzs67x6f@published" data-word-count="58"&gt;I had two days to prepare for chemo, and I did so by getting my eyebrows tattooed to avoid looking like Voldemort once my facial hair fell out. My oncologist recommended I “ease into baldness,” so I also chopped my long hair into a cute pixie cut. Despite loving the cut, I still cried in the salon chair.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmh5508gb000i3b78l32p33jl@published" data-word-count="119"&gt;I decided to do chemo, a bilateral mastectomy, and radiation, which have all taught me plenty about indignity: I had so much diarrhea during chemo that my insides felt like beef jerky. Radiation burned my armpit so bad that the skin fell off, giving it a real medium-rare vibe. My chemo-induced menopause requires me to inject vaginal moisturizer, turkey-baster style, every couple days; otherwise, I feel like I’m peeing knives. In attacking every cell in my body, I now have to keep a tissue on hand to catch drips of watery snot that drop randomly out of my nose — sometimes in front of a cashier at Trader Joe’s — since chemo made all my nose hair fall out.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmh5508hl000j3b78lw49hqua@published" data-word-count="88"&gt;After six weeks of chemo, (two rounds) my scalp ached horribly and thickets of hair fell out in chunks. Even the teeny stubble hurt. The only way to relieve it was to tweeze or even pinch it out. Then my eyebrows, eyelashes, and pubes fell out, and my arms and legs all felt like dolphin skin since all my hair stopped growing. Soon after, I waved the white flag and shaved what was left of my pixie cut, leaving a shiny, round cue ball, à la &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqgVXSvwGo"&gt;Mr. Worldwide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmh5508iy000k3b78tpjbyufe@published" data-word-count="45"&gt;Chemo &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/managing-cancer/treatment-types/chemotherapy.html"&gt;slows or kills fast-growing cells&lt;/a&gt;, which include cancer cells &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; the cells in hair follicles. That’s what leads to chemotherapy-induced alopecia, or as I call it, Stanley Tucci–itis. Typically, people begin to lose it two to three weeks after the first round of chemo.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmh5508k8000l3b78sennvibi@published" data-word-count="155"&gt;Baldness — like, total baldness, with no stubble, eyelashes, or body hair — telegraphs illness, particularly in women. It doesn’t help that your face looks absolutely over it. Your cancer is made visible to yourself, as you’re looking in the mirror, dumbfounded. I wasn’t the only person doing a double take. Everywhere I went, I got sad, sympathetic smiles from people — real&lt;em&gt; hang in there!&lt;/em&gt; vibes at Target. I was inevitably treated like the Sad Girl With Cancer, even by well-intentioned people. It makes me think that even if I was sick, but had a full head of hair, I could eat a goddamn slice of pizza in public without someone looking at me like I’m Beth in &lt;em&gt;Little Women.&lt;/em&gt; Still, I’ve heard women with cancer who didn’t have to do chemo complain about the opposite effect, wishing they looked more sick by being bald so that people would understand that they were struggling.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmh5508lk000m3b785rcwpmtb@published" data-word-count="40"&gt;Even though my bald head became a source of frustration and my own insecurities with being sick, I still wanted to take care of it and make sure it was primed for the day hair did begin to sprout again.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmh5508mx000n3b78tkvgd4dr@published" data-word-count="50"&gt;I went nuts researching clean, fragrance-free products safe for cancer patients and filled my bathroom with La Roche-Posay, Aveeno, and Avène soaps and creams. Initially I thought I could use the same body wash I’d researched on my head thinking it was fine; it’s skin up there after all, right?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmh5508ob000o3b78d83qqe3p@published" data-word-count="92"&gt;A worker at my hospital, City of Hope, suggested I use products with gentle exfoliating properties on my scalp. She handed me a gift box of Chi Power Plus Hair Renewing System: a shampoo, conditioner, and scalp treatment that would help with regrowth after chemo. The cool, herbaceous products felt soothing and moisturizing on my scalp. I gently massaged it in, imagining thick waves and curls peaking out of my pores in an act of manifestation. Even though I desperately wanted my hair back, the alternative options never felt right for me.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmh5508po000p3b78xszx2dvu@published" data-word-count="63"&gt;During chemo, many patients try cold capping, also known as scalp cooling. The medical technique preserves chemo patients’ hair by having them wear freezing-cold hair caps before, during, and after sessions, and it can reduce hair loss by as much as 50 percent. But cold capping can be tedious and uncomfortable and not suitable for all cancer patients. Success is also not guaranteed.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmh5508vm000q3b78rm9jlyw6@published" data-word-count="103"&gt;I asked my oncologist about cold capping for myself early on just to hear my options. She told me it can be very painful and might not make much of a difference. I didn’t want to add more pain on top of what I would already be feeling for the sake of saving my hair, even though I understand why so many do. Being bald when you don’t want to be marks you as sick and may not be the most flattering look, even though plenty of women prove it can be (I’m looking at you, &lt;a href="https://thegreatbritishbakeoff.co.uk/bakers/series-16-jasmine/"&gt;Jasmine from &lt;em&gt;The Great British Bake Off&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmh5508ww000r3b781c4cndjw@published" data-word-count="110"&gt;Once my initial shock wore down, I decided to embrace the bald; to relish in the sensation of a cool shower on my head; to buy big earrings and wear shimmery eye shadow; to put on a Dobby costume and surprise my friends for a laugh. I spent years rocking unflattering &lt;a href="https://x.com/kinnserrific/status/993829878205173761"&gt;Liz Lemon–esque layers&lt;/a&gt; and every time my bangs looked especially rat-chewed I just told myself, “Who cares! Hair grows back!” That would be my approach to baldness, too, I decided. Even so, there were bad days when I felt hideous and depressed, and there were days when I chose not to think about it, avoiding mirrors if I could.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmh5508y8000s3b78ifekt9oh@published" data-word-count="68"&gt;Even with my discomfort with my illness, I didn’t want to hide my bald head. I wore beanies and dad hats to protect my scalp from cold or hot weather, but otherwise I let my head be free. I didn’t wear wigs either. Just like with cold capping, I understand why so many women choose this route, but for me wearing a wig was uncomfortable in many ways.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmh5508zi000t3b78n6mpac92@published" data-word-count="106"&gt;Wigs bothered me on a sensory level. They felt hot and itchy. If a strand stuck to my face, it felt like walking into a spiderweb. Even though I was given a gorgeous wig made from real hair by a charitable foundation, I hated the sensation of it on my head. On a deeper level, seeing myself in a wig felt … off, like an uncanny valley version of myself. Somehow wigs made me feel even more sick. As much as I struggled with losing all my hair, I didn’t want to put on a façade of sorts. I didn’t want to wear the cancer costume.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmh55090w000u3b7857xwp2a5@published" data-word-count="111"&gt;For me, it felt important to continue to be in the world and show people around me, and even myself, that life keeps happening when you have cancer. You still have to return a shirt at Zara and pick up dinner; you can still go out for a drink with friends and throw big parties. In fact, I’m extremely fortunate to be able to do any one of those things when cancer often means the extreme opposite for so many. The point of it all was to live, and continuing to do so even in mundane ways was tantamount to breathing. It was a necessity and a privilege to keep going.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmh55093c000v3b78jrjp4iv0@published" data-word-count="47"&gt;I didn’t want to hide my illness, pretending it doesn’t exist for the sake of other people’s comfort. Taking care of my bald head, and letting it be loose out in the world, meant also taking care of my spirit as I navigated this rotten, terrible disease.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmh55094i000w3b786cr2pitg@published" data-word-count="70"&gt;As the end of chemo approached after four months, I began to plan and daydream about my hair. Doctors told me to shave two or so more times before letting it grow out to cut off any chemo junk that would be in my freshly grown strands. July 19 was the last time I shaved my head, just in time for a big good-bye party I threw for my boobs.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmh55099w000x3b78vc33o4uw@published" data-word-count="109"&gt;Watching my hair grow back into a little pixie after three months, its texture now thick and velvety, has been exciting. Sometimes I look at old photos and take videos of my head to monitor the regrowth, willing it to come back faster. Hell, even the annoying thick chin hair I always had to pluck is back with a vengeance. One of my best friends gave me a natural hair oil with rosemary and mint she found at a woo-woo shop, and I bought Cecréd Restoring Hair and Edge drops, hoping to coax more hair out from my head. I actually really miss my smooth chemo face and legs.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmh5509e0000y3b785k8h70vb@published" data-word-count="54"&gt;Talking to my oncologists and others with cancer, I’ve heard that post-chemo hair sometimes grows back as “chemo curls” — the initial growth post-chemo can be tight to soft curls, which, in some cases, straighten out over time. I keep staring in the mirror, looking for signs of curl, imagining myself looking positively Shakira-esque.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmh5509fa000z3b78w58bu9n5@published" data-word-count="77"&gt;Regardless of its new texture, my growing-back hair signals that cancer is closer to being behind me where I want it to be. I’m eager to let this part of my life go, even though I’ll continue to carry so much of the care I gave my head and body during this time with me always, whether it’s using rosemary on my sensitive scalp or reminding myself to put on hoop earrings and live fully every day.&lt;/p&gt;

                Scientists are taking a second look at a drug for Alzheimer's that may help patients who are particularly at risk of developing the disease.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;In April, the future was looking bleak for an experimental Alzheimer's drug called valiltramiprosate, or ALZ-801.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Researchers had just released &lt;a href="https://alzheon.com/topline-results-from-pivotal-apolloe4-phase-3-trial-of-oral-valiltramiprosate-alz-801-in-patients-with-early-alzheimers-disease-carrying-two-copies-of-apoe4-gene/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;topline results&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of a study of more than 300 people age 50 or older, who were genetically predisposed to Alzheimer's. Overall, those who got the drug did no better than those given a placebo.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;But in September, a &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40265-025-02250-5" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;closer look&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; at the results revealed benefits for a subgroup of 125 people who had only mild memory problems when they started taking the drug. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Those participants, initially diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment rather than mild dementia, "showed very meaningful responses," says Dr. Susan Abushakra, chief medical officer of Alzheon, the drug's maker.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;By one measure, the drug slowed cognitive decline by 52% in people with mild cognitive impairment. That result appears comparable with benefits from the two Alzheimer's drugs now on the market: &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2023/07/06/1186225580/alzheimers-drug-leqembi-gets-full-fda-approval-medicare-coverage-lecanemab" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;lecanemab&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2024/06/10/g-s1-3818/fda-advisors-back-alzheimer-drug-donanemab-despite-risks" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;donabemab&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;But the true effect of ALZ-801 is hard to quantify because of the relatively small number of participants in the group with mild cognitive impairment.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;More robust results came from measures of brain atrophy — the shrinkage that tends to come with Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In the hippocampus, for example, participants who got ALZ-801 experienced about 18% less atrophy than those who got a placebo.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That's an important difference, Abushakra says, because the hippocampus is critical to memory and thinking.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;The findings were published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Drugs&lt;/em&gt;. The study was supported by a $47 million grant from the National Institutes of Health.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;A drug that's different&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Ordinarily, results like that would probably fall short of the evidence required for approval by the Food and Drug Administration.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But ALZ-801 may get special consideration because it has potential advantages over the two drugs already on the market.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Those drugs are both monoclonal antibodies given by intravenous infusions. That adds to the cost and requires patients to make multiple trips to an infusion center.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;ALZ-801 is a twice-daily pill that can be taken at home.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Also, the monoclonal antibodies work primarily by breaking down sticky amyloid plaques. These plaques form after fragments of a misfolded protein called beta-amyloid begin to clump together.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Alzheon's product is meant to keep plaques from forming in the first place, by preventing amyloid proteins from clumping at all.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;As a result, ALZ-801 doesn't cause the swelling or bleeding in the brain that often comes with monoclonal antibody treatment.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;A safer treatment for a high-risk group&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The availability of a safer drug like ALZ-801 could be a boon to people who carry two copies of a gene called APOE4.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Their genetic status means they have about 10 times the usual risk of developing Alzheimer's. As a result, even though APOE4/4 carriers make up only about 2% of the population, they represent about 15% of all people diagnosed with the disease.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, people with APOE4 genes are not only more vulnerable to Alzheimer's, they are also more likely to experience side effects from treatment with monoclonal antibodies.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"These individuals are at higher risk for inflammation in the brain that can be quite serious," says &lt;a href="https://www.bannerhealth.com/services/research/about-banner-research/research-leadership/jessica-langbaum" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Jessica Langbaum&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an Alzheimer's researcher at Banner Health in Phoenix.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Even so, Langbaum thinks people with the APOE4/4 genes can be treated safely with the current monoclonal antibodies. That could mean starting with a lower dose, she says, or beginning treatment earlier in the disease, when fewer amyloid plaques are present.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But &lt;a href="https://www.researchalz.com/alzheimers-treatment-center-staff/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;David Watson&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a scientist who carries two copies of the APOE4 gene, thinks people like him need a safer drug.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Watson, a co-author of the new study, also notes that ALZ may have benefits beyond those seen with monoclonal antibodies. For example, he says, the experimental drug appears better at reducing levels of a protein fragment associated with brain cell death.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We're really making a difference in keeping neurons alive," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;More evidence of the drug's effectiveness is coming from people who have kept taking ALZ-801 after the initial 18-month study period ended, Watson says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Despite carrying genes that usually lead to a swift decline, he says, "many of them are holding their own" in their 60s and 70s.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="f0ba141f-3870-4a2d-b4a0-0f6b92fd480d"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The patient: &lt;/strong&gt;A 12-month-old boy in Portugal&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The symptoms: &lt;/strong&gt;Shortly after eating different types of fish, the child would develop an odor of rotting fish emanating from his body. The smell was noxious and powerful, especially around his head and hands. He was 10 months old the first time this happened. (The child had been exclusively breastfed as an infant and began eating solid foods at 7 months of age.) His mother temporarily put him on a fish-free diet, but after she reintroduced fish to his meals two months later, the odor returned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-seasonal" href="" data-url="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="f0ba141f-3870-4a2d-b4a0-0f6b92fd480d-2" class="paywall" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What happened next:&lt;/strong&gt; When doctors examined the child, they did not detect a fishy smell, though they noted that he had not eaten fish before his medical visit, according to &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11929150/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11929150/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;a report&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of the case. They detected no abnormalities in the boy's neurodevelopment or growth, and laboratory tests showed that his kidneys, liver and thyroid were functioning normally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mid-article-leaderboard" class="ad-unit sm:hidden block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="adcb0308-5d39-4094-bf84-801452402500"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The diagnosis: &lt;/strong&gt;Doctors suspected that the child had developed a rare metabolic disorder called &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/22356-trimethylaminuria-fish-odor-syndrome" target="_blank" data-url="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/22356-trimethylaminuria-fish-odor-syndrome" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;trimethylaminuria&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, also known as "&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/viruses-infections-disease/fish-odor-syndrome-a-rare-metabolic-condition-that-makes-sweat-smell-like-rotten-fish" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/viruses-infections-disease/fish-odor-syndrome-a-rare-metabolic-condition-that-makes-sweat-smell-like-rotten-fish"&gt;&lt;u&gt;fish odor syndrome&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;," in which breath, saliva, sweat and urine smell like decaying fish. Rotten fish gets its distinctive smell from a molecule called trimethylamine, and the human body produces trimethylamine from nitrogen-rich foods, such as fish. An enzyme called &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/gene/fmo3/" target="_blank" data-url="https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/gene/fmo3/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;flavin-containing monooxygenase 3&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (FMO3) breaks down trimethylamine in the body, changing it to the odorless compound trimethylamine N-oxide. But if the enzyme isn't working as it should, trimethylamine accumulates in the body and can make a person produce a foul, rotting-fish aroma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A metabolic pediatrician conducted a molecular analysis of the child's FMO3 gene, which makes the FMO3 enzyme, and found a combination of genetic variants that could disrupt the production of the enzyme, leading to a mild or temporary type of trimethylaminuria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The treatment: &lt;/strong&gt;The doctors recommended that the child's parents reintroduce fish to the child's diet in small increments and that they manage any lingering smell with a low-pH soap, which reduces body odors. Over time, the rotten smell after fish meals weakened. By the time the child was 19 months old, he was eating fish five or six times per week without experiencing any malodorous symptoms afterward, and the symptoms had not returned by the time he was 3 years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="67137b30-e86f-42cb-ac83-81fbbfd369a2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What makes the case unique: &lt;/strong&gt;There is no treatment or cure for trimethylaminuria; its primary cause is genetic, and in adults the condition is frequently chronic. In this case, the child's temporary bout of trimethylaminuria was likely shaped by a combination of factors, including inherited variants of the FMO3 gene and the immaturity of his metabolism, his physicians wrote in the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-gszn6YfDVmkkvBcW9aWw6h" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-gszn6YfDVmkkvBcW9aWw6h slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the boy's metabolic system matured, the FMO3 enzyme improved its ability to break down trimethylamine. This child's case and others suggest that the causes of trimethylaminuria are more nuanced than once thought and that the disorder varies in severity, according to the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trimethylaminuria is an uncommon disorder, with just a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3052392/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3052392/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;few hundred cases&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; described in medical literature. However, the condition may be underdiagnosed, as people with trimethylaminuria often link their symptoms to personal hygiene habits and do not seek medical treatment for the unusual smell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mb-6" id="1a59ac74-77c6-4d84-96bc-9a1415fca214"&gt;

Such a kind of claim doesn't only tap a deep parental fear, but it also ends up distracting from what research actually shows about autism spectrum disorder (ASD). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's no denying that the findings of such research are complex, and are mostly rooted in genes and early (mostly prenatal) brain development. There is no evidence of autism being caused by routine childhood vaccines whatsoever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;THE SHORT, EVIDENCE-BACKED ANSWER &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to experts, the strongest weight of evidence points towards &lt;strong&gt;genetic factors&lt;/strong&gt; as the dominant contributor to autism risk. Many hundreds of genes, and combinations of genes, raise susceptibility to this disorder.&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-personalisation" class="checktheseout2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    
  &lt;p&gt;A second reason is the &lt;strong&gt;prenatal environment&lt;/strong&gt;, comprising maternal infection, metabolic problems (obesity, gestational diabetes), some medications, and also exposure to pollutants or certain chemicals during pregnancy. These are known factors  which could raise risk, especially, in genetically susceptible foetuses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="itemcenter"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Large, high-quality studies and global health agencies have found no credible link between childhood vaccines and autism. The vaccine theory has been repeatedly investigated and discredited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to leading geneticists, every known factor that causes autism occurs during early brain development. Dr. Dhanjay Mukhoty, one of India's leading autism experts, says, “We’ve successfully identified genetic causes of autism, and we’re now ready and moving into a new phase where we’re using the genetic information to develop therapeutics.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;GENES MATTER BUT DON'T TELL THE WHOLE STORY &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twin, family and genomic studies show autism clusters in families and that many rare and common gene variants influence risk. Some syndromes (fragile X, Rett) that have known single-gene causes include autistic features. A clear signal that genes can be powerful drivers of the disorder in children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, scientifically, it is also known genes interact with the environment. A genetic vulnerability, for instance, can make a developing brain more sensitive to prenatal stressors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;ENVIRONMENTAL RISKS: THE PRENATAL WINDOW&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recent reviews and cohort studies have highlighted several prenatal risk factors with consistent signals across countries:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1) &lt;strong&gt;Infection to the mother or if she has a fever during pregnancy: &lt;/strong&gt;These factors are closely associated with higher odds of ASD in offspring. Inflammation appears to be a plausible pathway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2) &lt;strong&gt;Metabolic health of the mother:&lt;/strong&gt; Pre-pregnancy obesity and gestational diabetes are repeatedly linked with modestly increased ASD risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3) &lt;strong&gt;Some medications and exposures:&lt;/strong&gt; High-dose valproic acid during pregnancy is also a medically recognised teratogen linked to autism; signals about SSRIs, antibiotics and other drugs are mixed and confounded by the conditions they treat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4)&lt;strong&gt;Toxicants and air pollution: &lt;/strong&gt;Observational studies have reported higher ASD likelihood with prenatal exposure to air pollution, phthalates and some heavy metals, though effect sizes vary, and more research is needed to corroborate this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, these exposures usually increase risk modestly. Doctors give us a ratio in the 1.2–2.5 range. For most families, that means absolute risk remains low, but at a population level, these factors significantly matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;WHY VACCINES KEEP COMING UP &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaccines became a focal point because of a now-discredited study published two decades ago and the understandable impulse to explain rising diagnosis numbers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, multiple independent epidemiologic investigations across countries (including those that were funded by CDC) have found little or no association between MMR or other routine childhood vaccines and ASD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Major health bodies, including the CDC, WHO and autism research consortia, have concurred with these findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pushing vaccine fear harms public health and diverts attention from prevention and support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;WHAT PARENTS ACTUALLY SAY &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parents in India speak less about “causes” than about daily survival and future planning. In a panel on World Autism Awareness Day, one mother described quitting her job to care for an adult son with autism, fearing who would look after him if she fell ill; another parent detailed safety measures and behaviour challenges and the strain on middle-class families.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These remarks underline that, beyond science, the urgent need for treating ASD is for services, supports and long-term planning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“An autistic childwill always need somebody’s help,” one parent said, describing the constant worry about care, safety and the lack of government schemes for lifelong support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;True scientists are mapping gene networks, studying how maternal immune activation and pollution affect foetal brain wiring, and searching for biomarkers that could identify ASD risk earlier. This may one day allow targeted prevention or precision treatments. Unfortunately, we are not there yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors have recommended some practical takeaways: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;a) First and foremost, &lt;strong&gt;never skip vaccines.&lt;/strong&gt; Virologists have maintained that vaccination protects children from deadly infections. There's no conclusive evidence that it does cause autism. Hence, it is advisable for parents to keep immunisation schedules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;b) &lt;strong&gt;Prenatal care matters most.&lt;/strong&gt; Families should be educated about managing maternal health (healthy weight, diabetes control). Expectant mothers must avoid infections in pregnancy where possible, and should follow obstetric advice. This will help  reduce risks linked to ASD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;c) &lt;strong&gt;Reduce outside exposures&lt;/strong&gt; to a great extent. While complete avoidance can’t remove all risk, minimising air pollution exposure can go a long way. Families may consider reducing the use of unnecessary prenatal toxicants, and following doctors’ guidance on medications. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;d) &lt;strong&gt;Early screening and intervention is key&lt;/strong&gt;. It is believed that early detection and therapies (behavioural, speech, occupational) improve outcomes and quality of life. If the parent is worried about their child's delayed speech or social engagement, they should be advised to consult a paediatrician for an assessment immediately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blaming vaccines or simplifying autism to a single cause is appealing because it’s simple, but it’s a wrong approach and is dangerous. The evidence points to a multifactorial picture dominated by genetics and shaped by prenatal biology and environmental exposures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For readers, the priority is a clear one: protect maternal health, trust evidence-based public health (including vaccination), seek early assessment when development concerns arise, and push for better long-term services for autistic people and their families.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let's not get waylaid by tweets when science has already spoken. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="lrcmtcont"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="end_story"&gt;- Ends&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dottedimg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="authors__container"&gt;&lt;div class="authors__by"&gt;&lt;p class="authlable"&gt;Published By: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="authdetaisl"&gt;Deebashree Mohanty&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="published__on"&gt;&lt;p class="authlable"&gt;Published On: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="authdetaisl"&gt;Oct 29, 2025&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>India Today</author><pubDate>Wed, 29 Oct 2025 09:45:58 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>罗奇博士：任何低于8000国际单位的维生素D都不会导致过量服用-底特律新闻</title><link>https://www.detroitnews.com/story/life/advice/2025/10/29/dr-roach-anything-under-8000-iu-of-vitamin-d-wont-cause-an-overdose/86816514007/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_by"&gt;Dr. Keith Roach&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="gnt_ar_b"&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dear Dr. Roach:&lt;/strong&gt; Several years ago, in my early 80s, my gynecologist told me (like all women who mainly stayed indoors) that I should be taking 4,000 IU of vitamin D3 daily. Yet today, I read an article warning that many people are overdosing on vitamin D. Is this really a concern?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;em&gt;— L.M.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dear L.M.:&lt;/strong&gt; Overdosing on vitamin D is dangerous. Last month, I had a patient who had elevated levels of calcium, which caused typical symptoms of confusion, vomiting and muscle weakness. She was found to have a very high blood vitamin D level. (She had mistaken the instructions for taking vitamin D.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;I have also seen vitamin D toxicity in people who are prescribed 50,000 units once a week for a month and mistakenly take this each day. (I don't prescribe this formulation as I have seen mistakes like this too often.) Toxicity is almost unheard of at 4,000 units daily. Up to 5,000 or even 8,000 units of vitamin D3 daily are very unlikely to cause excess.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Screening and treatment for vitamin D deficiency is less often done since the publication of a large study that showed few benefits to treatment. However, it is still appropriate to consider vitamin D deficiency in some high-risk groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;This includes older adults who don't go outside much but also people who don't absorb calcium well (especially those with a history of bariatric surgery, inflammatory bowel disease, or celiac disease). It can also occur in dark-skinned people or those who wear sun-protective clothing all the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Some medicines (especially for epilepsy) can increase the body's metabolism of vitamin D. I recommend obtaining your blood levels prior to starting vitamin D supplementation to confirm that the level is optimal during therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dear Dr. Roach:&lt;/strong&gt; Individuals who have an endoscopy or a colonoscopy are sedated before the procedure. When they awake, they are usually fine. I recently had my second cystoscopy, and like the others, it involves inserting a scope to check out, in this case, my bladder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The only sedation is an injection of Novocain into the penis. Then I had to wait about 10 minutes, and in came the scope. It is the most incredibly uncomfortable procedure that I can remember undergoing. It lasts for about 5 minutes. Is this why you don't get sedated for this procedure?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;em&gt;— E.B.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dear E.B.:&lt;/strong&gt; I get frustrated when I hear about patients not getting adequate pain relief for a procedure. Women who get IUDs or an endometrial biopsy often have inadequate pain relief, and men getting prostate biopsies are not offered anesthesia often.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;While many people tolerate them without much discomfort, I have heard from many men and women who say that these procedures are the most pain they have ever had in their lives. How we are affected by medical procedures varies dramatically from one person to another. Many people want to appear stoic, but this is not necessary, helpful or good for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;For cystoscopies in particular, I would say that 10 minutes may not be enough time for the local anesthetic to work; 15-20 minutes is usually recommended. Simply allowing the patient to watch the procedure has been shown to reduce pain and anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The medical literature provides other options, including nitrous oxide (like some dentists use), a nerve block (anesthesiologists usually do this), or a different local anesthetic. If you need another cystoscopy, please feel empowered to ask for better pain relief when you are next recommended for it by your urologist.&lt;em&gt;Readers may email questions to ToYourGoodHealth@med.cornell.edu.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Detroit News</author><pubDate>Wed, 29 Oct 2025 09:01:29 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi0wFBVV95cUxPT01JQXFQY3VBUjI0a0JWZ0JaaFE1ZEs4Q3RJOWZMXzJWS3d5eW1va0ptRnY2OEpYOU9MQ1M5OXBWYzVwNmNFLVVIajFEc1ZmVUoyNUNRdW54UkgySVM2dmw4MUs3alc5bjNXUllLUEFSY09FTXgzdXdVNEV2MWJrdzdnZlNfLXlvZldjWG1pSzg1QXdHUnhxSVhSY3NfZEplTGM5VmFLZ3hvcTcwdElIOHVMUHNvY2dCWGpNTXFsR21Vb2NpaFJmZi1nX21QblRiMERZ</guid></item><item><title>一些急性和慢性病毒感染可能会增加心血管疾病的风险- www.heart.org</title><link>https://newsroom.heart.org/news/some-acute-and-chronic-viral-infections-may-increase-the-risk-of-cardiovascular-disease</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="body-container" class="cBuilder article-body"&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Research Highlights:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;A review of 155 scientific studies found influenza and COVID infections raised the risk of heart attack or stroke as much as three-to five-fold in the weeks following the initial infection.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Viruses that linger in the body, such as HIV, hepatitis C and varicella zoster virus (the virus that causes shingles), can lead to long-term elevations in the risk of cardiovascular events.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The study researchers say preventive measures, including vaccination, may play an important role in reducing the risk of heart attacks and strokes, especially in people who already have heart disease or heart disease risk factors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Embargoed until 4 a.m. CT/5 a.m. ET Wednesday, Oct. 29, 2025&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DALLAS, Oct. 29, 2025 — In the weeks following a bout of influenza or COVID, the risk of heart attack or stroke may rise dramatically, and chronic infections such as HIV may increase the long-term risk of serious cardiovascular disease events, according to new, independent research published today in the &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/journal/jaha" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Journal of the American Heart Association&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an open access, peer-reviewed journal of the American Heart Association.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It is well recognized that human papillomavirus (HPV), hepatitis B virus and other viruses can cause cancer; however, the link between viral infections and other non-communicable diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, is less well understood,” said Kosuke Kawai, Sc.D., lead author of the study and adjunct associate professor in the division of general internal medicine and health services research at the David Geffen School of Medicine at the University of California, Los Angeles. “Our study found acute and chronic viral infections are linked to both short- and long-term risks of cardiovascular disease, including strokes and heart attacks.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The researchers set out to systematically review all published studies that investigated the association between any viral infection and the risk of stroke and heart attack, initially screening more than 52,000 publications and identifying 155 as appropriately designed and of high quality allowing for meta-analysis of the combined data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In studies that compared people’s cardiovascular risks in the weeks following documented respiratory infection vs. the same people’s risk when they did not have the infection, researchers found:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;People are 4 times as likely to have a heart attack and 5 times more likely to have a stroke in the month after laboratory-confirmed influenza.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;People are 3 times more likely to have a heart attack and 3 times as likely to have a stroke in the 14 weeks following COVID infection, with the risk remaining elevated for a year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The immune system’s natural response to viral infections includes the release of molecules that trigger and sustain inflammation and promote the tendency of blood to clot, both of which may last long after the initial infection has been resolved. Both inflammation and blood clotting can reduce the ability of the heart to function properly and may help explain the increased heart attack and stroke risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inflammation plays a key role in the development and progression of cardiovascular disease (CVD). It contributes to the formation and rupture of plaques in arteries, which can lead to heart attacks and strokes. Some elevated inflammatory markers are linked to worse outcomes and higher risk of future events; thus, managing inflammation is becoming an important part of preventing and treating CVD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In studies comparing long-term risk (average of more than 5 years) of cardiovascular events in people with certain chronic viral infections vs. similar people without the infection, the researchers found:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;A 60% higher risk of heart attack and 45% higher risk of stroke in people with HIV infection.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;A 27% higher risk of heart attack and 23% higher risk of stroke in people with hepatitis C infection.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;A 12% higher risk of heart attack and 18% higher risk of stroke in people had shingles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The elevated risks for cardiovascular disease risks are lower for HIV, hepatitis C and herpes zoster than the heightened short-term risk following influenza and COVID. However, the risks associated with those three viruses are still clinically relevant, especially because they persist for a long period of time. Moreover, shingles affects about one in three people in their lifetime,” Kawai said. “Therefore, the elevated risk associated with that virus translates into a large number of excess cases of cardiovascular disease at the population level.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The findings also suggest that increased vaccination rates for influenza, COVID and shingles have the potential to reduce the overall rate of heart attacks and strokes. As an example, the researchers cite a 2022 review of available science that found a 34% lower risk of major cardiovascular events among participants receiving a flu shot in randomized clinical trials vs. participants in the same trials who were randomly selected to receive a placebo instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Preventive measures against viral infections, including vaccination, may play an important role in decreasing the risk of cardiovascular disease. Prevention is especially important for adults who already have cardiovascular disease or cardiovascular disease risk factors,” Kawai said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the American Heart Association, people may be at greater risk for cardiovascular disease because of viruses such as influenza, COVID, RSV and shingles. Additionally, because people with cardiovascular disease may face more severe complications from these viruses, the Association &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/vaccines/discussion-guide" target="_blank"&gt;recommends&lt;/a&gt; those individuals consult with a health care professional to discuss which vaccines are right for them, as vaccination offers critical protection to people already at increased risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although a connection has been suggested in previous studies, researchers note there is currently limited evidence and more studies are needed to understand the possible links between heart disease risk and several other viruses, including cytomegalovirus (virus that can cause birth defects), herpes simplex 1 (virus that causes cold sores), dengue (mosquito-spread virus that can cause dengue fever) and human papilloma virus (can cause cervical and other cancers later in life).&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The current analysis has some limitations as it was based on observational studies rather than randomized controlled trials; however, many of the studies accounted adequately for potential confounding factors. Because most studies examined infection with a single virus, it is unclear how infection with multiple viruses or bacteria may have affected the results. The analysis focused on viral infections that impact the general public and did not identify high-risk groups (such as transplant recipients) that may be disproportionately affected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Study details, background and design:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Investigators searched multiple medical databases from inception through July 2024 for studies examining the association of viral infections and cardiovascular diseases, then screened 52,336 possibly relevant publications and selected 155 studies as appropriate for analysis.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Studies were published between 1997 and 2024 and most were conducted in North America (67), Europe (46) and East Asia (32).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;137 studies evaluated one viral infection and 18 studies evaluated 2 or more.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;For each virus under consideration, researchers performed a meta-analysis of studies employing the same study design.&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;For more than a year, Diane Hunter, now 72, had been experiencing vague symptoms — pain in her spine and hips, nausea, exhaustion, thirst, and frequent urination. Her primary care physician had ruled out diabetes before finally chalking up her ailments to getting older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But months of intense back pain eventually landed her in the emergency room, where a doctor suggested that Hunter might have multiple myeloma. Hunter's first question was, "What is that?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Multiple myeloma is a cancer that develops in bone marrow plasma cells, crowding out healthy blood cells and damaging the bones. It is one of the most common blood cancers — and the most diagnosed among African Americans. The mortality rate from multiple myeloma also is higher among African American patients than white people, with a number of studies showing that, in addition to disease biology, societal factors such as socioeconomic status and &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37917858/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;lack of access&lt;/a&gt; to health insurance or medical services delay timely diagnoses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A belated diagnosis is what happened to Hunter, a Black woman in Montgomery, Alabama. She said her primary care doctor dismissed a recommendation from her endocrinologist to refer her to a hematologist after finding high protein counts in her blood. Then, she said, he also refused to order a bone marrow biopsy after the ER doctor suggested she might have multiple myeloma. Fed up, she said, she found a new doctor, got tested, and learned she indeed had the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.dana-farber.org/find-a-doctor/monique-a-hartley-brown" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Monique Hartley-Brown&lt;/a&gt;, a multiple myeloma researcher at the &lt;a href="https://www.dana-farber.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Dana-Farber Cancer Institute&lt;/a&gt; in Boston, said Hunter's experience is fairly common, particularly among Black patients who live in underserved communities.&lt;/p&gt;

    
&lt;p id="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" data-ad="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" class="ad-mpu-plus-outstream-middle ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='"mpu-plus-outstream-middle"'&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"On average, patients see their primary doctor three times before being accurately diagnosed," Hartley-Brown said. "The delay from symptom onset to diagnosis is even longer for Black Americans. Meanwhile, the disease is wreaking havoc — causing fractures, severe anemia, fatigue, weight loss, kidney problems."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Black and Hispanic patients are also less likely to receive the newest therapies, according to the Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation, and, when they do, they are more likely to do so later in the course of their disease than white patients. An &lt;a href="https://ashpublications.org/bloodadvances/article/6/6/1684/483828/Analysis-of-racial-and-ethnic-disparities-in" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;analysis published in 2022&lt;/a&gt; of racial and ethnic disparities in multiple myeloma drug approval trials submitted to the Food and Drug Administration concluded that Black patients made up only 4% of participants despite being roughly 20% of those living with the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, even though significant progress has been made in understanding the biology of multiple myeloma and how to treat it, those racial gaps may grow larger amid &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/nih-cancer-research-trump-cuts-hhs-layoffs/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;federal cuts to cancer research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.appliedclinicaltrialsonline.com/view/the-impact-of-dei-ban-on-clinical-research-ecosystem" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;backlash against diversity and inclusion efforts&lt;/a&gt;. While few multiple myeloma experts were willing to talk on the record about the impact of the funding cutbacks, &lt;a href="https://themmrf.org/about/executive-leadership/michael-andreini/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Michael Andreini&lt;/a&gt;, president and CEO of the Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation, has written that cuts to the National Institutes of Health and its National Cancer Institute &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/national-cancer-institute-nih-cuts-chaos-scientific-biomedical-research/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;put future innovations&lt;/a&gt; at risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Even before these potential cuts, funding for myeloma lagged behind," &lt;a href="https://themmrf.org/mmrf-blogs/is-progress-in-multiple-myeloma-stalling/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;he wrote&lt;/a&gt; before the cuts were finalized. "The myeloma specific budget has decreased significantly. Myeloma is almost 2% of all cancers, yet receives less than 1% of the NCI's budget."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The disease is already hard to diagnose. Because multiple myeloma is &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/multiple-myeloma/about/key-statistics.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;usually diagnosed&lt;/a&gt; when a patient is over 65 (African Americans tend to be &lt;a href="https://www.myeloma.org/blog/myeloma-facts-for-people-of-african-descent" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;diagnosed five years younger&lt;/a&gt;, on average), common symptoms such as lower back pain and fatigue are often chalked up to just getting older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's what happened to Jim Washington of Charlotte, North Carolina. He was 61 when excruciating hip pain brought his regular tennis games to a sudden stop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I figured I'd done something to injure myself," Washington said. "But I'd been playing tennis all my life, and this pain was different from anything I'd ever felt before."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Washington was fortunate to have a concierge doctor and premium health insurance. In quick succession, he underwent X-rays that revealed a lesion on his spine and received a referral to an oncologist, who identified a cancerous tumor. A subsequent biopsy and blood tests confirmed he had multiple myeloma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

                          &lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Washington had weeks of high-dose chemotherapy, followed by what is known as an autologous stem cell transplant, which used his own stem cells to regrow healthy blood cells in his body. It was a grueling process that ultimately left him with a clean bill of health. For the next several years, his doctors monitored him closely, including conducting an annual bone marrow biopsy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before treatment, he said, myeloma had infiltrated 60% of his blood cells. The stem cell transplant brought those levels down to zero. After about five years, however, his multiple myeloma level had crept back up to 10% and required more treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Washington had closely followed the latest research and believed he had reason to be optimistic. The FDA had approved the first &lt;a href="https://www.dana-farber.org/newsroom/news-releases/2021/first-fda-approval-of-car-t-cell-therapy-for-multiple-myeloma-marks-milestone-for-patients" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;CAR T-cell therapy for multiple myeloma&lt;/a&gt; in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="mpu-flex-inc4" data-ad="mpu-flex-inc" class="ad-mpu-flex-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["mpu-flex-inc",4]'&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hartley-Brown said the lack of Black patients in multiple myeloma drug approval trials raises concerns about whether the trial results are equally applicable to the Black population and may help explain why treatment advances have been less effective in Black patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She cited multiple causes for the low trial participation rate, including historical distrust of the medical establishment and a lack of available clinical trials. "If you are living in an underserved or underrepresented area, the hospital or community doctor may not have clinical trials available, or that patient may have limitations getting to that location affiliated with the clinical trial," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Washington, a Black patient, appears to have avoided this trap, having benefited from the latest treatments both times. In January, he began six weeks of chemotherapy with a three-drug combination of Velcade, Darzalex, and dexamethasone before undergoing CAR T-cell therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For that, doctors collected Washington's T cells, a type of white blood cell, and genetically modified them to better recognize and destroy the cancer cells before reinfusing them into his body. He didn't require hospitalization post-transplant and could do daily blood draws at home. His energy levels were much higher than during his first treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I've been in a very privileged position," Washington said. "The prognosis is very positive, and I'm feeling good about where I am at this point."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hunter, too, considers herself lucky despite receiving a delayed diagnosis. After her diagnosis in January 2017, she underwent five months of immunotherapy with a three-drug combination (Revlimid, Velcade, and dexamethasone) followed by a successful stem cell transplant and two weeks in the hospital. She has been in remission since July 2017.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hunter, now a support group co-leader and patient advocate, said that stories like Washington's and her own provide hope despite the research cuts.&lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="mpu-flex-inc5" data-ad="mpu-flex-inc" class="ad-mpu-flex-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["mpu-flex-inc",5]'&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the eight years since her treatment, she said, she's seen the thinking around multiple myeloma — long described as a treatable but incurable disease — begin to shift as a growing subset of patients remain disease-free for many years. She said she has even met people living with the disease for 30 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The word 'cure' is now being heard," Hunter said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/about-us/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;KFF Health News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs at&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/about-us/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt; KFF&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; — the independent source for health policy research, polling, and journalism.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhb2awux003i26qn0iya30vl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Covid-19 infections have been &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/09/health/covid-heart-attack-stroke-risk"&gt;strongly linked&lt;/a&gt; with cardiovascular conditions&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;like heart disease and stroke, but new research shows that other viral infections such as influenza, HIV, hepatitis C and shingles can also increase the risk of heart problems and cardiovascular disease.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhb2fyva00073b6n6r8xyps7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The meta-analysis, published Wednesday in the Journal of the American Heart Association, reviewed 155 studies spanning decades and found that viral infections can raise the risk of heart disease both immediately after an infection and over the long term.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhb3lnbu00013b6qtgkedowu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            People who caught the flu were up to six times more likely to have a heart attack in the month after the infection, and those who had Covid-19 had nearly twice the risk of developing heart disease or stroke compared with people who hadn’t been infected.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhb2gy74000r3b6nt3p9xq6m@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “One way to prevent this is really vaccination,” said lead study author Dr. Kosuke Kawai, an adjunct professor at the David Geffen School of Medicine at the University of California, Los Angeles. “Often, we get vaccinated to reduce the risk of influenza or other illness, but I think vaccines can provide additional benefit in terms of potentially protecting against cardiovascular disease.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhb2bgpp00003b6nbgc5nw9r@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The authors of the new research concluded that influenza and Covid-19 infections were associated with higher risk of acute cardiovascular events such as heart attacks. Chronic viral infections such as HIV, hepatitis C and shingles were associated with a long-­term increased risk of coronary heart disease and stroke.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhb2g5rs000d3b6nuh2aaodm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The new study also notes that cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex, hepatitis A, human papillomavirus (HPV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), dengue and chikungunya have been linked to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, but it says more research on the association is needed.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhb2g52n000b3b6n4m5cpp65@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The new findings fit with what clinicians have long observed, said Dr. Scott Roberts, associate medical director for infection prevention at the Yale School of Medicine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhb2gnxb000k3b6neoabuvui@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Unfortunately, many infections can do this,” he said. “Respiratory viruses increase cardiovascular risk in two ways”: indirectly, by triggering an overactive immune response that causes inflammation, leading to stress and blood clotting that affects the heart; or directly, when the virus can attack heart tissue itself.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhb2gnxb000l3b6n1993db0v@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Most respiratory viruses, including Covid-19, flu and RSV, act through the indirect pathway, Roberts said, while enterovirus strains – related to the viruses that cause hand, foot and mouth disease – can directly infect the heart muscle.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhb2gnxb000m3b6n7endmkwn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Generally, the more severe the viral illness, the greater the risk of cardiovascular complications,” he said. These infections can also worsen existing heart problems like heart failure, he added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhb3h08o00103b6ntwxbu4wd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kawai said it’s hard to quantify how likely it is for someone with a viral infection to develop cardiovascular disease, so everyone should take protective measures.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhb3hf4600173b6nzwv0fqzd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It also depends on the viral infection,” Kawai said. “It’s not just the patients who have underlying increased risk for cardiovascular disease that might be at greater risk, but those who are younger adults, or people who might not necessarily have some of the risk factors for cardiovascular disease, are also at increased risk” after a viral infection.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhb2gg10000i3b6nbf3kstxc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Our study highlights the importance of integrated preventive measures, especially for adults with traditional risk factors for [cardiovascular disease]. Vaccines may play an important role in preventing the risk of CVD,” the researchers wrote.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhb2h2gv000t3b6nk705rlto@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            They concluded that preventive measures such as vaccination and timely antiviral treatment could help reduce the burden of cardiovascular disease, which remains the world’s leading cause of death.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhb2h2gv000u3b6nz82k8p0e@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Vaccines for many of these viruses exist and generally lessen the risk of cardiovascular events after infection, since the severe infection is more likely to be mild in a vaccinated individual,” Roberts said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhb5v78h00003b6n5kq2k5g2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In people who have a healthy immune system, vaccines are protective without causing cardiovascular disease because they typically contain a small amount of an inactivated virus or specific subunits from the pathogen, Kawai said. The inactivated virus does not trigger an overactive immune response that causes inflammation that affects the heart, nor is it able to attack heart tissues themselves.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhb3h3ts00123b6nmrw5vx12@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Anyone who is concerned about the risk of heart problems after an infection should talk with their doctor, Roberts advises.

Andrew Josephson, chair of the neurology department at UCSF. “The amount is huge, but so is the scope. Most gifts we receive are very focused on a specific project. But this is someone who, because they believe so much in the mission of the aging and memory center, really wanted this to be unrestricted funding.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="A300" data-large-id="CONCERT1" data-unit="hnp-sfchronicle.com/article_dtc" class="f jcc mnh250px sm:mnh600px ais lg:f lg:jcc lg:mnh300px lg:ais"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Josephson said the unrestricted nature of the gift also is important at this time of uncertainty in federal funding, with financial support for academic research under constant threat. “It gives us the kind of flexibility that, particularly in these times of challenging funding, is incredibly appreciated,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brooklyn native Edward Fein was a stockbroker and financial analyst who retired in the 1970s and was committed, with his wife, to philanthropy, especially in medicine. He was cared for at the UCSF memory center for about a decade at the end of his life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This was a person who appreciated the care they received and wanted to make a truly transformative gift,” Josephson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease and other forms of dementia afflict more than 7 million Americans, and that number is expected to nearly double over the next 25 years, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Globally, about 150 million people are expected to be living with dementia by 2050, according to UCSF.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Edward, Pearl and I had many conversations over the years about the importance of supporting our work in the face of this global challenge,” said Dr. Gil Rabinovici, the Edward and Pearl Fein Distinguished Professor, in a statement. The Fein family has supported his work since 2015 studying how brain scans can improve patient care and the development of new treatments for Alzheimer’s. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="CONCERT1" data-large-id="CONCERT2" data-unit="hnp-sfchronicle.com/article_dtc" class="f jcc mnh250px sm:mnh300px ais lg:f lg:jcc lg:mnh300px lg:ais"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The memory and aging center, which opened more than 20 years ago, is an unusual collaboration between front-line doctors treating patients in various stages of dementia and laboratory and clinical researchers who are studying potential breakthrough therapies. “Our clinical patients help inform questions that our researchers then address,” Josephson said. “And that research can be translated quickly to the patients themselves.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s a popular program with about a six-week waiting list for patients. Caregivers there focus on working with patients and families and helping people live their best lives while facing dementia, Josephson said. Staff include therapists, social workers and genetic counselors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The memory center also focuses on training, including community outreach for the general public interested in dementia and specialized studies for postdoctoral researchers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers at the center already have made advances in dementia, including developing new brain scans and blood tests to identify Alzheimer’s disease early, which could be critical in finding therapies that could halt the progression of symptoms or, ideally, prevent disease entirely. Scientists there also are leading large national trials for new treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are keeping patients on the cutting edge of therapeutic options,” Josephson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="B300" data-unit="hnp-sfchronicle.com/article_dtc" class="f jcc mnh250px sm:mnh600px ais lg:none"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s an especially thrilling time for advances in dementia care, said Dr. Bruce Miller, who has been studying dementia since the 1990s and founded the memory and aging center at UCSF. When he started the clinic, he was the only doctor attached to it; there are now more than 50 faculty members involved and 330 staff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said he’s excited about several new therapies currently in trials — “I think these are going to be blockbusters” — but he’s also energized by how much better scientists have come to understand these conditions in the past decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s the most exciting time in my academic career,” Miller said. “There’s nothing that would get me to retire today. We’re just on the verge of such exciting changes in the way patients are treated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Having this sort of (Fein) endowment,” he said, “really ensures that we can remain very creative and fund the most imaginative science.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="CONCERT2" data-unit="hnp-sfchronicle.com/article_dtc" class="f jcc mnh250px sm:mnh300px ais lg:none"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn top"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn bottom"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>San Francisco Chronicle</author><pubDate>Wed, 29 Oct 2025 07:05:51 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinAFBVV95cUxOYkNMVFRVSm1fSmhXMVQxMlkzOHZ3bHNFWWlCU2o4YWpETzZZMmhMVnl2SUN6a3UzLVA4SEMzWjludXFVTG85d05UY3U4SGFUVElrN000aGdHSWY3NVB5Zi12ZDVGQkhiUDZLQmVvQ0NnM0VVOXM2SVpPa0J5V2FhdzE2NVJrMWZkb1U3eFkxTnRFOUtxZ0s4aVhnSUE</guid></item><item><title>“停止专注于锻炼” -一位教授说，你应该遵循这五个科学支持的步骤来改善你的健康状况- Fit&amp;Well</title><link>https://www.fitandwell.com/wellness/stop-focusing-on-working-out-a-professor-says-you-should-follow-these-five-science-backed-steps-to-improve-your-wellness-instead</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-body" class="article__body "&gt;

However, when we are successfully engaging in those activities that we most enjoy or through which we thrive, we most often expend both mental and physical energy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Henney and Hackett shared with me their five-step science-backed guide to exercise the mind and body to improve overall wellness.

A sedentary lifestyle will increase your risk of chronic health problems, age your brain and body, and make you vulnerable to depression and anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Movement, not exercise, is the daily answer to avoiding a sedentary lifestyle. This can be as simple as walking up the steps at work rather than taking the elevator. Anything that provides us a chance to get our heart rate up is great.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While we’ve heard a lot about getting to 10,000 steps a day—which can certainly be a great goal for some people—recent work suggests 7,000 steps a day can significantly improve our health. Many people may find that working towards this many steps is less daunting and a more realistic goal than 10,000. On average, this is about 4.5-5.3 kilometers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-h4mBXncRukqiSvgcrtZEeL" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-h4mBXncRukqiSvgcrtZEeL slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Start your week with achievable workout ideas, health tips and wellbeing advice in your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hackett says regular physical activity can improve heart health, reduce or slow cognitive decline and avoid metabolic syndrome—a range of conditions that, combined, increase the risk of developing heart disease, diabetes, stroke and other chronic health issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And walking can be particularly beneficial he says, adding: “A &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amepre.2025.107738" target="_blank" data-url="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amepre.2025.107738" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; of close to 85,000 people found that walking, particularly brisk walking, reduces all-cause mortality.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-step-two-be-socially-active" href="" data-url="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-step-two-be-socially-active"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Step two: Be socially active&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="0c8836d3-7266-4810-85c9-ab0d0962b370"&gt;“Maintaining close personal relationships with our family and friends is an often overlooked aspect of our health,” says Hackett. “But an influential &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39279411/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39279411/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; by Julianne Holt-Lunstad found social connections were as important for our health as quitting smoking, and more critical than our weight and not exercising enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Maintaining these connections gives us the opportunity to check in on others, share our experiences and offer mutual support. But this does not mean you have to be with people only in person—there are lots of ways to connect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Technological advances allow us to maintain consistent connections with close others. We can engage with others on social media—although at times this can certainly impact us negatively—or send our significant other a quick text to let them know we are thinking about them!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Joining and being active in community groups can be another important way to be engaged socially. These groups allow us to pursue activities important to us and connect us with like-minded others.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-step-three-use-mindfulness-as-a-stress-buster" href="" data-url="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-step-three-use-mindfulness-as-a-stress-buster"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Step three: Use mindfulness as a stress buster&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout " data-bordeaux-image-check id="39db5fd0-42c2-4b12-bfae-96e46065ccb4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="inline-layout "&gt;&lt;div class="caption-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Justin Hackett says a few mindful breaths can help invoke our body’s natural relaxation process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;p class="credit"&gt;(Image credit: Getty Images / andreswd)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p id="8d88ca0e-8f31-42db-b0ec-168d65365519"&gt;“Balancing the demands of family, work and school can make it hard to escape stress, but science shows a mindful approach is quite effective at managing it,” says Hackett.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Mindfulness does not need to be complicated. Taking a break from work and stretching at our desk, or if possible, taking a quick walk outside can make us feel better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In fact, simply taking a few mindful breaths—inhaling slowly through our nose and gently exhaling through our mouth—can help invoke our body’s natural relaxation process.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-step-four-be-kind-to-yourself-and-others" href="" data-url="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-step-four-be-kind-to-yourself-and-others"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Step four: Be kind to yourself and others&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="a3bff539-98bd-4b16-8200-74fe67ad7bd1"&gt;Hackett recommends trying a loving-kindness meditation. Spending just a few minutes a day repeating phrases such as “may I be happy” has been shown to increase positive emotions and help manage depressive feelings, according to a study published in the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://doi.org/10.1002/jts.21832" target="_blank" data-url="https://doi.org/10.1002/jts.21832" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Journal of Traumatic Stress&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Practicing kindness can make us feel better,” says Hackett. “Sending a colleague a thank you note, or even simply holding a door for someone can have a positive impact. You never know what other people are dealing with or working through. A simple act like holding a door for someone and smiling at them can mean more to them than we realize.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Another way to promote wellbeing is to focus on the good things in our lives. It’s easy to allow negative events in our lives to consume us and bring us down.

			&lt;p&gt;Modifications to a type of immune cell programmed to recognize and kill cancerous tumors could make them even more effective assassins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and Harvard Medical School have found a novel way to engineer chimeric antigen receptor natural killer (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAR-NK"&gt;CAR-NK&lt;/a&gt;) cells to ensure they're not rejected by the body's &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/the-immune-system-weighs-the-same-as-a-pineapple-study-finds"&gt;immune system&lt;/a&gt; as foes rather than friends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the treatment is yet to be tested in humans, initial experiments in mice and human tissues in the lab suggest these new CAR-NK cells are well tolerated and effective at &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/this-rare-fungus-can-kill-cancer-cells-and-we-finally-know-its-secret"&gt;fighting cancer&lt;/a&gt; – a promising start for these next-gen upgrades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer-vaccine-blocks-multiple-tumors-in-mice-for-250-days"&gt;Cancer Vaccine Blocks Multiple Tumors in Mice For 250 Days&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Natural killer cells are produced in the body as a first-line defense against cancers or tissues infected with  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/virus" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73053" data-postid="178689" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;viruses&lt;/a&gt;. They don't need priming, reacting to suspect cells that don't seem to belong. By engineering chimeric antigen receptors onto NK cells taken from a patient's own blood, the tiny killers can better target specific proteins known to identify cancerous cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The process of engineering enough CAR-NK cells to return to a patient takes several weeks, prompting scientists to consider using blood from healthy donors instead. While it means an army of CAR-NK cells can be ready to go at all times, the process increases the risk of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/breakthrough-test-predicts-whether-organ-transplants-will-be-rejected"&gt;immune system rejection&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_178692" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-178692" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/MiceTumors.jpg" alt="Tumor progress in mice" class="wp-image-178692 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/MiceTumors.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/MiceTumors-600x299.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-178692" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The engineered cells had a noticeable impact on tumors in mice (shown by the bright blotches).

The enhanced versions lasted at least three weeks, whereas the standard CAR-NK and NK cells were rejected by the immune systems of the mice, leaving the cancer to grow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was another benefit of the upgraded CAR-NK cells: a reduced likelihood of &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/22700-cytokine-release-syndrome"&gt;cytokine release syndrome&lt;/a&gt; – a potentially fatal side effect where the immune system triggers severe inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study team thinks their approach may also improve &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/immune-response-thought-to-aid-cancer-could-be-an-unexpected-cure"&gt;CAR-T cell therapies&lt;/a&gt;, which use 'T' immune cells instead of natural killer cells. These therapies work well in some patients, but not in others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/spark-into-space-comp"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg" alt="Win a $10,000 Space Coast Adventure Holiday" class="alignnone wp-image-177074 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro.jpg 844w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the key next steps here will be  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/clinical-trials" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73032" data-postid="178689" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;clinical trials&lt;/a&gt;, so the researchers can see if these positive effects are seen in people as well. If those trials go well, there's plenty of potential for these &lt;a href="https://lifesciences.danaher.com/us/en/library/allogeneic-cell-therapy.html"&gt;allogeneic therapies&lt;/a&gt; (using immune cell fighters from healthy donors).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We believe our approach could also be applied to other allogeneic cell-based products and can aid the design of 'off-the-shelf' allogeneic therapies," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-63863-8"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers in their published paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-63863-8"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Magnesium is an essential mineral for bone and heart health.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The average adult needs 320 mg to 420 mg per day.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Foods rich in magnesium include nuts, seeds, leafy greens and whole grains.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Whether related to claims that it might improve sleep or &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8012002/can-magnesium-help-you-poop/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;help you poop&lt;/a&gt;, magnesium has received a lot of attention over the last few years. And for good reason. Magnesium is an important nutrient for your overall health, especially for your heart, muscles and nerves. Unfortunately, many people in the U.S. consume less than what’s recommended, even though it's found naturally in foods like leafy greens, beans, legumes, whole grains, yogurt and more.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Magnesium is critical to many functions in the body and plays a role in everything from bone health to nerve function,” says dietitian &lt;a href="https://erinpalinski.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Erin Palinski-Wade, RD, CDCES&lt;/a&gt;. Palinski-Wade adds that magnesium also helps control your calcium and vitamin D levels, which are essential for healthy bone formation.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Let's take a closer look at what magnesium does in the body and how you can get enough of this mineral that also acts as an electrolyte.

&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; May Help Manage Your Blood Pressure &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Magnesium plays a role in how our hearts beat, so getting an adequate amount may help you prevent high blood pressure and lower your risk of heart disease.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “Some research shows that magnesium supplementation can help lower blood pressure, but only by a small amount,” says &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/author/toby-amidor/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Toby Amidor, M.S., RD, CDN&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian. But even a small amount of help from magnesium can add to the blood-pressure-lowering benefits if you engage in other healthy habits, like &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/how-to-lower-blood-pressure-8611460" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;exercising and reducing sodium&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Magnesium helps with glucose metabolism,” says Amidor. This helps support healthy blood sugar levels and reduce the risk of diabetes. Additionally, research has shown that eating enough daily magnesium may reduce blood pressure, hyperglycemia (high blood sugar levels) and hypertriglyceridemia (high triglyceride levels), which may improve metabolic syndrome and help manage diabetes.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Because magnesium helps to regulate calcium and vitamin D in the body, it is essential for bone health and a key nutrient in preventing bone loss and osteoporosis,” says Palinski-Wade.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Amidor adds that there is a positive association between magnesium intake and bone mineral density in both men and women, meaning that you’ll have stronger bones that are less likely to break.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Improving sleep is perhaps one of magnesium's most touted benefits in the wellness world. And while there is some research that shows that &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8076313/magnesium-for-sleep/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;magnesium may enhance sleep quality&lt;/a&gt;, more research is needed to support these claims.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; With that said, adequate magnesium can help with mood regulation, a critical function for overall health and wellness, says Palinski-Wade. And if you're experiencing less stress and anxiety, you may be able to sleep better.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Magnesium is an essential nutrient for your heart health. Palinski-Wade shares that it helps maintain a regular heart rhythm. This is because magnesium plays a role in the active transport of calcium and potassium ions across cell membranes, which steadies the heart rhythm.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Magnesium is an antioxidant, and getting enough might help lower &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-is-inflammation-8766645" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;chronic inflammation&lt;/a&gt; in your body, which can help with everything from longevity to healthy weight management and chronic disease risk.

People who have migraines also experience additional symptoms like nausea, vomiting and sensitivity to light, sound and smells. Some research has shown promising benefits of using magnesium to help treat and prevent migraines. However, more evidence is needed to support this hypothesis.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Additionally, Amidor notes that a magnesium deficiency may promote headaches, which could increase your risk of experiencing migraines.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Magnesium deficiencies occur when your magnesium levels are below a healthy range because you don’t eat enough magnesium-rich foods or take a supplement to compensate for that. While many Americans don’t eat enough foods with magnesium, a full-blown deficiency is not very common. Yet, some &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/signs-youre-not-getting-enough-magnesium-11740104" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;potential symptoms&lt;/a&gt; of a magnesium deficiency include:&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; How much magnesium you need depends on your age, sex and whether you're pregnant or breastfeeding.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The average adult male needs 400 mg to 420 mg of magnesium per day, and the average adult female needs 310 mg to 320 mg per day. If you're pregnant, your needs increase to 350 mg to 360 mg per day, and for breastfeeding, 310 mg to 320 mg per day. It's best to speak with a healthcare practitioner knowledgeable in nutrition—like a registered dietitian—to get the recommended amount for you.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Magnesium is naturally found in food and abundant in leafy greens, beans, legumes, whole grains and more.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_53-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Getting too much magnesium from food doesn’t cause health risks since your kidneys can eliminate the excess through your urine. However, high doses of magnesium carbonate, magnesium chloride, magnesium gluconate and magnesium oxide from supplements can cause abdominal cramping, diarrhea and nausea. Also, doses exceeding 5,000 milligrams are considered unsafe and may cause magnesium toxicity.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_58-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Getting enough magnesium through your diet is always best. However, certain conditions and circumstances can make this challenging. That’s when a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-magnesium-supplements-8425114" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;magnesium supplement&lt;/a&gt; may come in handy. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_59-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_60-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; However, experts agree that you should consult a primary healthcare provider first and consider certain factors before reaching for a bottle of magnesium. This is partly because there are several forms of magnesium, and how well your body absorbs them varies. For instance, some small studies have found that magnesium citrate, magnesium aspartate, magnesium lactate and magnesium chloride are more bioavailable than magnesium oxide and magnesium sulfate.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_61-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_62-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Palinski-Wade also notes that all forms of magnesium have varying effects, so it’s best to discuss the right type of magnesium and dosage with a healthcare practitioner. “Also, keep in mind that it can have some GI side effects, so take the supplement with food to improve absorption and minimize potential side effects,” says Palinski-Wade. This is why magnesium is a common &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/supplements-to-help-you-poop-8765310" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;supplement for constipation&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_64-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When choosing a supplement, there are several things to consider, including other ingredients besides the magnesium. "And look for independent verification to ensure the safety and quality of the product," adds Amidor.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_67-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Magnesium is an essential mineral that plays an important role in your heart and bone health, energy metabolism and more. Additionally, it may help reduce your risk of diabetes and help manage your blood pressure. The best way to get enough magnesium on a daily basis is through diet, but magnesium supplementation may also be helpful in certain circumstances. If you’re considering a supplement, talk to a healthcare practitioner first to figure out the right form and dosage for you. &lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s best to try to get enough magnesium through food alone. However, if you’re not able to meet the recommendations, taking a daily magnesium supplement might be safe as long as you don’t consume too much. There are also several types of magnesium, and some may be more appropriate for you and your specific situation than others. Your best bet is to have a conversation with a healthcare practitioner, like a registered dietitian, to determine the right dosage and type for you.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Creative experience might enhance brain health, which could slow down the brain's ageing. That's according to a study by a group of international scientists across 13 countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found that creative activities, like dance classes – the tango proved particularly effective – or art classes or music lessons or a hobby like gaming, had a positive impact on an  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/artificial-intelligence" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73092" data-postid="179325" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;artificial intelligence&lt;/a&gt; (AI) "brain clock".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And the more the participant practised their art form, the "younger" their brain clocks were.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/superager-brains-defy-cognitive-decline-we-finally-know-their-secret"&gt;'Superager' Brains Defy Cognitive Decline.

They compare neuroimaging, electrophysiological, or neuromolecular data to normal brain patterns across the lifespan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, by using a brain clock we can try to understand what makes a brain more resilient and what ages it faster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What did you want to find out?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We wanted to know whether being creative isn't just fun or emotionally rewarding, but actually biologically good for the brain. There's growing &lt;a href="https://www.artsandhealth.ie/research-evaluation/who-report-what-is-the-evidence-on-the-role-of-the-arts-in-improving-health-and-well-being-a-scoping-review/"&gt;evidence&lt;/a&gt; that arts engagement supports wellbeing, but we still lack a solid understanding of how creativity might shape brain health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09548963.2021.1910492"&gt;believe&lt;/a&gt; that art is too mysterious and intangible to study scientifically or to make a biological difference. We wanted to challenge both ideas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Could creative experiences, something that feels joyful and deeply human, also be measured in the brain? Could they help delay brain ageing in the same way that physical exercise helps the body?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our study tested whether creativity might influence the brain clock. If your brain clock says you're younger than your real age, it means your brain is functioning more efficiently than expected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How did you go about it?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We collected data from almost 1,400 people across different countries. Some were expert tango dancers, musicians, visual artists or gamers. Others were non-experts matched for age, education and gender from the same countries. Non-experts had no previous experience in the different disciplines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We recorded their brain activity using techniques called &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diagnostics/17218-magnetoencephalography-meg"&gt;magnetoencephalography&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://sapienlabs.org/lab-talk/what-does-the-eeg-signal-measure/"&gt;electroencephalography&lt;/a&gt;. They can be used to measure brain activity in real time. Then we trained computer models (machine learning models) to create a brain clock for each participant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/spark-into-space-comp"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg" alt="Win a $10,000 Space Coast Adventure Holiday" class="alignnone wp-image-177074 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro.jpg 844w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The models can be trained in less than an hour. The challenge was to collect the data – from Argentina to Poland – of hundreds of participants. That would be impossible without the collaboration of many researchers and institutes worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So we used the brain clocks to predict each person's age from their data. If someone's predicted brain age was lower than their real age, it meant their brain was ageing more slowly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, we used something called &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/subjects/biophysical-models"&gt;biophysical modelling&lt;/a&gt;. These models are "digital brains", and we used these virtual brains to understand the biology behind creativity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem with the machine learning models (the "brain clocks") is, although they can learn patterns in the data to make predictions, they can't reproduce real brain activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The biophysical models, on the other hand, are "real" brains in a digital world, that is, they are a mirrored copy of the brain inside a computer. These models use detailed biological and physical rules to simulate how a brain works. So, they aren't AI models. They're "generative models" that can, in fact, generate brain activity from mathematical equations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While brain clocks can be used to measure brain health (accelerated or delayed brain ageing), the biophysical models can explain why creativity is associated with better brain health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What did you find out?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across every creative field, the pattern was strikingly consistent: creativity was linked to a younger-looking brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tango dancers showed brains that appeared more than seven years younger than their chronological age. Musicians and visual artists had brains about five to six years younger. Gamers, about four years younger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_179334" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-179334" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/man_gaming_brain_health_642.jpg" alt="man playing computer games" class="wp-image-179334 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/man_gaming_brain_health_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/man_gaming_brain_health_642-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-179334" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Gamers had brains four years younger, on average. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MAEP5HyXB1c/"&gt;RyanKing999/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also ran a smaller experiment where non-experts trained for just 30 hours in the strategy video game &lt;a href="https://starcraft2.blizzard.com/en-us/"&gt;StarCraft II&lt;/a&gt; to see whether short-term creative learning could have similar effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even in the short-term experiment, after only 30 hours of creative training, participants' brain clocks ticked backward, showing a reduction of brain age between two and three years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The more people practised their art, the stronger the effect. And it didn't matter what kind of art it was. It could be dancing, painting, music, or gaming. All helped key brain areas work better together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These areas, important for focus and learning, usually &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-03209-x"&gt;age&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s44220-025-00502-7"&gt;first&lt;/a&gt;, but creativity seems to keep their connections stronger and more flexible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Creativity, we found, protects brain areas that are vulnerable to ageing and makes brain communication more efficient (similar to building more, larger, and higher-quality roads to communicate between cities within a country).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why is this important?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The arts and sciences, often seen as opposites, are in fact allies. Creativity shapes not only culture but biology. Our study reframes creativity as a biological pathway to brain health and resilience, not only a cultural or psychological phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By showing that artistic engagement can delay brain ageing, this research helps us reimagine the role of creativity in education, public health, and ageing societies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the big picture, it expands our understanding of healthy ageing beyond disease prevention. It highlights creativity as a scalable, accessible and deeply human mechanism to sustain cognitive and emotional wellbeing across diverse populations and lifespans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So if you're wondering whether being creative is "good for you", the answer seems to be "yes". Scientifically, measurably, and beautifully so. Your next dance step, brush stroke, or musical note might just help your brain stay a little younger.&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/267797/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade"&gt;

It also shapes the community of microbes living in your gut and steers how your body responds to stress. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists wanted to know whether a &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/how-polyphenols-promote-heart-health-youthful-skin-and-a-healthy-waistline/"&gt;polyphenol‑rich&lt;/a&gt; juice made from black chokeberries (&lt;em&gt;Aronia melanocarpa&lt;/em&gt;) could help a human‑like gut ecosystem and the host’s metabolism stay steady when faced with an inflammatory challenge from a high‑fat, Western‑style diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They turned to a controlled animal model that carried a human gut microbiome. That design allowed researchers to test cause and effect with tight control of variables like diet, timing, and sampling. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The central question was simple: Did this berry juice support a healthier response when the diet became high in fat?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-aronia-juice-and-human-health"&gt;Aronia juice and human health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study tested whether giving polyphenol‑rich Aronia juice to animals harboring a human gut &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/human-microbiome-trillions-of-bacteria-unique-like-fingerprints/"&gt;microbiome&lt;/a&gt; would support the gut community and the host’s metabolism during a high‑fat challenge. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The focus covered both microbial composition and thousands of small molecules circulating in the blood that signal how the body is doing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers used germ‑free mice that were colonized with gut microbes from screened adult donors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two donors had similar body measurements but differed in inflammation status: one had a low‑inflammation profile and the other had a high‑inflammation profile, both at rest and after a fatty meal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team transplanted these microbes into germ‑free mice and raised a second generation to confirm that the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/video/revolutionizing-agriculture-through-microbiome-engineering-crop-modification/"&gt;human microbiome&lt;/a&gt; was established and remained stable. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mice formed two distinct gut communities that matched their respective human donors, and their blood chemistry also separated into low‑ and high‑inflammation patterns before any treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-the-study-was-done"&gt;How the study was done&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The feeding trial lasted eight weeks. The mice drank either Aronia juice or a sugar‑matched control beverage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For two weeks, they ate standard chow along with their assigned drink. For the next six weeks, they switched to a high‑fat diet while continuing the same drink. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The design kept sugar intake comparable between groups to isolate the effect of polyphenols.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team collected stool samples to track which bacteria gained or lost ground and drew blood to profile thousands of metabolites using liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_chromatography%E2%80%93mass_spectrometry" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;LC‑MS&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They identified bacterial groups with &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/16S_ribosomal_RNA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;16S rRNA&lt;/a&gt; gene sequencing, a method that reads short genetic markers to map community membership and abundance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-aronia-juice-shifts-the-microbiome"&gt;Aronia juice shifts the microbiome&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the first two weeks on standard chow, Aronia juice nudged the gut community. The mice that drank the juice showed a small rise in overall species richness, also called alpha diversity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Certain bacterial groups became more abundant, including members of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eggerthellaceae" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eggerthellaceae&lt;/a&gt;, a family known for transforming plant polyphenols into smaller compounds that the host can use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The high‑fat diet then pushed the gut microbiome to reorganize, a shift scientists describe as a change in beta diversity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blood metabolites also moved in new directions under the high‑fat load. Aronia juice softened some of those changes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mice that drank the juice showed greater resistance to the high‑fat disruption than mice on the sugar‑matched control. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The starting microbiome still mattered: animals carrying the low‑inflammation donor’s microbiome stayed more resilient than those carrying the high‑inflammation donor’s &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/scientists-find-link-between-obesity-anxiety-and-gut-microbiome-changes/"&gt;microbiome&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-signals-in-the-blood"&gt;Signals in the blood&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blood chemistry added another layer of evidence. Aronia juice was linked to higher levels of phosphatidylcholines and related lipids. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These molecules are key parts of cell membranes, including the lining of the intestine that forms a barrier between gut contents and the bloodstream. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Healthy membrane composition supports a tighter barrier and reduces the chance that bacterial components leak into circulation and trigger inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After eight weeks, mice that drank Aronia juice also showed lower levels of trimethylamine‑N‑oxide (&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/trimethylamine-oxide" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;TMAO&lt;/a&gt;) compared with controls. TMAO forms when gut microbes process nutrients like choline and the liver converts the by‑products. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taken together, lower TMAO and higher phosphatidylcholines point to a shift in lipid handling that aligns with stronger barrier function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-food-microbes-and-aronia-juice"&gt;Food-microbes and Aronia juice&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In mice carrying the low‑inflammation microbiome, Aronia juice increased indoleacrylic acid, a molecule produced by specific bacteria from the amino acid tryptophan. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies link indoleacrylic acid with &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/drinking-tea-every-day-proven-studies-to-delay-biological-aging-in-humans/"&gt;antioxidant activity&lt;/a&gt;, anti‑inflammatory signaling, and support for gut barrier integrity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not every microbiome can make this molecule; only certain species carry the enzymes to produce this compound. The benefit depended on which microbes were present in the gut to begin with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-aronia-juice-and-future-human-study"&gt;Aronia juice and future human study&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The data fit a clear picture. This work sits within a controlled animal model using microbiomes from two human donors, which helps dissect mechanisms but does not capture the full diversity seen in people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study does not present Aronia juice as a cure‑all. Your microbiome helps determine how foods affect you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Polyphenol‑rich plants – berries like Aronia and &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/eating-just-a-handful-of-blueberries-every-day-can-boost-memory-and-make-you-smarter/"&gt;blueberries&lt;/a&gt;, colorful vegetables, and teas – offer more than vitamins. They also supply complex molecules that certain gut bacteria can convert into helpful compounds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A more diverse, balanced microbiome appears to handle dietary stress better, as shown by the low‑inflammation group’s response here. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While this study does not set a human dose of Aronia juice, it strengthens a broader idea in biology and nutrition: health reflects nutrients plus microbes working together, especially when the diet is high in fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full study was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/nutrition/articles/10.3389/fnut.2023.1244692/full" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Frontiers in Nutrition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 29 Oct 2025 03:15:48 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqgFBVV95cUxQUjR5ck9abWhYaERIcC1KdWhSVmlMNmJfZm56bzZMdXZfcWl4aFlCdkVFd0M1XzVMamNvS3hCeHFZd2NHN2JzeVBQWHhWdzFzVGFQbTZzcG5iSFV3aVlwQnBodjFBWERXdXdCVnozWnd0VkxvelN1VVhiODM2YXFGa1lzUTN5ZERLek1LQjZGSTUyMzE0TmhYV0FxbzBDMWVqdENJemhhUDNjZw</guid></item><item><title>富含维生素的水果，称为“黑金” ，可降低血糖和血压- Earth.com</title><link>https://www.earth.com/news/aronia-melanocarpa-fruit-juice-black-chockberryregulates-blood-sugar-pressure/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page_content__AwOj6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Food does more than fill you up.

The benefit depended on which microbes were present in the gut to begin with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-aronia-juice-and-future-human-study"&gt;Aronia juice and future human study&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The data fit a clear picture. This work sits within a controlled animal model using microbiomes from two human donors, which helps dissect mechanisms but does not capture the full diversity seen in people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study does not present Aronia juice as a cure‑all. Your microbiome helps determine how foods affect you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Polyphenol‑rich plants – berries like Aronia and &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/eating-just-a-handful-of-blueberries-every-day-can-boost-memory-and-make-you-smarter/"&gt;blueberries&lt;/a&gt;, colorful vegetables, and teas – offer more than vitamins. They also supply complex molecules that certain gut bacteria can convert into helpful compounds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A more diverse, balanced microbiome appears to handle dietary stress better, as shown by the low‑inflammation group’s response here. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While this study does not set a human dose of Aronia juice, it strengthens a broader idea in biology and nutrition: health reflects nutrients plus microbes working together, especially when the diet is high in fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full study was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/nutrition/articles/10.3389/fnut.2023.1244692/full" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Frontiers in Nutrition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 29 Oct 2025 03:15:48 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqAFBVV95cUxQN0h2cnpCb0xJeXRzM0tscUZoeGxBY0hBWXhxNTdEQU16VzZiXzczYVFYalB1QjZWZ2thU3JoZWlvUTduQTFMTnZPSi1CeVRIZlJJUENmWjZvc09QaFdkVFZQZlcwVk0wRG8wME9nNUQtZmdlV29OUHdCMHNuM01pc1lnRjJwNjVDSEJMeVIxUW1xZnVob0ZtN0o4MGswLWw3Zl9NM210NUw</guid></item><item><title>营养师挑选您应该吃的# 1碳水化合物来改善胆固醇- EatingWell</title><link>https://www.eatingwell.com/best-carb-for-better-cholesterol-11839084</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-callout--summary mntl-sc-block-universal-callout--tips mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-summary callout--bordered" data-text="Key Points" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;
&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dietitians recommend black beans as a top carb for supporting healthy cholesterol.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;They’re rich in fiber, plant-based protein, resistant starches and phytochemicals, which help to lower total cholesterol.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Black beans are affordable, versatile and convenient, making them easy to add to a variety of dishes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Think all carbs are bad? Think again. Despite their undeserved reputation as being “unhealthy,” the right carbs are highly nutritious and can even &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/small-habits-for-heart-health-11796620" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;support heart health&lt;/a&gt;. “Carbs provide energy and key nutrients like fiber, vitamins and minerals,” says &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/author/lauren-manaker/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Lauren Manaker, M.S., RDN, LD, CLEC&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When choosing carbs, complex options rich in fiber—like whole grains, legumes, fruits and vegetables—are your best bet. They aid digestion, provide steady energy and help support heart health, including &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/fiber-foods-to-help-lower-cholesterol-11770161" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;lowering cholesterol&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Black beans are a cholesterol superstar because they’re packed with soluble fiber, which binds cholesterol in the gut and helps remove it from the body,” says &lt;a href="https://www.brannoninbalancenutrition.com/about" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Brannon Blount, M.S., RDN, LDN&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Research consistently shows that a diet high in fiber—especially soluble fiber—can reduce total and LDL (“bad”) cholesterol, making it a key tool for managing cholesterol levels.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; One cup of cooked black beans provides an impressive 15 grams of fiber, or around 54% of the recommended daily value.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Since most people don’t get enough fiber, adding black beans to your meals is an easy and convenient way to help meet your needs.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Black beans are very low in total fat and contain zero saturated fat, making them an excellent choice for a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/15297/our-top-15-heart-healthy-foods/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;heart-healthy diet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Research shows that dietary patterns lower in saturated fat are linked to a reduced risk of high cholesterol and heart disease.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The American Heart Association recommends keeping saturated fat intake to no more than 6% of total calories—especially for individuals with heart disease or high cholesterol.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;For someone eating a 2,000-calorie diet, that’s about 13 grams per day.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; By making black beans the main ingredient in your meals, you can reap the benefits of fiber, complex carbohydrates and protein—all without adding extra saturated fat.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Prefer to keep meat in your diet? You don’t have to give it up entirely. Even partially replacing meat with plant-based proteins can support healthy cholesterol levels.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Dishes like tacos, stir-fries, casseroles and chili are perfect ways to enjoy some meat while still getting the benefits of plant-based protein.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Black beans also contain resistant starch, a type of prebiotic linked to lower cholesterol.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;“Many quality carbs act as prebiotics, feeding the good bacteria in your gut. A healthy gut microbiome is linked to lower cholesterol and better heart health,” says Manaker. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Resistant starches feed beneficial bacteria, producing byproducts like short-chain fatty acids that can reduce cholesterol production in the liver and help lower total cholesterol. They also help control post-meal blood sugar and increase feelings of fullness, which can prevent overeating and further support healthy cholesterol levels.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Black beans are packed with phytochemicals—plant compounds that protect cells, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/80991/10-ways-to-reduce-inflammation/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;reduce inflammation&lt;/a&gt; and support heart health. They’re &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-flavonol-rich-foods-11783068" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;rich in polyphenols&lt;/a&gt;, flavonoids, anthocyanins and tannins, all linked to better heart health. Their deep color comes from anthocyanins, making black beans one of the highest sources of these compounds among beans and lentils.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; These antioxidants help fight inflammation by reducing oxidative stress, both of which are key contributors to heart disease, says Manaker. While the effect is indirect, supporting these markers can also &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8758/high-cholesterol-diet-guidelines/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;maintain healthy cholesterol levels&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In addition to being rich in nutrients that support healthy cholesterol levels, black beans are convenient, economical and versatile. Whether you buy them dried or canned, they’re easy to incorporate into any eating plan.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For convenience, canned black beans are ideal since they’re ready to use. Simply open a can, rinse the beans under cool water to reduce sodium and toss them into any dish. If you prefer &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7742530/how-to-cook-dried-beans/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;dried beans&lt;/a&gt;, cook a large batch ahead of time. This allows you to control sodium and season them with your favorite herbs and spices.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Black beans can be added to a variety of dishes, including salads, soups, tacos, casseroles or even &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/280185/breakfast-beans-with-microwave-poached-egg/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;scrambled eggs&lt;/a&gt;. “They’re versatile, budget-friendly and an easy swap for higher-fat ingredients to make meals heart-smart,” adds Brannon.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Manaker also recommends using black beans in creative ways, including desserts and dips. For example, they can serve as a base for &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/black-bean-brownies-8761128" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;brownies&lt;/a&gt; or muffins, adding moisture and fiber without a strong bean flavor.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_51-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_52-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Reducing foods high in saturated fat, like butter, cream, fried foods and fatty meats, is also essential for maintaining healthy cholesterol levels. Instead, prioritize foods high in &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/saturated-fat-unsaturated-fat-whats-the-difference-11751825" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;unsaturated fats&lt;/a&gt;, such as avocado, extra-virgin olive oil, nuts, seeds and fatty fish, which help improve cholesterol and support overall heart health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_55-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Although carbs often get a bad reputation, they can play an important role in supporting heart health. Dietitians recommend black beans as a top carb for maintaining healthy cholesterol because they’re rich in fiber, plant-based protein, resistant starches and phytochemicals—and they’re naturally free of cholesterol-raising saturated fat. On top of that, black beans are affordable, convenient and versatile, making them a clear winner for both your meals and your heart.&lt;br&gt;

Whether supporting muscle and nerve function, or strengthening bones and aiding energy production, our bodies rely on magnesium every day. And despite this, many people don’t get nearly enough of it. Why? Because many of us aren’t even aware of the natural sources of magnesium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the National Institutes of Health, magnesium is “widely distributed in plant and animal foods,” but refining and processing of foods often strips it away. That’s why, in everyday diets, especially ones that rely heavily on processed and refined products, it’s surprisingly easy to fall short of your magnesium needs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Often when we think of magnesium-rich foods, we might picture familiar items like spinach, almonds, or whole grains. But there are plenty of less obvious, natural sources hiding in our regular diet — foods you perhaps never considered. Discovering these surprising options can not only make boosting magnesium intake easier, but it also makes it tastier and more varied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this guide, we’ll explore 10 surprising natural sources of magnesium — foods you may not have realized contribute significantly — and we’ll learn how to consume them to maximize absorption and benefit your health. Whether you’re a vegetarian, omnivore, busy professional, or just someone who wants to boost their mineral intake without relying on supplements, these food-based options offer real, practical ways to help meet your magnesium needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Wed, 29 Oct 2025 01:48:52 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi_AFBVV95cUxPVXV4YzFSS2szX29IdVFxTlVqUmc0cWpreFQ0SnZZcEZodDRKV19FUk9TYm5CVHppLW1EZEtaYXpoUzZkaUl2QkZrZC1ER3RGTDdDMk9OREpYbHMzV1FpSk0zR29ZNjhfbG1rS2Z6VnF1bGh1Y3B2c2lkNlk5NTBzMzJrLWkwdndld2NrQ2wyRDR2NE04d1RWdTNtOG5ndjlLRF9LYlpJeXN1MkJodmxNQ1NQQnhlOFc0LV9IRzN5MzNScUE3ZVYtNmVZR1pkWTYzenUtT0dSV29icmVkYjNyVU15aGpXRVpWem00X2JFWFd4NHRwTkpQVmV3Um_SAYQCQVVfeXFMUDZycXlhMmRUQjNPNVNuWVFtWDdJVWtRTHVaYzB4STZGd19oWjA4NWVmWW1RZ3FwWjVCSGhSRDVUVURRNkRQSGVQeS1OX21EZVJwT1p4YnQ2Y1hzT2hEWDJmVXMzNkEtT2RWaHcxdUdHOFl5OFkxNUF6c0tiS2NKTUhWMk9jeVZiaHpRQTJkNVFiMFBJQ3hlY28wX203eWloeTFuZ1FnRjcxdkd2R3pueFRWSWFvMk1YWGtxS2hKbENFSVFyeTRaRGxmUmczQjIzN2prU3M2NnZJSUViaFlWTEtwUGd1Qk56TWt4NVZYUjdFaW1TbmhhcmNOVHVqYzg5RjlyTkI</guid></item><item><title>这些医生希望打破医学上的羞耻和指责的循环- NPR</title><link>https://www.npr.org/2025/10/28/nx-s1-5589220/shame-competence-medicine-doctors-blame-patients</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="storytext" class="storytext storylocation linkLocation"&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;The distress that Will Bynum later recognized as shame settled over him nearly immediately.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Bynum, then in his second year of residency training as a family medicine physician, was wrapping up a long shift when he was called into an emergency delivery. To save the baby's life, he used a vacuum device, which applies suction to assist with rapid delivery.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The baby emerged unharmed. But the mother suffered a severe vaginal tear that required surgical repair by an obstetrician. Soon afterward, Bynum retreated to an empty hospital room, trying to process his feelings about the unexpected complication.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"I didn't want to see anybody. I didn't want anybody to find me," said Bynum, now an&lt;a href="https://fmch.duke.edu/personnel/will-bynum-md" target="_blank"&gt; associate professor of family medicine&lt;/a&gt; at Duke University School of Medicine in North Carolina. "It was a really primitive response."&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Shame is a common and highly uncomfortable human emotion. In the years since, Bynum has become a&lt;a href="https://journals.lww.com/academicmedicine/fulltext/2025/07000/how_shame_shaped_me__exploring_the_impact_of_shame.17.aspx" target="_blank"&gt; leading voice&lt;/a&gt; among clinicians and researchers who argue that the intense crucible of medical training can amplify shame in future doctors.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;He is now part of an emerging effort to teach what he describes as "&lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(24)02269-4/abstract" target="_blank"&gt;shame competence&lt;/a&gt;" to medical school students and practicing physicians. While shame can't be eliminated, Bynum and his research colleagues maintain that related skills and practices can reduce the culture of shame and foster a healthier way to engage with it.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Without this approach, they argue, tomorrow's doctors won't recognize and address the emotion in themselves and others. And thus, they risk transmitting it to their patients, even inadvertently, which may&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7613638/pdf/JEP-28-854.pdf" target="_blank"&gt; worsen their health&lt;/a&gt;. Shaming patients can backfire, Bynum said, making them defensive and leading to isolation and sometimes substance use.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Blame the patients&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The U.S. political environment presents an additional obstacle to changing the culture of shame. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and other top Trump administration health officials have&lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/maha-movement-chronically-ill-blame-game/" target="_blank"&gt; publicly blamed&lt;/a&gt; autism, diabetes, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and other chronic issues in large part on the lifestyle choices of people with the conditions — or their parents.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;For instance, FDA Commissioner Marty Makary suggested in a Fox News interview that more diabetes could be treated with cooking classes instead of "&lt;a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/robert-f-kennedy-jrs-fda-commissioner-marty-makarty-suggests-diabetics-get-cooking-classes-over-insulin/" target="_blank"&gt;just throwing insulin at people&lt;/a&gt;." &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Even before the political shift, that attitude was reflected at doctors' offices as well. A 2023 study found that&lt;a href="https://www.diabetesresearchclinicalpractice.com/article/S0168-8227(23)00590-9/abstract" target="_blank"&gt; one-third of physicians reported feeling repulsed&lt;/a&gt; when treating patients with Type 2 diabetes, which is sometimes linked to obesity. About 44% viewed those patients as lacking motivation to make lifestyle changes, while 39% said they tended to be lazy.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We don't like feeling shame. We want to avoid it. It's very uncomfortable," said&lt;a href="https://www.fammed.wisc.edu/directory/9cc3f9cc/" target="_blank"&gt; Michael Jaeb&lt;/a&gt;, a nurse at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, who has&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38500241/" target="_blank"&gt; conducted a review&lt;/a&gt; of related studies, published in 2024. And if the source of shame is from the clinician, the patient may ask, "'Why would I go back?' In some cases, that patient may generalize that to the whole health care system."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Indeed, some patients, like Christa Reed have avoided doctors because of this. Reed dropped out of regular medical care for two decades, weary of weight-related lectures. "I was told when I was pregnant that my morning sickness was because I was a plus-size, overweight woman," she said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Except for a few urgent medical issues, such as an infected cut, Reed avoided health care providers. "Because going into a doctor for an annual visit would be pointless," said the now 45-year-old Minneapolis-area wedding photographer. "They would only just tell me to lose weight."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Then, last year, severe jaw pain drove Reed to seek specialty care. A routine blood pressure check showed a sky-high reading, sending her to the emergency room. "They said, 'We don't know how you're walking around normal,'" she recounted.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Since then, Reed has found supportive physicians with expertise in nutrition. Her blood pressure remains under control with medication. She's also nearly 100 pounds below her heaviest weight, and she hikes, bikes, and lifts weights to build muscle.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;A "masochistic" work ethic&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://providerwire.com/psychiatry-physician/california/camp-pendleton/savannah-woodward-1063946721" target="_blank"&gt;Savannah Woodward&lt;/a&gt;, a California psychiatrist, is among a group of physicians trying to bring attention to the detrimental effects of shame and develop strategies to prevent and mitigate it. While this effort is in the early stages, she co-led a session on the spiral of shame at the American Psychiatric Association's annual meeting in May.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;If physicians don't acknowledge shame in themselves, they can risk depression,&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1931720425000285?via%3Dihub" target="_blank"&gt; burnout&lt;/a&gt;, sleeping difficulties, and other ripple effects that erode patient care, she said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We often don't talk about how important the human connection is in medicine," Woodward said. "But if your doctor is burned out or feeling like they don't deserve to be your doctor, patients feel that. They can tell."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In a survey conducted this year, 37% of graduating students&lt;a href="https://www.aamc.org/data-reports/students-residents/report/graduation-questionnaire-gq" target="_blank"&gt; reported feeling publicly embarrassed&lt;/a&gt; at some point in medical school, and nearly 20% described public humiliation, according to an annual survey by the Association of American Medical Colleges.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Medical students and physician residents are already prone to perfectionism, along with an almost "masochistic" work ethic, as Woodward described it. Then they're run a gantlet of exams and years of training, amid constant scrutiny and with patients' lives on the line.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;During training, physicians work in teams and make presentations to teaching faculty about a patient's medical issues and their recommended treatment approach. "You trip over your words. You miss things. You get things out of order. You go blank," Bynum said. And then shame creeps in, he said, leading to other debilitating thoughts, such as "'I'm no good at this. I'm an idiot. Everyone around me would have done this so much better.'"&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Yet shame remains "a crack in your armor, that you don't want to show," said&lt;a href="https://healthcare.utah.edu/find-a-doctor/karly-ann-pippitt" target="_blank"&gt; Karly Pippitt&lt;/a&gt;, a family medicine physician at the University of Utah who has taught medical students about the potential for shame as part of a broader ethics and humanities course.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"You're taking care of a human life," she said. "Heaven forbid that you act like you're not capable or you show fear."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Stop the shame cycle&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;When teaching students about shame, the goal is to help future physicians recognize the emotion in themselves and others, so they don't perpetuate the cycle, Pippitt said. "If you felt shamed throughout your medical education, it normalizes that as the experience," she said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Above all, physicians-in-training can work to reframe their mindset when they receive a poor grade or struggle to master a new skill, said Woodward, the California psychiatrist. Instead of believing that they've failed as a physician, they can focus on what they got wrong and ways to improve.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Last year, Bynum started teaching Duke physicians about shame competence, beginning with roughly 20 OB-GYN physician residents. This year, he launched a larger initiative with&lt;a href="https://www.shamelab.org/home" target="_blank"&gt; The Shame Lab&lt;/a&gt;, a research and training partnership between Duke University and the University of Exeter in England that he co-founded, to reach about 300 people across Duke's Department of Family Medicine and Community Health, including faculty and physician residents.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;This sort of training is rare among Duke OB-GYN resident&lt;a href="https://obgyn.duke.edu/personnel/canice-dancel-md" target="_blank"&gt; Canice Dancel&lt;/a&gt;'s peers in other programs. Dancel, who completed the training, now strives to support students as they learn skills such as how to suture. She hopes they will pay that approach forward in "a chain reaction of being kind to each other."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;More than a decade after Bynum experienced that stressful emergency delivery, he still regrets that shame kept him from checking on the mother as he usually would following delivery. "I was too scared of how she was going to react to me," he said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It was a little devastating," he said, when a colleague later told him that the mother wished he had stopped by. "She had passed a message along to thank me for saving her baby's life. If I had just given myself a chance to hear that, that would have really helped in my recovery, to be forgiven."&lt;/p&gt;

This versatile dish is perfect for a cozy dinner, and can be easily adjusted to suit your preferences. To kick up the heat, add a chopped jalapeño to the veggie mixture. You can swap out the rotisserie chicken for another protein like leftover steak, or make it vegetarian by using no-chicken broth and subbing tofu in place of the chicken.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This fiber-rich soup is an easy, healthy dinner when you’re pressed for time.

Frozen sweet potatoes and collard greens keep the prep to a minimum, but if you have a little extra time on your hands, fresh veggies work just as well. Serve with crusty bread for dunking.

"A good example of this is the habit of wearing a seatbelt. Most people don't anticipate getting into an accident, but if it happens, wearing a seatbelt decreases the risk of serious injury or death."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You may have been doing yard work for &lt;em&gt;almost &lt;/em&gt;as long as you've buckled your seatbelt. In fact, mowing the lawn may have been your first job as an older teen. However, emergency room physicians note that it's easy to feel so confident in your ability to do outdoor chores that you forget it's even more critical to maintain safe habits than to have a pristine lawn.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ER doctors reveal the two things they wish you'd stop doing in your front yard and the easy ways to cut these habits from your routine.

"Over time, these decisions help people avoid adding increased risk to their lives where simple activities can cause serious harm."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On the other hand, he notes that bad habits—like not wearing the right shoes or not protecting your eyes—increase the likelihood of injuries, even if you haven't experienced them yet.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/best-habit-for-longevity-according-to-a-doctor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The One Habit a Longevity Expert Is Begging Everyone Over 50 To Adopt ASAP;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;The One Habit a Longevity Expert Is Begging Everyone Over 50 To Adopt ASAP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Worst Shoes To Wear When Mowing the Lawn—and What To Wear Instead&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;ER doctors aren't flip-flopping on this advice: "&lt;a href="https://parade.com/shopping/amazon-fitory-flip-flops-sale" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Flip-flops;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Flip-flops&lt;/a&gt; and sandals lack the grip needed for pushing a heavy machine over uneven terrain, dramatically increasing your risk of slipping and falling onto or in front of the running mower," warns &lt;a href="https://doctors.hackensackmeridianhealth.org/provider/harry-kopolovich/1680871" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Harry Kopolovich, MD, MBA, FAAEM, FAEMS;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Harry Kopolovich, MD, MBA, FAAEM, FAEMS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the chair of emergency medicine at Hackensack Meridian Jersey Shore University Medical Center.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As you may know from the unpleasant experience of wiping out when wearing flip-flops on a slippery floor, they aren't the sturdiest shoes on the sales rack. Lawnmowers have additional hazards that floors do not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you slip on wet grass or stumble on uneven ground, your foot can slide under the mower deck," Dr. Kopolovich continues. "The blade can amputate your toes or a significant portion of your foot as it spins at more than 200 mph. At this speed, small rocks, twigs or pieces of metal are turned into high-velocity projectiles."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Since open-toed shoes offer zero protection, he reveals that these projectile objects can easily break the delicate bones in your feet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be honest, the solution to this one is probably right next to your flip-flops in your closet. "Sturdy shoes with non-slip soles should be worn," Dr. Lee advises. "Work boots or hiking boots serve as good examples of shoes that can protect feet when operating a lawnmower." &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/worst-habit-for-eye-health-according-to-ophthalmologists" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The Common Habit That Could Be Damaging Your Vision, According to Ophthalmologists;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;The Common Habit That Could Be Damaging Your Vision, According to Ophthalmologists&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Worst Lawnmower Habit for Eye Health and How To Avoid It&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eye injuries may not have made the top two most common injuries in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29395756/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:American Journal of Emergency Medicine;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;American Journal of Emergency Medicine&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;/em&gt;report. Still, ER doctors emphasize it's crucial not to overlook how poor yard work habits can alter your vision—sometimes permanently.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"There are multiple risks involved with mowing without eye protection," Dr. Conroy warns. "Most commonly, sometimes the mower can produce flying debris that could strike and injure your eye. In addition, at times, fertilizers and chemicals that have been applied to the lawn can become airborne and irritate the eyes."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To avoid these injuries, emergency room doctors suggest protecting your peepers. However, you don't want just any old pair of goggles—and sunglasses certainly won't cut it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"It is important when picking a pair of safety goggles or glasses to choose one that provides certified protection against impact as well as chemical exposure," Dr. Conroy says. "Additionally, choosing a pair that is rated as ‘anti-fog’ is helpful to minimize any potential obstruction."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Kopolovich advises people to look for an "ANSI Z87.1" rating on their eyewear, which indicates it provides impact protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Typically, it's stamped on the frame or lens," he says. "They can typically be purchased at hardware or home improvement stores. You can also purchase a wrap-around style, which protects your eyes from debris coming from the front and the sides."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/hip-flexor-stretches-for-people-over-50" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The One Simple Stretch Physical Therapists Want Everyone Over 50 To Do Daily;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;The One Simple Stretch Physical Therapists Want Everyone Over 50 To Do Daily&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;More Yard Work Safety Tips&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Covering your feet and eyes when mowing the lawn is crucial. However, emergency doctors wish people knew a few more things before heading out to do yard work. They share five more tips to help you stay safe and avoid the ER when maintaining your outdoor oasis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;1. Dress for safety success&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mowing the lawn can make you sweat, but it's better to need a shower post-chores than an ER visit. Wearing the pants—and other layers of protection—is important.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"In addition to eye protection and sturdy shoes with non-slip soles, pants should be worn while mowing the lawn," Dr. Lee stresses. "When operating a gas-powered mower, earplugs or muffs that provide adequate noise reduction should be used to prevent hearing loss."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He says that work gloves can protect your hands from debris and blisters that can form when you push the lawnmower for long periods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;2. Don't DIY debris removal&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Kaplan says one of the most common mistakes that lands people in his ER is attempting to remove debris from under their lawnmower. The consequences can be devastating.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"This often results in finger and hand lacerations and amputations," He reports. "Never place your hands near the lawnmower blades. Always ensure a lawnmower has been turned off and you have clear visibility to examine the blades and engine."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;3. Check your form&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good form isn't just important when working out. In fact, all of that core work you do at the gym can pay dividends if you tap into it when doing yard work.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Walk upright and engage your core," Dr. Kopolovich advises. "Let the mower's power do the work—you are there to guide it. Avoid hunching over. When turning, take small steps instead of twisting your spine to prevent back strain."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;4. Beware of burn risks&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Burns are also common when mowing the lawn. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"It is easy to forget how hot the engine can get from running as well as just being out in the sun," Dr. Conroy shares. "This is a risk for children as well, who might be playing around the mower after it's done and touch a hot part of the engine without realizing it. The best advice is either putting the mower away safely once done, or putting it somewhere where there are no children or pets."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On that note...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;5. Do a scene check&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We know that you may want your kids or grandkids to see you mow the lawn as a way to set an example. However, have it be from a distance (they also shouldn't "help" you mow the lawn).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A person operating a lawnmower may not be aware that a child is nearby and may accidentally run them over," Dr. Lee says. "Allowing a child to sit with a person operating a riding lawnmower introduces the risk of the child falling and being injured by the mower blade.  Objects launched by a lawn mower or weed trimmer can injure anyone who happens to be nearby."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He adds that you'll also want to check your work area for a few inanimate objects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Before mowing, inspect the lawn to assure it is clear of rocks, sticks or other objects," Dr. Lee recommends. "A lawn should not be mowed when wet, as it is easier to slip and fall, especially when pushing a lawn mower. Make sure the scene is safe."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Up Next:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/best-exercise-for-back-pain-over-50" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Related: Want To Prevent Back Pain Over 50?

        &lt;p&gt;Research out today finds that a substantial portion of people have a sensitivity to gluten or wheat but don’t have celiac disease.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scientists in the UK and elsewhere reviewed dozens of studies conducted across the globe. They estimate that about one in every ten people worldwide report having a condition called non-celiac gluten/wheat sensitivity, or NCGWS. They also found that people with NCGWS are more likely to have other health issues, including anxiety and irritable bowel syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The findings highlight that “NCGWS is both common and linked to a significant emotional and psychological burden,” lead author Mohamed Shiha, a gastroenterologist at the University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust, told Gizmodo.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;A systematic look&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Various studies in recent years have tried to assess the toll of NCGWS. But according to Shiha, theirs is the first to systematically pool together and evaluate this data to provide reliable figures on the worldwide prevalence of the condition.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;They ultimately analyzed 25 studies conducted between 2014 and 2024 across 16 countries, collectively involving nearly 50,000 adults. Overall, they found that the global rate of self-reported NCGWS was 10.3%, though this could vary widely between countries. In the UK, for instance, the rate was 23%, while in Chile, it was 0.3%. About 5% of Americans reported having NCGWS, though this estimate is based on a single study.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The most common symptoms associated with NCGWS were gastrointestinal and included bloating, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. But some people also reported symptoms like fatigue, joint pains, and headaches. Women were more likely to report having NCGWS, and NCGWS was more common in people with depression, anxiety, and IBS. Less than half of people with the condition (40%) reported sticking to a gluten-free diet as a result.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The team’s findings were &lt;a href="https://gut.bmj.com/lookup/doi/10.1136/gutjnl-2025-336304"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; Tuesday in the journal &lt;em&gt;Gut&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;A broad umbrella&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;While celiac disease can be screened for with a simple blood test, there is no standard criteria or reliable markers for diagnosing NCGWS. And it seems to be a complex condition with no single, unifying cause, the authors say.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“Our findings suggest that NCGWS is an umbrella term that describes a broad group of individuals with wheat or gluten-related symptoms that often stem from different underlying mechanisms, ranging from gut–brain interaction disorders like IBS to psychological and social factors, rather than a single, uniform biological condition,” Shiha said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In some cases, it could be akin to a social contagion. Rising public awareness and media attention might influence how “people interpret their symptoms,” he explained. In other cases, NCGWS could be getting mixed up with other conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“Most cases may not be directly related to gluten or wheat themselves but rather overlap with irritable bowel syndrome and other gut–brain interaction disorders such as functional dyspepsia,” Shiha said. “The significant association we found with IBS, anxiety, and depression supports this hypothesis.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Just last week, a review in the Lancet &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(25)01533-8/abstract"&gt;presented&lt;/a&gt; evidence that most people with a professed gluten sensitivity are actually more likely to be sensitive to fermentable carbohydrates (FODMAPs) or to other wheat ingredients. This review also argued some cases could be caused by a nocebo effect, or the mere expectation that eating gluten will cause harm—a finding echoed by a small clinical trial &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/gluten-could-be-wrongly-blamed-for-americans-stomach-troubles-2000632584"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; earlier this July.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Whatever the causes, more should be done to properly diagnose and treat these cases, the authors say. To that end, the team is working on creating clearer, symptom-based criteria for identifying NCGWS. “We also want to explore how to best manage these symptoms without resorting to unnecessary restrictive diets, which can affect quality of life and nutrition,” Shiha said.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WE have been plunged into autumn gloominess, especially now the clocks have gone back. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The darker evenings can affect our &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/sleep/"&gt;sleep&lt;/a&gt;, mood and &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/energy/"&gt;energy&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="single__inline-module inline-module inline-module--newsletter aligncenter inline-module--thesun aligncenter wp-block-nypost-editor-newsletter" data-source-unit="Inline Newsletter Module Fabulous"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;figure id="attachment_37152674" class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-caption alignnone aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Tucking into a fruity crumble packed with berries could help lift your mood after the clocks go back&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Credit: Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;If you struggle moving into &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/autumn/"&gt;autumn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/winter/"&gt;winter&lt;/a&gt;, Laura Stott has these tips to help you. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EXTRA TIME IN BED: &lt;/strong&gt;Heading to bed just 30 minutes earlier as evenings draw in could benefit both your body and your mind. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/37062445/when-clocks-go-back-2025-date/" rel=""&gt;Darker nights and shorter days&lt;/a&gt; can derail our circadian rhythms – the body’s internal clock that regulates our mood, mindset, &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/health/37080651/why-tired-all-the-time-sleep/" rel=""&gt;sleep patterns and energy levels&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Gradually resetting your natural patterns by turning in earlier to sleep while it’s dark and then rising earlier to maximise daylight can help you adjust to any post-clock-change “&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/fabulous/2364499/jet-lag-symptoms-tips-cure/" rel=""&gt;jet-lag&lt;/a&gt;” effects. &lt;/p&gt;
		
		&lt;p class="article-readmore__content-clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		

&lt;figure id="attachment_37152663" class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-caption alignnone aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Getting outside for daylight first thing – for the likes of putting your bins out – can boost your mood and keep your body clock on track&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Credit: Getty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p id="outstream" class="nuk-ad-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TAKE THE BINS OUT: &lt;/strong&gt;It’s tempting to hit snooze on your alarm and pull the covers back over your head when it’s cold outside. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But ensuring &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/health/23411893/seasonal-affective-disorder-sad-symptoms-summer/" rel=""&gt;exposure to daylight&lt;/a&gt; straight after rising will boost your wellbeing as the light on your face tells your brain that it’s time to wake up and get going. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It also helps regulate the hormone melatonin, which keeps your body clock in check. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Getting outside first thing, even if it’s just to take out the rubbish or drink your first cuppa, could keep your natural rhythms consistent – even when it’s overcast or rainy. &lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EAT A CRUMBLE: &lt;/strong&gt;Scoffing a yummy fruit crumble could help you to combat low mood that can set in after the &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/clocks-change/"&gt;clocks change&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Studies show blueberries, raspberries and strawberries are top picks for those with seasonal slumps as they contain vitamin C and polyphenols, which encourage the production of mood-boosting hormones dopamine and serotonin. &lt;/p&gt;



		
						
						
		



&lt;p&gt;They also reduce the stress hormone cortisol. Keep a bag of berries in the freezer and chomp on them in desserts or smoothies, or as a winter-proofing wellbeing snack. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure id="attachment_37152665" class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-caption alignnone aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Brighten your mood and beat winter lethargy by adding a few mood-boosting houseplants to your home&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Credit: Getty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BUY A POT PLANT: &lt;/strong&gt;To push back against lethargy get some &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/37109916/plants-home-boost-wellbeing/" rel=""&gt;houseplants&lt;/a&gt;. Research shows that tending to them can make us feel brighter, so pop a pot or two on your windowsill to banish the blues. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Opt for indoor blooms that cope well with low light, such as a peace lily or colourful blooming cyclamen. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even colourful fake blooms can give you a boost. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE RIGHT GEAR: &lt;/strong&gt;We know regular exercise is a great way to feel and stay well all year round, but when it’s dark outside, it’s too easy to stay on the sofa instead of &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/fitness-and-exercise/" rel=""&gt;heading out for a run or to the gym&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Invest in the right gear – waterproofs, winter workout wear, thermal undies and socks – to motivate yourself to get moving whatever the &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/weather-2/"&gt;weather&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure id="attachment_37152704" class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-caption alignnone aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Beating the dark-evening blues can be as simple as meeting friends — socialising is proven to lift your mood and ease stress&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Credit: Getty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MEET  MATES: &lt;/strong&gt;Many of us don’t feel like socialising when it gets darker, but spending time with friends or family is proven to lift mood, reduce negative feelings and even reduce stress, so grab a &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/coffee/"&gt;coffee&lt;/a&gt; with your bestie, arrange a date night or join a club. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure id="attachment_37152667" class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-caption alignnone aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Studies show fairy lights really can make us happier by causing a release of the feel-good hormone dopamine&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Credit: Getty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GET  CRISTMAS LIGHTS UP: &lt;/strong&gt;It might only be October but getting the fairy lights up could be just the mood boost you need if the dark evenings are getting you down. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Studies show fairy lights really can make us happier by causing a release of the feel-good hormone dopamine. Just don’t get the rest of the decorations out yet. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ADJUST YOUR TIMERS:&lt;/strong&gt; Don’t forget to reset any timers that don’t update automatically, such as heating, smart lights and sound systems. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Heating and lighting that aren’t working in line with your new daily routine may make it harder for your body to adjust. &lt;/p&gt;

As of Tuesday, more than 5,000 cases had been reported. Two babies have died.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-5759ac" class="body-graf"&gt;Canada eliminated measles in 1998. The U.S. followed two years later, in 2000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b716d4" class="body-graf"&gt;There are multiple criteria for losing an official &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/measles-minnesota-double-us-outbreaks-vaccine-continue-rcna235144" target="_blank"&gt;measles elimination status&lt;/a&gt;, including the declines in vaccination rates observed in both countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1f6911" class="body-graf"&gt;But the most significant factor is having &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/data-investigation-childhood-vaccination-rates-are-backsliding-us-rcna228876" target="_blank"&gt;ongoing measles transmission&lt;/a&gt; for a full year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3dd5a3" class="body-graf"&gt;“To really say that a country has lost the status, it takes 12 months of continuous transmission with the same genotype and the same strain of the virus,” said Daniel Salas, an immunization expert with the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-245cd2" class="body-graf"&gt;Canada hit that mark this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f98515" class="body-graf"&gt;PAHO, which is part of the World Health Organization, is the group charged with determining whether a country in North, South or Central America has eliminated measles. It is set to convene next week in Mexico City to analyze measles data through the end of October.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f89502" class="body-graf"&gt;If a country loses its measles elimination status, “a corrective action plan will be requested to guide efforts to regain elimination,” according to a PAHO spokesman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-79b294" class="body-graf"&gt;It’s highly unlikely that the U.S. will lose its elimination status during the upcoming meeting, Salas said, because the ongoing outbreak began in January. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-0b234b" class="body-graf"&gt;In the U.S., at least &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;1,618 measles cases&lt;/a&gt; have been logged so far this year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The outbreak that threatens the U.S. elimination status began in West Texas in late January. More than 800 people in Texas and New Mexico have been infected, and the outbreak has spread to other states. Three people died, including two young girls. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-74ec86" class="body-graf"&gt;It will take time to analyze whether ongoing spread in Arizona, Utah and South Carolina is linked to the West Texas outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-456c5f" class="body-graf"&gt;The elimination of measles in the U.S. and Canada “was a huge achievement,” Salas said. “When we say that we sustain the elimination as a region, we are also acknowledging each country for their efforts.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-5d7af7" class="body-graf"&gt;The possibility of elimination status in Canada is “a wake-up call that we need to do better in vaccinating our general public so we don’t have outbreaks like this,” Dr. Isaac Bogoch, an infectious diseases expert at the University of Toronto, said in an&lt;a href="https://www.ctvnews.ca/toronto/video/2025/10/28/consequences-of-canada-losing-its-measles-free-status/" target="_blank"&gt; interview this week with CTV Television Network&lt;/a&gt; in Toronto. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-cae3d5" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/vaccines/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine&lt;/a&gt; is extraordinarily effective, according to the CDC. Two doses, usually given around ages 1 and 5, are 97% effective at preventing infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Tue, 28 Oct 2025 21:46:09 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipAFBVV95cUxQVThsd1JDdFpfMmV3WGZUeEpFcTFHenhLZ2VhQWZMU1lza0NZT2l2SUJ0Zlk0MlFGQkZvamFiZjRxZUkwZ0d4NGpqM01qSG9EQTZjVzNyaGtSN0lwd2w1bGc0TTVNNW5yZWlQWUtoYWk5MEtQWU1WaU5NUmlpalVabzFIZVBKb3h0Mk9FNUtkN0thWm91UDJRNkZGWW14d1JYUUw5RNIBVkFVX3lxTE9IRzVPZHV3NG1ReHkwZzVjZ2QzcFoxdFg0SHB6MTd2Q3pSOHBja2VvbWItTklsZUs3RzFzdVdYeDZQYmdtOHRrbm9fRWNIakRPek9LeEJn</guid></item></channel></rss>
