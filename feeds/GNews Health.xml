The &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/are-you-consuming-too-much-sugar" target="_blank"&gt;Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt; recommends avoiding “added sugars.” These are the sugars added to food products, including pasta sauces, crackers and drinks.

And the best way that we have to prevent measles is by vaccination.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/global-measles-vaccination/data-research/global-measles-outbreaks/index.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;rise&lt;/a&gt; in international cases comes soon after the US government laid off and put on leave thousands of USAID employees and contractors, many of whom worked in countries with high rates of measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;But the highly contagious virus is also on the rise in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;There were 285 cases of measles reported in the US last year. So far, there have been &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;378&lt;/a&gt; confirmed cases in the first few months of 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Some &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;309 of those cases&lt;/a&gt; are in Texas, which has had 40 hospitalizations and one death of an unvaccinated six-year-old girl from measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The outbreak has spread to New Mexico, where 42 cases, two hospitalizations, and one death of an unvaccinated adult have been &lt;a href="https://www.nmhealth.org/about/erd/ideb/mog/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;confirmed&lt;/a&gt;. It’s also spread to Oklahoma, which has &lt;a href="https://oklahoma.gov/health/health-education/acute-disease-service/rash-illness/measles.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; four probable cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Officials suspect the true number of cases is higher; typically, there are one to two deaths per 1,000 cases. The under-reporting means “we’re not at a point where we know where all of our cases are”, Wells says, which makes it challenging to stop the spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Families with multiple cases may not get everyone tested. And “there’s some hesitancy in interacting with the medical community”, Wells says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The vast majority of cases are among people who have not been vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“There’s a lot of vaccine hesitancy in Gaines county, which is where the majority of the cases are,” Wells says. There’s social pressure against getting vaccinated and misinformation has taken root over the past two decades, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The parents of the child who died appeared in a &lt;a href="https://live.childrenshealthdefense.org/chd-tv/shows/good-morning-chd/breaking-news-parents-of-child-in-texas-measles-outbreak-death/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; on Monday with Children’s Health Defense, the anti-vaccine organization previously helmed by Kennedy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“We would absolutely not take the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/mmr" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;MMR&lt;/a&gt;,” said the girl’s mother, referring to the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine. “The measles wasn’t that bad. They got over it,” she said of her four other children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“It’s not as bad as the media is making it out to be,” the father said through a translator. Both parents fought back tears throughout the interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Kennedy has shied away from directly recommending vaccinations during this outbreak while also promoting alternative treatments. He has also &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/10/health/measles-texas-kennedy-fox.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;suggested&lt;/a&gt; that the Texas child was unhealthy or malnourished, despite medical reports that she was healthy and had no underlying conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="81795a62-557d-4baa-ae8a-6ac3e2e55b01" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class=" dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":21,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"‘Wake-up call’: Measles cases doubled in Europe last year, say WHO and Unicef","elementId":"81795a62-557d-4baa-ae8a-6ac3e2e55b01","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/mar/13/wake-up-call-measles-cases-doubled-europe-last-year-who-unicef"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":0,"display":0,"theme":0}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Health departments in cities like Lubbock, where the hospitalized children with measles are being treated, have created mass vaccination clinics where anyone can get the MMR vaccine free of charge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“We’re trying to remove every single barrier to get vaccinated,” Wells says. “And then we’re working more with messaging from trusted leaders about the importance of vaccination.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;But so far, the Lubbock clinic has only given out about 300 more vaccines than they usually would over the past few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Without widespread vaccination, the outbreak could continue for another year, she says. Other recent outbreaks have been in densely populated areas, but these cases are spread over 11 counties in Texas, plus New Mexico and Oklahoma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“We have a large, spread-out population where we’re going to keep seeing measles pop up,” Wells says. “It’s going to take a lot of time to change the perception of vaccines, get people vaccinated, and then get to a point where there won’t be any vulnerable people left for measles to find.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;From the first two cases, Wells knew “this is going to be big”. Two children hospitalized in Lubbock tested positive, which meant there was more community spread happening under the radar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Now, she worries about someone stopping at one of the major rest stops along Texas highways and spreading measles far beyond the state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“That’s how easily transmissible measles is,” Wells says – and outbreaks can ignite anywhere that the vaccination rate is low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;In Ohio, an unvaccinated resident tested positive for measles after international travel, &lt;a href="https://odh.ohio.gov/media-center/odh-news-releases/health-director-announces-measles-case-in-ohio" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;according&lt;/a&gt; to the state department of health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Maryland officials also announced two more cases of measles in unvaccinated international travelers. They flew into Dulles international airport on 5 March – the same day as the previous case in Maryland, though at different times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;These cases are not associated with that previous case or with the measles outbreak in New Mexico, Texas and Oklahoma, Maryland health officials &lt;a href="https://health.maryland.gov/newsroom/Pages/Two-cases-of-measles-confirmed-in-Maryland-residents-with-recent-international-travel.aspx" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;say&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;These patients, who traveled internationally together, also visited several locations throughout the Washington DC area, including four visits to a healthcare center as well as trips to the metro, a shuttle bus at National airport, and a car dealership, over the course of 12 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;If patients suspect they were exposed to measles, they should seek care immediately – but it’s very important to notify healthcare providers of potential measles cases, so that others in the facility don’t get sick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“Call ahead to tell the place where you are going to, to tell the provider where you are going to, that you’re coming in because you may have possibly been exposed to measles,” Donatelli says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“That way, the provider can go ahead and make the proper arrangements so that you could be seen safely and quickly – and at the same time, they can protect other people.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian US</author><pubDate>Sun, 23 Mar 2025 12:03:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijgFBVV95cUxOa2tyMEVPbmVzNDdZdUVZdVpSMzRIM0p1NF84QkhYdFRBZkJmN1VBbEhkTi1Fck1pQk5ndGVoWUlGdTRiSnk1OGFrN3dxWVozQjBOdkJzRGw3eHdIRGxtXzI0Wm44b2I4Q0dOT0d6OTRxcGFqYjlwV3BGVUEyWjVoTFZRelAyYmNvMEREVUl3</guid></item><item><title>The dangers of too much protein and which type is healthiest - The Telegraph</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirgFBVV95cUxQOEpyTk82NHdsX2dhWGNuRkhPVVRVa1BqMDREdWd6T0c4b1hSZGI2bFFUcUtHUlVfeFVkeEVXeFFsVWljQmFFR2lWSzNVQWUtWGdEdVdSODFvTmlYX3J5LUU5M0NyRVJyQXVCelZvb1BjdWVjc3dTYnRoQ2dtcVJrLUVTbW8wbzZOaktyVEg0VHh5SkpHeUMzdnNnM2xXNUhDVVd4RHhnX0kxenhPTVE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="component article-body-text    " data-test="article-body-text"&gt;
  
  

	

	
	

	
	



  
  
    &lt;p&gt;Indeed, many people taking supplemented forms of protein, such as shakes &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/recommended/leisure/fitness/best-protein-bars/"&gt;and bars&lt;/a&gt;, may be wasting their time and money, as the body cannot store protein. Instead, the protein is broken down into amino acids which are excreted if not used, or in the case of high protein diets the body converts excess protein to glucose which is stored as fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you’re going all out on having everything enriched with or fortified with protein and are not very active or doing a lot of strength and muscle building then you may be getting too much for your body to utilise, and it will pass out down the toilet,” says Thornton-Wood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;What are the risks of eating too much?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Protein is an essential nutrient found throughout the body, not just in muscle but in bone, skin, hair, and every other tissue. It makes up the enzymes that create biochemical reactions and the haemoglobin that carries oxygen in blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are few risks of having too much protein per se. Indeed, an analysis by Harvard University which followed 130,000 people for up to 32 years, found that the percentage of calories from total protein intake was not related to overall mortality or to specific causes of death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, research indicates that the form the protein comes in (the protein package) rather than the amount is more likely to make a difference to health. For example, a high protein diet which relies on &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/diet/nutrition/why-healthy-brain-requires-meaty-diet/"&gt;red meat&lt;/a&gt; may also contain high levels of saturated fat, while a diet reliant on powders and bars will likely include a lot of processed ingredients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;Inflammation&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers at the University of Navarra in Spain reported that certain animal-based sources of protein could cause higher levels of inflammation than foods like legumes, nuts, and beans. They found that obese people on diets who got more of their protein from meat had higher levels of inflammation compared to participants who consumed mostly fish or plant-based sources of protein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, another &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6483052/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; of 2,061 participants found that overall inflammation and oxidative stress increased less in those with the highest protein intake than in those with the lowest. The study concluded that dietary protein, particularly from plant sources, may be associated with beneficial changes in the inflammatory burden in ageing populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;Heart problems&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research conducted at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, part of Harvard University, found that eating regular small amounts of red meat, especially processed red meat, is linked to an increased risk of heart disease and stroke, and the risk of dying from cardiovascular disease or any other cause. Another 2010 &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2946797/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; analysed data on the dietary habits and health outcomes of 84,136 women and concluded that high red meat intake increases risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) and that the risk may be reduced by changing to other sources of protein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;Bowel cancer&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once again, the culprit is not volume, but the type of protein being consumed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Thornton-Wood explains: “&lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/conditions/cancer/signs-symptoms-screenings-treatments-bowel-cancer/"&gt;Bowel cancer&lt;/a&gt; is linked to overconsumption of red meat and to consumption of too much processed meat.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2015, the WHO’s International Agency for Research on Cancer concluded that consumption of processed meat is carcinogenic and that consumption of red meat is “probably carcinogenic to humans”. Thornton-Woods adds that eating protein at the expense of other nutritious foods like the fruit, vegetables, and whole grains, may also carry risks.&lt;/p&gt;

I’d never miss or delay colonoscopies and screening tests.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Cases of colorectal cancer have been &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2020/colorectal-cancer-rising-younger-adults" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="rapidly increasing" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67dc3773e4b038b4d0a68261" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.cancer.gov/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2020/colorectal-cancer-rising-younger-adults" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="9"&gt;&lt;span&gt;rapidly increasing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; among young adults. Though the disease, which affects fewer than 1% of adults, is still rare, the spike in incidence has made early screening and diagnosis all the more important. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Because of this alarming trend, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force issued new &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/colorectal/basic_info/screening/index.htm#:~:text=Regular%20screening,%20beginning%20at%20age,to%20their%20doctor%20about%20screening." role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="colon cancer screening guidance" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67dc3773e4b038b4d0a68261" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/colorectal/basic_info/screening/index.htm#:~:text=Regular%20screening,%20beginning%20at%20age,to%20their%20doctor%20about%20screening." data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="10"&gt;&lt;span&gt;colon cancer screening guidance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; in 2021 to try to catch more cases. Now, all adults are advised to starting screening by a colonoscopy or stool-based test starting at age 45.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Regular colonoscopies are especially important for people with inflammatory bowel disease, such as ulcerative colitis or Crohn’s disease, since these conditions can increase your risk of colorectal cancer. But even otherwise healthy people who have no family history can get colorectal cancer. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“No matter how healthy your lifestyle is, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/colorectal/basic_info/screening/tests.htm#:~:text=The%20U.S.%20Preventive%20Services%20Task,to%20your%20doctor%20about%20screening." role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="when you hit a certain age" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67dc3773e4b038b4d0a68261" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/colorectal/basic_info/screening/tests.htm#:~:text=The%20U.S.%20Preventive%20Services%20Task,to%20your%20doctor%20about%20screening." data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="11"&gt;&lt;span&gt;when you hit a certain age&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, you need to get screened,” Teitelbaum said. Getting screened is the best way to catch colon cancer early and treat it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. I wouldn’t ignore any odd or abnormal symptoms.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Doctors across the country have noticed that many younger adults don’t think their abnormal symptoms could be cancer, Teitelbaum said. And because they’re so young, health care providers may not immediately suspect issues either. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;This can lead to delayed diagnoses and poorer outcomes, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ejcancer.com/article/S0959-8049(21)00395-6/fulltext" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="research" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67dc3773e4b038b4d0a68261" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.ejcancer.com/article/S0959-8049(21)00395-6/fulltext" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="12"&gt;&lt;span&gt;research&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; shows. The takeaway? You &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;have&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; to pay attention to your body, Teitelbaum stressed. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Look out for any changes in bowel habits ― if you have always pooped on schedule but now frequently feel constipated, or notice blood in your stool and have abdominal pain, it’s worth talking to a doctor. Diarrhea, fatigue or unexplained anemia also warrants a medical checkup.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It’s important to advocate for yourself. If you feel like your doctor isn’t taking your symptoms serious, go get a second opinion. “If you’re really worried, you need to persist,” Teitelbaum said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. I wouldn’t underestimate the power of a healthy lifestyle.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Though the causes of colon cancer are poorly understood, over half of colorectal cancers are linked to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/colon-rectal-cancer/causes-risks-prevention/risk-factors.html" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="modifiable lifestyle factors" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67dc3773e4b038b4d0a68261" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/colon-rectal-cancer/causes-risks-prevention/risk-factors.html" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="13"&gt;&lt;span&gt;modifiable lifestyle factors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span&gt; Smoking tobacco, drinking alcohol and having a sedentary lifestyle are thought to go hand in hand with a heightened risk of colon cancer, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/colorectal/basic_info/risk_factors.htm" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="according to the " data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67dc3773e4b038b4d0a68261" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/colorectal/basic_info/risk_factors.htm" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="14"&gt;according to the &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/colorectal/basic_info/risk_factors.htm" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Centers for Disease Control and Prevention" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67dc3773e4b038b4d0a68261" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/colorectal/basic_info/risk_factors.htm" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="15"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/latest-news/six-ways-to-lower-your-risk-for-colon-cancer.html#:~:text=Diets%20that%20include%20lots%20of,increased%20risk%20of%20colorectal%20cancer." role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Your diet" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67dc3773e4b038b4d0a68261" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/latest-news/six-ways-to-lower-your-risk-for-colon-cancer.html#:~:text=Diets%20that%20include%20lots%20of,increased%20risk%20of%20colorectal%20cancer." data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="16"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Your diet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; also plays a big role.

Stroke is one of the leading causes of disability in the world, according to &lt;a href="https://www.neurology.pitt.edu/people/alhamza-r-al-bayati-md" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Alhamza Al-Bayati" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67d9b182e4b0fd92334499d4" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.neurology.pitt.edu/people/alhamza-r-al-bayati-md" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="4"&gt;Dr. Alhamza Al-Bayati&lt;/a&gt;, a neurointerventional surgeon at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. It’s also the fifth-leading cause of death in the United States, said &lt;a href="https://utswmed.org/doctors/erica-jones/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Erica Jones" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67d9b182e4b0fd92334499d4" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://utswmed.org/doctors/erica-jones/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="5"&gt;Dr. Erica Jones&lt;/a&gt;, an assistant professor in the Department of Neurology at University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it turns out that people shouldn’t be focused on burnt toast. The phantom smell does not mean you’re going to have a stroke — Jones said the purported symptom is “not real. It’s not actually associated with stroke.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://findadoctor.mountauburnhospital.org/Details/171143?Index=7&amp;amp;Specialties=10105%2C10138%2C10110%2C10168%2C10108%2C10150%2C10112%2C10134%2C10113%2C12681" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Linda Wendell" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67d9b182e4b0fd92334499d4" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://findadoctor.mountauburnhospital.org/Details/171143?Index=7&amp;amp;Specialties=10105%2C10138%2C10110%2C10168%2C10108%2C10150%2C10112%2C10134%2C10113%2C12681" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="6"&gt;Dr. Linda Wendell&lt;/a&gt;, the chief of neurology at Mount Auburn Hospital in Massachusetts, said she had not previously heard of the rumor, but that other people in her life had. Nonetheless, there is no evidence indicating that the phantom scent is a sign of stroke, Wendell noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;For something that isn’t real, the myth is pretty widespread. Where did it come from? Experts aren’t totally sure, but Jones has a theory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Phantom smells are something that are far more common in seizures, in epilepsy,” she explained. “I think because it’s associated with another neurologic condition, people may be getting seizures and stroke confused and thinking that this is a stroke symptom. But actually this would be very unusual to have this symptom be related to a stroke. ... Even among seizures, it’s still a rare symptom.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Al-Bayati noted that phantom smells are associated with another neurological condition as well: migraine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suffice to say, if you frequently notice phantom scents, you should talk to your doctor — but this doesn’t mean you’re about to have a stroke. Instead of focusing on burnt toast, doctors say you should know the real signs of a stroke, in addition to the lifestyle factors and conditions that put you at higher risk of one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Actual Warning Signs Of Stroke&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;With phantom scents ruled out, doctors say there are distinct signs of a stroke that you should be aware of.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jones said that stroke is not only “preventable” but also “very treatable” — as long as you receive medical attention quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you can get to a hospital within three to four hours of developing symptoms, it’ll be easier for doctors to reverse stroke symptoms, she said. And, of course, getting there even faster is ideal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;With each minute that passes, a stroke victim loses 2 million neurons in their brain, according to Al-Bayati. This cell death continues until &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/stroke-every-minute-counts" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="blood flow" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67d9b182e4b0fd92334499d4" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/stroke-every-minute-counts" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="7"&gt;blood flow&lt;/a&gt; to the brain resumes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Al-Bayati, Jones and Wendell all said the easiest way to remember the signs of a stroke is with &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/be-fast-stroke-symptoms_l_64ba9296e4b0dcb4cab8d971" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="the mnemonic “BE FAST”" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67d9b182e4b0fd92334499d4" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="64ba9296e4b0dcb4cab8d971" data-vars-target-content-type="buzz" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="8"&gt;the mnemonic “BE FAST”&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;B for “balance issues” — is the person feeling off balance?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;E for “eyesight changes” — are they experiencing vision loss, double vision or other changes to their eyesight?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;F for “facial drooping” — is their face drooping on one side, or numb?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A for “arm weakness” — is one arm weakened? Can the two arms be raised symmetrically?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;S for “speech difficulty” — is their speech slurred or nonsensical? Are they unable to speak?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;T for “time to get help” — seek medical attention as soon as possible.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;You won’t necessarily experience all of those symptoms when having a stroke — instead, you may just have one or a few, Al-Bayati said. For example, some people only have speech problems or only have facial drooping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: MoMo Productions via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;MoMo Productions via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;To lower your risk of stroke, seek medical attention for conditions like high blood pressure.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How To Decrease Your Risk Of Stroke&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Wendell, you should try to maintain a healthy lifestyle to prevent a stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;This includes sticking to a nutritious diet, and avoiding “foods that are high in fat [or] cholesterol,” as well as sugary foods, Wendell said. You should eat lean protein (like chicken breast, lentils, beans, turkey, tofu and fish), as well as fruits and vegetables, according to Jones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Physical activity is also important. “Regular cardiovascular exercise greatly reduces your stroke risk,” Jones explained. You should try to get 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise (such as brisk walking, dancing or water aerobics) each week, or 75 minutes of vigorous exercise (such as running, swimming laps or doing heavy yard work), &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/fitness/fitness-basics/aha-recs-for-physical-activity-in-adults" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="according to the American Heart Association" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67d9b182e4b0fd92334499d4" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/fitness/fitness-basics/aha-recs-for-physical-activity-in-adults" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="9"&gt;according to the American Heart Association&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smoking puts you at higher risk of stroke. Additionally, “if you have a medical condition like high blood pressure, &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/life/topic/high-cholesterol" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="high cholesterol" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67d9b182e4b0fd92334499d4" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="/life/topic/high-cholesterol" data-vars-target-content-type="feed" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="10"&gt;high cholesterol&lt;/a&gt;, diabetes, then you want to make sure that you’re talking to your doctor, that you’re on the appropriate medications to control these different diseases and that you are taking your medications each day,” Wendell noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you don’t know your cholesterol and blood pressure levels, or haven’t been tested for some time, you should talk to your doctor about getting an assessment. This is true whether you’re 80 or 25.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Stroke is literally a disease of all ages,” Al-Bayati said. “Pediatric population and young adults can have a stroke. Elderly population can have a stroke.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s common for younger people to skip doctor’s appointments and annual physicals, but this won’t help your health in the long haul.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A lot of [younger] people think they feel fine, so they don’t see a reason to see the doctor,” Jones said. “But high blood pressure, for instance, often doesn’t cause symptoms, and so you could be walking around with high blood pressure for years and have no idea.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;She added: “We have that happen all the time, where people come in with their stroke, and then we also have to tell them that they have high blood pressure, diabetes and all these other things. And that’s the first they’re hearing of it, and it’s probably been there for years. But they just didn’t know because they had never seen a doctor to check on it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title"&gt;Get Our Lifestyle Coverage Ad-Free&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message-container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message support-huffpost-control"&gt;&lt;p&gt;HuffPost is your trusted source to help you lead a better life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our reporters rely on research, expert advice and lived experiences.

Not cultivating social relationships.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We know that socialization helps with your brain and with your longevity,” said &lt;a href="https://www.nm.org/doctors/1346279213/lee-a-lindquist-md-mph" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Lee Lindquist" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67d9b32ee4b0fd9233449c9a" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.nm.org/doctors/1346279213/lee-a-lindquist-md-mph" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="5"&gt;Dr. Lee Lindquist&lt;/a&gt;, chief of geriatrics at Northwestern Medicine in Chicago.

As you age, it’s normal for your social circle to dwindle, which means it’s critical to keep going out to meet new people if you want to age well, Lindquist noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Not adjusting your medications as you age.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We see it so many times where people will be on medicines that they were started on in their 40s and 50s that they may not need in their 70s or 80s,” Lindquist said. “And some of these medicines are not ideal for older adults.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Certain medications can make you more susceptible to falls and cause thinking problems, she added.

Not exercising.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;This one probably isn’t surprising, but it can’t be said enough: Failing to exercise will harm your longevity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Exercise is amazing — being able to put exercise in a pill form would take a lot of health care providers out of business, because it really is good for mood, it’s good for weight control, it’s good for your bones, it’s good for your heart, it’s good for your brain,” Whitson said. “And it really is about the only thing that you can recommend that has all-around good benefit.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Exercising is super important, and not exercising or not getting enough daily activity is something that will definitely harm your longevity,” Lindquist said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;When asked how much she recommends people exercise, Lindquist simply said: “More.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When you get too comfortable, and doing the same activity three times a week, once a week, or even not at all, it just really hurts your body,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, if you’re someone who goes on a daily walk, try adding in a Zumba class a few times a week. If you’re a die-hard Peloton fan, sign up for some personal training classes, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Even if you ask your physician for a physical therapy order to get you started to get you moving around more, that’s very important,” Lindquist said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re looking for a benchmark to start, you should aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate exercise or 75 minutes of vigorous exercise each week, according &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/fitness/fitness-basics/aha-recs-for-physical-activity-in-adults" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="to the American Heart Association" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67d9b32ee4b0fd9233449c9a" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/fitness/fitness-basics/aha-recs-for-physical-activity-in-adults" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="10"&gt;to the American Heart Association&lt;/a&gt;. And, again, more minutes mean more health benefits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Smoking.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/fact_sheets/health_effects/effects_cig_smoking/index.htm" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Smoking cigarettes is linked" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67d9b32ee4b0fd9233449c9a" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/fact_sheets/health_effects/effects_cig_smoking/index.htm" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="11"&gt;Smoking cigarettes is linked&lt;/a&gt; to lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, heart disease, stroke and more.

You can also get resources from your doctor to help you quit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Klaus Vedfelt via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Klaus Vedfelt via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;Staying social has proven longevity benefits.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Eating an unhealthy diet.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Whitson, prioritizing a healthy diet is another way to better your chances of a healthy life span.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whitson suggested that “a Mediterranean-style diet that is heavy on fish... and heavy on whole fruits and vegetables and grains, with only the very occasional treat of processed food, is probably the best thing for most people.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s never too late to change your diet ― but you may have an easier time doing so when you’re younger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s very hard to change your diet when you’re in your 70s, 80s, 90s, so if you can start eating right earlier, it’s going to be easier for you and it’ll affect you better over the long run,” Lindquist explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7.

Letting stress go unmanaged.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s really hard to not feel stressed about work and family and whatever other things make us stressed out, but just be mindful that we as humans have a very physical stress response to things that are not a physical threat to us,” Whitson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many animals have a stress response that kicks in under conditions of urgency, like when they’re being chased by a predator or looking for water. Generally, once the need is met, the stress goes away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We as humans are able to stress about things that... just don’t pose any physical threat to us ― but then by turning on that stress response and having it kind of chronically activated, it does all kinds of things,” Whitson said. “It reduces our immune system’s ability to fight off real pathogens and things that are our real stressors.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stress also takes a toll on our metabolism, our sleep, our blood pressure and more. It’s important to do what you can to decrease your stress, whether that’s talking to a mental health professional (if possible) or cutting out things in life that cause you problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9. Not planning for your future health.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We talk a lot about planning for end of life — you know, what are you going to do? Do you want CPR? Do you want advanced-care planning? Who’s my power of attorney? Where’s my will?” Lindquist said. “But many times people don’t think about, ‘What am I going to do in the 10 to 20 years before I die?’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lindquist refers to this time frame as the “fourth quarter of life, because that’s the time when you’re going to have more health problems.” She added that people in their 70s, 80s and 90s are more likely to require hospitalization and deal with worsening memory loss. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides deciding who get the lake house, your golf clubs or your engagement ring, you should start thinking about your plan for the last 10 to 20 years of your life, Lindquist explained. Are you going to plan to move in with family? Will you have in-home care? Will you move to a senior community? Do you live near a hospital?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These are conversations that people should be having, especially when they’re considering longevity and living longer,” she noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;By having these conversations with loved ones, you can make sure your voice is heard as you age and that there are no unchecked expectations.

    &lt;p&gt;Men with an extra 11 centimetres – or just over four inches – on their waistlines, increased their risk of developing cancer by 25 per cent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But a comparable increase in BMI of 3.7, such as from 24 to 27, increased the risk by 19 per cent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers said the &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2024/05/10/nearly-half-cancer-cases-linked-obesity/"&gt;excess abdominal body fat elevated the risk of cancer&lt;/a&gt; beyond the standard BMI increase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For women, the associations were weaker and similar for both waist circumference and BMI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It found that both a 12 centimetres wider waistline and an increase in BMI score of 4.3, were both associated with a 13 per cent higher risk of developing cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research will be presented at this year’s European Congress on Obesity in Malaga, Spain, in May, and published in The Journal of the National Cancer Institute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors said it was more accurate to measure waist circumference because BMI “does not provide information on fat distribution”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;More effective in men&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;They said &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2024/06/02/obesity-blamed-as-cancer-cases-rise-more-quickly-in-young/"&gt;stomach fat&lt;/a&gt; “accumulates around the abdominal organs” and was more likely to lead to disease, while people with similar BMI scores but different fat levels and placement, would have different cancer risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They said it was a more effective measure in men because they are more likely to store fat in the abdominal area, whereas women are more likely to have fat spread across their body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week, &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/nhs/"&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt; guidelines revealed that millions of people would be summoned for annual weigh-ins at their GP surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice), the health watchdog, said everyone with common long-term conditions including arthritis, heart failure and diabetes would have annual BMI and waist circumference checks.&lt;/p&gt;

But according to an expert in the subject, &lt;a href="/topic/walking"&gt;walking&lt;/a&gt; reigns supreme. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s accessible, and for most people there are low barriers to entry in terms of cost, equipment or skill requirements – that’s why we say it’s the best,” says &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://education.ua.edu/about/directory/faculty-directory/elroy-aguiar/"&gt;Dr Elroy Aguiar&lt;/a&gt;, an assistant professor in exercise science at The University of Alabama, who specialises in step-based physical activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But despite walking’s accessibility credentials, there are still many people chained to their desks or run (quite literally) off their feet, who consequently can’t find time to squeeze in much health-boosting movement. For these people, Dr Aguiar says there are ways to make the steps they &lt;em&gt;are &lt;/em&gt;doing go even further. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 epFywa"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Focus on cadence &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.who.int/initiatives/behealthy/physical-activity"&gt;World Health Organisation&lt;/a&gt;’s physical activity guidelines state that adults “should do at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity, 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity physical activity or an equivalent combination of both throughout the week”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This suggests that, while more movement is better, those with limited time will enjoy greater ROI from higher-intensity activities. And one of the easiest ways to increase the intensity of walking is to increase your step speed – aka cadence. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our studies [published in the &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29858465/"&gt;British Journal of Sports Medicine&lt;/a&gt;] show that if you walk at a cadence of about 100 steps per minute, that’s equivalent to what’s called ‘moderate-intensity’,” says Dr Aguiar. “All of the research in this area suggests that most of the benefits [of walking] accumulate at a moderate or higher intensity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is easier than it sounds, he says, with most people self-selecting a cadence of roughly 110-115 steps per minute when striding purposefully down the street.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you wanted to bump it up to a vigorous-intensity, you could walk at around 130 steps per minute,” Dr Aguiar adds. “If you move within that range or slightly above, you can shift gears so to speak and move from moderate to vigorous, getting more benefit from the activity you’re doing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 epFywa"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;10-second takeaways: &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-kk992l-0 sc-w27hnf-1 epFywa fsVXVg"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Increase the number of steps you take per minute to “get more benefit from the activity you’re doing”. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Aim for 100 steps per minute for a moderate-intensity activity, or 130 steps per minute for a vigorous-intensity activity. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/joe-wicks-workout-for-beginners-b2716443.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Joe Wicks says the fitness industry is overlooking those who need it most – this is his solution&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 epFywa"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;One minute of higher-intensity activity can be beneficial &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This advice stems from another of Dr Aguiar’s research papers, this time published in the &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/sms.14762"&gt;Scandinavian Journal of Medicine and Science in Sports&lt;/a&gt; in 2024. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The top line is that increasing both exercise quantity and quality (ie. intensity) are linked to improved health outcomes, and as little as one minute of higher-intensity activity has been associated with lower levels of metabolic syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metabolic syndrome is a cluster of five cardiovascular risk factors comprising elevated waist circumference, high triglycerides, low HDL (the “good” cholesterol), high blood pressure and high blood sugar. So in layman’s terms: if you want to lose fat, lower your blood sugar and blood pressure, and improve your cholesterol levels, very short bouts of higher-intensity exercise can help. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Accumulating a high volume of walking throughout the day, then focussing on doing at least 30 minutes of faster walking or jogging, would be a good way to lower your metrics for each of the progressive risk factors,” says Dr Aguiar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But one of the really interesting findings from our paper was that, if you look at people’s highest one minute of activity across each day, that was a very strong signal for whether they had one or more of the metabolic syndrome risk factors present. Even something as little as one minute of high-intensity activity could be beneficial.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 epFywa"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;10-second takeaways: &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-kk992l-0 sc-w27hnf-1 epFywa fsVXVg"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Increasing both exercise quantity and quality (eg. number of steps taken and intensity, in the form of speed) can contribute to improvements in waist circumference, blood sugar, blood pressure and cholesterol levels. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;As little as one-minute of higher-intensity activity per day can be beneficial for your health. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/fat-loss-habits-ben-carpenter-b2699499.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A fat loss expert says ‘diets don’t work’ - he recommends doing these five things instead for long-term results&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 epFywa"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Move after meals &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We know that even a short amount of exercise has an immediate effect,” says Dr Aguiar. “Straight away, you get lower blood pressure and lower blood glucose. This ties in with another &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://diabetesjournals.org/care/article/36/10/3262/30770/Three-15-min-Bouts-of-Moderate-Postmeal-Walking"&gt;study on postprandial walking&lt;/a&gt; [walking after a meal].”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research found that, in “older persons at risk for glucose intolerance”, those who went for a 15-minute walk after meals had much shallower highs and lows in their blood sugar levels throughout the day. Why? Because glucose is pulled into the cells of working muscles during exercise to be used as energy, so if you go for a walk after eating then blood sugar levels are stopped from spiking. This can prevent the development of insulin resistance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The way insulin resistance works is that, over years and decades, the body can become resistant to the effect of insulin [a hormone which regulates blood sugar levels] because you’re consuming too much carbohydrate,” Dr Aguiar explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; “The muscle, because it’s not active, becomes resistant, and then insulin doesn’t work anymore. That’s when you have to take medications like synthetic insulin or other drugs that control blood glucose levels like metformin.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But these medications should be seen as a “last line of defence”, he adds. Your body is likely to have been struggling with handling glucose for some time before insulin resistance develops, and exercise (vis-à-vis, walking) is a “primary strategy and behavioural recommendation” for combatting this. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“[Moving after meals] reduces the amount of work your pancreas has to do, and improves the way your muscle can take in or accept glucose to use it as a fuel,” Dr Aguiar says. “That effect over years and decades is what prevents you from getting metabolic syndrome, diabetes and hypertension. Just 15 minutes of walking after each main meal is going to be beneficial for your health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 epFywa"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;10-second takeaways: &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-kk992l-0 sc-w27hnf-1 epFywa fsVXVg"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;15 minutes of brisk walking after each major meal will help regulate your blood sugar levels. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Done consistently, this can reduce your risk of developing metabolic syndrome, diabetes and hypertension. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/exercise-fitness-for-longevity-b2706750.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The 80:20 training routine that can help you live longer according to a specialist trainer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 epFywa"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Try rucking &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/what-is-rucking-b2611597.html"&gt;Rucking&lt;/a&gt; refers to the act of &lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/rucking-walking-10000-steps-a-day-b2711070.html"&gt;walking with weights&lt;/a&gt;, usually in the form of a &lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/best-weighted-vests-b2663286.html"&gt;loaded backpack&lt;/a&gt;. This can be done with specialist kit, such as a custom-built rucksack and weight plates, or you can just chuck a few heavier household items into a sturdy but standard bag then go for a walk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now for the obvious question: why would you want to do that? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Extra weight costs you energy to move,” says Dr Aguiar. “If you’re adding weight, it’s going to increase your oxygen consumption, and it’s going to increase your heart rate if you’re trying to maintain the same speed of walking.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As referenced in the points above, this will increase the intensity of your walk, leading to elevated calorie burn and potentially increased cardio perks in the same timeframe. And the benefits don’t end there. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“All of the muscles in your lower body – the quadriceps, hamstrings and gastrocnemius (calf muscles) – are going to have to accommodate that heavier load, so you could get small improvements in strength and bone density, especially if you do it over a prolonged period of time,” Dr Aguiar adds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This probably won’t be equivalent to what you would achieve from resistance training, but you may get some improvement in muscle mass from rucking.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A good starting point for rucking is to carry a couple of extra kilograms in your bag while walking, then you can build the weight from there as your fitness level increases. Start light and progress gradually to give your body time to adapt to this new demand and minimise injury risk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 epFywa"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;10-second takeaways: &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-kk992l-0 sc-w27hnf-1 epFywa fsVXVg"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Carrying a weighted backpack (rucking) while walking increases the intensity of the activity, elevating calorie burn and potentially cardiovascular fitness too. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rucking can also develop strength, muscle and bone density in the lower body. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Start with light weights and progress the load you’re carrying gradually. This will give your body time to adapt to this new demand and minimise injury risk. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-wellbeing/disability-benefits-wes-streeting-anxiety-work-b2716393.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Generation Anxious: Why ordinary ups and downs are turning the young into ‘can’t cope’ workers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 epFywa"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What are the benefits of walking?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even without any of these techniques, walking boasts plenty of benefits, and there is an ever-growing pool of research to support this. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Over the last two or three years there have been a lot of large studies coming out looking at prospective associations between walking and health outcomes like all-cause mortality, which is a fancy way of saying any reason why someone would die,” Dr Aguiar explains. “These studies are showing that walking, not necessarily in huge volumes, is associated with large reductions in risk of all-cause mortality.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 2023 meta-analysis published in the &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37555441/"&gt;European Journal of Preventive Cardiology&lt;/a&gt; found there is a “significant inverse association between daily step count and all-cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality, with the more [steps] the better over the cut-off point of 3867 steps per day for all-cause mortality and only 2,337 steps per day for cardiovascular mortality.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, the more you walk, the lower your risk of dying, and a little extra activity can go a long way – “We showed that a 1,000-step increment correlated with a significant reduction of all-cause mortality of 15 per cent, and similarly, a 500-step increment correlated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular mortality of seven per cent,” the research goes on to add.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 2023 &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.ugr.es/en/about/news/how-many-steps-take-each-day-reduce-risk-premature-death8000"&gt;University of Granada&lt;/a&gt; study then sought to find the optimal number of steps per day. It concluded that, while more movement is inevitably better for your health, “if we focus on the risk of dying from cardiovascular disease, most of the benefits are seen at around 7,000 steps [per day]”. It adds that the coveted 10,000-step goal has “no scientific basis”, but can be a handy way to encourage more movement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond all-cause mortality, further benefits of walking can depend on your fitness level. For example, an Olympic runner who regularly subjects themself to an intense training regime is unlikely to build cardiovascular fitness from a brisk stroll – they’re already operating at a higher level. The same applies to gym-goers, who probably won’t build leg strength from &lt;a href="/extras/indybest/outdoor-activity/10k-steps-per-day-benefits-b2639829.html#:~:text=It%20can%20improve%20your%20health%20and%20fitness&amp;amp;text=The%20real%2Dworld%20benefits%20are,and%20many%20other%20chronic%20conditions."&gt;10,000 steps&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, if you currently do little-to-no activity, the stimulus provided by walking will be sufficient to trigger greater changes. These include boosting heart health and cardiovascular fitness, strengthening the bones, joints and muscles in your lower body so you’re less susceptible to injury, and contributing to daily calorie burn to aid weight management. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/jennifer-aniston-pvolve-workout-review-b2711068.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’m 46 and I tried Jennifer Aniston’s Pvolve workout – it felt like I was exercising for my future self&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Sun, 23 Mar 2025 06:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinwFBVV95cUxPNGFUenVuLTVldktPX1dkeVprS3c3dlN1V1JZYmRJU0hoZl9IVjZVRVgzay1kUFR4TkFuOXZiX0hBajhsSHc4dWVnblg3VlhWZmRIYmdoQzVTeWdPN1A4eU9OMVNsc1ppY2o4QUVoSTVEN2VFWU5kMXV0X095US1lQU5Eamd3N1BCVEZmQklwSlY2bzFQZjRPcFJwNEtrN28</guid></item><item><title>How balanced diet help improve quality of sleep and improve productivity - The Times of India</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Workplace stress is a key challenge in today's environment, given the pace of change that the planet is seeing as it had never seen before. Climate change is making tropical regions warmer, impacting focus, productivity, and health. Meanwhile, technology is evolving at breakneck speed, forcing employees to constantly upskill or risk falling behind. This dual pressure—physical stress from climate shifts and mental stress from technological change—is taking a toll on individuals at work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Countering that the best tool would be technology and ensuring that technology is harnessed in planning menus by incorporating both calorific content and other necessary nutrient requirements into the menu planning. That is why companies which invest in tools that enable menus to be planned vis-a-vis the dietary recommendations for food at work, are likely to be better placed in addressing diet related requirements of employees. Of course, diet in itself is not sufficient, the need to exercise and remain fit can never be taken away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But a balanced diet with a healthy lifestyle is critical and it can only be achieved, not just by adding a few avocados or having a kiwi fruit as a fad, but by doing detailed menu planning which looks at combinations of staples and vegetables alongside lentils, so that the nutritive value and the calorific value are both balanced. Once that happens and the quantum of food consumption is regulated, it is natural that, it will positively influence sleep habits.\\&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The big advantage, India, as a country has, is that it largely consumes fresh food, which enables healthier digestion and ensures better breakdown of nutrients in the digestion process. This, in turn has an impact on the quality of sleep, because if you are eating healthier, you will sleep healthier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is enough research to show that disturbed sleep or inadequate sleep impacts productivity, just as there is enough research to show that a balanced diet is key to maintaining good health, which in turn again impacts your sleep habits. It is a fact that an unhealthy person is unlikely to have a good quality of sleep, and several factors which can underpin it. But at this point in time, as an organization, our priority is to ensure that we use planning tools to build healthier menus and ensure that these healthier menus are consumed in a manner which correlates with the dietary requirements of people in certain age brackets. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overconsuming even healthy food can be unhealthy. And that’s the key challenge—how do we consume the right amount while still eating healthy?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the area where we work most with our clients. We focus on delivering the right messaging to the consumers of our food—employees at work. At the same time, we build healthier menu patterns within the available resources. Our goal is to help employees stay productive by maintaining good health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contributed by: Sanjay Kumar, MD &amp;amp; CEO, Rassense Pvt Ltd&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Sun, 23 Mar 2025 05:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi6wFBVV95cUxQSjRMMVhMVk9Id3g4OXl5SjRmRXZsOElORDZWdVNKaWRKZW1XN3NaUmUzTDZEcnJXQ0tpSkJZM21ZZkhRbklFbm1yQUJyemdERlY4aDBaQ1JzZWVOSHZtazlEVVo4aExLVUNhUG5yQXJkX0RuZDQtWXFVLVI3RnRYak8zeVFoeGZOWkl5dFktU2VnTkNmckktVHY3X1AyNEFBc3J0QV9BOFJER1R1OUZKUHkzeG5SSFNVakExc2laSU1VclVub0lsalp1QjRmWVh1WTc4N3hHcVNnMWIzRWdXQWtBM19Ldm5WeEFF0gHwAUFVX3lxTE1aT3Q5X2czWW83aGxVQ0tFYkRmQ2VLUURSd1luaTJzTmVtNi10MUo3cDVBNGprZW0xUnlaNzJOY3I0UEd0eTNBRjJHTHQxaFhPNk9XWDNHOEh0ZV81b2RXRmQwdlQ1T0ZvbUdidHhpSkFFQTN2S2R3eVZOeG92cjJhNzA5VWIzSjJyOVpvTUhnRExqVF9RbDZnOU5xUEJ3RWw3OUZSS0RaNEFja3JsY25DMTRXUmZlUFZfU19DYXpwdzBWR09wbi04RGx5YWgtWlJyWHNtM3p0T0RNdUl5Z2FvckwzQVlXV0lTRnozZzlZTg</guid></item><item><title>The Longevity Business Is Booming—and Its Scientists Are Clashing - The Wall Street Journal</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilAFBVV95cUxQOWEyMkJyTWJ0TkdsX1hUY1ZFMzl1Q3V2V3BRdlJIOThqMFdNNDkzRFNJZ012ZXZWUDZBeC11akF2RzZDQl8yRHJ5amlJLU84Zl84bHZ0UFQzbFNUa2N6bHRPZFhnZElQVGkxWnFWU3lCRTJTcWJZSmRMWXFmWnZmNkFKREdPdXFCamFSbm1IV1F3LWVM?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Wall Street Journal</author><pubDate>Sun, 23 Mar 2025 01:31:31 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilAFBVV95cUxQOWEyMkJyTWJ0TkdsX1hUY1ZFMzl1Q3V2V3BRdlJIOThqMFdNNDkzRFNJZ012ZXZWUDZBeC11akF2RzZDQl8yRHJ5amlJLU84Zl84bHZ0UFQzbFNUa2N6bHRPZFhnZElQVGkxWnFWU3lCRTJTcWJZSmRMWXFmWnZmNkFKREdPdXFCamFSbm1IV1F3LWVM</guid></item><item><title>Cruel new twist in colon cancer epidemic in young people - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Young people with colon &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-32cfad30-05a1-11f0-83a7-eff5085fe898"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; are 'significantly' more likely to die from heart problems than the general population, experts warn. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers found people with colorectal cancer were 16 percent more likely to die from cardiovascular disease (CVD) - a group of heart conditions like heart attack and high blood pressure - than those without colon cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In patients diagnosed with colon cancer within the last two years, their risk more than doubled.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, the link was most devastating in young patients, who are &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14210777/doctor-colon-cancer-crisis-common-ingredients-responsible.html"&gt;increasingly being ravaged by colon cancer&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Colon cancer patients under the age of 50 were nearly 2.5 times more likely to die from cardiovascular disease than their peers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While the researchers do not know why there is a link between colon cancer and mortality from CVD, they suggested aggressive cancer treatments like chemotherapy and radiation could damage the heart, leading to an increased risk of conditions like heart attack. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Younger people are also more likely to need more intense cancer treatments, as they are at a &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14215241/doctors-reveal-tragic-young-people-colon-cancer.html"&gt;higher risk of being diagnosed at later stages&lt;/a&gt;

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Ahsan Ayaz, study author and an internal medicine resident at Montefiore St Luke's Cornwall Hospital in New York, said: 'Based on our findings, the two-year period after a colorectal cancer diagnosis is a critical period when patients need aggressive care to improve cardiovascular outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'For example, there should be an aggressive approach to control cardiovascular risk factors and comorbidities like &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/diabetes/index.html" id="mol-32d09790-05a1-11f0-83a7-eff5085fe898"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; and hypertension. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'There is also a need for coordination between oncology teams and primary care teams, because most of those risk factors are managed by primary care providers.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Colorectal cancer is the fourth most common cancer in the US and the second-leading cause of cancer deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The American Cancer Society estimates 154,270 Americans will be diagnosed with colon cancer this year, and 52,900 will die. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the UK, 44,063 cases are diagnosed per year, and the nation experiences 16,808 deaths every year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And since the 1990s, early-onset colon cancer has increased by 50 percent, and rates are expected to double between 2010 and 2030. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The new study, which will be presented later this month at the American College of Cardiology's Annual Scientific Session, looked at data from 630,000 patients in the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;While some warning signs are easy to spot — such as severe chest pain — others are more vague and hard to pinpoint&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;All patients were diagnosed with colorectal cancer between 2000 and 2021. The patients' exact ages are unknown. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cardiovascular mortality was defined as deaths from heart disease, high blood pressure, stroke, tears or aneurysms in the aorta, or atherosclerosis - a buildup of plaque in the arteries. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers found colorectal cancer patients overall had a 16 percent increased risk of dying from cardiovascular causes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's unclear what demographic they used as a control group. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Their likelihood of dying from these conditions was highest in the first two years after their colorectal cancer diagnosis, increasing to 45 percent during this period. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Colon cancer patients under age 50 were 2.4 times more likely to die of cardiovascular issues than people in the same age group who did not have cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, researchers concluded that Black colorectal cancer patients had a 74 percent increased chance of dying from cardiovascular issues, and white men were at a 55 percent increased risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Ayaz suggested the racial disparities could be due to socioeconomic issues, location, and access to care, but added that more research on this is needed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers said the increased risk among colon cancer patients could stem from heart damage linked to cancer treatments like chemotherapy and radiation, called cardiotoxicity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Bailey Hutchins of Tennessee, pictured at left, died of colon cancer earlier this year at age 26. Monica Ackermann of Australia, pictured at right, was just 31 when she was diagnosed with colon cancer &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These treatments may lead to inflammation, scarring, and other forms of heart damage that makes it more difficult for the heart to function properly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Colon cancer also results in widespread inflammation that can spread to the heart, making it more prone to damage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, the risk of cardiovascular death may be greater in younger people because they need more aggressive treatment, which could increase their chance of cardiotoxicity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A separate study published earlier this year looking at 25,000 adults with colorectal cancer in Denmark found patients under 50 were &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14215241/doctors-reveal-tragic-young-people-colon-cancer.html"&gt;more likely to be diagnosed at later stages&lt;/a&gt;, meaning their cancer was more prone to spreading. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Later-stage cancer often requires more aggressive combinations of surgery, chemo, radiation, and immunotherapy, all of which can contribute to cardiotoxicity.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Ayaz said: 'For therapies that are newer, there is not a lot of data on the side effects and toxicities, but evidence is emerging that they cause cardiovascular toxicity.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team is planning to conduct additional research on cardiovascular mortality in colon cancer patients receiving different types of treatment.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Sun, 23 Mar 2025 01:26:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>Scientists Find Strong Link Between Drinking Sugary Soda and Getting Cancer -

The five-year survival rate for OCC, which &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28865100/" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;causes painful sores&lt;/a&gt; on either the lips or the gums and can spread down the throat if left untreated, is &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9437560/" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;only 64.3 percent&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a new paper published in the journal &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/10.1001/jamaoto.2024.5252?utm_campaign=articlePDF%26utm_medium=articlePDFlink%26utm_source=articlePDF%26utm_content=jamaoto.2024.5252" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;JAMA Otolaryngology-Head &amp;amp; Neck Surgery&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, the University of Washington researchers looked at long-term healthcare data for more than 162,000 healthcare workers from the &lt;a href="https://hsph.harvard.edu/news/long-running-nurses-health-study-at-risk-of-shutting-down/" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;Nurses' Health Study&lt;/a&gt; and identified 124 cases of OCC among them. Crunching the numbers, the researchers found that people who drink at least one sugary soda beverage per day were at a 4.87 times greater risk of developing OCC than their counterparts who had less than one such drink per month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those who don't smoke or drink — or do so lightly — the numbers were even more stark: those who consumed one or more sugary soda per day were 5.46 more likely to develop OCC than people who drink less than one per month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper only establishes correlation, not causation, but the results are pretty striking. Brittany Barber, an assistant professor of otolaryngology head and neck surgery who led the research with her colleagues at UW, told &lt;em&gt;UPI&lt;/em&gt; that rising rates of this type of cancer among women are "alarming."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until now, sugary soft drinks have not been studied as one of the culprits behind that rate rise among nonsmokers — especially after rates of OCC related to smoking have seen a steady decline thanks to &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK343649/" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;successful anti-smoking campaigns&lt;/a&gt; and legislature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2020, the report notes, there were 355,000 new cases of OCC and 177,000 deaths globally. Despite being far "less common than breast or colon cancer," as Barber notes, that's still a pretty grim ratio of deaths to diagnoses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather than implying that the sugar from sodas themselves is causing people to get OCC, the researchers hypothesize that "diets with higher added sugar may contribute to chronic inflammation." Previous studies have connected &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41405-024-00265-w" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;excessive consumption of sugary drinks&lt;/a&gt; with gum disease — which, in turn, has been &lt;a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/news/newsroom/news-releases/2018/01/more-evidence-of-link-between-severe-gum-disease-and-cancer-risk" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;linked to oral cancer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There will obviously need to be more research to pin down this apparent connection — but in the meantime, cutting out full-sugar sodas, or soft drinks completely, may be your best bet for avoiding mouth cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More on oral health:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://futurism.com/neoscope/rfk-fluoride-water-tooth-rot" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;&lt;em&gt;When They Took Fluoride Out of the Water Like RFK Jr. Wants to Do Everywhere, People's Teeth Started Rotting Out of Their Heads&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Futurism</author><pubDate>Sun, 23 Mar 2025 00:41:32 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiY0FVX3lxTE5scllyM2xOcnl0Tlg0dF9wTXdHUzIwUUIxZEtEN0ppbmJVSzZKR2ptcEgtMG50RXBkTThPQUI5NGV1cHRtSVE4TDd3MmFqaF9MVjlFRl9CWi1pNElMcHVMSF9Taw</guid></item><item><title>Kennedy Instructs Anti-Vaccine Group to Remove Fake C.D.C.

Kennedy Jr., the nation’s health secretary, on Saturday instructed leaders of the nonprofit he founded to take down a web page that mimicked the design of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s site but laid out a case that vaccines cause autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The page had been published on a site apparently registered to the nonprofit, the anti-vaccine group Children’s Health Defense. Mr. Kennedy’s action came after The New York Times inquired about the page and after news of it ricocheted across social media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The page was taken offline Saturday evening. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“Secretary Kennedy has instructed the Office of the General Counsel to send a formal demand to Children’s Health Defense requesting the removal of their website,” the Health and Human Services Department said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“At H.H.S. we are dedicated to restoring our agencies to their tradition of upholding gold-standard, evidence-based science,” the statement said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;It was not clear why the anti-vaccine group might have published a page mimicking the C.D.C.’s.

class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The chances of developing the cancers rose in men too, with new-onset type 2 diabetes linked to a 74% increase in pancreatic cancer and a near quadrupling in the risk of liver cancer in the five years afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;A smaller effect was seen for bowel cancer, with the risk of the disease 34% higher in women and 27% higher in men with new-onset type 2 diabetes compared with people without a recent diabetes diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“Diabetes and obesity are associated with similar cancer types,” said Owen Tipping, a medical student who worked on the study with Andrew Renehan, professor of cancer studies and surgery at the University of Manchester. “Our research was detecting the effect of diabetes on cancer, after adjusting for obesity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Previous studies have linked &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/oct/03/cancer-obesity-weight-us-study" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;obesity with 13 types of cancer&lt;/a&gt;, many of which are also more common in people with type 2 diabetes. But researchers have struggled to work out whether diabetes itself raises the risk of some or all of the cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;For the latest study, the Manchester group turned to the UK Biobank which holds medical and lifestyle data on half a million people. They examined the records of 23,750 people with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes and compared them with more than 70,000 matched controls without diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;There tends to be a surge in cancer diagnoses shortly after people are found to have diabetes, simply because patients have more medical tests. The researchers accounted for this spike in cancer due to better detection by ignoring cases reported within a year of a diabetes diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;According to the study, after five years the risk of any obesity-related cancer was 48% higher for men recently diagnosed with type 2 diabetes than for those without the condition. For women, the risk was 24% higher in those with a recent diabetes diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Not all obesity-related cancers rose with diabetes, however. Women with diabetes were no more likely to develop endometrial cancer or post-menopausal breast cancer than those without, according to the study which will be presented at the European Congress on &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/obesity" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Obesity&lt;/a&gt; in Málaga, Spain, in May.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Across the population, the lifetime risks for liver and pancreatic cancer are higher for men than women. In the UK, one in 76 men and one in 130 women will develop liver cancer, while one in 55 men and one in 59 women will get pancreatic cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Tipping said it was too early to know whether people with diabetes would benefit from cancer screening, but added: “We know with pancreatic cancer that it’s important to detect it early.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;It is unclear how diabetes might drive cancer, but scientists suspect high levels of insulin, high blood glucose and chronic inflammation. The sex differences may be driven by hormone levels, how sensitive the body is to the effects of insulin or variations in body fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Sophia Lowes at &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/cancer" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Cancer&lt;/a&gt; Research UK said: “This study helps increase our understanding of the link between diabetes and cancer. While many questions remain about how and why diabetes might cause cancer, research like this is vital in helping us better prevent, detect and diagnose the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“Overweight and obesity cause at least 13 different types of cancer. The world around us doesn’t always make it easy, but keeping a healthy weight and eating a healthy, balanced diet is one way to reduce the risk of cancer. There are other steps people can take too, such as not smoking and cutting down on alcohol.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Sat, 22 Mar 2025 23:03:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMivwFBVV95cUxNbExfcVVkMW5SNXE2YXZqeWFPdnUwdUdHUWJFeEJrVXhJX2E1eTNrTWtUWFJydWE0QnBDN01iekRmU1JFTk45XzFyT0FqTHY0YkJRM0FvVXR2VjlTb3VHOVVOM25OUGZDbjdMSmFSVHhjOEdIYzJqaktQeFlVYlhLMWkxUE80d3M1N0tFM2dBaGxBcVlzUkxBT2FmN2treVNTemhlZEdHX0J2ZDRHRFV2Y2YzVC1QQ3lCenh5VjRyNA</guid></item><item><title>Pensacola car show drives support for Alzheimer's awareness and Gulf Coast Kids House - WEAR</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMitAFBVV95cUxPWnRZVnU4LVlyZFI0ZHNwR1B1Yl84Q2FnVU1jWlM4Z3Z4Ym5kcXBvcDNSaFFqUFl4dmJwbWNLY3BvVFVxNXhSSWZLS0VKSTNaa2FiT3ZUcW95bkhkdWFlamhMS2FmTEFsWEgyZHhWbXRoUjlXWTJzMllxbkRlbWE2cFNoeS15T1NkRUtfY2VUZE5SWUdSdEFCTENRV1JxNzRkSk5UNjBwaE1RUlROU3RaVGpCNGU?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="index-module_storyColumn__EZ7G" id="js-Story-Content-0"&gt;&lt;p class="StoryTags-module_tagWrapperLine__Jfav"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="StoryText-module_storyText__FWhP"&gt;&lt;p&gt;PENSACOLA, Fla. -- The parking lot at marcus pointe baptist church was full of cars showing off the last century of automotive history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You could see everything from a model tee to a modern ATV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Axels for Alzheimer's are all for a good cause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The annual car show benefits the Alzheimers Association and Gulf Coast Kids House.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As former caregivers this is something that's very dear to our hearts, we've already lost family members to this," a caregiver said.

It is said to be the world’s largest prostate cancer screening study, said SWNS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/common-cancer-type-could-detected-new-blood-test" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Common Cancer Type Could Be Detected With New Blood Test;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Common Cancer Type Could Be Detected With New Blood Test&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long-term data from this entity consistently shows that PSA screening programs can lead to a 20% reduced risk of dying from prostate cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, an analysis of 20-year follow-up data from the ERSPC is the first to look at the link between the consistent decline of &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/medical-research/medical-tech" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:screening invitations;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;screening invitations&lt;/a&gt;

and preventative care in general."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She added, "This is the opposite behavior of people who are perhaps more health-conscious and are more likely to attend a screening appointment … Our study identifies that men who were invited for screening, but do not attend screening appointments, are at a significantly higher risk of dying from prostate cancer compared to men who were not offered screening or accepted an invitation for screening."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Long-term data from this entity consistently shows that PSA screening programs can lead to a 20% reduced risk of dying from prostate cancer.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Leenen said that experts "need to better understand who these men are, why they choose not to attend appointments and how to motivate them."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doing so, she added, "will help us design population-based prostate cancer screening programs that encourage higher rates of informed participation … Tackling attendance rates in this way could be a big factor in the long-term success of a national prostate screening program," SWNS reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:For more Health articles, visit ;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;For more Health articles, visit &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.foxnews.com/health" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:www.foxnews.com/health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;www.foxnews.com/health&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Urologist Tobias Nordström, M.D., Ph.D., of the Karolinska Institute in Sweden, said, "We need to better understand why these men might actively choose not to participate in screening, despite being invited to attend, and how this behavior is linked to worse outcomes when they get a diagnosis."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings from the study are scheduled to be presented this weekend at the European Association of Urology (EAU) Congress in Madrid, Spain, said SWNS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fox News' senior medical analyst &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/person/s/marc-siegel" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Marc Siegel;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Dr. Marc Siegel&lt;/a&gt;, who was not involved in the new study on prostate cancer risks, previously called out the need for regular medical screenings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Siegel has emphasized the need to "diagnose it early for better outcomes."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Angelica Stabile of Fox News Digital contributed reporting. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Original article source:&lt;/em&gt;

 &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Nearly two percent of Americans have been diagnosed with body dysmorphic disorder as of 2024&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Body dysmorphic disorder is a mental health condition that causes you to excessively and obsessively criticize perceived defects or flaws in your appearance that are usually minor or non-existent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The person's fixation is far beyond the typical dissatisfaction people may have - like wanting to lose 5lbs - and can cause a person to constantly feel embarrassed, ashamed and anxious to the point they avoid social situations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group floatRHS"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Charles Lee, a board certified plastic surgeon explained why certain people should not get plastic surgery&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nearly two percent of Americans have been diagnosed with BDD as of 2024, according to National Alliance of Eating Disorders. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As a result, people suffering from body dysmorphia may seek out plastic surgery as a solution to fix their imperfections, but in one &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@drlee90210/video/7130480675517517098?lang=en"&gt;TikTok video&lt;/a&gt;, Dr Lee advises them not to do so. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The expert explained: 'So someone who looks at a perfectly normal part of their body but they see a big problem, you're not going to get that fixed with surgery that really needs to be taken care of.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Instead of plastic surgery, doctors suggest seeking out mental health professionals who can help evaluate the situation and suggest appropriate treatment such as therapy and medications. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Control freaks and perfectionists&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Lee added that people who are extremely particular in life and cannot bear slight asymmetries should not undergo procedures. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Perfectionists and control freaks tend to have a strong drive for flawlessness, which can lead to unrealistic expectations about the outcome of plastic surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But, there is always a risk of complications or flaws when it comes to cosmetic procedures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In cases of a rhinoplasty (nose job) and eyelid surgery, it is normal to expect a bit of unevenness. However this may cause extreme disappointment among perfectionists - causing them to book more appointments and procedures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Lee added that people who are extremely particular in life and cannot bear slight asymmetries should not undergo procedures&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Lee explained: 'Surgery is not that precise, and if you can't accept a few millimeters off here and there, you should not get plastic surgery, especially the more precise procedures, such as rhinoplasty or eyelid surgery. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'A fraction of a millimeter can be seen, but a surgeon can't necessarily correct all that, plus we have some asymmetries that cannot be corrected as well.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The specialist also noted plastic surgery requires a 'lot of patience and a lot of ability to accept the unknown'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He added: 'You're going to be swollen for a while. You're going to heal a certain way. Nobody can predict exactly how the outcome is going to be. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We have a general idea, but it's in the 95 percent precision rate and that last five  percent is kind of random and you have to be willing to accept that. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'And you may not know for six months, 12 months, sometimes two years, what the final result is.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;People with delusional expectations  &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over the last few years, social media has convinced people that plastic surgery can completely 'fix' their problems and make them look perfect. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Lee highlighted that people who have a tendency to bleed easily during surgery should avoid an elective operation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But Dr Lee says this is unrealistic and people shouldn't expect instant gratification. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's important to understand it is impossible for plastic surgery to completely alter facial and bodily structures. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The surgeon revealed: 'I've had a lot of cosmetic surgery myself. I had rhinoplasty, chin implant, whatever. I can't go into surgery expecting to look like Tom Cruise, no matter how much surgery I get.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He also emphasized it is extremely important for patients to be grounded in reality as plastic surgery ideally cannot reverse signs of aging, improve relationships or alter any negative thought patterns about your body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Easy bleeders&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lastly, Dr Lee highlighted that people who have a tendency to bleed easily or excessively should opt out of elective surgeries.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He explained that 'one in 10 people' have a tendency to bleed during surgery and while those with milder conditions, such as vitamin K deficiency, should treat those before seeking treatment, but other 'severe bleeders' need to be careful. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Conditions such as hemophilia - a condition where blood does not clot - and Von Willebrand disease - a genetic bleeding disorder caused by low levels of a clotting protein - may lead to prolonged and difficult-to-control bleeding. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;An accumulation of cigarette smoke in the chest can also cause issues during the healing process&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Frequent cigarette smoking and excessive alcohol consumption can also cause issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alcohol can cause blood to thin and an accumulation of cigarette smoke in the chest can lead to complications during the healing process. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Lee explained: 'The big thing that we worry about related to bleeding during surgery is substance abuse, including cigarettes.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'That's a huge one, because cigarette smoke and other smoke, but cigarette in particular has nicotine and carbon monoxide, tar, things that really clog up the oxygen flow to the healing areas and that can cause necrosis, meaning tissue death, poor scarring and a bad outcome. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'So you really should not smoke for almost any of these elective procedures. Alcohol, there's another one. Red wine causes bleeding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Other types of alcohol can prolong the swelling phase, and sometimes, if it's swollen for too long of a period, you're not going to get a good result.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Sat, 22 Mar 2025 20:12:01 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMingFBVV95cUxQVHkydkpVZGlCclRYV2xFV1dNZWFoRDNPOUpQOGpJaXRrb2dlSkxKN2FVLWhlaWtfS3V1N0RzVlJrX0Etekd5dTViV0dnaVE1bU9oRzR6X0d2ZmdUUEhuN0p6YVpTRm5RODNudWc3Q0VoalpnVVZmY3ZFX0tYeDRqZmxIZXpHb2ltcHlzN1hoLTNIdkw5OW5Za3ZMNUs0UdIBowFBVV95cUxPMXNoVDBKems4OExiVGhqaFN5djRBWmxCV1NOQlU4RWtJQXhDeGZvbExxZXU1S3JPc1JxVy1wX2pxbHZaMVM4X2dPNmxoUWNFemdzeWRCUmZzWmh0cG4wVTYwZ2Y5UEpfLVppSklmU1NBMHMtZVRYRFVhdC1yNVZFX2pBWGdnYkZHYXRua2MyZkpLakVoamQyVmpxS0RfM1hvZ3Q4</guid></item><item><title>Researchers discover why people don’t remember being a baby - The Brighter Side of News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMingFBVV95cUxNX3VwLXRWUjJQVHBFRVNoYkFHQlZ6Z2g0NE1Xc2lDcTZGYUdWc1YwdEI3WGJKZ0Z6ejVwOHhJc0lvYmVfOG84c0diSWVwZDBlbkt6eGlTb2xmaVdkY3hsWTQybVBuM1pfUXB3Z1AxSEp0VUlvdGFPNy1RNTl3d2RoV2dPbFhiSTdvTkRuSld3R29SVHVKNHdjREF5WDVaZw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiBox-root css-a9h2n1" data-id="page-content" data-og-area="article-blocks"&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For decades, scientists have been puzzled by a simple question: Why can't you remember being a baby? Even though infants learn rapidly in their early years, most people can't recall anything from before age three. This common phenomenon, known as infantile amnesia, has led researchers to debate whether babies fail to form memories or if they simply forget them over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recent research challenges the idea that early memories don’t exist. A groundbreaking study from &lt;a href="https://www.yale.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Yale University&lt;/a&gt; suggests that infants’ brains do encode experiences, but these memories might become inaccessible as the brain matures. The findings reshape our understanding of memory formation and could provide clues about how memory retrieval works later in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="how_the_infant_brain_encodes_memories"&gt;How the Infant Brain Encodes Memories&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/common-herb-restores-memory-and-reduces-inflammation-for-alzheimers-patients/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;hippocampus&lt;/a&gt;, a small seahorse-shaped structure deep in the brain, plays a major role in forming and retrieving episodic memories—those tied to specific events, places, and people. In adults, damage to the hippocampus leads to severe memory loss, making it difficult to recall personal experiences. Scientists have long debated whether an infant’s hippocampus is developed enough to encode these types of memories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Acquiring brain imaging data from young children can be challenging.

This idea was based on the fact that the brain’s memory circuits, known as the trisynaptic pathway, are still developing in early life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="5" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some studies also compared infant memory capabilities to adults with hippocampal damage, reinforcing the belief that young brains couldn't encode experiences properly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="6" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, newer research suggests otherwise. Behavioral studies have shown that infants can remember specific events for days, weeks, or even months, contradicting the idea that their &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/health/common-supplement-found-to-improve-cognitive-health-and-prevent-dementia/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;brains can't store memories&lt;/a&gt;. But until now, direct evidence from the brain itself was lacking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="7" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the latest study, published in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adt7570" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Science&lt;/a&gt;, researchers used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to measure brain activity in infants aged four to 25 months as they viewed images of faces, objects, and scenes. By analyzing how long infants later looked at familiar images compared to new ones, scientists could determine whether a memory had been encoded. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="8" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results showed that when the hippocampus was more active during an image’s first appearance, the baby was more likely to recognize it later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="the_role_of_the_hippocampus_in_infant_memory"&gt;The Role of the Hippocampus in Infant Memory&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="9" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings suggest that infants as young as 12 months can encode episodic memories in the same region of the hippocampus that adults use for memory storage. Specifically, activity in the posterior hippocampus—the part closer to the back of the head—was linked to &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/bioluminescent-lanterns-shed-new-light-on-memory-formation-and-synaptic-activity/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;stronger memory&lt;/a&gt; encoding. This region is also crucial for adult episodic memory, reinforcing the idea that infants' brains use a similar mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="10" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, younger infants showed a different pattern. Babies under 12 months didn't display the same memory-related brain activity, suggesting their hippocampal circuits were still developing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Schematic of a trial sequence shown to infants during fMRI depicting encoding trials with a previously unseen face, object, or scene photograph.

This form of learning, linked to a different hippocampal pathway, emerges earlier than episodic memory and helps babies understand language, objects, and social cues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="12" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The hallmark of these types of memories, which we call &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/bacteria-in-your-mouth-linked-to-memory-and-dementia-risk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;episodic memories&lt;/a&gt;, is that you can describe them to others, but that’s off the table when you’re dealing with pre-verbal infants,” explained Nick Turk-Browne, senior author of the study and professor of psychology at Yale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="13" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;By showing that the infant hippocampus can encode memories, the study shifts the focus from whether babies can store memories to why they forget them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="why_do_early_memories_disappear_"&gt;Why Do Early Memories Disappear?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="14" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;If infants can encode memories, why don’t you remember being a baby? Researchers believe the answer lies in how memories are stored and retrieved over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Subsequent memory effect in the infant hippocampus. (CREDIT: Science) &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="15" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;One possibility is that early memories never transfer to long-term storage, fading before they can be solidified. Another explanation is that these memories remain in the brain but become inaccessible as it develops.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="16" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Animal studies provide intriguing clues. Research on rodents shows that memories formed in infancy leave lasting cellular traces, called &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/5d-memory-crystal-can-store-the-entire-human-genome-for-billions-of-years/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;memory engrams&lt;/a&gt;, in the hippocampus. Even when young animals appear to forget, these traces remain intact. In some cases, memory recall can be restored through specific cues or direct stimulation of these engrams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="17" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the rapid neurogenesis (growth of new neurons) that occurs in infancy may interfere with memory retrieval. Some scientists believe that as new &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/lab-grown-neurons-developed-to-behave-exactly-like-natural-ones/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;neurons&lt;/a&gt; integrate into the hippocampus, they disrupt existing memory circuits, making earlier memories harder to access. This could explain why memories from early childhood fade even though the brain is still capable of storing them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="18" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turk-Browne and his team are now testing whether infants, toddlers, and preschoolers can remember experiences from their own babyhood. Preliminary results suggest that some of these memories might persist into early childhood before eventually becoming inaccessible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="4" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Development of hippocampal subsequent memory effect.

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you've ever noticed how memories from the same day seem connected while events from weeks apart feel separate, a new study reveals the reason: Our brains physically link memories that occur close in time not in the cell bodies of neurons, but rather in their spiny extensions called dendrites.&lt;/p&gt;


										      
																																	&lt;p&gt;This discovery stems from studies in &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/mice/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;mice&lt;/a&gt;, in which researchers observed memory formation using advanced imaging techniques, including miniature microscopes that captured single-cell resolution in &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/live+animals/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;live animals&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study shows that memories are stored in dendritic compartments: When one memory forms, the affected dendrites are primed to capture new information arriving within the next few hours, linking memories formed close in time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"If you think of a neuron as a computer, dendrites are like tiny computers inside it, each performing its own calculations," said lead author Megha Sehgal, assistant professor of psychology at The Ohio State University. "This discovery shows that our brains can link information arriving close in time to the same dendritic location, expanding our understanding of how memories are organized."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research was &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-025-01876-8" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; recently in the journal &lt;i&gt;Nature Neuroscience&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though most learning and memory studies have focused on how a single memory is formed in the brain, Sehgal's lab aims to determine how we organize multiple memories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The idea is that we don't form memories in isolation. You don't form a single memory. You use that memory, make a framework of memories, and then pull from that framework when you need to make adaptive decisions," she said.&lt;/p&gt;

																																						&lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
    
     
&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="8188791252"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
																																			&lt;p&gt;Neurons, the principal brain cells, are known to encode and relay information. Dendrites—the branch-like projections extending from neurons—serve a critical role in how information is processed, receiving incoming information and passing it to the neuronal cell body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But dendrites are not just passive conduits—each dendritic branch can act as an independent computational unit. While dendrites have been thought to play an important role in the brain's function, how they shape learning and memory has been unclear until now, Sehgal said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When mice were exposed in experiments to two different environments within a short period of time, the team found that memories of these spaces became linked. If mice received a mild shock in one of these spaces, the animals ended up freezing out of fear in both environments, associating the shock from one room with the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study focused on the &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/retrosplenial+cortex/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;retrosplenial cortex&lt;/a&gt; (RSC), a brain region crucial for spatial and contextual memory. The researchers observed that linked memories consistently engaged the same groups of RSC neurons and their dendritic branches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team tracked these changes at the dendritic level by visualizing &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/dendritic+spines/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;dendritic spines&lt;/a&gt;, tiny protrusions on dendrites where neurons communicate. The formation of new memories triggered the addition of clustered dendritic spines, a process critical for strengthening communication between neurons and facilitating learning.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;

    
&lt;/div&gt;
																																			&lt;p&gt;Dendritic spine clusters formed after the first memory were more likely to attract new spines during a second closely timed memory, physically linking those experiences in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To confirm the role of dendrites in linking memories, the team used optogenetics, a technique that allows researchers to control neurons with light. By reactivating specific dendritic segments that had been active during &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/memory+formation/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;memory formation&lt;/a&gt;, they were able to link otherwise unrelated memories, further demonstrating the importance of dendritic changes in shaping memory networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to illuminating a previously unknown role for dendrites in linking memories, the findings open new avenues for understanding memory-related disorders, Sehgal said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our work not only expands our understanding of how memories are formed but also suggests exciting new possibilities for manipulating higher order memory processes," she said. "This could have implications for developing therapies for memory-related conditions such as Alzheimer's disease."&lt;/p&gt;

The two topics are linked: The anti-seed-oils faction has turned to saturated fats as a replacement, based on the belief that these fats are more “natural.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which brings us to a new study &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/article-abstract/2831265" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:in JAMA Internal Medicine;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;in &lt;em&gt;JAMA Internal Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which looked at the association between varying consumption levels of either butter or plant-based oils (aka seed oils), and mortality levels, &lt;a href="https://www.menshealth.com/health/a63096101/signs-of-heart-disease-in-men/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:heart disease;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.menshealth.com/health/a43774213/good-news-about-cancer/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:cancer;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; incidence over the long term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using data from the &lt;a href="https://nurseshealthstudy.org/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Nurse’s Health Study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Nurse’s Health Study&lt;/a&gt;, a large-scale study started in 1976, researchers analyzed the dietary habits of more than 220,000 adults. They collected the data through participants’ food frequency recalls to determine the amount of butter and/or plant-based oils in the participants’ diets over the course of roughly 30 years. (Researchers included safflower, soybean, corn, canola, and olive oils in the “plant-based” oils group.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results were consistent with what previous research has already shown: People who ate the most butter had a 12% higher risk of developing cancer, and a 15% higher risk for all-cause mortality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conversely, the subjects who ate the most plant-based oils had a 16% lower risk for all-cause mortality, a 6% lower risk of death from heart disease, and 11% lower risk for cancer, which compounded the more plant-based oils were consumed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers also found that substituting just 10 grams of butter a day—which is less than a tablespoon—for plant-based oil, &lt;a href="https://www.massgeneralbrigham.org/en/about/newsroom/press-releases/dietary-habits-study-suggests-more-plant-oils-less-butter-lead-to-better-health" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:led to a 17% reduction in cancer deaths and all-cause mortality;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;led to a 17% reduction in cancer deaths and all-cause mortality&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These conclusions seem aligned with what other studies have found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However—and this is a big HOWEVER—there are some caveats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, it’s virtually impossible to draw a definitive link between specific diets—&lt;em&gt;especially&lt;/em&gt; in a population—and health outcomes over time. Scientists just can’t keep people in a controlled lab environment for years of their lives. For long-term research like this, we have to rely on self-reported food intake, and at least some of that data may be inaccurate: People can forget, omit, or even lie about what they’ve been eating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, other factors may muddle the link. People who eat more butter, for instance, may also do more of &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; things that increase their risk for disease. They may eat a more processed diet, be more sedentary, or be more likely &lt;a href="https://www.menshealth.com/health/a35213467/quitting-cigarettes-how-i-did-it/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:to smoke;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;to smoke&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Third, people's diets tend to change over time. (While researchers had participants fill out food frequency forms every four years, is this enough data to show the true nature of each person’s intake? Maybe or maybe not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Good Food, Bad Diet&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link athena-button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1982137509?tag=syn-yahoo-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5Bartid%7C2141.a.64255411%5Bsrc%7Cyahoo-us" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:$12.05 at amazon.com;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;$12.05 at amazon.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fourth, all of the participants in the study were nurses. Do they represent the general population? Also maybe or maybe not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the potential flaws in nutrition research as a whole, dietitians like myself look for reproducible effects and patterns. If we keep getting the same results over a series of similar studies, it’s likely that there is a true effect happening. In this case, it’s highly likely that a diet high in saturated fats is associated with a greater risk for disease and death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This doesn’t mean we all need to avoid saturated fat; it simply means that a diet containing a mix of fats is probably the best for health (with the exception of trans fats, which are definitely harmful).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This means favoring unsaturated fats (including seed oils like canola and soybean) &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; adding in some saturated fats like butter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Balance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It might not be the next hot food trend, but it’s the most effective and sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL</author><pubDate>Sat, 22 Mar 2025 15:35:10 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMib0FVX3lxTE8zTm5DQU1uemtMckxhN2JvTmdwRmpROWxhZ3gzUnhsbWl6SnljZ1Zrclk1NkxWRUF0VE1KVHEzMGdxcVpYSFdOVHlzUXFTLVg3OUVlMHlwVFg0Ym1rVndVblFFVzdKUEk3bFBvZ08zbw</guid></item><item><title>An Uncertain Future for the County’s STI Clinic Stirs Outcry - Willamette Week</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqAFBVV95cUxQU1NXOHFUcFd0a2xjVFAtdzZuZkEwWE9ka1NZREUwdHFqQnlRRG1jZTZ1WklBTTdLaDNjS3NvVXRHU3d5YnZIZXo5TWxmV3ZrTWstMXd2NTRGeU1adHcwdzJma2EwNklzVjcwY1ltNkhGXzVMZ2NkU3YwQnV0dk5wSmZvdHdnMUdlVXRxd29yRG0tWm1UM0tXSy1YeDlEVzJ5V2lCLUtNaWY?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article class="b-article-body"&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Health care advocates are raising alarms over the possible shutdown of Multnomah County’s sexually transmitted infections clinic in Old Town. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Last month, the county health department listed the STI clinic’s $1.4 million annual budget among $9 million in cuts needed to reduce the department’s budget by 12%, as part of a budgeting exercise ordered by County Chair Jessica Vega Pederson. She asked departments to list what they’d cut to bridge the county’s $21 million budget shortfall. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“In response to this significant budget challenge, the Health Department was asked to think strategically and concentrate on providing core services,” a Multnomah County spokesperson said in a statement to &lt;i&gt;WW&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-enter:html-block-f0fFsJJApdG78II" data-fusion-component="html-block-f0fFsJJApdG78II"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;broadstreet-zone zone-id="169550"&gt;&lt;/broadstreet-zone&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-exit:html-block-f0fFsJJApdG78II" data-fusion-component="html-block-f0fFsJJApdG78II"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The health department raised the possibility of eliminating the STI clinic altogether, closing its doors in June. The health department’s other clinics would be expected to pick up the STI clinic’s services, which include testing and treatment for illnesses such as HIV, syphilis and gonorrhea. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Since then, the budget outlook has grown sunnier: The county only needs to trim $15 million, and the STI clinic is listed by the health department as its first priority to be saved. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Still, those close to the program have in recent weeks expressed concern about its future, given that the county is in delicate negotiations with other governments over its homeless services budget, and its budgeting woes for that office could have a domino effect. Social media posts began circulating across platforms in February, urging voters to contact Vega Pederson and county commissioners about the clinic’s survival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-enter:html-block-f0f4sSS60cJYa3P" data-fusion-component="html-block-f0f4sSS60cJYa3P"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-exit:html-block-f0f4sSS60cJYa3P" data-fusion-component="html-block-f0f4sSS60cJYa3P"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“Eliminating this clinic is not just going to inconvenience or something like that—it’s going to cost lives in the long run,” says Jeanne Krinsley, who worked there for nearly 25 years. “We’ve spent decades building trust with people, especially with the LGBTQ+ community and immigrants. They’re not comfortable going to someone they don’t trust.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The STI clinic has operated around Old Town since the 1960s and is currently housed in the Gladys McCoy Building on Northwest 6th Avenue. Last year, the clinic’s staff treated nearly 3,000 patients, and is on track to treat a similar caseload this year. Krinsley, who retired in 2023, not only treated and educated patients who contracted STIs through consensual encounters, but she also treated sexual assault victims, many of whom hadn’t told anyone else what happened to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“When someone says, ‘I’ve never told anyone that,’ that’s a real honor when someone confides in you like that,” Krinsley says. “Our patients—we’re supposed to call them ‘clients,’ but I don’t see what’s wrong with ‘patients’—just loved us.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The medical specialty requires sensitivity toward patients of all backgrounds, including houseless people, people who don’t speak English fluently, and people navigating the complexities of American health care. Krinsley says she remembers the STI clinic leading treatment during the mpox outbreak of 2022 and staying open in 2020 for in-person care when primary care doctors pivoted to telehealth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“People trusted us, so they came in,” she says. “If we’re so unimportant, why were we still coming in?” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Multnomah County’s STI clinic workers attempt to lower the barriers patients face when seeking treatment for STIs. Some clinicians visit sites like camps of houseless people to offer testing and treatment, a service that would be cut if the clinic had to close its doors. This keeps treatment accessible for people who might not be able to afford care without insurance, or who fear the stigma associated with STI testing. A familiar staff of expert providers also means patients have access to culturally competent clinicians who can help reassure them when their care leaves them physically or emotionally vulnerable. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-enter:html-block-f0fHBQDiWeXl5zS" data-fusion-component="html-block-f0fHBQDiWeXl5zS"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;broadstreet-zone zone-id="169550"&gt;&lt;/broadstreet-zone&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-exit:html-block-f0fHBQDiWeXl5zS" data-fusion-component="html-block-f0fHBQDiWeXl5zS"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“We had a guy who did not speak English who we spent a year trying to get into HIV treatment because he did not trust the medical system,” Krinsley says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Though new STI cases fell in Multnomah County in 2023 from their immediate post-pandemic spikes in 2020–22, the rates still remain around pre-pandemic highs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Vega Pederson said in a statement to &lt;i&gt;WW&lt;/i&gt; that she has not yet reached a final decision on the STI clinic’s future. She’ll propose a budget April 24, with the final budget to be approved in early June. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“Any cuts proposed by the department are provisional and meant to give myself and our board a range of options to consider,” she said. “We appreciate the patients, community members, and partner organizations who have contacted our office and testified to share their support for the services provided by the STI clinic. I share their passion for impactful public health initiatives and prevention efforts, especially as we see these services eroded at the federal level.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Krinsley says in her experience that primary care providers can miss an STI’s early symptoms before they’re so obvious they require urgent care, which comes with a higher co-pay when patients have insurance. Symptoms can also go away without the infection resolving, leaving unsuspecting patients unaccounted for to risk spreading infections. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-enter:html-block-f0fWUJt8KR3m5Ob" data-fusion-component="html-block-f0fWUJt8KR3m5Ob"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;broadstreet-zone zone-id="169550"&gt;&lt;/broadstreet-zone&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-exit:html-block-f0fWUJt8KR3m5Ob" data-fusion-component="html-block-f0fWUJt8KR3m5Ob"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“HIV and syphilis can kill you down the line,” Krinsley says. Closing the clinic “is just not going to work very well. It’s just going to lead to a lot more disability and death, and it’s just so short-sighted because it’s going to lead to an increase in costs.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Willamette Week</author><pubDate>Sat, 22 Mar 2025 15:12:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqAFBVV95cUxQU1NXOHFUcFd0a2xjVFAtdzZuZkEwWE9ka1NZREUwdHFqQnlRRG1jZTZ1WklBTTdLaDNjS3NvVXRHU3d5YnZIZXo5TWxmV3ZrTWstMXd2NTRGeU1adHcwdzJma2EwNklzVjcwY1ltNkhGXzVMZ2NkU3YwQnV0dk5wSmZvdHdnMUdlVXRxd29yRG0tWm1UM0tXSy1YeDlEVzJ5V2lCLUtNaWY</guid></item><item><title>Oregon Man Sues Pet Food Company for Allegedly Killing His Cats With Bird Flu - Gizmodo</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirAFBVV95cUxQQjlkR0wzVjk4cVJWblJTNlhfUmgwRFlOYUUycTh1bzFlZHltZndzbi1XeVd4YUJyZkVrenNWaGU0eXJYVzFmUHhMUFREd1hJM01RUFpjMDFjOXBvYXFVMDczYTlqOXg1OHlkTHZPX25iLXhSX21KaGVsdUVtV3BORXFSd3Q2ek5NbjFSaXEwMFdzQU1pYWlucUQwNkNEd0Qtd000Wkt0R251ZEVY?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content prose dark:prose-invert lg:prose-lg lg:leading-[29px] font-serif max-w-none"&gt;
              
              
              &lt;p&gt;A man in Oregon filed a lawsuit against Wild Coast Pet Food this week after his cat died from bird flu. The suit alleges the company misled consumers when it sold raw chicken cat food as healthy, failing to acknowledge potential risks, such as potential death from the consumption of H5N1-infected food.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The lawsuit, filed by Tim Hanson, seeks just under $8,000 in damages which covers compensation for veterinarian bills and legal fees, according to &lt;a href="https://www.ktvb.com/article/news/regional/portland-man-sues-wild-coast-pet-food-cat-dies-bird-flu/283-983181c4-2d7f-4549-8239-6e72d29d4386"&gt;KTVB 7&lt;/a&gt; in Oregon. Hanson adopted his cat Kira in 2021 and told the news outlet he typically feeds his cats raw food like the chicken that killed his cat because “I believe in the health benefits of it.” It’s not entirely clear what health benefits Hanson believes can come from raw chicken.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hanson told KTVB 7 he bought the Wild Coast Pet Foods brand cat food in January but one day in early February Kira stopped eating. Hanson told the news outlet he brought her to the vet on Feb. 5 and a few days later tests confirmed Kira had bird flu.  Kira was so sick she had to be euthanized on Feb. 9.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Wild Coast, which is based in Washington, issued a recall on March 1 for its 16 oz and 24 oz frozen Boneless Free Range Chicken Formula raw pet food for cats. The food was sold in Washington and Oregon.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The warning from the recall, which was posted on the FDA’s website:&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who fed pets the recalled products should watch for symptoms of bird flu in their pets, including fever, lethargy, low appetite, reddened or inflamed eyes, discharge from the eyes and nose, difficulty breathing, and neurological signs like tremors, stiff body movements, seizure, lack of coordination, or blindness. People with pets exhibiting these signs after feeding this product should contact their veterinarian.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;The spread of bird flu has been devastating for many cat owners, as they seem to be the most susceptible among domestic animals outside birds to H5N1. Many cats from New York to Oregon have been documented to have died from the disease and there are likely many more deaths that are going undetected.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;No humans in the U.S. have contracted bird flu from eating food, at least as far as health authorities can tell. But it does appear that cats are getting it from the consumption of raw food. U.S. health agencies have tested both milk and beef and it appears both are safe for human consumption even with the presence of bird flu as long as the milk is pasteurized and the beef is cooked to at least medium.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;There’s also no evidence of human-to-human spread of the bird flu in the U.S. but there is concern a mutation could allow that to happen. There have been 70 cases of H5N1 documented in Americans with one death. Forty-one of those cases have been tied to dairy cattle, 24 have been traced to poultry farms, two cases are from backyard flocks and wild birds, and three cases are still unknown sources.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Wild Coast didn’t respond to questions emailed Friday. Gizmodo will update this post if we hear back.&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;
