"It's very clear based on where these outbreaks are occurring."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The CDC currently &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/vaccines/index.html" target="_blank" dir="ltr"&gt;recommends&lt;/a&gt; that people receive two doses of the MMR vaccine, the first at ages 12 to 15 months and the second between 4 and 6 years old.

&lt;h2&gt;“Damning”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, a lack of updated data can make it more difficult, if not impossible, for federal and state health officials to identify and rapidly respond to emerging outbreaks. It can also prevent the identification of communities or demographics that could benefit most from targeted vaccination outreach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/ANNALS-25-05527"&gt;an accompanying editorial&lt;/a&gt;, Jeanne Marrazzo, CEO of the Infectious Disease Society of America and former director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, stated the concern in starker terms, writing: “The evidence is damning: The administration’s anti-vaccine stance has interrupted the reliable flow of the data we need to keep Americans safe from preventable infections. The consequences will be dire.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study authors note that the unexplained pauses could be direct targeting of vaccine-related data collection by the administration—or they could be an indirect consequence of the tumult Kennedy and the Trump administration have inflicted on the CDC, including brutal budget and staff cuts. But Marrazzo argues that the exact mechanism doesn’t matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Either causative pathway demonstrates a profound disregard for human life, scientific progress, and the dedication of the public health workforce that has provided a bulwark against the advance of emerging, and reemerging, infectious diseases,” she writes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marrazzo emphasizes that the lack of current data not only hampers outbreak response efforts but also helps the health secretary realize his vision for the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kennedy, “who has stated baldly that the CDC failed to protect Americans during the COVID-19 pandemic, is now enacting a self-fulfilling prophecy. The CDC as it currently exists is no longer the stalwart, reliable source of public health data that for decades has set the global bar for rigorous public health practice.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emily Hilliard, a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services, sent Ars Technica a statement saying: “Changes to individual dashboards or update schedules reflect routine data quality and system management decisions, not political direction. Under this administration, public health data reporting is driven by scientific integrity, transparency, and accuracy.”&lt;/p&gt;

Decades of robust evidence show this approach does not work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“The most effective way to reduce the record number of alcohol deaths we are seeing is through population-level measures such as minimum unit pricing, clear health warnings on alcohol labels, restrictions on alcohol availability, and comprehensive bans on alcohol marketing – which we know drives drinking among children and young people.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The figures follow previous reporting by the Institute of Alcohol studies, which found that alcohol abuse &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/article/2024/may/17/27bn-a-year-spent-in-england-on-harm-done-by-alcohol-study-finds" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;costs the health service £4.9bn a year&lt;/a&gt;, of which more than £3bn is spent on alcohol-related A&amp;amp;E visits and hospital admissions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="EmailSignUpWrapper" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props="{&amp;quot;index&amp;quot;:10,&amp;quot;listId&amp;quot;:4156,&amp;quot;identityName&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;morning-briefing&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;description&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;name&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;First Edition&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;frequency&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Every weekday&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;successDescription&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;We'll send you First Edition every weekday&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;theme&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;news&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;idApiUrl&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://idapi.theguardian.com&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;hideNewsletterSignupComponentForSubscribers&amp;quot;:true}"&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure id="67325ceb-3105-43d5-9643-22df7b2c6634" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-47fhrn"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":11,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"Not keen on feeble nolo wine?

They can include dabs of blood on toilet paper after a bowel movement and lingering abdominal pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This was the case for Garza, who noticed specks of blood and intense pressure with bowel movements in the spring of 2014. Over the next few weeks, Garza, who was 45 at the time, became bloated and was in so much abdominal pain that he was limited to a 'practically all liquid diet.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Still, and contrary to what you might expect for cancer patients, he actually packed on weight, going from about 150lbs to 170lbs in a matter of months, despite exercising regularly and hardly eating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Roughly one year later, Garza underwent surgery for a hernia. At a follow-up appointment after the surgery, doctors felt a mass in his anal sphincter, a group of muscles that help release stool from the rectum. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Daniel Garza (pictured) was diagnosed with anal cancer in 2015. Doctors believe HIV had increased his risk&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;On May 5, 2015, a colonoscopy and biopsy revealed stage two anal squamous cell carcinoma, which makes up nine in 10 anal cancer cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For early stages such as this, where the anal cancer has not spread, the five-year survival rate is 85 percent, according to the American Cancer Society. If it spreads, however, that rate drops to 36 percent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite spending 15 years advocating for HIV awareness and risk factors, Garza was blindsided, never envisioning the disease could cause cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Studies show HIV can raise the risk of several forms of cancer, including anal cancer, because of its effects on the immune system. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;HIV has also been shown to increase the risk of contracting human papillomavirus (HPV), another sexually transmitted infection that causes more than nine in 10 cases of anal cancer. Garza believes he acquired HPV at some point in the early 2000s. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Research also estimates that men who have sex with men, such as Garza, are up to 20 times more likely to be diagnosed with anal cancer, as HPV can be transmitted to the anus through anal sex. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'After all these years of doing education and prevention and advocacy, I had never heard of the cancers that were associated with HIV,' Garza, now 55, told the Daily Mail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I didn't know that. I've never heard it talked about. It was never brought up. As gay and Latino men, we don't talk about any cancers below the belt, and it just never came up.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Each year, anal cancer affects about 11,000 Americans, roughly 70 percent of whom are women due to a higher likelihood of contracting HPV. Anal cancer kills just under 2,200 people, with an even split between men and women. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The overall risk of being diagnosed with the disease is about one in 500, according to the American Cancer Society, and it accounts for just 0.5 percent of all new cancer cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Data from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) estimates 30 percent of anal cancer patients are between 55 and 64 years old, and the average age at diagnosis is 64. However, HIV is most often diagnosed in people between the ages of 25 and 34, which could be contributing to anal cancer in people under 50. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pictured: Garza during his cancer treatments. He is now cancer-free, but the disease caused him to lose half of his anal sphincter &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above graph from the American Cancer Society shows the gradual increase in anal cancer cases from 1975 through 2023, the latest data available&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Anal cancer in the US saw an average yearly increase of three percent from 2001 to 2015. Federal data suggests there was a 46 percent surge between 2005 and 2018, largely among older people who did not get the opportunity to be vaccinated for HPV when they were younger. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The HPV vaccine was first introduced in 2006 and was only recommended for girls and women between the ages of nine and 26. It was approved for boys in 2009. The recommended age range meant that much of the still-vulnerable, older population missed out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;HPV can also lay dormant for decades, which may be fueling an increase of anal cancer in people in their 50s and 60s. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After his diagnosis, Garza immediately went into advocate mode and began documenting parts of his cancer journey. He made a series of YouTube videos for the first 30 days after his diagnosis, which went up until he shaved his head before receiving chemotherapy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'That side of me was like, "Yes, let's do this. Let's talk about this,"' he told the Daily Mail. 'If I didn't know how to start the conversation, there was going to be millions of people out there that don't know how to either, we need to learn together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'But the other part of me, as a Latino gay man, did feel some shame.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When Fawcett died of anal cancer at age 62, it sparked an overwhelming amount of speculation from fans and tabloids about her sex life. Anal cancer was long seen as taboo and inherently tied to sexuality and sex habits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pictured: Garza (right) with his partner, Christian (left). Garza told the Daily Mail that he struggled with feelings of shame after being diagnosed with anal cancer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above graph from a 2022 study in the Journal of Clinical Oncology shows an increase in anal cancer in men and women above the age of 50 in 2014 - 2018 compared to 2001 - 2005&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Garza also told the Daily Mail that he worried damage to his anus from cancer and treatments could impact intimacy with his longtime partner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It's a lot of trauma,' he said. 'It's part of our identity, so I developed some shame and some stigma. There was a time where I was like, "Is this my fault? Is this the punishment for my sexuality?"'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Garza started treatment in late May 2015, which included 38 rounds of radiation, weekly chemotherapy and 40 rounds of hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;HBOT involves lying flat in a chamber with up to three times more air pressure than normal. The goal is to breathe pure oxygen, allowing the blood to carry more of it than usual to damaged tissues and accelerate healing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While lifesaving, the radiation used to destroy his cancer caused Garza to lose half of his anal sphincter. This may later lead to pain and issues controlling bowel movements. To combat this, Garza was fitted in April 2016 with an ostomy bag, which diverts waste from the digestive tract through an opening in the abdomen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Garza stayed on maintenance treatments until 2017, when he was declared cancer free. Doctors believe his chance of the cancer returning is slim, but he undergoes regular blood tests to check for elevated tumor markers like carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and to keep an eye on his HIV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Garza said anal cancer has, however, changed his relationship with his partner, who was also his main caregiver during treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Garza has now shifted his advocacy work to focus on both HIV and anal cancer. He is the director of outreach at Cheeky Charity&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'When a partner becomes a caregiver, there is this new connection between the patient and the caregiver, because you have to put aside the relationship part,' Garza told the Daily Mail. 'It changed the way we saw each other mentally because we both went through this journey together.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Damage to Garza's body has also made intimacy a challenge for the couple, though he said they have adapted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Garza has also shifted his advocacy work to focus not just on HIV but on anal cancer and other forms of the disease that are more prevalent among the HIV-positive community. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I participate in HIV conferences, I go to cancer conferences,' he said. 'I've done some research and study conferences. I've added information about HPV, mental health, body dysmorphia, sexuality - my story has grown.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He also encouraged others experiencing symptoms like anal bleeding, abdominal pain and bloating to seek a second opinion if they feel dismissed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Don't ignore the signs,' he told the Daily Mail. 'If you know something's going on and you've done all the recommendations and it's still happening, get a second opinion. It's okay to offend your doctor a bit, as long as it's about your body.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Having colorblindness could be even more of a disadvantage than commonly thought. Research published this month might indicate that colorblind people are less able to literally spot certain cancers before it’s too late.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers at Stanford University and others examined the medical records of people with color blindness and cancer. Compared to others, colorblind people had a higher chance of not surviving their bladder cancer, they found. The results suggest that individuals with colorblindness often don’t perceive blood in their urine, the researchers say—a key early warning sign of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I’m hopeful that this study raises some awareness, not only for patients with colorblindness, but for our colleagues who see these patients,” senior study author Ehsan Rahimy, adjunct clinical associate professor of ophthalmology, &lt;a href="https://news.stanford.edu/stories/2026/01/colorblindness-bladder-cancer-mortality-risk-study-research"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; the Stanford Report over the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;A color disadvantage&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Colorblindness, or color vision deficiency, is relatively common, though much more so in men. About 8% of men are &lt;a href="https://www.colourblindawareness.org/colour-blindness/"&gt;estimated&lt;/a&gt; to have some degree of colorblindness, compared to 0.5% of women.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Most cases are caused by genetic mutations, and the condition comes in several forms depending on how a person’s cone cells function abnormally. Our cones normally recognize blue, red, and green light and send corresponding signals to the brain; the perception of other colors then comes from the mixing and interpretation of these signals by the brain. That said, many colorblind people tend to have trouble seeing both red and green.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s sometimes so mild that people will go years or even their entire lives without knowing they have it. But some case reports and small studies have hinted that colorblind people have a worse time on average when they develop bladder or colorectal cancer. Since these cancers regularly cause blood to show up in urine or stool (often without pain) before more apparent symptoms, some researchers have hypothesized that colorblind people simply don’t see these early indicators.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;To better unravel this potential phenomenon, the researchers examined a large database of electronic health records. They analyzed the records of 136 colorblind people diagnosed with bladder cancer, as well as 187 colorblind people with colorectal cancer. Both groups were compared to similar non-colorblind people with these cancers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Colorblind people with bladder cancer lived shorter lives compared to their non-colorblind counterparts, the researchers found. Over a 20-year span, colorblind people with bladder cancer had a 52% higher risk of dying in general. Interestingly, though, there was no apparent difference in survival between colorblind and non-colorblind people who had colorectal cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The researchers aren’t exactly sure why this pattern was only seen with bladder cancer. But they note that colorectal cancer can cause other early, noticeable symptoms besides a bloody stool, including chronic diarrhea or constipation. The average person is routinely advised to start getting screened for colorectal cancer as early as &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/colon-rectal-cancer/detection-diagnosis-staging/acs-recommendations.html"&gt;age 45&lt;/a&gt;, which could reduce the time it takes for people with colorblindness to notice something wrong compared to everyone else.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;What should this mean for colorblind people?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers caution their findings shouldn’t be seen as definitive proof of a causative link between colorblindness and worse outcomes for bladder cancer. Nor are they calling for radical changes in the advice that doctors give to such individuals, at least right now. But the study does warrant further research and awareness of the potential perception gap that colorblind people might face with these cancers, they argue.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“This is a hypothesis-generating paper that should raise clinicians’ diagnostic suspicion for bladder cancer in patients with color vision deficiency and prompt further investigation into whether screening for bladder cancer should be introduced for high-risk individuals with color vision deficiency,” they wrote in their paper, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s44360-025-00032-7"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; this month in Nature Health.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Scientists have long known that &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/cycling-lower-dementia-risk-study-11757686" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;physical activity is linked to better cognitive function&lt;/a&gt; later in life.

What's been less clear is whether exercise can actually change the physical structure of the brain—and whether these changes show up on scans.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A team of researchers from the AdventHealth Research Institute and the University of Pittsburgh wanted to find out. They designed a year-long clinical trial to examine whether following &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/exercise-every-day-study-11707905" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;standard exercise guidelines&lt;/a&gt; could slow or even reverse something called "brain age"—a measure of how old your brain looks on an MRI compared to your actual age. The results were published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Sport and Health Science&lt;/em&gt;. Let's break down what they found.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The researchers recruited 130 healthy adults between the ages of 26 and 58 for a single-blind, 12-month randomized clinical trial. Participants were randomly assigned to one of two groups: a moderate-to-vigorous intensity aerobic exercise group or a control group that was asked not to change their activity levels.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Those in the exercise group attended two &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/exercise-every-day-study-11707905" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;supervised 60-minute workout sessions&lt;/a&gt; each week in a laboratory setting and added home-based exercise to reach roughly 150 minutes of aerobic activity per week. That’s the amount recommended by the American College of Sports Medicine. Participants could &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/is-walking-a-good-enough-form-of-exercise-11743962" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;walk, jog or run on a treadmill&lt;/a&gt;, or use equipment like bikes, elliptical machines or rowers. Heart rate monitors tracked their exercise intensity throughout the study.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; At the start and end of the study, researchers measured participants' brain structure using MRI scans and assessed their cardiorespiratory fitness through a test called peak oxygen uptake (VO2peak). Using a machine learning tool called brainageR, they calculated each person's "brain-predicted age difference," or brain-PAD—essentially, how much older or younger the brain appeared compared to the person's chronological age.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; After 12 months, clear differences emerged between the two groups. Participants in the exercise group showed a measurable decrease in brain age—their brains looked about 0.6 years younger at the end of the study compared to the beginning. Meanwhile, the control group showed a slight increase in brain age (about 0.35 years older), though this change wasn't statistically significant.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When the researchers compared the two groups directly, the gap was close to one full year in favor of the exercise group. Unsurprisingly, the exercise group also showed &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7939026/encouraging-news-study-finds-physical-activity-not-weight-loss-key-reducing-health-risks/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;significant improvements in fitness&lt;/a&gt;. Interestingly, the researchers also found that higher fitness levels at the start of the study were associated with younger-looking brains.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There are some important limitations to keep in mind. The study involved healthy, relatively well-educated volunteers, and the sample size was modest. The COVID-19 pandemic also affected participation, as some people had to continue exercising at home during shutdowns. Additionally, while the researchers explored potential explanations for why exercise improved brain age—including changes in fitness, body composition, blood pressure and a brain protein called BDNF—none of these factors fully explained the effect. The exact mechanism remains unknown.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "People often ask, 'Is there anything I can do now to protect my brain later?’ Our findings support the idea that &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/movement-for-longevity-study-11773321" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;following current exercise guidelines&lt;/a&gt;—150 minutes per week of moderate-to-vigorous aerobic activity—may help keep the brain biologically younger, even in midlife," senior author and neuroscientist Kirk I. Erickson, Ph.D., says in a press release.&lt;span data-cite="2" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The focus on midlife is particularly important. Many studies on exercise and brain health have concentrated on older adults, after age-related changes have already become more pronounced. This study suggests that starting earlier—in your 30s, 40s and 50s—may offer greater benefits over time by giving your brain a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/habits-women-in-their-20s-should-start-for-healthy-aging-11708753" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;head start against aging&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you're not currently meeting the 150-minute-per-week recommendation, don't worry. You can start where you are. Try adding short walks throughout your day, taking the stairs instead of the elevator or scheduling a few sessions at the gym each week. Activities like brisk walking, cycling, swimming and dancing all count as moderate-to-vigorous aerobic exercise. The key is consistency: participants in this study exercised regularly for a full year to see results.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you have any health conditions or haven't exercised in a while, talk to your health care provider before starting a new fitness routine. They can help you create a plan that's safe, approachable and effective for your individual needs.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A new study in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Sport and Health Science&lt;/em&gt; suggests that following basic aerobic exercise guidelines—150 minutes per week of moderate-to-vigorous activity—can make your brain appear measurably younger on MRI scans. After one year, adults who exercised regularly showed brains that looked nearly a year younger than those who didn't change their habits. While the changes were modest, researchers believe that even small shifts in brain age during midlife could add up to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/top-mistakes-to-avoid-for-cognitive-health-11779797" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;meaningful protection against cognitive decline&lt;/a&gt; later on. So if you've been looking for motivation to move more, consider this: your brain will thank you.

"We will continue to follow the science."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The AAP continues to broadly recommend routine immunization against RSV, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, rotavirus, flu and meningococcal disease. Twelve major medical and health care organizations have formally endorsed its recommendations, including the American Medical Association, the National Medical Association and the American Academy of Family Physicians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;In contrast, the updated CDC schedule narrowed recommendations for protection against meningococcal disease, hepatitis B and hepatitis A to children who are at higher risk for infections. It also recommends that choices on vaccinations against flu, Covid-19 and rotavirus be based on "shared clinical decision-making," which means people who want one must consult with a health care provider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"After an exhaustive review of the evidence, we are aligning the U.S. childhood vaccine schedule with international consensus while strengthening transparency and informed consent," US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said after the vaccine schedule update. "This decision protects children, respects families, and rebuilds trust in public health."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;There were no safety issues or new research to suggest that the vaccines on the CDC's previous schedule weren't necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"For now, unfortunately, we have to ignore everything about vaccines that is coming from our federal government," said Dr. Sean O'Leary, chair of the AAP's Committee on Infectious Diseases. "Parents should trust their pediatrician, trust the professional societies like the American Academy of Pediatrics."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The half-dozen pediatricians who spoke with CNN they said they'll stick with the AAP's guidance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Dr. Sarah Elizabeth DeRoo, a pediatrician at Children's National in Washington, DC, says that she will continue to share "very candidly" with families about vaccines and that "we know they're safe and effective."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;When the CDC's vaccine schedule changed this month, she said, it undermined some parents' confidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"We have families that come into our clinic that traditionally have been very accepting of vaccines and they want to know, 'is this new recommendation, is this evidence-based, or do I need to think differently about these vaccines' that they've accepted previously?" DeRoo said. "We've been giving messaging to our patients that we're continuing to follow the recommended schedule by the American Academy of Pediatrics, which is an evidence- based schedule."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The disconnect between advice from the CDC and from doctors has confused and even scared some parents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"We are seeing the vaccine conversation come up more and more frequently because of fear of this and general misinformation spreading online," said Dr. Nina Alfieri, Continuity Clinic director with Lurie Children's Pediatrics at Uptown in Chicago. "We always want families to feel welcome coming to clinic with their questions."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Dr. Adam Ratner, a pediatric infectious disease specialist at NYU, said he gets why parents are asking more questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"We've had so many years of the CDC being a reliable source of information," he said. "It's understandable why families are confused."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Historically, states have followed CDC recommendations, but most say they will now follow AAP recommendations instead, according to KFF, a health policy organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;As of January 20, KFF found, 28 states were giving advice that deviates from federal guidelines for some or all childhood vaccines. Although it's not clear how states will handle vaccine requirements for schools, what is clear is that there is a real blue/red divide on which vaccine advice to follow, according to Jen Kates, a co-author of the analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;All states with Democratic governors have announced that they won't follow federal guidelines. Only four states led by Republicans have done the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"For the first time in our country, we're going to have really varying laws, policies and attitudes about vaccines based on where people live," Kates said. "It's a major sea change in public health policy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Hoyen, of UH Rainbow Babies and Children's, has been practicing medicine for 30 years and said she doesn't want to go back to the pre-vaccine days. She remembers a colleague who was deaf in one ear because of a childhood case of mumps and another in the same class who was deaf in one ear because of meningitis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Meningitis was so common before the Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) vaccine came into use in 1987, she remembers, that pediatricians routinely kept spinal tap equipment on hand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"They'd do the taps in the office, give them a dose of penicillin or whatever and send them straight to the hospital," Hoyen said. "There's a reason why these vaccines were created. It's to help kids thrive and not to have to worry about complications from these childhood illnesses."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;O'Leary also doesn't want to go back to the pre-vaccine era. He trained to be a doctor in the 1990s, before there was a vaccine against rotavirus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"We had three seasons. In the winter, we had influenza season, we had RSV season, and we had rotavirus season. Heaven forbid if they all hit at the same time, because we'd be overwhelmed. Now, we don't have a rotavirus season, and we're seeing a very big impact on RSV season with the new product," O'Leary said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;DeRoo, who has only been caring for children during what she called "the vaccine era," says she's been trying to refresh her knowledge of what vaccine-preventable diseases look like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"We have to rethink how we're approaching people who walk in and are sick in the clinic, to make sure that we take all the appropriate precautions in the event that they may not be fully immunized," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Ratner said a measles outbreak in New York a few years ago was the first time many of his colleagues had ever seen a case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"I think, given the way that things are going in this country, that is likely to change," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"The idea of going backwards is horrifying because you don't want to lose hard-won progress, but also because we're not talking about something abstract," Ratner said. "We're talking about actual children and families."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;&lt;em class=" "&gt;The-CNN-Wire &amp;amp;  2026 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

            The fast-growing measles outbreak in South Carolina is now the largest in the United States since the disease was declared eliminated in this country more than two decades ago.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkwxk87q00043b6s5tm6zaeg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            With 789 cases reported as of Tuesday, the South Carolina outbreak surpassed a massive outbreak in Texas, which reached 762 cases before it ended in August last year. Two children died during the outbreak in Texas.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkwxk87r00053b6ssqgaimdw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            South Carolina, which first reported cases in October, has added more than 600 cases in 2026 alone. At least 18 people – adults and children – have been hospitalized for complications of measles, the state health department said Tuesday, and no deaths have been reported.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkwy1brr00003b6rdwrtk2p8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There are an additional 557 people in quarantine in South Carolina, meaning they may have been exposed to measles and don’t have immunity to it through vaccination or prior infection. The health department reported exposures at three additional schools Tuesday, on top of existing quarantines among students at 20 others.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkwwmez800003b6sui0181yu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Cases in North Carolina and Washington have also been linked to the South Carolina outbreak.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkwxktfm000b3b6st1b0uvzo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Measles was declared eliminated in the US in 2000, meaning there has not been continuous transmission for more than a year at a time.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkwxktfm000c3b6s48sjsvg0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Before 2025, there were an average of about 180 measles cases reported each year since elimination, according to US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data. The US reported more than 2,200 confirmed measles cases in 2025 — significantly more than there have been in any year since 2000.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkwxktfm000d3b6sn04kondx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The CDC &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; on Friday that there have been 416 confirmed measles cases reported in the US so far in 2026, but its update included data up until Thursday, before South Carolina’s latest numbers came in. At least 14 states have reported a confirmed measles case so far this year, and another large outbreak continues to grow along the Arizona-Utah border.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkwxktfm000e3b6sefxjhxrc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The spread of measles over the past year has left the US at &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/09/health/measles-elimination-investigation"&gt;risk of losing elimination status&lt;/a&gt;, which the Pan American Health Organization could decide to revoke when it meets in April.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkwxktfm000f3b6smuntsyv8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The CDC previously &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;called&lt;/a&gt; measles elimination “a historic public health achievement,” possible in large part because of vaccination.The measles vaccine was licensed in 1963 and the combination measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine that is most commonly used first became widely available in the US in the 1970s.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkwxktfm000g3b6shbfzjgss@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Previously, the country’s elimination status was threatened in 2019, amid &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/10/health/measles-outbreak-new-york-2019-lessons-learned"&gt;large outbreaks in New York&lt;/a&gt; concentrated in Orthodox Jewish communities in Brooklyn and Rockland County.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkwxks2x00093b6siyiki2x3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Under US Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime vaccine skeptic, the federal government’s posture toward measles has changed.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkwxl5jg000l3b6suk3z4dp4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            CDC Principal Deputy Director Dr. Ralph Abraham, a former Louisiana surgeon general who &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/25/health/cdc-deputy-director-ralph-abraham"&gt;ended &lt;/a&gt;some &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/25/health/cdc-deputy-director-ralph-abraham"&gt;vaccine promotion&lt;/a&gt; in his state before &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2025/2025-principal-deputy-director.html" target="_blank"&gt;taking&lt;/a&gt; his new post late last year, argued last week that ongoing measles transmission from the Texas outbreak, which started in January 2025, has not been proved.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkwxl5jg000m3b6s5ojaok0x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Nonetheless, Abraham said the loss of measles elimination status would “not really” be significant.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkwxl5jg000n3b6s0cpsoc06@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s just the cost of doing business with our borders,” Abraham told reporters in a briefing. “We have these communities that choose to be unvaccinated. That’s their personal freedom.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkwxl5jg000o3b6stl68lg99@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Abraham added that “vaccination remains the most effective way to prevent measles” and said the CDC is “here to help,” but they’re willing to listen to alternatives “for treatment and prevention.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkwxl5jg000p3b6spk90rb55@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The vast majority of cases in the South Carolina outbreak are among children, nearly all of whom were not fully vaccinated with the recommended two doses of MMR vaccine. Of the 789 cases reported as of Tuesday, more than 700 were not vaccinated or had not received the two recommended MMR doses, the health department said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkwxl5jg000q3b6sy3k6rfc2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            State health officials have been encouraging vaccination, including through facilitating mobile health unit vaccination events, to try to contain the outbreak.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkwxl5jg000r3b6slq85frsi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In Spartanburg County, the epicenter of the outbreak, 90% of students had required immunizations in the 2024-25 school year, among the lowest vaccination rates in the state, according to state &lt;a href="https://dph.sc.gov/health-wellness/child-teen-health/school-vaccination-coverage-data/school-vaccination-coverage-and" target="_blank"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt; – with some schools there reporting much lower rates. Public health experts say a 95% vaccination rate is typically needed to keep measles from spreading in a community because the virus is so contagious.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkwxl5jg000s3b6s39ku09t0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The MMR vaccine is widely available at doctors’ offices, pharmacies and health departments, and is free for many families through the Vaccines for Children program or health insurance, State Epidemiologist Dr. Linda Bell said last week.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkwxl5jg000t3b6s6ybec8no@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “As we continue to watch this daily surge in cases, [the Department of Public Health] strongly encourages those who are not protected to take advantage of the opportunity to get protected against unexpected exposures and illnesses now to help us stop this outbreak and to help us protect our communities,” Bell said.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Scientists at the University of California San Diego have discovered a path between the brain and the immune system that could potentially lead to new ways to ease heart attacks. They showed that disabling specific parts of that circuit could profoundly improve outcomes in mice with experimentally induced heart attacks.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The injury almost disappears," says UCSD neuroscientist&lt;a href="https://theaugustinelab.org/" target="_blank"&gt; Vineet Augustine&lt;/a&gt;, who led the new &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(25)01506-5?rss=yes" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; appearing Tuesday in the journal &lt;em&gt;Cell&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;While it may not seem obvious how neuroimmune crosstalk relates to heart disease, links between the nervous and immune systems have captivated researchers for decades. Some researchers have focused on the vagus nerve, a huge bundle of fibers that carries signals between the brain and other organs to control breathing, blood pressure, digestion and other involuntary functions.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;A key discovery came in 2000 when researchers at the Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research on Long Island, New York, showed that electrically stimulating the vagus nerve in rats curbed production of an immune protein that drives inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Last July, an implantable&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/03/nx-s1-5272748/vagus-nerve-stimulation-may-tame-autoimmune-diseases" target="_blank"&gt; vagus nerve stimulator&lt;/a&gt; developed by SetPoint Medical — a company co-founded by Dr.&lt;a href="https://feinstein.northwell.edu/institutes-researchers/our-researchers/kevin-j-tracey-md" target="_blank"&gt; Kevin Tracey&lt;/a&gt;, president of the Feinstein Institutes — earned FDA approval as a treatment for people with rheumatoid arthritis, an autoimmune disease.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Earlier research had also found striking links between the cardiovascular system and the nervous and immune systems. On the day of the devastating 1994 Northridge earthquake, the number of&lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJM199602153340701" target="_blank"&gt; sudden cardiac deaths&lt;/a&gt; in Los Angeles County rose more than fivefold. Similar spikes occur with high-stakes sporting events. During stressful moments, the heart rate shoots up to protect us.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The brain says, hey, get up and run, you're going to die," says Dr.&lt;a href="https://www.uclahealth.org/providers/kalyanam-shivkumar" target="_blank"&gt; Kalyanam Shivkumar&lt;/a&gt;, a UCLA cardiac electrophysiologist.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;While such fight-or-flight signals help during emergencies, in the long term, they trigger harmful inflammation. "And then the heart swells up. You get arrhythmias and heart failure," says Shivkumar, who's leading an effort to create a&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/05/26/nx-s1-4974797/the-anatomical-atlas-used-by-doctors-has-a-dark-history-one-man-is-pushing-for-change" target="_blank"&gt; new anatomical atlas&lt;/a&gt; of the heart.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The current research from UCSD uses state-of-the-art tools from genetics and neuroscience to gain a more precise understanding of how the brain communicates with the heart and its role in heart attacks.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;It shows how the vagus nerve carries signals between the brain and the heart. Augustine says he found that during a heart attack in mice, certain vagal neurons (TRPV1 expressing neurons) "literally wrap around the injury site." His team wondered if blocking communication through those nerve cells could help slow or even prevent heart attacks in the lab animals.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;It was a bold idea — one that some scientists told Augustine was "unreal" when he spoke about the project in its early stages four or five years ago.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The experiments were technically demanding and required multiple researchers to work long hours together — one performing heart surgery on the mice, another targeting specific cells in the brain, and others taking physiological measurements and conducting echocardiography to image the heart in real-time.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Minor errors at any step could have compromised the entire experiment," Saurabh Yadav, a postdoc in Augustine's lab and one of the paper's first authors, said via email. "There were moments when I wondered whether I had taken on too much or if this was simply too big a leap."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Then came an "incredibly encouraging" moment, Yadav told NPR. The team turned off this small group of TRPV1 nerve cells and saw striking improvements in pumping efficiency and electrical signals associated with heart contraction. And that was just the first victory.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The TRPV1 neurons carry signals from the heart to the hypothalamus — a deep-brain structure that regulates body temperature, thirst, hunger and sleep. Other cells in the hypothalamus receive those signals and relay them to a different cluster of nerve cells that project back to the heart and unleash an immune protein that drives inflammation. Blocking any of the three junctures of the heart-brain-immune loop relieved heart attack complications in the mice, the UCSD team reports in &lt;em&gt;Cell&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The findings in this paper are quite impressive," says&lt;a href="https://profiles.icahn.mssm.edu/cameron-s-mcalpine" target="_blank"&gt; Cameron McAlpine&lt;/a&gt;, a neuroimmunologist at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai who was not involved in the new research.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;While he and others have long known that heart attacks trigger major changes in the immune and nervous systems, McAlpine says, it's only in the last five or six years that researchers have developed "tools and technologies that allow us to study this at a really deep level" — such as some of the genetic approaches for precisely manipulating the activity in specific groups of nerve cells.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For years, research in this area stalled because of a conceptual divide — the idea that the brain is the command center, sending signals to the rest of the body, Augustine says. Clinicians "focused on the organ itself, whereas the nervous system was kind of ignored," he adds. "That created a lot of silos." &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Now, interest in the nervous and immune systems is surging. These systems "affect practically everything in your body," he says. "The field is really exploding."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;While the mouse findings are still years from entering human trials, it's possible that the approved vagus nerve stimulator could prove useful for heart attacks after further study, says &lt;a href="https://english.tau.ac.il/profile/rollsasya" target="_blank"&gt;Asya Rolls&lt;/a&gt;, a neuroimmunologist at Tel Aviv University in Israel. Her team has shown that the&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s44161-024-00491-3" target="_blank"&gt; brain's reward networks&lt;/a&gt; can regulate inflammation in mice in various settings including bacterial infections and cancer as well as heart attacks.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In future experiments, Augustine says his team will flesh out the heart-brain-immune circuit by investigating, for example, what exactly the nerve cells are sensing and how they communicate with the heart cells.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In a 2024 paper, McAlpine and colleagues report that heart attacks send immune cells into the brain to&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08100-w" target="_blank"&gt; promote deep sleep&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The growing body of research illustrates how brain-immune connections can manifest differently across conditions — and "it's likely much more complex" than the specific pathways identified by each research team, Rolls told NPR via email. Each manipulation likely affects many other pathways such as blood flow, vascularization and metabolism. A National Institutes of Health program called&lt;a href="https://ncats.nih.gov/research/research-activities/SPARC" target="_blank"&gt; Stimulating Peripheral Activity to Relieve Conditions (SPARC&lt;/a&gt;) is funding research on stimulating neural circuits to relieve disease.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Shivkumar sees an emerging theme. "The message people should get is, oh my God, these scientists are doing something very exciting. But literally we are building on ancient knowledge," he says. Research on stimulating the vagus nerve supports "what the Buddha said: meditate. I call it Zen cardiology."&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Mainstream doctors aren’t backing down from a fight with Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the current U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services. The American Academy of Pediatrics has just released its own recommendations for which vaccines children and teens should receive—with some notable differences from the version recently tabled by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The AAP &lt;a href="https://downloads.aap.org/AAP/PDF/AAP-Immunization-Schedule.pdf"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; its childhood vaccine schedule on Monday, with the endorsement of 12 other medical organizations and groups, including the American Medical Association, the Infectious Diseases Society of America, and the Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine. The recommendations are in line with the AAP’s prior guidance but contain several vaccines no longer universally recommended by RFK Jr.’s CDC, including the flu shot.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“The AAP will continue to provide recommendations for immunizations that are rooted in science and are in the best interest of the health of infants, children and adolescents of this country,” said AAP President Andrew Racine in a &lt;a href="https://www.aap.org/en/news-room/news-releases/aap/2025/american-academy-of-pediatric-issues-recommended-childhood-and-adolescent-immunization-schedule-for-2026/"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; released by the organization. “Routine childhood immunizations are an important early step in the path to lifelong health.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Tried and tested&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Last month, RFK Jr. and the Trump administration &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/trump-rfk-jr-are-officially-tearing-down-the-childhood-vaccine-schedule-2000705661"&gt;abruptly removed&lt;/a&gt; several vaccines from the recommended childhood vaccination schedule—a longstanding goal of the anti-vaccination movement. The CDC now only endorses childhood vaccines for 11 diseases, down from the 18 diseases previously recommended by the health agency.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The changes supposedly align the U.S. with other peer countries, federal officials have said, but the new schedule actually only copies that of Denmark—which vaccinates against 10 diseases—with one addition, chickenpox. Those left on the cutting room floor included hepatitis A and B, rotavirus, RSV, flu, and meningococcal disease. The CDC had previously removed the covid-19 vaccine from its routine schedule last year.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Many experts at the time lambasted the changes and the rationale behind them. Many countries recommend more childhood vaccines than Denmark does, including Canada, Japan, and Germany. Denmark’s schedule is also influenced by factors specific to the country and not the U.S., such as a universal health care system that better screens for diseases like hepatitis B. Vaccines for these diseases are now only recommended for high-risk groups or as part of a “shared clinical decision-making” process.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Just as importantly, there is no solid evidence that the timing and amount of vaccines previously recommended by the CDC posed any added risk to children’s health. And studies have continuously rebuffed antivaxxers’ &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/cdc-website-now-boosts-debunked-link-between-vaccines-and-autism-2000688898"&gt;claims&lt;/a&gt; made about specific routine vaccines, such as a supposed link between autism and the measles, mumps, and rubella, or MMR, vaccine (still on the current schedule).&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The AAP’s schedule covers the same diseases previously recommended by the CDC. It also maintains a recommendation for children to get two doses of the HPV vaccine starting as early as ages 9 to 12, as opposed to the CDC’s new recommendation of one dose at age 11 or 12 (while some research has suggested one dose can provide effective protection, this strategy is still being evaluated, the AAP said).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“AAP recommends immunizations that have been designed to teach the immune system to recognize and resist serious diseases,” said Sean O’Leary, chair of the AAP Committee on Infectious Diseases, in a statement. “They are carefully tested and monitored over time. The pacing and combination of vaccines are based on what we know about when your child’s immune system is ready to learn and respond best.”&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;The growing resistance&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The AAP’s new schedule is the most recent sign that doctors and local health officials won’t easily go along with RFK Jr.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While states have long relied on the CDC’s guidance to shape their vaccine policy, for instance, numerous state health departments have formed their own coalitions during the second Trump term and have &lt;a href="https://health.ny.gov/press/releases/2025/2025-12-10_hepatitis_b_votes.htm"&gt;stated&lt;/a&gt; that they will not carry out the changes endorsed by RFK Jr.’s CDC. The AAP and other organizations have also &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/aapnews/news/33682/Updated-AAP-lawsuit-seeks-to-replace-ACIP-members?autologincheck=redirected"&gt;launched&lt;/a&gt; lawsuits against the Trump administration for past abrupt shifts to its vaccine policy and are now &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/aapnews/news/34241"&gt;challenging&lt;/a&gt; the latest changes in court, too.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;For the time being, though, it appears that RFK Jr. and his allies will continue to push the envelope in their agenda against vaccines. Over the weekend, Kirk Miloan, chair of the CDC’s advisory vaccine committee—a panel unilaterally reshaped by RFK Jr. last year—&lt;a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Health/chair-cdcs-vaccine-advisory-committee-questions-polio-shot/story?id=129580522"&gt;questioned &lt;/a&gt;whether Americans still needed vaccines for polio and measles. Notably, the U.S. is in the midst of a measles resurgence, one that might soon cause the country to lose its official measles-free status.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The beauty industry has a way of convincing us that better skin always costs more money, more steps and more patience than we actually have. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But &lt;a data-aps-asc-tag="nypost-20" data-aps-asin="B01MDTVZTZ" data-wrapped-template="https://r.nypostlink.com?btn_ref=org-19984c113c692001&amp;amp;btn_url" href="https://r.nypostlink.com?btn_ref=org-19984c113c692001&amp;amp;btn_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FOrdinary-Niacinamide-10-Zinc-30ml%2Fdp%2FB01MDTVZTZ%3Fref_%3Dpb_hm_dp%26th%3D1%26tag%3Dnypost-20%26asc_refurl%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fnypost.com%2F2026%2F01%2F27%2Fshopping%2Fthis-6-serum-delivers-results-and-has-thousands-of-fans%2F%26asc_source%3Dweb" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-nyp-affiliate="true"&gt;The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1% Serum&lt;/a&gt; proves the opposite, sitting on shelves at a $6 price tag and with a reputation you can count on.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s the kind of product that makes you question why you ever paid triple digits for serums that promised the same results (even though some are worth it). However, The Ordinary proves that a simple, effective and refreshingly no-nonsense formula can earn cult status by keeping it simple.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The real magic of this serum lies in its ingredient lineup and how hard it works behind the scenes. &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/article/best-niacinamide-serums-per-dermatologists/"&gt;Niacinamide&lt;/a&gt;, also known as vitamin B3, is a multitasking favorite that skincare experts swear by. At a 10% concentration, it helps smooth uneven texture, brighten dull skin and strengthen the skin barrier so your face becomes more resilient over time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Zinc PCA at 1% supports oil control and helps keep congestion in check, making this serum especially appealing if your skin swings between shiny, clogged or unpredictably breakout-prone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite being powerful, the serum itself feels refreshingly light. It’s water-based, absorbs quickly and doesn’t leave behind that sticky or greasy feeling that can ruin an otherwise good routine. This makes it incredibly easy to layer with other products, whether you’re a minimalist who just wants &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/shopping/best-cleansers-face-washes-for-dry-skin-review/"&gt;cleanser&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/shopping/best-pdrn-skincare-products-review/"&gt;serum&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/article/best-moisturizers-for-dry-skin-face-products/"&gt;moisturizer&lt;/a&gt; or someone who loves a more involved lineup. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It works well both morning and night, slipping seamlessly under &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/article/best-sunscreen-for-face/"&gt;sunscreen&lt;/a&gt; during the day and richer creams in the evening. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"&gt;





&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest reasons this serum has become such a staple is its versatility. I use it to help control oil throughout the day, soften the appearance of &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/shopping/best-pore-pads-review/"&gt;pores&lt;/a&gt; and support clearer skin over time. It’s equally as great for evening out the skin tone and giving the face a more balanced, healthy look. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Instead of targeting just one concern, it tackles several at once, which makes it feel like a smart, efficient choice rather than an extra step you don’t really need.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Then there’s the value, which is honestly hard to overstate. Products with similar concentrations of niacinamide often cost many times more, yet this serum delivers comparable results without asking you to rethink your budget. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For beginners, &lt;a data-aps-asc-tag="nypost-20" data-aps-asin="B01MDTVZTZ" data-wrapped-template="https://r.nypostlink.com?btn_ref=org-19984c113c692001&amp;amp;btn_url" href="https://r.nypostlink.com?btn_ref=org-19984c113c692001&amp;amp;btn_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FOrdinary-Niacinamide-10-Zinc-30ml%2Fdp%2FB01MDTVZTZ%3Fref_%3Dpb_hm_dp%26th%3D1%26tag%3Dnypost-20%26asc_refurl%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fnypost.com%2F2026%2F01%2F27%2Fshopping%2Fthis-6-serum-delivers-results-and-has-thousands-of-fans%2F%26asc_source%3Dweb" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-nyp-affiliate="true"&gt;this serum&lt;/a&gt; is a low-risk way to introduce an active ingredient into a routine. For seasoned skincare lovers, it’s proof that not every effective product has to be expensive.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Cancer Vaccine Coalition and American Association for Cancer Research convene first-of-its-kind global think tank as immune-activating treatments reach a tipping point.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="legendSpanClass"&gt;NEW YORK&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="legendSpanClass"&gt;Jan. 27, 2026&lt;/span&gt; /PRNewswire/ -- Cancer vaccine research is entering a new phase as leading scientists join forces to coordinate the next stage of progress in cancer immunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientific advances in immunotherapy, technology, and immune system targeting have moved therapeutic cancer vaccines from theoretical promise toward clinical reality. The field is now entering a coordination phase aimed at accelerating patient access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Against this backdrop, more than 50 of the world's leading cancer vaccine researchers, clinicians, and cross-sector experts are meeting for &lt;i&gt;Transforming Cancer Care: A Global Think Tank to Accelerate Advances in Cancer Immunity&lt;/i&gt;, a first-of-its-kind effort designed to align priorities and advance progress across the field. The two-day think tank is organized by the Cancer Vaccine Coalition (CVC) in partnership with the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) and hosted by HSBC Innovation Banking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This is a moment where coordination becomes the catalyst," said Kristen Dahlgren, founder and CEO of the Cancer Vaccine Coalition, a breast cancer survivor, and former NBC &lt;i&gt;TODAY Show&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Nightly News&lt;/i&gt; correspondent. "I've seen the promising data from clinical trials. Patients need better therapies to help them beat cancer, and by working together, we can move advances through the system faster. With almost 1 in 2 of us expected to be diagnosed with cancer in our lifetime, there's no time to waste."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The think tank brings together leaders from top academic cancer centers, biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, as well as policy and regulatory experts to establish shared priorities and actionable strategies to accelerate cancer vaccine development and delivery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Current immunotherapies successfully treat 20% of the deadliest cancers by unleashing the power of cancer-killing T cells," said Elizabeth Jaffee, MD, deputy director of the Johns Hopkins Kimmel Cancer Center and co-chair of the two-day think tank. "Vaccines have the potential to increase the success of these immunotherapies in the other 80% of deadly cancers by creating cancer-killing T cells. The last decade of scientific discoveries has propelled vaccines toward becoming the next generation of successful immunotherapies for cancer treatment and prevention."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the think tank, participants are focused on identifying practical solutions to shared challenges, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul type="disc"&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Defining scientific priorities across cancer vaccine discovery, development, and implementation&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Improving efficiency across research and clinical translation pipelines&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Integrating emerging technologies such as AI-driven antigen prediction and novel delivery platforms&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Aligning funding strategies, regulatory pathways, and policy frameworks&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Establishing models for sustained global collaboration and equitable access&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"AACR is honored to work with the Cancer Vaccine Coalition and the think tank sponsors to convene the top experts in the field this week," said Margaret Foti, PhD, MD (hc), chief executive officer of AACR. "By bringing together an international group of dedicated, renowned researchers and patient advocates who are able to contribute a wide range of perspectives and scientific knowledge, we hope to foster the next breakthroughs in cancer vaccine research so that people diagnosed with cancer will have the opportunity to live longer and better lives."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cancer remains the second leading cause of death in the United States, claiming more than 600,000 lives each year, while millions more live with the fear of recurrence. Cancer vaccines represent a potential shift in how cancer is treated, and, ultimately, prevented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therapeutic cancer vaccines are designed to train the immune system to recognize and eliminate cancer cells, with the goal of durable, long-term immune protection. Clinical trials are currently underway across multiple cancer types, including glioblastoma, melanoma, pancreatic, breast, ovarian, and liver cancers, with early studies showing promising signals of immune response and clinical benefit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One such example is Brad Silver, who received a therapeutic cancer vaccine for stage IV glioblastoma in 2003. At the time, he was given just two months to live. Twenty-two years later, Silver is thriving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I am not supposed to be here," said Silver, who was treated in an early stage clinical trial of DCVax-L at UCLA. "The world views a stage IV glioblastoma diagnosis as a death sentence, but I'm living proof that a different outcome could be possible thanks to this clinical research. I wish everyone facing cancer could have access to vaccine-based treatments."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Global Think Tank is supported by HSBC Innovation Banking, Northwest Biotherapeutics, Pfizer and Anixa Biosciences.&lt;/p&gt;

But in certain corners of Instagram and TikTok, women are convinced it really starts much earlier. Now, in addition to the 40 weeks your body is actively growing a fetus, you also have to worry about “trimester zero” — the months before you even start trying to conceive.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;In this world, the ideal woman can’t get enough organ meat and takes double the daily recommendation of choline to boost her future baby’s IQ.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;She orders her own ferritin tests online so she can see if her iron levels are holding strong at 70 ng/mL or dipping below 50 ng/mL.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;She has no need for an alarm clock or caffeine, since she wears blue-light blockers after dark and wakes naturally with the sunrise. The air she breathes is filtered and unpolluted by artificial fragrance. Her kitchen is free of plastic and bleach. Physically, she’s the strongest she’s ever been, because she knows that for the next nine months, her body will be running the equivalent of a marathon every day.&lt;/p&gt;

But increasingly, it feels like the goal post has been moved back. On her podcast, &lt;em&gt;Culture Apothecary&lt;/em&gt;, MAHA influencer Alex Clark &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DQ7ru_5EuRN/"&gt;recommends&lt;/a&gt; women thinking about getting pregnant soon stop wearing nail polish, while holistic nutritionists say it’s important &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DPmWlMzEglq/?hl=en"&gt;to avoid drinking iced beverages&lt;/a&gt;. Influencers are &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DS7xY7zDU-I/?hl=en"&gt;chronicling their meditation journeys&lt;/a&gt; to lower cortisol six months before trying to conceive, while others are &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DG4KiB2O-lo/?hl=en"&gt;ordering direct-to-consumer micronutrient labs&lt;/a&gt; and embarking on &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DHlSeiHR1Ee/?hl=en&amp;amp;img_index=6"&gt;60-day pregnancy-prep detoxes&lt;/a&gt;. While the recommendations are all over the map, the message is clear: What you’re doing now could be putting your future child at a disadvantage — even if you’re not pregnant yet.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmkvrrouh00263b7a6mjy1z4n@published" data-word-count="96"&gt;I heard from a woman who eats liver every week (it tastes gross, but she read that it’s full of B vitamins) and another who got a stool analysis done to assess her gut health. A dietitian who specializes in fertility says women are coming to her for advice on how to optimize their microbiome before passing it on to their babies.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;One mother told me she became fixated on her blood sugar and worried that spikes would increase her risk of miscarriage. She started using a glucometer and stopped drinking orange juice and eating bananas.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmkvrrowg00273b7akkvkenmy@published" data-word-count="129"&gt;Many of those I spoke to mentioned reading Lily Nichols’s &lt;a href="https://realfoodforfertility.com/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Real Food For Fertility&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;which emphasizes that, even before you’re pregnant, your diet lays “the essential groundwork for your baby’s development.” That’s just one of a raft of recent books full of advice for women thinking about trying to get pregnant.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;In her forthcoming book, &lt;a href="https://www.nataliecrawfordmd.com/book"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Fertility Formula&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the reproductive endocrinologist Natalie Crawford suggests women lower their exposure to toxins by avoiding travel during rush hour.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Ann Shippy’s &lt;a href="https://annshippymd.com/the-preconception-revolution/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Preconception Revolution&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;tells women not to touch receipts or use hair dye. For the toxins that cannot be avoided, she suggests you start taking &lt;a href="https://shop.annshippymd.com/collections/all-products/products/zeo-bind"&gt;her line of detox supplements&lt;/a&gt;, which she says can help remove heavy metals from your system before you pass them on to your baby via breastmilk.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmkvrroyn00283b7a1eg26akv@published" data-word-count="164"&gt;It’s true that many couples struggle to get pregnant, and doctors like Crawford argue that the standard medical advice — start trying and see what happens — is failing women. Yet some claims about the importance of trimester zero strain credulity. According to &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CTDV-rfJuyD/"&gt;Alexandra Radway&lt;/a&gt;, who coaches women on how to prepare their bodies for conception, the women who follow her protocol have pregnancies unburdened by the inconveniences of morning sickness, fatigue, or back pain. Shippy, a functional medicine practitioner, tells me that women have been misled to believe that their fertility declines after age 35. With the right supplements and a “super-clean diet” (i.e., no gluten or dairy), she claims women can easily get pregnant well into their 40s and feel great, “because their bodies are so ready.” For women who are truly healthy, IVF is “very rarely” necessary, she says. Listening to them talk, it’s easy to come away thinking that if you struggle to get pregnant or have a difficult pregnancy, it’s your fault.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmkvrrp0y00293b7ae0bmpdze@published" data-word-count="83"&gt;Of course, your health before conception matters. But the doctors I spoke to said the things that actually make a difference are far more basic. You should take &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/folate-vs-folic-acid-prenatal-vitamins.html"&gt;a prenatal with folic acid&lt;/a&gt; and avoid smoking and drug use. You should also make sure any chronic conditions, like high blood pressure or diabetes, are under control, and get up to date with vaccines and STI testing. Most of these are things doctors would recommend to everyone, not just women planning to get pregnant.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmkvrrp3w002a3b7a1dpdvna3@published" data-word-count="87"&gt;And even if you go out of your way to micromanage your nutrients and rid your home of toxins, there’s still no guarantee you’ll get pregnant. No matter what fancy &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/mandymooremm/videos/850166884187166/"&gt;prenatal&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://thisisneeded.com/products/egg-quality-support?delivery-schedule=monthly&amp;amp;utm_source=google&amp;amp;utm_source=google&amp;amp;utm_campaign=18300978467&amp;amp;utm_term=18300978467%7C%7C&amp;amp;nbt=nb%3Aadwords%3Ax%3A18300978467%3A%3A&amp;amp;nb_adtype=pla&amp;amp;nb_kwd=&amp;amp;nb_ti=&amp;amp;nb_mi=164791643&amp;amp;nb_pc=online&amp;amp;nb_pi=47045685838069&amp;amp;nb_ppi=&amp;amp;nb_placement=&amp;amp;nb_li_ms=&amp;amp;nb_lp_ms=&amp;amp;nb_fii=&amp;amp;nb_ap=&amp;amp;nb_mt=&amp;amp;gad_source=1&amp;amp;gad_campaignid=17415527961&amp;amp;gbraid=0AAAAACtRsSjqqwgcL8T69TLJW8sj10mjH&amp;amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiAvtzLBhCPARIsALwhxdpJVaM8mnjLyhqsgXEzif1eyK7VbyY3Qc5Du1lXFMzsWCp23-DFP9gaAiSnEALw_wcB&amp;amp;variant=47045685838069"&gt;brands&lt;/a&gt; try to tell you, there’s no magical solution that will stop your eggs and ovaries from aging, says Katherine VanHise, an OB/GYN and reproductive endocrinologist at HRC Fertility Beverly Hills. And sure, some women have no problem getting pregnant in their mid-40s — but that probably has more to do with genetics than with their diet.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmkvrrp5n002b3b7aw1nt8ion@published" data-word-count="145"&gt;For many women, pregnancy is an exercise in learning to accept what we cannot control. Growing a baby inside your body requires a certain level of blind faith. Of course it’s comforting, and human, to fixate on the choices we do have.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;It’s also hard to ignore that the rulebook for how to have a healthy pregnancy is expanding at the same time that access to maternal health care is being decimated. The Trump administration has gutted the CDC’s Division of Reproductive Health, stopped collecting &lt;a href="https://parentdata.org/the-pregnancy-dataset-we-cant-afford-to-lose/"&gt;crucial data on pregnancy&lt;/a&gt;, and slashed funding for Medicaid, which &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/23/nyregion/doulas-childbirth-medicaid.html"&gt;many women rely on for prenatal care&lt;/a&gt;, while simultaneously &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/trump-rfk-jr-tylenol-autism-explained.html"&gt;urging pregnant women to “tough it out” and avoid Tylenol&lt;/a&gt; against the advice of leading medical associations. Dr. Oz recently applauded the fact that, &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@drjessicaknurick/video/7597608143023082782"&gt;facing a severe shortage of OB/GYNs&lt;/a&gt;, Alabama is now using robots to perform ultrasounds on pregnant women.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmkvrrp7a002c3b7ajdh7f76a@published" data-word-count="120"&gt;As &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/09/10/nx-s1-5101902/35-of-u-s-counties-dont-have-an-adequate-place-in-which-to-give-birth-report-finds"&gt;prenatal care becomes a luxury,&lt;/a&gt; maternal and infant health is increasingly presented as a matter of personal responsibility, with choices as basic as what to have for breakfast framed as high stakes. The noise only gets louder once you’re actually pregnant. According to Jessie Inchauspé, a.k.a. the Glucose Goddess, pregnant women should think twice before eating that bagel. Her new book, &lt;a href="https://www.glucosegoddess.com/pages/9-months-that-count-forever?srsltid=AfmBOoqYtklQeeAYKevQdghQ1wBxaQk8ty-c9nN8lPf6kYCIu48qJMBy"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nine Months That Count Forever&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, warns that overdoing it on sugar and refined grains can put your baby at risk for all sorts of health complications, including diabetes, obesity, ADHD, and autism. (OBs say that while prenatal nutrition is important, your baby’s future health &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DTyJ8pCDSPf/"&gt;is impacted by far more&lt;/a&gt; than the number of cookies you eat while pregnant.)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmkvrrpfu002d3b7aido4ylrn@published" data-word-count="125"&gt;Nervous about her chances of getting pregnant at 37, one mother told me she went on an “insane, anxiety-fueled health kick” before trying to conceive. She did acupuncture, stopped wearing perfume, swapped out her scented soap, and ate as many goji berries as she could stand. While ovulating, she took Mucinex to thin her cervical mucus. “I stopped working out with a trainer, because I’d read that if you worked out too hard, the egg wouldn’t implant.” She got pregnant after a few months of trying. Yet despite eating “the cleanest I’d ever eaten,” she was diagnosed with gestational diabetes. She knew it was most likely genetic; diabetes runs in her family. Still, she felt guilty and worried her baby was going to have blood-sugar issues.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmkvrrphw002e3b7ab05wlo97@published" data-word-count="121"&gt;“It just feels like there’s this responsibility on mothers that starts even before you’re pregnant, like, if you don’t do all these things perfectly, then you’re being irresponsible with your future child.” Now, when she takes her 2-month-old to the pediatrician and fills out the postpartum-depression assessment, she always pauses on the question: “Have you blamed yourself unnecessarily?” “I think that’s really hard to answer as a mother, when all the messaging is, ‘You need to do this and this,’” she told me on a phone call while she pumped. These days, her feeds are full of advice on everything she should eat while breastfeeding to ensure her baby is getting all the optimal nutrients. “It feels like it never ends.”&lt;/p&gt;

The condition has been linked to inflammation in the lungs that narrows the airways and makes breathing difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That inflammation was widely attributed to molecules known as "leukotrienes." These chemicals are released by white blood cells when the airways are irritated or exposed to allergens. Because leukotrienes trigger a chain reaction that tightens the airways, drugs were developed to block their effects and ease breathing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, researchers at Case Western Reserve University say those molecules may not be the primary cause after all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We've found molecules that are alike in structure but generated through a completely different chemical pathway in the body," said lead researcher Robert Salomon, the Charles Frederic Mabery Professor of Research in Chemistry. "We think the molecules we're calling 'pseudo leukotrienes,' may be the dominant players in the inflammatory cascade that causes disease."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings could lead to new approaches for treating asthma and other inflammatory conditions. Researchers say the work may also have implications for neurological diseases such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases. The study was funded by the U.S. National Institutes of Health and is available online as a pre-proof ahead of publication in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How Free Radicals Create a Different Kind of Inflammation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leukotrienes, long thought to be central to inflammatory diseases, are produced through enzyme-driven processes that modify lipids, or fatty molecules. The newly identified pseudo leukotrienes form in a very different way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Salomon and his team found that pseudo leukotrienes are created when free radicals add oxygen to lipids. Free radicals are highly reactive molecules that can cause damage if they are not controlled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The free radical process is almost like an explosion or a fire," said Salomon, who is also professor of ophthalmology in the Case Western Reserve School of Medicine. "It's just like when oxygen reacts with fuel and you get flames. It can easily get out of control."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the researchers, people with asthma may have lower levels of enzymes and antioxidant molecules that normally neutralize free radicals before they cause harm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why Current Asthma Drugs May Miss the Target&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both leukotrienes and pseudo leukotrienes trigger inflammation by binding to the same receptor, much like a key turning an ignition to start an engine. Once activated, this process leads to airway constriction in people with asthma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Medications such as Singulair work by blocking that receptor, preventing the key from fitting and stopping the reaction from starting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_bottom"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The real importance of this discovery is the possibility of treating these diseases with drugs that prevent the free radical process or moderate it rather than drugs that block the receptor," Salomon said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This approach could allow treatments to target harmful inflammation more precisely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When Inflammation Helps and When It Hurts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inflammation is not always harmful. It plays a vital role in healing by directing white blood cells to injured tissue. It is also involved in memory and normal development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some asthma drugs are currently being used off-label to treat neurological diseases. However, blocking leukotrienes may interfere with their beneficial roles in the body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"If the molecules that are causing the problem are not the leukotrienes but these other molecules," Salomon said, "a better treatment would be to just stop the formation of these other molecules rather than gumming up the ignition."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Testing the Theory in Patients&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To investigate their hypothesis, Salomon and his colleagues relied on decades of experience studying lipid oxidation, along with chemical insight, to predict that pseudo leukotrienes existed. They synthesized the molecules in the lab and developed techniques to detect them in biological samples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team analyzed urine samples from people with mild or severe asthma and compared them with samples from individuals without the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pseudo leukotrienes were not only present in asthma patients, but their levels closely matched disease severity. People with asthma, whether mild or severe, had four to five times higher levels than those without asthma. Researchers suggest these molecules could serve as a biomarker to measure disease severity and track how well treatments are working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Comes Next&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research team plans to examine whether pseudo leukotrienes also play a role in other respiratory illnesses. These include respiratory syncytial virus (commonly known as RSV), bronchiolitis in babies, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The study involved collaborators from multiple institutions. At Case Western Reserve University, the team included Mikhail Linetsky, research professor in chemistry, Masaru Miyagi, professor of pharmacology at the School of Medicine, and graduate students. Contributors from the University of Toledo included Sailaja Paruchuri, professor of physiology and pharmacology, and Lakshminarayan Teegala, assistant professor of physiology and pharmacology. At the Cleveland Clinic Children's Hospital, Fariba Rezaee participated as associate professor of pediatrics and staff physician in the Center for Pulmonary Medicine.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Supplements can help bridge nutritional gaps, but some should be taken with great caution.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Supplementing with iron, resveratrol and vitamins C and E may be harmful if not needed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Get your nutrients through food and engage in healthy lifestyle habits for healthy aging.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Aging gracefully is a goal many aspire to achieve, and living a long, healthy life often becomes a top priority as we grow older. With countless products and supplements advertised as “the key to youthful vitality,” it’s easy to feel overwhelmed or confused about what truly contributes to healthy aging. The supplement aisle, filled with promises of better energy, stronger bones, sharper minds and radiant skin, can be alluring—but also misleading. Not everything labeled as a “health booster” is as beneficial as it may seem.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While supplements can be helpful to address specific deficiencies or support overall health—especially as we age—not all are created equal. And some may even do more harm than good. It’s crucial to approach supplementation with a cautious and informed mindset, ensuring that your choices are based on science rather than marketing.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Here are some supplements you’re better off avoiding and why they may work against your goal of living a long and vibrant life.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-1-iron"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; 1. Iron &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7920421/what-is-iron-why-do-you-need-it/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Iron&lt;/a&gt; is essential for maintaining healthy red blood cells and ensuring efficient oxygen transport throughout the body. However, iron supplements may not be the best choice if your goal is aging healthily. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “I don't recommend taking iron supplements for healthy aging unless there is a specific reason and they are prescribed by your doctor,” explains &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/author/elizabeth-ward/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Elizabeth Ward, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;. “Excess iron can build up in the liver, heart and pancreas in people with hemochromatosis, an inherited condition that causes you to absorb a lot of iron. You may not know that you have this condition, which occurs in 1 in 200 to 400 people and often goes undiagnosed, so better safe than sorry."&lt;span data-cite="1" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Another downside to supplementing iron, Ward adds, is that too much iron can &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/supplements-that-may-make-medication-less-effective-11881061" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;interact with certain medications&lt;/a&gt; and decrease their effectiveness. With that said, Ward explains that some older people do need iron supplements, including those with iron-deficiency anemia due to chemotherapy or certain gastrointestinal disorders, such as celiac disease or those with chronic heart failure. However, taking iron supplements for longevity is not recommended for the generally healthy population, especially older people. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-2-resveratrol"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; 2. Resveratrol &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/foods-with-more-resveratrol-than-a-glass-of-red-wine-11752763" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Resveratrol&lt;/a&gt; is a natural compound found in grapes, red wine and certain berries, known for its antioxidant properties. It is often touted for its potential to support heart health and combat aging.&lt;span data-cite="2" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Despite its popularity and promising findings in animal studies, the doses required to replicate the effects seen in these studies are far higher than what is typically available in supplements,” says &lt;a href="https://inutritioncenter.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Vanessa Imus, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;. “Therefore, while resveratrol may offer some health benefits, it is often considered more hype than worth as a standalone supplement for healthy aging." 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; One systematic review suggests there is currently no conclusive clinical evidence to advocate resveratrol’s recommendation in any health care setting.&lt;span data-cite="3" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; High doses of resveratrol in supplement form may also interfere with certain medications, such as blood thinners, and could lead to gastrointestinal side effects.&lt;span data-cite="4" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/benefits-vitamin-c-8546809" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Vitamin C&lt;/a&gt;, also known as ascorbic acid, is a vital nutrient that supports immune function, skin health and iron absorption from &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7878282/complete-plant-based-diet-grocery-list/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;plant-based foods&lt;/a&gt;. It is a powerful antioxidant that helps protect cells from damage caused by free radicals.&lt;span data-cite="6" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Yet while vitamin C is an essential nutrient to include in one’s diet, &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/johannahkatz/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Johannah Katz, M.A., RD&lt;/a&gt;, suggests that excessive doses of vitamin C can potentially interfere with the body’s natural defense mechanisms. “Studies have shown that high levels of exogenous antioxidants, including vitamin C, might suppress the body’s endogenous antioxidant response system, which is more powerful in combating oxidative stress,” explains Katz.&lt;span data-cite="5" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “Moreover, the body tightly regulates vitamin C absorption and excess amounts are typically excreted, offering no added benefit and possibly causing side effects like gastrointestinal discomfort." 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-happens-when-you-consume-vitamin-e-regularly-8685814" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Vitamin E &lt;/a&gt;is a fat-soluble antioxidant that plays a critical role in protecting cells from oxidative damage caused by free radicals. Research indicates that vitamin E supplements should not be relied upon for longevity support due to a lack of consistent evidence demonstrating their effectiveness in extending life span.&lt;span data-cite="7" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; While vitamin E is known for its antioxidant properties, studies exploring its impact on longevity have produced mixed results.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Some research has even suggested that high doses of supplemental vitamin E may do more harm than good by disrupting the body’s natural oxidative balance and potentially increasing the risk of certain diseases, like cardiovascular issues or certain types of cancer.&lt;span data-cite="8" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/2051586/best-antioxidant-rich-foods/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Antioxidants&lt;/a&gt;, when consumed in isolated, high amounts, can sometimes interfere with the body’s normal cellular processes, leading to unintended adverse effects rather than the desired health benefits.&lt;span data-cite="9" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Healthy aging doesn't have to be complicated—it’s all about making small, intentional choices that support your body and mind over time. Here are some simple, manageable tips to get you started:&lt;span data-cite="10" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eat a Colorful Diet: &lt;/strong&gt;Focus on whole foods like fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins and healthy fats. A &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/275617/why-you-should-eat-the-rainbow-when-it-comes-to-fruits-and-vegetables/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;colorful plate&lt;/a&gt; is not only appealing but also packs a variety of nutrients your body needs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stay Active&lt;/strong&gt;: Regular exercise is key. Whether it’s walking, yoga, swimming or dancing, find &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8026823/what-is-joyful-movement/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;activities you enjoy&lt;/a&gt; and stick to them. Even 30 minutes a day can make a big difference!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prioritize Sleep:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/sleep-and-longevity-8430567" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;Quality sleep&lt;/a&gt; allows your body to repair and recharge. Aim for seven to nine hours each night and establish a consistent sleep routine to help your body clock stay on track.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keep Your Mind Engaged:&lt;/strong&gt; Challenge your brain with puzzles, reading or learning something new. Staying mentally active can help maintain cognitive health as you age.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stay Hydrated:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7870247/what-happens-when-you-drink-more-water/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;Drinking enough water&lt;/a&gt; is essential for everything from digestion to skin health. Keep a water bottle handy to remind yourself to sip throughout the day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stay Connected:&lt;/strong&gt; Maintain strong relationships and social connections with friends, family or community groups. Emotional support plays a vital role in overall well-being.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While it’s tempting to turn to supplements that promise to boost longevity, it’s important to approach them with caution. Many products on the market make bold claims but lack solid scientific backing—or worse, may pose risks to your health when taken unnecessarily. While certain supplements can help with healthy aging, it’s best to first focus on building a strong foundation for your health through balanced nutrition, regular physical activity, quality sleep and meaningful social connections. Your body thrives on these natural, time-tested care methods far more than on quick-fix solutions.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Remember, there’s no substitute for a healthy lifestyle, and the key to longevity lies in simple, mindful choices that support your overall well-being. If you’re considering taking a supplement, always talk to a health care professional to ensure it’s safe and truly needed for your situation. By staying informed and prioritizing evidence-based practices, you can take the guesswork out of aging gracefully.&lt;br&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkvor47f002x27qc1l3i781j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Terry Sigmond thought it was a cold. She even tried to get out of a New Year’s celebration, but her friend encouraged her to go.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkvrpwv8004h3b6shanrz9bw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            So began her weeks-long flu ordeal, when she dozed to Hallmark Channel movies and swapped bed-rest photos with the same friend she rang in 2026 with.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkvrvofg004j3b6siul0qq4h@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We have all these pictures together, and we’re smiling,” Sigmond said. After flu, “we send pictures to each other with tissues stuffed up our noses to catch all the dripping snot.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkvorwp600033b6soo0ze36b@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I just laid in bed for days. We have one of those Sleep Number beds that you can crank up the heat on, and I think my husband thought he was in a sauna,” said Sigmond, 64, who said she’s usually a healthy and energetic marketing manager for a home care company in Florida.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkvorwp700053b6slhmnf7ti@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Sigmond and her friend are far from alone. A brutal flu season is hitting across the country, sending record levels of people to the doctor.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkvp0uqz002s3b6sn2x7ab94@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            According to the most recent data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, dozens of cities, states or territories in the US show moderate to very high flu activity, but there are signs the season is coming down off its winter peak. Overall, the CDC estimates that there have been 19 million illnesses, 250 hospitalizations and 10,000 deaths this season — most of them caused by a new strain called &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/13/health/flu-season-subclade-k-variant"&gt;subclade K&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkvorwp700073b6skca25jks@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When CNN asked for your flu stories, we received hundreds of written responses from people like Sigmond and Jillian Luis, a 36-year-old from the Seattle area who said her family was sick for weeks.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkvorwp700083b6supg69enj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We just were kind of out of it for a whole month,” she said between coughs.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkvorwp700093b6szpq7durt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It started with her 3-year-old, then her 6-year-old. Somehow her husband avoided it.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkvorwp7000a3b6s6osqku2w@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I’m glad somebody’s healthy, but man, it’s annoying,” Luis joked.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkvor6xy00003b6swit0guo7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Luis is one of many who wrote to CNN who described the strain of juggling their regular responsibilities with a miserable illness. The one silver lining, Luis said, is that her 3-year-old became so resourceful, she figured out how to break into the sandwich bread and beef sticks. How does she know? Luis found the too-chewy beef bits in the kitchen and pieces of bread with holes nibbled out of them, “like we had a mouse.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkvot1l3000h3b6sj3ghmv5p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The next challenge, Luis said, is dialing back all the extra PBS Kids they’ve been watching. “Trying to get back into a routine and limit screen time again, now that will be the battle.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkvoskp4000e3b6sngwuybxi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Many people said they could see how conveniences developed during the Covid-19 pandemic made the flu manageable this year. But there are only so many food deliveries, off-camera Zoom meetings and TV binges to take advantage of when they’re the sickest they’ve ever felt.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkvrkqay004e3b6svo8nhm8c@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Here’s how they managed so far during this record-breaking flu season.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkvoti9k000k3b6sevyz9rcw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Lindsay Nelmes says she barely remembers New Year’s — and it wasn’t for fun reasons.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkvovmkl000r3b6sh5v1nzr0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The 43-year-old Florida mother of two describes her family as “normally pretty healthy,” but after traveling to Chicago for the holidays, all of them — including her husband and their two middle-schoolers — caught the flu and developed the same symptoms: dizziness, chills, terrible fatigue and big-time brain fog.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkvovmkl000s3b6s4373lfg6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The family spent much of the first week of 2026 in bed.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkvovmkl000t3b6szfvbp77e@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We just dropped like flies,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkvovmkl000u3b6s8o2do2ow@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            With everyone being sick, Nelmes says, her kids would come into her bedroom with their iPads and headphones and ask for medicine about every four hours. When they bounced back quicker than the adults, there was a two-day stretch in which she thinks she ordered Instacart or DoorDash six times.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkvovmkl000v3b6ssoo5uh8j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I’m going to regret looking at my bank statement,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkvovmkl000w3b6sej51w7nx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The flu wiped Nelmes out.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkvovmkl000x3b6serfz2nie@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “My husband and I, it was literally three or four days of just sleeping, not getting up, chugging Gatorade, not eating. It was bad,” Nelmes said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkvovmkl000y3b6s0sp9i4mw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Nelmes has regrets. She was so tired, she couldn’t really follow her sister’s advice to binge-watch “&lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/05/entertainment/heated-rivalry-hbo-max-hockey"&gt;Heated Rivalry&lt;/a&gt;.” (The show streams on HBO, which is owned by CNN’s parent company, Warner Bros. Discovery.) Even steamy sex scenes between rival hockey players couldn’t hold her attention.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkvovmkl000z3b6sjjfgzv81@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I would turn it on and just fall asleep,” she said, and still “wake up completely exhausted.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkvovl41000p3b6sbw15dzut@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Sylvia Baer said she and her husband got flu shots this year, and they know that if they hadn’t, they’d be in the hospital — or worse.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkvow7jk00173b6s79bjf2ei@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            They’ve been married 43 years and are hardly ever apart, so one recent morning, she noticed a subtle change in his voice. He confessed to a cough but “tends to push stuff away,” said Baer, 75. He left to play golf.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkvow7jk00183b6s5cfxo4b1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Suspecting that he was sick, she immediately ordered ingredients to make chicken soup – but before she could even fire up the stove, he came home. He said he felt so bad, he’d left his game early.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkvow7jk00193b6sglpqi881@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Now, this has never happened in the history of the universe,” Baer said.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkvow7jk001a3b6s7q36mriz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Her husband slept for two days, “miserable and coughing.” Believing that the vaccine would protect her, she felt she could care for him without getting sick. “You know that hope that you cling on?” But soon, she felt a telling ache in her shoulders.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkvow7jk001b3b6svmm0249y@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We’re both academics, so we like to be in charge of our minds. We have multiple degrees between us, but whoo, this virus is so much smarter than we are,” Baer said. She had a fever and a cough, she said, and has never felt so tired.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkvow7jk001d3b6sgbs1k9pg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “And there was pain in places I didn’t even know I had,” Baer said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkvow7jk001e3b6swpqx517x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The hardest thing for Baer has been needing to sleep so much. Though they’re retired, the snowbirds divide their time between Florida and New Jersey and are not the types to lie around. Baer said they play tennis regularly; &lt;a href="https://davenport.yale.edu/profile/sylvia-baer" target="_blank"&gt;they’re Davenport Fellows&lt;/a&gt; at Yale; she’s &lt;a href="https://www.sylviabaer.com/about.html" target="_blank"&gt;the poet laureate of Cape May&lt;/a&gt;. She writes plays and poems and both teach workshops. When they’re back in New Jersey, they keep a &lt;a href="https://www.sylviabaer.com/poet-tree" target="_blank"&gt;Poet-Tree&lt;/a&gt;, a tree covered in brightly colored poems they constantly resupply so people can take one right from the lawn.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkvow7jk001f3b6s126c6jhi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But sick with the flu, a professor who taught literature for 50 years said she couldn’t write or read anything.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkvow7jk001g3b6sgez0bv2z@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “If I felt better, I would be sad about it, but I don’t even feel well enough to be sad,” Baer said. “I have planted my flag deeply into the land of bitter.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkvow5qt00143b6sslwl4wou@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Benjamin Brooker, a 40-year-old father of two who lives in the Richmond, Virginia, area, said he got sick after a family New Year’s weekend stay at a hotel in southwestern Virginia.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkvowp9y001n3b6sevhrly89@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            His 7-year-old had it first, but his symptoms got better between breakfast and bedtime. The boy and his older brother had been vaccinated in October, but time got away from Brooker and his wife, Lauren, and they didn’t get the flu shot like they usually did – and he paid for it, he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkvowp9y001o3b6snt6dzg9s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            At first, Brooker thought he had food poisoning and called off work. He felt well enough that he ran errands and got one son to the orthodontist, but when he got back home, his wife noticed something was “still a little off” and reminded him that it was his responsibility to get it checked out.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkvowp9y001p3b6si2karndl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The next day, urgent care confirmed that he had the flu. Brooker said he thinks his wife immediately went to get her flu shot and a prescription for the &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/26/health/flu-treatment-tamiflu-xofluza-relenza-rapivab"&gt;antiviral Tamiflu&lt;/a&gt;. She avoided getting sick – which he said is fortunate, since she took over all the family duties, including caring for their two cats and three dogs.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkvowp9y001q3b6sgvvx9mp4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “She’s a saint,” Brooker said.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkvowp9y001r3b6sop466elj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He took &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/26/health/flu-treatment-tamiflu-xofluza-relenza-rapivab"&gt;Xofluza, the single-dose antiviral&lt;/a&gt;, but was still “completely bedridden for four days.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkvowp9y001s3b6sgdvko8ub@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Brooker isolated himself from the family; the few times they had to interact, he wore a mask and wiped everything he touched with Clorox wipes.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkvowp9y001t3b6sjjqcyq7b@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “They’d remind me, ‘did you wash your hands? Did you Clorox the doorknob and the light switch?’ ” he said of his family.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkvowp9y001u3b6snjombboy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He missed three days of work and only felt up to small tasks by day five. It took more than a half-hour to write two emails.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkvowp9y001v3b6sqje2x7ma@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Brooker, the assistant coach of one son’s hockey team, felt like he’d been getting better every day but still wasn’t 100% by the weekend.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkvowp9y001w3b6sbxgqf5pr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Normally, I’m pretty animated, but I just wasn’t. By the end of the day, it had just completely taken it out of me.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkvownqe001l3b6ssqksbghe@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Linda Hyatt, a veterinarian in the Chicago suburbs, said she coughed so hard from the flu that she cracked a rib.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkvoyc3n00233b6scq5qa8dn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “This is not something I had on my pregnancy bingo card,” said Hyatt, who was sick late in her pregnancy.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkvoyc3n00243b6sw4alatan@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The 40-year-old says there were many things she and her husband wanted to finish before her scheduled Cesarean section, but they were out of time. “We’re just triaging and doing the things that are the most necessary,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkvoyc3n00253b6s0of8r5tj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Her young son got sick first, but it was mild, with a “tiny fever and maybe a little bit of a snotty nose.” All of them got their flu shots this year. Hyatt figured it was just a cold, but when a fever of 100 kept coming back, he tested positive for the flu at a pediatric urgent care. He got Tamiflu and seemed better, and her husband didn’t get sick at all. Hyatt, though, became “totally incapacitated.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkvoyc3n00263b6swt87ly85@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Being so big and pregnant and coughing so much and being so tired and everything, I really had to rely on my husband to care for our 2-year-old. He’s such an active, active boy,” Hyatt said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkvoyc3n00273b6sl5e5iko8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Overly optimistic, Hyatt thought she’d get better quickly and says she bought a ton of food for a delayed Christmas celebration. But even days after the holiday, she wasn’t up to it, and when they finally celebrated later, “I asked to open gifts in my pajamas.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkvoyc3n00283b6syiu6emk7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When she went back to work, she wore a mask, which prompted several of her patients’ humans to tell her about their own terrible bouts with the flu.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkvoyc3n00293b6stzs0jxm0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            One silver lining: With so much flu, she said, it should boost her infant’s immunity through the rest of the flu season, which runs through May.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkvoyc3n002a3b6srxu4p8dn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Hopefully, this means that this baby will have protection,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Rebecca Hernandez, a 46-year-old mother of two who works at a lab in Michigan, said she’s grateful that a recent promotion lets her work from home sometimes. It hasn’t been easy working through the flu, but “you just have to keep going.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkvozh5h002h3b6s8r0gmpp4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            She spent a couple days at home and went back to the lab, but she came home exhausted and had to nap. “It has been rough.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkvozh5h002i3b6s7409rvr3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Her 10-year-old son was polite enough to wait for her to wake up before asking her to make pancakes, she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkvozh5h002j3b6sti8jkvvi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Hernandez’s husband, who did not get sick, took over most of the cooking, or she’s just told her kids to grab what they want from the pantry. That worked with her 15-year-old, but her younger child didn’t always eat when it was lunch or dinnertime.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkvplybe003a3b6s1q90xosh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Suddenly I’d see all these wrappers around the living room and think to myself ‘oh, God, he got into that,’ but I let it go,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkvozh5h002k3b6sbgc2ueet@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            She’s also had to let go of her kids’ strict sleep schedule. She didn’t have the energy to keep up with it.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkvozh5h002l3b6sr0ipityt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “My husband’s more of a night owl,” she said, so he’s managing the children’s bedtimes for now.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkvozh5h002m3b6s1btew93j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Hernandez says her big takeaway is to make sure she gets a flu shot from now on. Her entire family gets vaccinated every year, but she got busy this year and forgot.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkvozh5h002n3b6sssllvbq6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “This is a reminder that I have to make time for myself and get the shot.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkvp0w9e002u3b6s0659dk49@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When Brad Young came down with a sore throat, aches and a fever, followed by stomach bloating and brain fog, he had to keep his wits about him: He still had to work and solo parent a 5-year-old and a 7-year-old over the holidays.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkvp0w9e002v3b6sk1ck0b2b@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I’m very blessed with their temperament, because they knew Daddy was not feeling well, and they were able to give me the space I needed,” said Young, a 37-year-old director at a tech company in Tucson, Arizona. “It helped that they had free rein of TV and YouTube and Disney+, and they definitely took advantage of that.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkvp0w9e002w3b6sw1stav65@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Young said breaking his “cardinal rule” helped, too.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkvp0w9e002x3b6sqho5j0t6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I never order meal service deliveries. I always think it’s just a total waste, but now we kind of see the value in meal delivery services,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkvp0w9e002y3b6st46ppl8g@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This had been the longest he’s been sick, Young said. He was glad to work remotely, even though it was tough. After a long stretch with kids out of school over the holidays, he was eager to use his brain and talk to adults, he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkvp0w9e00303b6svobmfdj8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The flu also taught some valuable lessons. He usually keeps busy exercising and working on several projects at once, but the flu forced him to slow down. It’s been a “good exercise in patience and being in the moment.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkvp0w9e00313b6sfkbum4ab@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Another benefit, of sorts, was his total lack of an appetite. He didn’t even want coffee, and “alcohol is the last thing I want to do right now.” It made things easy to stick to dry January and everyone’s favorite New Years resolution, losing weight.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkvp0w9e00323b6sw3sr5nv6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I’m kicking off the New Year strong.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

Your body cannot make vitamin B-12 on its own, so if you don’t eat enough foods rich in B-12, take B-12 supplements or have trouble with absorption for any reason, you could be at risk for a deficiency. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Vegetarians and vegans are at increased risk for a B-12 deficiency, given that vitamin B-12 is primarily in animal food sources,” Kolesa said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;People with gastrointestinal issues that affect B-12 absorption, like Crohn’s disease or celiac disease, pernicious anemia, a history of stomach or bariatric surgery, or heavy alcohol use, may also be at risk for low B-12 levels.

Some good food sources include fish, meat, eggs, dairy, nutritional yeast and fortified breakfast cereals. But people who are deficient may need to take B-12 supplements orally or via injections. Your primary care doctor can test your levels through a basic blood panel to determine whether you’re deficient or low in vitamin B-12.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Oral B12 supplements are effective for most patients, while injectable forms are used in more severe cases,” Salinas said. “Blood testing is the most reliable way to determine whether dietary intake alone is adequate.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Testing is an important way to catch a B-12 deficiency before it progresses to the point where it &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Data/Nhanes/Public/2013/DataFiles/VITB12_H.htm" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="cannot be reversed" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="6977a7bae4b01cc3c1ad545f" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Data/Nhanes/Public/2013/DataFiles/VITB12_H.htm" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="20"&gt;&lt;span&gt;cannot be reversed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.

                Injectable GLP-1 drugs have been a game-changer for many people with obesity. But as researchers discover why the medicines fail for others, they are gaining insights about the complexity of the condition.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Obesity shaped Anna Olson's earliest notions of herself, when she saw a photo and thought, "Oh, I look different than the other kids."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Olson's obesity began in toddlerhood, ran in her family, and left her with a chronic hunger hard to satiate. Dozens of diet, drug and exercise regimens didn't work, and advice from doctors was always the same: Eat less. "And I'm kind of like, 'Well, it's what I'm doing now. What else can I do?'" she says, and the response, again, was: "Well, you just got to eat less."&lt;/p&gt;   
   
   

   &lt;p&gt;In fact, science now shows obesity is far more complex — with numerous genetic, biological, neurological, lifestyle, metabolic and behavioral factors contributing to it.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Root causes vary&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Doctors, patients and drug companies have learned a lot more in recent years about obesity and what works — or doesn't — since the new class of obesity treatments known as GLP-1 drugs have come to market. Although obesity manifests one way — excess weight — doctors say there are perhaps dozens of different forms of it. For treatment to work, therefore, root causes must be identified, then addressed, for each person. Obesity doctors and researchers say within several years, they expect treatment will be more customized to meet the needs of each patient.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For Olson, genetic testing indicated she likely has several genetic and hormonal factors setting her hunger and satiety sensors out of whack. One of the GLP-1 drugs — Ozempic — worked briefly, but it turned out another, Zepbound, better recalibrated Olson's hormone imbalance. It was only when she started tackling her specific obesity drivers&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;that Olson began losing lots of weight — 65 pounds to date, as she remains on the medicine. "I've been able to keep it off," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Popular drugs a precursor to precision medicine?&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Use of GLP-1 drugs is already huge and is set to become even more common, as the medicines become cheaper, with more variations, including the recently launched&lt;strong&gt;, &lt;/strong&gt;easier-to-use Wegovy pill from Novo Nordisk.&lt;/p&gt;   
   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Ozempic and Wegovy are the brand names for a drug called semaglutide. Zepbound and Mounjaro are the brands of a drug called tirzepatide. Both are &lt;a href="https://www.drugs.com/medical-answers/tirzepatide-semaglutide-how-compare-3576410/" target="_blank"&gt;GLP-1 agonists, and tirzepatide blocks&lt;/a&gt; an additional hormone, known as GIP.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Within a few years, doctors say, there also will be more ways to determine an individual's specific obesity factors, which will enable a more precise targeting of the root causes of their obesity, similar to how chemotherapies can target specific cancer subtypes.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The complex makeup of obesity might also explain why GLP-1s don't work for many people. A sizable minority &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/glp-1-diabetes-and-weight-loss-drug-side-effects-ozempic-face-and-more" target="_blank"&gt;experience side effects&lt;/a&gt; like nausea; &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11751938/" target="_blank"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; have shown a significant portion of patients lose less than 5% of their body weight on the drug, though they may experience other metabolic improvements.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Obesity subtypes &lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"There are many types of obesity, and each type of obesity has a unique genetic predisposition," says &lt;a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/acosta-andres-j-m-d-ph-d/bio-20189108" target="_blank"&gt;Andres Acosta&lt;/a&gt;, a gastroenterologist and hepatologist at the Mayo Clinic. Acosta says early research indicates genetic markers might be measured to predict, for example, whether a person might not respond well to GLP-1 medicines.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Acosta is also co-founder of Phenomix Sciences, a company selling genetic testing through some doctors' offices; the testing is &lt;a href="https://www.myphenometest.com/faqs" target="_blank"&gt;not covered by insurance&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The cheek-swab genetic test groups people into four basic obesity &lt;a href="https://www.genome.gov/genetics-glossary/Phenotype" target="_blank"&gt;phenotypes&lt;/a&gt; (meaning observable traits): Hungry Gut, Hungry Brain, Emotional Hunger, and Slow Burn. (A person might belong to more than one of these groups.) Each category has different hormonal or lifestyle factors that drive obesity. For example, someone with emotionally driven eating habits might not benefit as much from GLP-1 drugs.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Acosta says also, those with abnormalities in their gut hormones tend to lose more weight on GLP-1 medicines, while some people with "Hungry Brain" genetic markers may have a broken neural pathway that prevents the drug from being as effective for that group. For those people, Acosta says, often earlier generations of weight-loss medicines — or a combination of new and old drugs — work best.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;A workable treatment plan&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Anna Olson says this kind of personalization was key. Through genetic testing, she found out her phenotype is "Hungry Brain." She also found out she has &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/bardet-biedl-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20586227#:~:text=Overview,%2C%20learning%2C%20thinking%20and%20memory." target="_blank"&gt;Bardet-Biedl syndrome&lt;/a&gt;, a genetic disorder that predisposes her to eat too much. Knowing that, she says, reduced her sense of stigma and helped her find the most fitting combination of medications for her.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Now 36, she says her cholesterol and blood sugar levels have improved, and she's closer to her dream of traveling further afield from her native Minneapolis. "When I was more overweight than now, there was absolutely no way that I could do that."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;More precise diagnosis of specific forms of obesity is still a few years off, says &lt;a href="https://obesitymedicine.org/resources/speakers-bureau/lydia-alexander-md-foma/" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Lydia Alexander&lt;/a&gt;, past president of the &lt;a href="https://obesitymedicine.org/?utm_medium=cpc&amp;amp;utm_source=google&amp;amp;utm_campaign=TM_BR_SummerDiscountExtension25" target="_blank"&gt;Obesity Medicine Association&lt;/a&gt;. But researchers are getting closer to understanding the variables that make a difference.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The chemistry of a person's gut microbiome, their proclivity toward addiction, or the molecular shape of their hormone receptors can all affect the drug's efficacy, she says. "The medication might be degraded faster in one individual than in another," she says, which might also explain the different responses to GLP-1s.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Alexander says that in all instances, adaptations in lifestyle are critical for a full and lasting response. In fact, &lt;a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/392/bmj-2025-085304" target="_blank"&gt;a recent review of 37 studies on weight loss&lt;/a&gt; showed that those who rely on GLP-1 drugs tend to gain back the weight at a faster rate when they stop treatment, as compared to those who rely on behavioral change.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;A 50-50 chance of success&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, one of the downsides of &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/public-opinion/poll-1-in-8-adults-say-they-are-currently-taking-a-glp-1-drug-for-weight-loss-diabetes-or-another-condition-even-as-half-say-the-drugs-are-difficult-to-afford/" target="_blank"&gt;popularized GLP-1 drugs&lt;/a&gt; is that they have raised people's expectations for rapid weight loss, says &lt;a href="https://popcenter.harvard.edu/blog/directory/jennifer-manne-goehler/" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Jennifer Manne-Goehler&lt;/a&gt;, a Harvard metabolic disease specialist. She says &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11404059/#:~:text=3.1.,-2.&amp;amp;text=Similarly%2C%20a%20greater%20proportion%20of,14%2C23%2C24%5D." target="_blank"&gt;roughly half of those who take GLP-1 drugs lose 15%&lt;/a&gt; or more of their weight, and "because the potential of those drugs is so incredible for that half, everyone who takes them thinks they're going to be in the half that have that experience."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Manne-Goehler says what's often forgotten is that obesity is a chronic, lifelong condition. "One tool does not work for each person, and one tool often is not enough over the lifetime of a person to control or to mitigate the health impact of that condition," she says. But over the next few years, she says, at least there will be more tools to better target treatment.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

But if you’re constantly feeling on edge, &lt;a href="https://www.gq.com/story/email-apnea"&gt;taking shallow breaths without even realizing it&lt;/a&gt;, or so stressed that you’re unable to do things you love, &lt;a href="https://www.gq.com/story/how-much-anxiety-is-normal"&gt;it’s a problem&lt;/a&gt;. To effectively treat your anxiety, you have to get to the root causes of it, including considering how your diet may be contributing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Case in point: A &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30068404/"&gt;2018 study published in the &lt;em&gt;British Journal of Nutrition&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; found that adults with a magnesium deficiency had higher levels of anxiety than those who got enough magnesium. If you do a relatively good job of eating a wide range of nutrient-rich foods, you likely get enough magnesium. But if you cycle through the same handful of meals or know your diet isn’t exactly the healthiest, there’s a good possibility you’re lacking it. Roughly half the U.S. population is deficient in magnesium, according to &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6163803/"&gt;a 2018 study in &lt;em&gt;Nutrients&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While upping your magnesium intake isn’t the magic bullet to living an anxiety-free life, it can certainly help. Here, medical experts and dietitians give their best tips on using magnesium to calm anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The connection between magnesium and anxiety&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“&lt;a href="https://www.gq.com/story/magnesium-nutrient-supplements-5"&gt;Magnesium&lt;/a&gt; is a mineral involved in hundreds of important biochemical reactions in the body, many of which directly affect the nervous system,” says registered dietitian &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sonya-bolch-angelone-0022345/" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/sonya-bolch-angelone-0022345/"}' href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sonya-bolch-angelone-0022345/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sonya Angelone, PhD, RDN&lt;/a&gt;. She explains that one reason why getting enough magnesium is key to managing anxiety is because it helps regulate neurotransmitters and support the body’s stress response. “Magnesium helps regulate GABA, the primary calming neurotransmitter in the brain,” Angelone says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-VgtPr ekoLDG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Angelone explains that when the body has enough magnesium, the nervous system can more efficiently shift from a fight-or-flight state into a calmer state. “In other words, magnesium can help prevent the brain from revving too high and getting pushed into overdrive,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.mindsyncpsychiatry.com/start-here/" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.mindsyncpsychiatry.com/start-here/"}' href="https://www.mindsyncpsychiatry.com/start-here/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;William Chu, PMHNP-BC&lt;/a&gt;, a psychiatric nurse specializing in nutritional psychiatry, says this too. “Magnesium acts as one of the brain’s natural calming agents. It helps regulate the nervous system by supporting GABA, the brain’s primary calming neurotransmitter, and by dampening the stress response that keeps the body stuck in fight-or-flight,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides preventing the body from jumping into an anxious state too easily, Dr. Chu says that low magnesium leads to higher cortisol, a.k.a. the stress hormone. “Having a magnesium deficiency enhances our susceptibility to stress,” adds &lt;a data-offer-url="https://drumanaidoomd.substack.com/" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://drumanaidoomd.substack.com/"}' href="https://drumanaidoomd.substack.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Uma Naidoo, MD&lt;/a&gt;, a nutritional psychiatrist and author of &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.amazon.com/Calm-Your-Mind-Food-Revolutionary/dp/031650209X" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.amazon.com/Calm-Your-Mind-Food-Revolutionary/dp/031650209X"}' href="https://www.amazon.com/Calm-Your-Mind-Food-Revolutionary/dp/031650209X" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-aps-asin="031650209X" data-aps-asc-tag="gqdailynl-20"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Calm Your Mind With Food&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The major lesson boils down to this: When faced with a stressful situation, the body is primed to jump into an anxious state if your magnesium levels are low. But if you get enough magnesium, you could encounter the same situation and feel calmer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to use magnesium to calm anxiety&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Knowing that magnesium can help you be resilient in anxiety-inducing situations can make you want to go all-in on magnesium supplements and consume as much as you can, but that’s not how it works. Dr. Naidoo emphasizes that consuming more than the recommended daily amount of magnesium (&lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Magnesium-HealthProfessional/"&gt;which is between 400 and 420 milligrams a day&lt;/a&gt;), won’t give you extra protection from anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to using magnesium to manage anxiety, you have two options: upping your intake of magnesium-rich foods or taking a supplement. All the experts we talked to advocate for aiming to get enough magnesium intake through food first. But if you are deficient (which you can find out by having your healthcare provider take some bloodwork), a magnesium supplement can be helpful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;Magnesium-rich foods&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keeping track of your magnesium intake can be tedious, so instead of mentally logging every gram, registered dietitian &lt;a data-offer-url="https://andytherd.com/" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://andytherd.com/"}' href="https://andytherd.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Andy De Santis, RD&lt;/a&gt;, says the best way to get enough is by eating a wide range of nutrient-rich foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>GQ</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibkFVX3lxTE5wUzdVc2hkRXRHcng0TjloSThZT0Rxa0k3cEpCb1psbVVkQXlSWTJ1NERvRnJLRi0xX2luSkdlMzhwS0RtYXZwUEV4bEN6YXEwaF9rMnlTc2FORGJUMjJVYS1NQlpUenFOU0I4Y3VR</guid></item><item><title>特朗普的政策与新出现的对新冠肺炎长期危害的理解不一致- CBS新闻</title><link>https://www.cbsnews.com/news/covid-long-term-harm-health-policies/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="content__body"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Possible risk of autism in children. Dormant cancer cells awakening. Accelerating aging of the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Federal officials in May 2023 &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ashish-jha-on-winding-down-the-covid-19-pandemic-emergency/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;declared an end&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to the &lt;a href="https://archive.cdc.gov/www_cdc_gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/your-health/end-of-phe.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;national COVID pandemic&lt;/a&gt;. But more than two years later, a growing body of research continues to reveal information about the virus and its ability to cause harm long after initial infections resolve, even in some cases when symptoms were mild.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The discoveries raise fresh concerns about the Trump administration's COVID policies, researchers say. While some studies show COVID vaccines offer protective benefits against longer-term health effects, the Department of Health and Human Services has drastically limited recommendations about who should get the shot. The administration also &lt;a href="https://hsph.harvard.edu/news/slashing-of-funding-for-mrna-vaccine-development-raises-concern/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;halted Biden-era contracts&lt;/a&gt; aimed at developing more protective COVID vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The federal government is curtailing such efforts just as researchers call for more funding and, in some cases, long-term monitoring of people previously infected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"People forget, but the legacy of COVID is going to be long, and we are going to be learning about the chronic effects of the virus for some time to come," said &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/michael-t-osterholdm-phd-mph" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Michael Osterholm&lt;/a&gt;, an epidemiologist who directs the University of Minnesota's Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Trump administration said that the COVID vaccine &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cdc-acip-vaccine-recommendations-covid-chickenpox/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;remains available&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and that individuals are encouraged to talk with their health providers about what is best for them. The COVID vaccine and others on the schedule of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention remain covered by insurance so that individuals don't need to pay out-of-pocket, officials said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Updating CDC guidance and expanding shared clinical decision-making restores informed consent, centers parents and clinicians, and discourages 'one size fits all' policies," said HHS spokesperson Emily Hilliard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although COVID has become less deadly, because of population immunization and mutations making the virus less severe, researchers say the politicization around the infection is obscuring what science is increasingly confirming: COVID's potential to cause unexpected, possibly chronic health issues. That in turn, these scientists say, drives the need for more, rather than less, research, because over the long term, COVID could have significant economic and societal implications, such as higher health care costs and more demands on social programs and caregivers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The annual average burden of the disease's long-term health effects is estimated at $1 trillion globally and $9,000 per patient in the U.S., according to a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12639003/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;report published&lt;/a&gt; in November in the journal NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine. In this country, the annual lost earnings are estimated to be about $170 billion.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One study estimates that the flu resulted in $16 billion in direct health costs and $13 billion in productivity losses in the 2023-2024 season, according to &lt;a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.64898/2025.12.23.25342685v1.full" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;a Dec. 30 report in MedRxiv&lt;/a&gt;, an online platform that publishes work not yet certified by peer review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;COVID's growing reach&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much has been learned about COVID since the virus emerged in 2019, unleashing a pandemic that the World Health Organization reports has killed more than &lt;a href="https://data.who.int/dashboards/covid19/deaths" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;7 million people&lt;/a&gt;. By the spring of 2020, the term "&lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/long-covid-what-scientists-now-know/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;long COVID&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" had been coined to describe &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/long-covid-symptoms-nih-study/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;chronic health problems&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; that can persist post-infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More recent studies show that infection by the virus that causes COVID, SARS-CoV-2, can result in heightened health risks months to more than a year later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, researchers following children born to mothers who contracted the virus while pregnant have discovered they may have an &lt;a href="https://secure-web.cisco.com/1NW5qPcwDHtYq61Mh4p5FWNgu1mmUrB2QAYq-vhqRRNn-7MGYPEsQpWsbC0267LhmpL11F1aSkZrWcUmZ05pN4ixHjN9V7uCeRRNTszAPHxW6026yC8Apd5C3NcumnwuMjt8W_6ivt2HY9z_a0pLasE3RVGL3i8kehntfPZEP7n34rKa8JVf9Fo7dKuuL1ROHaJ3fIW-Lbg_3ps-fWTr2Gtetq2155Fy_pRZHQjBpUN9H-CusODm3NUIpY8m9j4SRJ0AO1gOAet9cDKSnF1cTloVo7F-crOKu5jKZQn9FAhwCneHu2Ersf297fC9ogaoiUwLZDd8u-40CyqUNTG_hLA/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cidrap.umn.edu%2Fcovid-19%2Fkids-exposed-covid-utero-may-be-higher-risk-autism-other-brain-problems" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;increased risk for autism&lt;/a&gt;, delayed speech and motor development, or other neurodevelopmental challenges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38351665/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Another study&lt;/a&gt; found babies exposed to COVID in utero experienced accelerated weight gain in their first year, a possible harbinger of metabolic issues that could later carry an increased risk for cardiovascular disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These studies suggest avoiding severe COVID in pregnancy may reduce risk not just during pregnancy but for future generations. That may be another good reason to get vaccinated when pregnant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are other body symptoms apart from the developing fetal brain that also may be impacted," said Andrea Edlow, an associate professor of obstetrics, gynecology, and reproductive biology at Harvard Medical School who was involved in both studies. "We definitely need more research."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Epidemiologists point to some specific, emerging challenges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2311330" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;U.K. study&lt;/a&gt; in the New England Journal of Medicine found people who &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/covid-19/even-fully-recovered-survivors-mild-covid-can-lose-iq-points-study-suggests#:~:text=Mild%20cognitive%20decline%20was%20noted,recovered%20from%20mild%20COVID%2D19." target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;fully recovered&lt;/a&gt; from mild COVID infections experienced a cognitive deficit equal to a three-point drop in IQ. Among the more than 100,000 participants, deficits were greater in people who had persistent symptoms and reached the equivalent of a nine-point IQ drop for individuals admitted to intensive care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.va.gov/132887/dr-ziyad-al-aly-recognition-long-covid-research/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Ziyad Al-Aly&lt;/a&gt;, a clinical epidemiologist who has studied longer-term health effects from COVID, did the math. He estimated COVID may have increased the number of adults in the U.S. with an IQ of less than 70 from 4.7 million to 7.5 million — &lt;a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/covid-19-leaves-its-mark-on-the-brain-significant-drops-in-iq-scores-are/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;a jump of 2.8 million adults&lt;/a&gt; dealing with "a level of cognitive impairment that requires significant societal support," he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"People get COVID-19, some people do fine and bounce back, but there are people who start experiencing problems with memory, cognition, and fuzzy brain," he said. "Even people with mild symptoms. They might not even be aware."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diane Yormark, 67, of Boca Raton, Florida, can relate. She got COVID in 2022 and 2023. The second infection left her with brain fog and fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I felt like if you had a little bit too much wine the night before and you're out of it," said Yormark, a retired copywriter, who said the worst of her symptoms lasted for about three months after the infection. "Some of the fog has lifted. But do I feel like myself? Not like I was."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data from more than a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9978692/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;dozen studies&lt;/a&gt; suggests COVID vaccines can help reduce risk of severe infection as well as longer-lasting health effects, although researchers say more study is needed.&lt;/p&gt;

    
    
    &lt;p id="mpu-flex-inc5" data-ad="mpu-flex-inc" class="ad-mpu-flex-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["mpu-flex-inc",5]'&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But vaccination rates remain low in the U.S., with only about 17% of the adult population reporting that they got the updated 2025-2026 shot as of Jan. 16, based on &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/respiratory-viruses/data/vaccination-trends.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;CDC data.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump administration officials led by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. have reduced access to COVID vaccines despite the lack of any new, substantiated evidence of harm. Though the shots were a hallmark achievement of the first Trump administration, which led the effort for their development, Kennedy has said without evidence that they are "&lt;a href="https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2021/dec/10/robert-f-kennedy-jr/no-covid-19-vaccine-not-deadliest-vaccine-ever-mad/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;the deadliest vaccine ever made&lt;/a&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In May he said on X that the CDC would &lt;a href="https://x.com/seckennedy/status/1927368440811008138?s=46" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;stop recommending COVID shots &lt;/a&gt;for &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/05/27/nx-s1-5413179/covid-vaccine-children-pregnant-rfk-cdc" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;healthy children and pregnant women&lt;/a&gt;, citing a &lt;a href="https://climate.law.columbia.edu/content/rfk-jr-makes-false-claims-about-covid-deaths-vaccine-safety-senate-hearing" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;lack of clinical data&lt;/a&gt;. The Food and Drug Administration has since issued new guidelines limiting the vaccine to people 65 or older and individuals 6 months or older with at least one risk factor, though many states continue to make them more widely available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Trump administration also halted &lt;a href="https://www.lung.org/blog/mrna-vaccines-cuts" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;almost $500 million in funding&lt;/a&gt; for mRNA-based vaccines. Administration officials and a number of Republicans question the safety of the Nobel Prize-winning technology — heralded for the potential to treat many diseases beyond COVID — even though clinical trials with tens of thousands of volunteers were performed before the &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/mrna-vaccines-trump-boast-under-gop-attacks-legislation/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;COVID mRNA vaccines&lt;/a&gt; were made available to the public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And numerous studies, including new research in 2025, show COVID vaccine benefits include a &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2510226" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;reduction in the severity of disease&lt;/a&gt;, although the protective effects wane over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Following the findings&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers say more and broader support is important because much remains unknown about COVID and its impact on the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The growing awareness that, even in mild COVID cases, the possibility exists for longer-term, often undetected &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11834749/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;organ damage&lt;/a&gt; also warrants more examination, researchers say. A &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352396425005560" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;study published this month&lt;/a&gt; in eBioMedicine found people with neurocognitive issues such as changes in smell or headaches after infection had significant levels of a protein linked to Alzheimer's in their blood plasma. EBioMedicine is a peer-reviewed, open-access journal published by &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;The Lancet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the brain, the virus leads to an immune response that triggers inflammation, can damage brain cells, and can even shrink brain volume, according to &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04569-5" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;research on imaging studies&lt;/a&gt; that was published in March 2022 in the journal Nature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666354625002005" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Australian study&lt;/a&gt; of advanced brain images found significant alterations even among people who had already recovered from mild infections — a possible explanation for &lt;a href="https://www.news-medical.net/news/20251215/COVID-19-could-leave-a-measurable-imprint-on-the-brain.aspx" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;cognitive deficits&lt;/a&gt; that may persist for years. Lead study author Kiran Thapaliya said the research suggests the virus "may leave a silent, lasting effect on brain health."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Al-Alay agreed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We don't know what will happen to people 10 years down the road," he said. "Inflammation of the brain is not a good thing. It's absolutely not a good thing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That inflammatory response has also been linked to blood clots, arrhythmias, and higher risk of cardiovascular issues, even following a mild infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A University of Southern California study published in October 2024 in the journal Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology found the risk for a &lt;a href="https:/www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/ATVBAHA.124.321001" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;major cardiac event&lt;/a&gt; remains elevated nearly three years after COVID infection. The findings held even for people who were not hospitalized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We were surprised to see the effects that far out" regardless of individual heart disease history, said James R. Hilser, the study's lead author and a postdoctoral fellow at the UCLA David Geffen School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;COVID can also &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09332-0" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;reactivate cancer cells&lt;/a&gt; and trigger a relapse, according to research published in July in the journal Nature. Researchers found that the chance of dying from cancer among cancer survivors was higher among people who'd had COVID, especially in the year after being infected. There was nearly a twofold increase in cancer mortality in those who tested positive compared with those who tested negative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The potential of the COVID virus to affect future generations is yielding new findings as well. Australian researchers looked at male mice and found that those who had been &lt;a href="https://florey.edu.au/news/2025/10/covid-19-causes-changes-in-sperm-that-lead-to-increased-anxiety-in-offspring/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;infected with and then recovered&lt;/a&gt; from COVID experienced changes to their sperm that altered their offspring's behavior, causing them to exhibit more anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, many people are now living — and struggling — with the virus' after-effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dee Farrand, 57, of Marana, Arizona, could once run five miles and was excelling at her job in sales. She recovered from a COVID infection in May 2021.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two months later, her heart began to beat irregularly. Farrand underwent a battery of tests at a hospital. Ultimately, the condition became so severe she had to go on supplemental oxygen for two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her cognitive abilities declined so severely she couldn't read, because she'd forget the first sentence after reading the second. She also had to leave herself reminders that she is allergic to shrimp or that she likes avocados. She said she lost her job and returned to her previous occupation as a social worker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I was the person who is like the Energizer bunny and all of a sudden I'd get so tired getting dressed that I had to go back to bed," Farrand said.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While she is better, COVID has left a mark. She said she's not yet able to run the five miles she used to do without any problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/about-us/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;KFF Health News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs at &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/about-us/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;KFF&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; — the independent source for health policy research, polling, and journalism.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Before Mohammad Samad was diagnosed with &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/colon-cancer-environmental-causes-microplastics-antibiotics-sleep-2025-1" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;stage 3 colon cancer&lt;/a&gt; at age 37, he felt in the best shape of his life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I was eating all my greens, making those healthy smoothies in the morning. I was cycling, I was exercising. I was doing yoga and meditation," the former project manager, who is based&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;in the UK, told Business Insider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A sudden, stabbing pain in Samad's lower abdomen in October 2020, which lasted 20 seconds, was the first sign that something was wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The force of it just made me fall to my knees," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By December, the pain was more intense and happening every morning and night. He could also feel a hard, golf ball-sized lump in the area.&lt;/p&gt;
              
            
              
            &lt;p&gt;Soon, he was &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/identical-twins-young-colon-cancer-diagnosis-2025-11" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;exhausted all the time&lt;/a&gt;, and often&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;constipated and bloated. The lunch breaks he used to spend shooting hoops at a local park became nap time.&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;figure class="figure image-figure-image   " data-type="img" data-e2e-name="image-figure-image" data-media-container="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;
              
              
                
              
              &lt;span class="image-source-caption "&gt;
                    &lt;figcaption class="image-caption headline-semibold" data-e2e-name="image-caption"&gt;
                      After several visits to the doctor, Samad pushed for further testing.
                      
              &lt;span class="image-source headline-regular" data-e2e-name="image-source" itemprop="creditText"&gt;
              
              Mohammad Samad
              
              &lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;/figure&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Samad presumed his symptoms were related to stress and his diet, or that he possibly had COVID-19. "In my head, it didn't seem that bad," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in January 2021, when he started to feel the lump, he finally went to see a doctor at his wife's request.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the five months that followed, he made multiple visits to three different doctors and was misdiagnosed with stress, IBS, and Crohn's disease. Eventually, Samad was diagnosed with colon cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They would look at me and go, '&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/why-so-many-young-people-getting-colon-cancer-answer-infancy-2025-12" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;You're young, you're fit&lt;/a&gt;, you're healthy. We can see that.' And so they assume that it is a minor thing," he said of his doctor's visits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/rectal-bleeding-most-common-early-sign-of-colon-cancer-taboo-2025-5" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;symptoms of colon cancer&lt;/a&gt; and conditions including IBS overlap, which means doctors tread a tightrope when diagnosing younger, generally healthy patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Samad's experience isn't unusual for young cancer&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;patients. A 2020 survey by the charity Bowel Cancer UK of 1,295 &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/true-cost-young-colon-cancer-crisis-2025-10" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;colorectal cancer patients&lt;/a&gt; diagnosed under the age of 50 found that 42% said doctors told them they&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;were too young to have the disease. In addition, two-thirds were initially misdiagnosed with conditions that have similar symptoms,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;such as IBS, hemorrhoids, or anaemia. The survey echoes wider research on the misdiagnoses of young cancer patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/most-common-symptoms-colon-cancer-under-50s-chart-2024-5" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;common symptoms&lt;/a&gt; of early-onset colon cancer include blood in the stool, abdominal pain, weight loss, loss of appetite, and constipation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="b299cbe3-57db-4aad-95eb-9164579dfc7d" data-toc-id="b299cbe3-57db-4aad-95eb-9164579dfc7d"&gt;Samad was misdiagnosed with IBS and Crohn's disease&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first doctor that Samad visited said she couldn't feel a lump when she pressed down on his abdomen, and suggested he could have "a blockage," likely caused by stress. She prescribed Samad laxatives and told him to return if his symptoms didn't improve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Four weeks later, when the laxatives hadn't helped, a different doctor prescribed him IBS medication and more laxatives. The doctor also recommended following an elimination diet to see if certain foods triggered the IBS symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When things didn't improve after two weeks and Samad was told to keep taking the IBS medication and eliminating more foods, he demanded a blood test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I kind of just put my foot down and said, 'I'm not leaving without a test,'" he said. It showed Samad had concerning levels of inflammation in his body, which was confirmed by blood and stool tests at the emergency room.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In May 2021, seven months after he first felt the intense pain, Samad was referred to a specialist who thought he had Crohn's disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/colon-cancer-symptoms-in-my-30s-colonoscopy-cost-insurance-2025-7" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;A colonoscopy&lt;/a&gt;, where a thin tube with a microscopic camera on the end is placed into the rectum and colon, showed Samad had a tumor, which a biopsy confirmed was advanced colon cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Fortunately, it hadn't spread, but it was at that stage where they said to me, 'We're going to throw the kitchen sink at it," Samad said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His mind "entered a black hole" as the oncologist talked through the next steps. Samad's dad had recently died of COVID-19, and he worried about how his diagnosis would impact his family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"How do I tell my mom who's just lost a life partner? How do I tell my siblings? How do I tell my children who have just been introduced to the concept of death by a loved one?" said Samad, whose two children were age 8 and 6 at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="fbe25dc7-b4d0-4e68-a2d1-eab2a454cc9c" data-toc-id="fbe25dc7-b4d0-4e68-a2d1-eab2a454cc9c"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Samad's treatment was derailed by infections&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Samad had chemotherapy to shrink the tumor and surgery to remove it, but after two chemo cycles lasting four weeks each, he was hospitalized by a "nasty" infection for five months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During that time, he was too unwell to have chemo, and his tumor grew to the size of a small watermelon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The tumour was getting larger and larger, and eventually they said, 'Your bowel is now perforated, bleeding all these toxins into your system,'' he said.&lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/figure&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Samad had to have emergency surgery to remove it, which was successful, but left him with nerve damage in his leg and need to use a &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/marathon-runner-stage-3-colon-cancer-no-symptoms-2025-12" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;stoma bag&lt;/a&gt;. He has ongoing health issues, but has been cancer-free for two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I get regular checkups, and I've been given the all clear, which is amazing," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="736e0aed-487d-4565-931f-1945afd58a8e" data-toc-id="736e0aed-487d-4565-931f-1945afd58a8e"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The tumor tested positive for Lynch syndrome&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Samad's tumor tested positive for a genetic condition called &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/woman-years-of-stomach-pain-diagnosed-colon-cancer-2025-5" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;Lynch Syndrome&lt;/a&gt;, which increases a person's risk of developing a number of cancers, including colon cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The number of younger people without Lynch syndrome &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/colon-cancer-environmental-causes-microplastics-antibiotics-sleep-2025-1" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;developing colon cancer&lt;/a&gt; despite leading healthy lifestyles is on the rise, for reasons scientists are trying to uncover.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If caught early, colon cancer is often treatable. The US Preventive Services Task Force recommends that people start getting screened at regular intervals when they turn 45, and people with a higher-than-average risk should ask a healthcare professional about when they should start testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In around March 2022, Samad started a blog to share his experience and raise awareness of the rising rates of &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/young-people-cancer-crisis-risk-tips-2025-11" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;colon cancer in young people&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's still that association that cancer is only for old people. It can affect everyone," he said, adding: "Just listen to your body, go see a specialist, check those symptoms, and really push for it."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="accordion__title"&gt;​​Is it OK to mix and match meals if there is one I do not like?&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_1-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes! This meal plan is meant to serve as inspiration. It doesn’t need to be followed exactly to reap the benefits. When choosing recipes, we made sure to check the calories, fiber, protein and sodium to align with the parameters of this plan and be within our sodium limits. If you’re making a recipe swap, it may be helpful to choose a recipe with similar calories, fiber, protein and sodium levels. For more inspiration, check out these delicious &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-new-high-protein-recipes-for-better-blood-sugar-8694761" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;high-protein recipes for better blood sugar&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="accordion__title"&gt;Can I eat the same breakfast or lunch every day?&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_2-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Definitely, it’s fine to eat the same breakfast or lunch every day. The breakfasts range from 345 to 419 calories while the lunches span 334 to 478 calories. These ranges are fairly close, though if you’re closely monitoring your calories or other nutrients, like protein, you may want to adjust a snack or two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;span class="accordion__title"&gt;Why is there not a modification for 1,200 calories?&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_3-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We no longer provide modifications for 1,200-calorie days in our meal plans. The 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans suggests that limiting calories to 1,200 per day is too low for most people to meet their nutritional needs, plus it’s unsustainable for long-term health and well-being.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="accordion__title"&gt;What are the health impacts of high blood sugar levels?&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_4-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If left untreated, continuously elevated blood sugars can cause some serious harm. High blood sugar levels can damage blood vessels, which can reduce kidney function, cause vision loss, cause heart disease and negatively impact nearly every function in the body.&lt;span data-cite="2" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_182-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If improving blood sugars is your goal, research indicates that eating more protein may help. Protein is a nutrient with many health benefits, including supporting healthy blood sugar by slowing down digestion to mitigate blood sugar spikes. Eating a high-protein diet and reducing total carbohydrate can help reduce the risk, but it’s just one piece of this important puzzle. But, there’s no need to completely avoid carbs. Instead, opt to include &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-high-fiber-carbs-to-eat-according-to-a-dietitian-8364239" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;high-fiber carbohydrates&lt;/a&gt;, like legumes, fruit and whole grains, while limiting refined grains and added sugars. The fiber in carbohydrates isn’t digested, which means it slows down digestion and, like protein, helps reduce blood sugar spikes. Plus, fiber has many &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/287742/10-amazing-health-benefits-of-eating-more-fiber/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;health benefits&lt;/a&gt; that you would miss out on if carbs were reduced drastically.

The plan was simple: a warm bath, a few peaceful minutes, and no one needing anything. But Winnie’s mom, who shares their life over at @the.golden.girl.winnie, learned very quickly that this was not going to be a solo activity. When the video starts, we already see this &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/golden-retriever" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Golden Retriever;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Golden Retriever&lt;/a&gt; puppy dangling over the tub’s rim. She seems to think “sharing is caring” applies to bathwater, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Golden Retriever puppy jumps into bathtub while owner is in it&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The video opens mid-chaos with Winnie deciding to join her mom for her bath time. Her mom films from within the tub as Winnie’s front paws begin to flail against the porcelain. She tries to pull herself in, essentially swimming through the air with her upper body. Eventually, she finds some traction and hauls her hind legs over the side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;She looks incredibly proud of this athletic achievement. One viewer joked, “Mum go in bath…. me go in bath,” which seems to be precisely what’s going through her head. If you live with a Golden Retriever, you already know water is rarely considered off-limits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Then the video cuts to this very soggy Golden Retriever puppy standing in one corner of the bathtub. She looks down at a red-and-blue toy floating nearby with curiosity. Her front paws rest on the rim, dripping a steady stream of water onto the bath mat below. There’s not a single ounce of remorse on her face as she stands there innocently. So much for mom’s “me time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The comment section is obsessed with her lack of boundaries. One person noted that moms never actually get alone time, only “quality time” with a beautiful puppy. Another fan captured the mood perfectly, imagining Winnie thinking, “I’ll just uh.. scooch on in here.” Closed doors tend to be taken as a personal insult when there’s a dog in the house.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The post &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com/news/204252-golden-retriever-puppy-video-bath-tub-video" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Video: Golden Retriever Puppy Makes Plans of Her Own When Owner Hits the Tub;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Video: Golden Retriever Puppy Makes Plans of Her Own When Owner Hits the Tub&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:DogTime;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;DogTime&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 07:33:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilAFBVV95cUxPY1d3RVZ6dDdQdHp2dVBtMVE3MjdUVFVEaHlhS1A1WjhjTEN2NnFWOEgyTjlZczItcEthejk3U2I4R0x2dlBYbUdKSVBrdko5ZWxsQ0VTaWo1dFhoRjhkRGJ4SHBwb2ZRNGNoaW93YUJ6RkUta3FjTGk5RzZDd0kxR2R4cWpMRGJhQmhqNk82aElQRk9k</guid></item></channel></rss>
