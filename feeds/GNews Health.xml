			&lt;p&gt;Some &lt;a href="https://www.omnicoreagency.com/tiktok-statistics/"&gt;1.8 billion people&lt;/a&gt; log into TikTok at least once a month, spending an average of 95 minutes per day being engaged, entertained, and even educated by the app.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those are phenomenal numbers, but a new study shows the platform isn't the most reliable source for information, particularly when it comes to health conditions like  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-adhd" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73112" data-postid="155775" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;ADHD&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A team led by researchers from the University of British Columbia (UBC) in Canada found that of the top 100 most-viewed TikTok videos tagged for &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-adhd"&gt;attention deficit hyperactivity disorder&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;span&gt;ADHD&lt;/span&gt;) content, fewer than half matched the professional diagnostic criteria for the condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The videos – which had collectively racked up nearly half a billion views in total – were largely based on personal experience and opinion. They often missed the nuances of ADHD, such as the way symptoms can differ between people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_155778" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-155778" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/WordCloud.jpg" alt="Word cloud" class="wp-image-155778 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/WordCloud.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/WordCloud-416x415.jpg 416w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/WordCloud-600x599.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-155778" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers looked at hashtags related to ADHD posts. (Karasavva et al., &lt;em&gt;PLOS One&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"TikTok can be an incredible tool for raising awareness and reducing stigma, but it also has a downside," &lt;a href="https://news.ubc.ca/2025/03/adhd-misinformation-on-tiktok/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; UBC clinical psychologist Vasileia Karasavva.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Anecdotes and personal experiences are powerful, but when they lack context, they can lead to misunderstandings about ADHD and mental health in general."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers also ran an experiment using the top 100's five most accurate and five least accurate videos, as judged by clinical psychologists. These 10 clips were then shown to 843 undergraduates taking an introductory psychology course, who were asked to rate them based on their perceived educational value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the best five videos scored an average of 3.6 from psychologists for accuracy, they only got a score of 2.8 from the students. The worst five videos for accuracy scored 1.1 from psychologists, but 2.3 from students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The implications are clear: there's a significant gap between expert opinions on TikTok's ADHD videos and those of casual viewers. Such potential for misinformation could interfere with the public's &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/adhd-diagnoses-keep-rising-higher-this-is-why-its-happening"&gt;understanding of the condition&lt;/a&gt;, which could affect how many are diagnosed and treated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our findings highlight a discrepancy between mental health professionals and young adults regarding the psychoeducational value of ADHD content on TikTok," &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0319335"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers in their published paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Addressing this is crucial to improving access to treatment and enhancing support for those with ADHD."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study also showed that students who viewed more ADHD content in general were more likely to share it with others, and that they were more likely to think that ADHD is more common &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/massive-review-finds-adhd-is-more-prevalent-in-adults-than-we-realized"&gt;than it actually is&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Content creators on TikTok are rewarded for attracting views rather than &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/we-analyzed-what-tiktok-says-about-medical-tests-and-got-a-nasty-shock"&gt;providing accurate information&lt;/a&gt;, the researchers point out, and they'd also like to see more expert content from health professionals shared on the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers aren't anti-TikTok, and acknowledge its value in building community and reaching young people. But they're also encouraging TikTok viewers to look for other, more reputable sources of information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Some young adults turn to TikTok because of access barriers, or negative experiences they have had with mental health professionals," &lt;a href="https://news.ubc.ca/2025/03/adhd-misinformation-on-tiktok/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Amori Mikami, a professor of psychology at UBC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0319335"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PLOS One&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

It can be recognized under the brand name Klonopin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Clonazepam is a sedative and has side effects including paranoia, suicidal ideation, and impairment of judgement, coordination, and memory. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ketamine is an anesthetic which can have hallucinogenic effects.

Olivia, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/news/article-14404017/Wyoming-girl-Olivia-Blackmer-dies-mother-Tranyelle-Harsshman-murder-suicide.html"&gt;died at a hospital in Salt Lake City,&lt;/a&gt; Utah, five days after the incident. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Traynelle's husband, Cliff, was on a business trip and the girls were home sick with the flu. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Olivia died at a hospital in Salt Lake City after her sister, Brailey, was found dead in their home &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Olivia's biological father and stepmom announced her death in an update on an online fundraiser days after the murder-suicide &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The shocking events occurred in the small town of Byron, Wyoming &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Their toxicology reports, as first reviewed by local news outlet, &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://cowboystatedaily.com/2025/03/20/byron-mom-in-murder-suicide-had-depression-anxiety-meds-in-system/"&gt;Cowboy State Daily&lt;/a&gt;, revealed that the children who died at the scene had 'unusual large amounts of Propanolol – beta-blocker – and Diphenhydramine – antihistamine which causes drowsiness – in their systems.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Diphenhydramine is a key ingredient in the brand-name allergy drug, Benadryl. Propranolol is a prescription beta-blocker that can treat high blood pressure, chest pain, migraines, and tremors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The drug can result in side effects such as slow or uneven heartbeats, lightheadedness, trouble breathing, sudden weakness, depression, heart problems, or low blood sugar. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's unclear why the girls were on the medications, but Cliff told Cowboy State Daily that his wife's chemical mental health treatments were her last hope to cope with her mental health struggles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I'm bitter that this has had to continue to be a thorn in my side, when I need to just… grieve my family's loss,' Cliff said on the questions he's been pestered with since the tragedy rocked his family. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I also want people to understand that this isn't a chance to demonize different therapies. This works for a lot of different people,' he continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This was her last grasp at the rope, if you will, to hang on.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Law enforcement responded to the home just minutes after Harshman called 911 and reported her daughters deaths &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Olivia and Brailey, the two oldest daughters who died in the murder-suicide, pictured with their biological father Quinn Blackmer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cliff told the outlet that he went to visit his wife in the hospital after the murder-suicide and prayed for the strength to forgive  her. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He added that he was working on accepting that his family was gone and wanted to focus on grieving instead of defending them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cliff was the biological father of the two younger girls, Brooke and Jordan, but raised Olivia and Brailey for years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Olivia and Brailey's biological father, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/news/article-14405313/heartbroken-dad-breaks-silence-daughter-died-mother-murder-suicide.html"&gt;Quinn Blackmer, and his wife Katelynn announced&lt;/a&gt; that Olivia had died after fighting in the hospital for days after she was shot. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Olivia is with her sisters now. She gained her angel wings yesterday at 3.49pm. She fought so hard up til the last minute,' Katelynn Blackmer wrote in an update on an &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-olivia-fight-after-tragic-loss"&gt;online fundraiser&lt;/a&gt; for the family. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Her body and her brain had been through too much, medication helped, but we reached a point where medical options were exhausted and her body only continued to get worse.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The community has rallied around the grieving fathers amidst the unimaginable loss, setting up fundraisers and prayer vigils. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The community has since rallied around the grieving fathers who lost their daughters in the shocking murder-suicide &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The family announced in a heartbreaking update that Olivia had joined her three sisters and died in a Utah hospital after the incident &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Harshman's family and friends have stood up for the mother after the tragedy, with her close friend Nicole Jensen previously telling Dailymail.com that she was a 'fierce mama bear protector.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I will defend her and her memory until the end of my days,' Jensen said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I know that she felt she couldn't live anymore but also couldn't abandon her children without her to fight for and care for them.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cliff echoed a similar sentiment to &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://cowboystatedaily.com/2025/02/12/husband-of-woman-in-byron-murder-suicide-says-she-was-depressed-struggling/"&gt;Cowboy State Daily&lt;/a&gt;, telling the outlet that despite his wife's unimaginable actions, he still loved her. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He told the publication that his wife 'was not a monster' and that she struggled to cope with mental illness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Most people don't understand how that affects the brain. It's a chemical imbalance,' he said. 'And it can be exacerbated by trying to fix it with medication.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cliff added that her violent actions were 'so out of character' and what happened was 'unbelievable.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'As angry as I may be with her, I still love her - and I still lost her as well,' he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Fri, 21 Mar 2025 01:45:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirwFBVV95cUxOOUlnY044V3RxeHVMNDBEUUhzZGExTGs1WGNPRTdlVTFiQXk4WmF2emEzNjFHTDZhdmJLaGRFZHp5eXhIQWp0TkpyRTJnMjZPb2Qyd2FTR0NyQVAtVFpuT0RWMkRnTXBzX1AtdVNMNE5ZR3dGbm8yeXFsX2JobWM2VHMxaXJBUHNoZUVaZEk2aFR4Y3JZdS1qcGdUajZtWlhiQnRpQmxUYnMtc0p6VEVz0gG0AUFVX3lxTE0tdzJET2ozWWpYbjFfU1hHN2lrbmNoWnk5ZEFENkxBMW92akk4dHRqbFlQUkhZbVBvQ3dPMy1JdkxCV3l2N1lZMnlPSzZ1SHJKRGoybWJTX0kwTXF1bjFYdi16Q2RuSDUxMTJsWHZFaW1TNTBkcnQ1cDlHUFV3dFpJakFIbWdaZnBwTmdZTHZmb0pDbmUxQTF1UDZTbmxDb1hKS1ZZOVVJREVkZVlUcW5ick9wWQ</guid></item><item><title>Trump’s Former Surgeon General Tears Into RFK Jr. for Fostering Vaccine Skepticism - The Daily Beast</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqwFBVV95cUxPZ3drMEFQQThPdWtvMWZ3aVJuQTZZTlE2em9Xelp5eFU5RG4xUnhPbG5zZWttelFSVUdwNHVFMXB4LTZpUm55VUVUMXhUUVlPSW9VZGREcHdqdjhLLVZkMnAzSE5sVFZiNjZ3cTNNY3pUX1hZbk8xTGdYb1Fya1lDWG40MGhzYjJXdlhlSDYtZHlYa1dDNExHVE1sdGhmcllqUEU2MlJjdXNoV2c?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-stack b-right-rail__main-interior-item" data-style-direction="vertical" data-style-justification="start" data-style-alignment="unset" data-style-inline="false" data-style-wrap="nowrap"&gt;&lt;a class="c-overline b-overline TDB" href="/category/politics/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="/category/politics/"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Politics&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h1 class="b-headline"&gt;Trump‚Äôs Former Surgeon General Tears Into RFK Jr. for Fostering Vaccine Skepticism &lt;/h1&gt;&lt;h2 class="c-heading b-subheadline"&gt;In an op-ed, Dr. Jerome Adams noted that Kennedy‚Äôs legacy will depend more on what he does about the measles outbreak now than his words in the past.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="c-stack b-double-chain" data-style-direction="vertical" data-style-justification="start" data-style-alignment="unset" data-style-inline="false" data-style-wrap="nowrap"&gt;&lt;div class="c-grid b-double-chain__children-grid"&gt;&lt;div class="c-stack b-double-chain__child-item" data-style-direction="vertical" data-style-justification="start" data-style-alignment="unset" data-style-inline="false" data-style-wrap="nowrap"&gt;&lt;div class="Article-byline--single-author"&gt;&lt;p class="PublicationTime"&gt;&lt;time class="PublicationTime__pub-time" datetime="March 20, 2025 at 9:31PM EDT"&gt;&lt;span class="PublicationTime__date-label"&gt;Published¬†&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="PublicationTime__date"&gt;Mar. 20 2025¬†&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="PublicationTime__time"&gt;9:31PM EDT¬†&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="b-lead-art"&gt;&lt;figure class="c-media-item"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="c-media-item__fig-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__credit"&gt;Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p id="c0fDzxgXCT3g12H" data-fusion-collection="chains" data-fusion-type="article-body" data-fusion-message="Could not render component [chains:article-body]"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="Short-author-bio-tips"&gt;&lt;p class="Short-author-bio-tips__tip"&gt;Got a tip?

&lt;hr class="t-copy has-xxl-vert-marg"&gt;
    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;The Texas parents of an unvaccinated 6-year-old girl who died from measles Feb. 26 told the anti-vaccine organization Children’s Health Defense this week that the experience did not convince them that vaccination against measles was necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“She says they would still say ‘Don’t do the shots,’ ” an unidentified translator for the parents said. “They think it’s not as bad as the media is making it out to be.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;The couple, members of a Mennonite community in Gaines County, spoke on camera in both English and Low German to CHD Executive Director Polly Tommey and CHD Chief Scientific Officer Brian Hooker.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“It was her time on Earth,” the translator said the parents told her. “They believe she’s better off where she is now.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“We would absolutely not take the MMR,” the mother said in English, referring to the measles-mumps-rubella vaccination children typically receive before attending school. She said her stance on vaccination has not changed after her daughter’s death.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“The measles wasn’t that bad. They got over it pretty quickly,” the mother said of her other four surviving children who were treated with castor oil and inhaled steroids and recovered.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;The couple told CHD that their daughter had measles for days when she became tired and the girl’s labored breathing prompted the couple to take her to Covenant Children’s Hospital in Lubbock. There, the girl was intubated and died a few days later. The other children came down with measles after their sister died.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;The&lt;a href="https://live.childrenshealthdefense.org/chd-tv/shows/good-morning-chd/breaking-news-parents-of-child-in-texas-measles-outbreak-death/"&gt; parents’ interview&lt;/a&gt; was posted on the website of Children’s Health Defense, an organization founded in 2007 by Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who is now secretary for the U.S. Health and Human Services Department. Kennedy &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2024/12/03/rfk-jr-maha-pay-vaccine-group-childrens-health-defense/"&gt;stepped down from the organization&lt;/a&gt; to run for president in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;The deceased girl’s father insisted that measles helps build up a person’s immune system. “Also the measles are good for the body for the people,” the father said, explaining “You get an infection out.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;The Mennonite community located in remote Gaines County, about 400 miles west of Dallas, has been the center of a West Texas measles outbreak. As of Tuesday, &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2025/02/18/texas-measles-outbreak-climbs/"&gt; measles has spread to 279 patients&lt;/a&gt; in Gaines and nearby counties.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Covenant Children’s Hospital in Lubbock, which cared for the couple’s daughter, released a prepared statement on Thursday. They said the interview circulating online contains “misleading and inaccurate claims regarding care provided at Covenant Children’s” and that the hospital could not directly speak about the girl’s case because of patient confidentiality laws.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“What we can say is that our physicians and care teams follow evidence-based protocols and make clinical decisions based on a patient’s evolving condition, diagnostic findings and the best available medical knowledge,” the statement said.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Covenant Children’s reiterated that measles is a highly contagious, potentially life-threatening disease that often creates serious, well-known complications like pneumonia and encephalitis.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;The hospital urged anyone with questions about measles to contact their health provider.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A new study found that low waist-to-hip ratio may be associated with better brain connectivity in older age.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Researchers also found that a high waist-to-hip ratio may negatively affect 25% of the white matter tracts in your brain.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;White matter helps your brain communicate with itself and your spinal cord.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Keeping our minds sharp as we age is essential on many levels, from helping us preserve our independence to increasing longevity and quality of life. And since changes in the brain start decades before symptoms of dementia show up, it’s never too early to begin healthy brain habits.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Some of those habits might include keeping an eye on &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/7-habits-dementia-study-11695904" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;your blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;, getting &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/alzheimers-exercise-study-11691515" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;in some exercise&lt;/a&gt; and eating a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/polyphenols-reduce-cognitive-decline-11680121" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;wide variety of fruits and veggies&lt;/a&gt;. Maintaining a healthy weight can be pretty important as well. Some studies have linked obesity with worse brain health, though much of that research has used BMI to determine the weight class of study participants, and BMI is not always the most accurate measure of weight. For example, someone can have a lot of lean mass—including muscle and bone—and low body fat, yet rank in the “obese” BMI category. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For this reason, European researchers decided to use waist-to-hip ratio instead of BMI since abdominal fat &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/could-the-body-roundness-index-replace-bmi-8658684" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;may be a more accurate measure&lt;/a&gt; of disease risk. These researchers wanted to know if diet quality and abdominal fat during middle age are associated with cognitive decline at older ages. They published their findings in &lt;em&gt;JAMA Network Open.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Here’s what they found.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-was-this-study-conducted"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Was This Study Conducted? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Researchers drew data from a long-term study called the Whitehall II Study at University College London. This study began in 1985 and looked at the relationship between socioeconomic factors, work conditions and health outcomes in people who worked in British public service. Over 10,000 participants were followed for 30 years, which were broken up into 13 study “waves.” Waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) was measured during five of those waves.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For this study, researchers also used brain MRI scan data from a random subset of the larger Whitehall II Study. That study was called the Whitehall II Imaging Substudy at the University of Oxford, and it included 775 participants who received functional brain MRI scans. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The study at hand consists of two cohorts. The first, called the diet cohort, was made up of 506 participants, 79% of them male. Data was drawn from three waves of the Whitehall II study, and the average participant age was 48 at the first wave used and 70 when the MRI scans were performed. The second cohort for this study was called the WHR cohort. It was made up of 657 participants, 80% of them male, with similar ages to the diet cohort on average.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Diet quality was determined via food frequency questionnaires given during three of the waves. After data was collected, participants’ diet quality was assigned a score using the Alternative Healthy Eating Index-2010—generally, the higher the number, the healthier the diet. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Abdominal adiposity was determined using the WHR, which was estimated by measuring hip and waist circumferences and then dividing the waist circumference by the hip circumference. The lower the ratio, the less abdominal adiposity. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Researchers also examined participants’ brain scans. The MRI brain scans were functional—as opposed to still, snapshot images of the brain—allowing the researchers to examine blood flow in the brain, which is a measure of brain function.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-callout mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-generic" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt; &lt;h3 class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__heading"&gt;Study Limitations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;To assess diet, researchers used self-reported food questionnaires, which may have errors if participants misremember or misreport their eating habits.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Participants in this study were largely middle-aged and predominantly male. Though researchers adjusted for differences in sex, these findings may be less applicable for women.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The participants in this study were also generally healthier than the U.K. population at large, researchers note, and the participants were mostly white and British, which means these findings may be limited in their generalizability.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-did-this-study-find"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What Did This Study Find? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Statistical analysis suggests that higher diet quality and lower WHR during the study period were associated with better structural and functional connectivity in the brain later in life. In addition, a lower WHR during midlife was associated with better working memory and executive function later in life. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In contrast, higher abdominal fat in midlife was associated with worse cognitive performance in older age, including fluency, episodic memory, working memory and executive function. This was, in part, evidenced by higher widespread diffusivity of white matter in the brain. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; White matter is brain tissue composed of nerve fibers that facilitate rapid transmission of electrical signals between different brain regions and the spinal cord. For your brain health, you definitely want to keep your white matter intact. These researchers found that, on average, about 25% of white matter tracts were negatively affected in people with higher WHR during midlife.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-does-this-apply-to-real-life"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Does This Apply to Real Life? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Another study has suggested that compared to imbalanced diets—like high-protein, low-fiber diets—a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/the-importance-of-a-balanced-diet-for-brain-health-8641834" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;healthy, balanced diet that includes a variety of foods&lt;/a&gt; may be better for brain health. This current study seems to support this notion.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290813/mind-diet-best-foods-to-eat-to-keep-your-brain-young/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;MIND diet&lt;/a&gt;—a fusion of the Mediterranean and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7938379/the-1-diet-to-lower-high-blood-pressure-according-to-science/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;DASH diets&lt;/a&gt;—focuses on brain-healthy nutrients, including antioxidants, vitamins, minerals, fiber, protein and healthy fats. And there’s a bonus: the MIND diet is also good for your heart and can be great &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/mind-diet-diabetes-study-11696569" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;for people with diabetes&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The MIND diet is flexible and can be tailored to your preferences. To get started, try our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/simple-7-day-cognitive-health-meal-plan-11685540" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Simple 7-Day Cognitive Health Meal Plan&lt;/a&gt;. Created by a registered dietitian, it includes meals and snacks for seven days—all the recipes you need to feel inspired in the kitchen. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Other than diet, there are activities you can engage in that will support your brain. Meditating and practicing yoga—or &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/number-one-habit-to-reduce-dementia-risk-8722637" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;moving your body more&lt;/a&gt; through other activities—can reduce stress and protect your brain. Ditto for getting plenty of quality sleep. Since the brain is at least 73% water, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7948091/why-drinking-water-all-day-long-is-not-the-best-way-to-stay-hydrated/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;staying well-hydrated&lt;/a&gt; is an easy way to diffuse brain fog and improve concentration.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Keep your brain active by learning new skills, reading and challenging it with various types of puzzles. And spend time with loved ones, since loneliness has been associated with &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/loneliness-dementia-risk-study-8733921" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;an increased risk of dementia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-the-bottom-line"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; The Bottom Line &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_49-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This study suggests that a healthy, balanced diet and an optimal amount of abdominal fat during the mid-life years may lead to a healthier brain later in life. As with any research, more needs to be done to investigate the connection further.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_50-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_51-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Many factors influence abdominal fat, including diet, exercise, stress and sleep. If you feel like you may need a whole-health overhaul, start with small changes to your routines that you can build on over time. A little less screen time before bed so you can sleep better could be a great first step, or maybe you could aim to try a new healthy recipe each week to get more veggies and healthy fats and proteins into your day. Sometimes the little changes can reap big rewards down the road.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

Researchers found strong links between placental DNA methylation and conditions like schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings suggest that genetic risk factors for psychiatric disorders may be active before birth. Understanding these early epigenetic changes could lead to targeted interventions and personalized prevention strategies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Placental influence:&lt;/strong&gt; DNA methylation in the placenta affects genes linked to psychiatric disorders.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Early intervention potential:&lt;/strong&gt; Identifying risks in prenatal stages may allow for prevention.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neurodevelopmental origins:&lt;/strong&gt; Schizophrenia and other disorders may start before birth.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of the Basque Country&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A study that involved 28 researchers from 18 institutions across Europe and the United States highlights the placenta as a key element in neuropsychiatric development.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The research has demonstrated that specific epigenetic modifications in the placenta, particularly DNA methylation, can influence the expression of genes associated with psychiatric disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108213"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/genetics-schizophrenia-placenta-neurosceince.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/genetics-schizophrenia-placenta-neurosceince-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/genetics-schizophrenia-placenta-neurosceince-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/genetics-schizophrenia-placenta-neurosceince-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/genetics-schizophrenia-placenta-neurosceince-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/genetics-schizophrenia-placenta-neurosceince-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/genetics-schizophrenia-placenta-neurosceince-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/genetics-schizophrenia-placenta-neurosceince.jpg" alt="This shows a brain" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/genetics-schizophrenia-placenta-neurosceince.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/genetics-schizophrenia-placenta-neurosceince-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/genetics-schizophrenia-placenta-neurosceince-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/genetics-schizophrenia-placenta-neurosceince-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/genetics-schizophrenia-placenta-neurosceince-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/genetics-schizophrenia-placenta-neurosceince-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/genetics-schizophrenia-placenta-neurosceince-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The discovery that genetic risk may be linked to placental DNA methylation opens new avenues for preventing and treating psychiatric disorders. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings suggest that genetic risk may already manifest during the prenatal stage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Epigenetic modifications are chemical changes in DNA and its associated proteins that regulate gene activity without altering their sequence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most studied modifications is DNA methylation, a process in which methyl groups—small molecules composed of one carbon and three hydrogen atoms—are added to specific regions of the DNA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This mechanism, essential for development, environmental adaptation, and disease predisposition, is influenced by genetics and responds to factors such as diet, stress, and exposure to pollutants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study results indicate that schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depression disorder are the neuropsychiatric disorders most strongly linked to DNA methylation in the placenta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other conditions, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or autism, show some potentially causal associations, although to a lesser extent, while no visible effects were found in other analyzed pathologies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These findings reinforce the hypothesis that schizophrenia and other disorders have a neurodevelopmental origin and that the placenta plays a fundamental role in this process,” explains Dr. Fernandez-Jimenez.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Implications for Personalized Medicine and Prevention&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The discovery that genetic risk may be linked to placental DNA methylation opens new avenues for preventing and treating psychiatric disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If we could identify risk factors at the prenatal stage, we could intervene before symptoms appear, adjusting treatments or designing personalized preventive strategies,” adds Cilleros-Portet, who completed her PhD at UPV/EHU last summer and is currently a postdoctoral researcher at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also underscores the importance of understanding where and when each genetic factor acts in pathology, since this could impact therapeutic decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Not all genes associated with a disorder should be treated directly; some may have acted in an earlier developmental stages and may not be actionable in adulthood,” concludes Fernandez-Jimenez.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research represents a significant advance in understanding the biological basis of neuropsychiatric disorders and opens new lines of investigation for early detection, as well as for the development of more effective therapies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Additional Information&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study was conducted at IRLab (UPV/EHU and Biobizkaia). IRLab is a multidisciplinary research group coordinated by Dr. José Ramón Bilbao, full professor at UPV/EHU and researcher at Biobizkaia. Dr. Fernandez-Jimenez has been working in this laboratory for years, developing her own research lines in the epigenomics of celiac disease and, more recently, of the placenta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This summer, Dr. Cilleros-Portet completed her doctoral thesis on placental DNA methylation and its impact on health in this laboratory, under the supervision of Fernandez-Jimenez and Bilbao. She is currently a postdoctoral researcher at the prestigious Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this genetics and schizophrenia research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#2e4f5c4f405a544f004c4b475a474f446e4b465b004b5b5d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Arantza Beitia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://ehu.eus" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of the Basque Country&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Arantza Beitia – University of the Basque Country&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image:&lt;/strong&gt; The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-57760-3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Potentially causal associations between placental DNA methylation and schizophrenia and other neuropsychiatric disorders&lt;/a&gt;” by Fernandez-Jimenez et al. &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Potentially causal associations between placental DNA methylation and schizophrenia and other neuropsychiatric disorders&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Increasing evidence supports the role of the placenta in neurodevelopment and in the onset of neuropsychiatric disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, mQTL and iQTL maps have proven useful in understanding relationships between SNPs and GWAS that are not captured by eQTL. In this context, we propose that part of the genetic predisposition to complex neuropsychiatric disorders acts through placental DNA methylation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We construct a public placental &lt;em&gt;cis&lt;/em&gt;-mQTL database including 214,830 CpG sites calculated in 368 fetal placenta DNA samples from the INMA project, and run cell type-, gestational age- and sex-imQTL models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We combine these data with summary statistics of GWAS on ten neuropsychiatric disorders using summary-based Mendelian randomization and colocalization. We also evaluate the influence of identified DNA methylation sites on placental gene expression in the RICHS cohort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We find that placental &lt;em&gt;cis&lt;/em&gt;-mQTLs are enriched in placenta-specific active chromatin regions, and establish that part of the genetic burden for schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depressive disorder confers risk through placental DNA methylation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The potential causality of several of the observed associations is reinforced by secondary association signals identified in conditional analyses, the involvement of cell type-imQTLs, and the correlation of identified DNA methylation sites with the expression levels of relevant genes in the placenta.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Thu, 20 Mar 2025 20:52:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidkFVX3lxTE5INktiYjNCbTloR3NrTkl1ZHRJLVUzY0tlT3FHR2psZ2ZIeXJrQ3FCekoyTHozTnowZnF3a1NsUWdyYWhCaXhwaEcyNGpsbzlTOFBFLXdfcTRnVVJ2dmNyN2RvRFI4TjdmYmhnNjVpVDJCM2FseUE</guid></item><item><title>Artificial sweeteners and sugar substitutes directly linked to heart attacks and strokes - Earth.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqAFBVV95cUxQalRBSXAwTFd6U2ljYTI1X1dqOS1DM0NidC1vSlNpMS0tc3c2WGZnUUszenNGNWg4b0k4OEhkc1ZWa1E5SHRieTFKMjNWUHgxZ19ITEZ1b0lnbHA5czlPQjlHcEplTHhoQ1MyaFpQOXVSbGF6anh3Rk15TnB1QjNwMklscnlaZ1ZaRF9Fd2R3SWtTdXM2dXRkVTRMVW9oQ1pTV1FuZmtza18?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page_content__AwOj6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sugar substitutes and artificial sweeteners show up in many diets and “low-calorie” products, promoted as a way to help people enjoy sweet flavors without the usual calories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some folks pick them to help manage weight goals or reduce daily sugar intake. Others look for sugar-free snacks to limit changes in blood glucose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their popularity reflects a common desire to avoid sugar-related pitfalls. Yet concerns continue to surface about how these substances may affect overall health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Senior and corresponding author Stanley Hazen, M.D., Ph.D., from Cleveland Clinic’s &lt;a href="https://www.lerner.ccf.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Lerner Research Institute&lt;/a&gt;, addresses these questions through new findings on certain sugar substitutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-sugar-substitutes-the-basics"&gt;Sugar substitutes – the basics&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are many forms of “sugar substitutes,” also known as artificial sweeteners. &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/mice-fed-artificial-sweetener-exhibit-alarming-health-issues/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Aspartame&lt;/a&gt;, sucralose, saccharin, and sugar alcohols such as erythritol and xylitol are available in various items labeled “diet” or “low-calorie.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They offer sweetness in small amounts because many are far sweeter than table sugar. Saccharin, for example, is typically hundreds of times sweeter than sugar, so only a tiny dose is required.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also appeal to those trying to manage their weight. Some people believe replacing sugar with these products helps them avoid extra calories. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Others rely on them to reduce sudden spikes in blood sugar, which can be appealing to individuals with conditions like diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several regulatory agencies consider many of these sugar substitutes acceptable at certain daily intake levels. Some &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/most-baby-food-isnt-nutritious-despite-what-the-label-says/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;nutritional guidelines&lt;/a&gt; encourage their use when people need to cut back on simple carbohydrates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Many professional societies and clinicians routinely recommend that people at high &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/young-cannabis-users-face-higher-heart-attack-risk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;cardiovascular risk&lt;/a&gt; – those with obesity, diabetes, or metabolic syndrome – consume foods that contain sugar substitutes rather than sugar,” Dr. Hazen explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These findings highlight the importance of further long-term clinical studies to assess the cardiovascular safety of erythritol and other sugar substitutes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though these products are labeled “&lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/food-ingredients-packaging/generally-recognized-safe-gras" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Generally Recognized as Safe&lt;/a&gt;,” the way individuals actually consume them raises questions that may not have been fully covered in past research. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some experts would like to see broader and longer studies on potential effects beyond weight management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-sugar-substitute-called-erythritol"&gt;Sugar substitute called Erythritol&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over time, scientists wondered if all sugar substitutes behave the same way in the body. A Cleveland Clinic team looked at &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erythritol" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;erythritol&lt;/a&gt;, a sugar alcohol found in sugarless items such as gum and certain snack products. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During an intervention study with healthy volunteers, they noticed a pattern that prompted follow-up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This research raises some concerns that a standard serving of an erythritol-sweetened food or beverage may acutely stimulate a direct clot-forming effect,” said study co-author W. H. Wilson Tang, M.D., research director for Heart Failure and Cardiac Transplantation Medicine at &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Erythritol and other sugar alcohols commonly used as sugar substitutes should be evaluated for potential long-term health effects, especially when such effects are not seen with glucose itself.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-xylitol-also-has-issues"&gt;Xylitol also has issues&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those same scientists saw that &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/holiday-dangers-keeping-your-pets-safe-on-easter-weekend/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;xylitol&lt;/a&gt;, another sugar alcohol, displayed similar behavior in the bloodstream. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Individuals with higher xylitol levels appeared to have an increased likelihood of experiencing serious cardiac-related events over the following few years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since these trends emerged in people already facing cardiovascular issues, the question has become whether these substances could pose added risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some products are marketed as keto-friendly, which has further boosted the reputation of sugar alcohols for those on very &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/low-carb-diets-have-more-nutritional-value-than-expected/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;low-carb diets&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While xylitol and erythritol fit the profile for reduced-calorie sweetening, this latest work suggests that they merit deeper research to see how they interact with blood and overall heart function in various groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-balancing-sweetness-and-safety"&gt;Balancing sweetness and safety&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In light of the new data, there are suggestions for caution, particularly if a person has conditions linked to thrombosis or other cardiac complications. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I feel that choosing sugar-sweetened treats occasionally and in small amounts would be preferable to consuming drinks and foods sweetened with these sugar alcohols, especially for people at elevated risk of thrombosis, such as those with &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/sugary-drinks-linked-to-millions-of-diabetes-and-heart-disease-cases/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt;, diabetes, or metabolic syndrome,” Dr. Hazen advises. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Cardiovascular disease builds over time, and heart disease is the leading cause of death globally. We need to make sure the foods we eat aren’t hidden contributors.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Manufacturers often include sugar substitutes in a range of drinks and snacks. Some individuals like them simply because they believe they promote better control of caloric intake. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet researchers suggest that people who already have heart-related issues or metabolic conditions pay special attention to how often they rely on these sweeteners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-does-any-of-this-matter"&gt;Why does any of this matter?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One reason experts remain cautious is the fact that sweetener consumption can vary widely from person to person. Some drink several diet beverages a day or frequently snack on sugar-free treats. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guidelines about upper intake levels were developed when long-term &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/morning-coffee-drinkers-have-a-lower-risk-of-heart-disease-and-death/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;cardiovascular outcomes&lt;/a&gt; were less clear. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, these studies may prompt new evaluations of how all sugar alcohols behave in those at high risk for blood clots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether someone chooses sugar alternatives for &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/weight-loss-drugs-could-save-an-enormous-number-of-lives/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;weight management&lt;/a&gt; or portion control, these details introduce fresh reasons to check in with a healthcare provider. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An individual plan that considers medical history and personal risk factors can be valuable when figuring out how often to use products sweetened with substances like erythritol or xylitol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-s-next-for-sugar-substitutes"&gt;What’s next for sugar substitutes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Opinions differ about whether these sugar substitutes fully serve their intended purpose. Some see them as helpful for limiting sugar. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Others consider them a source of unintended problems when used regularly, especially in people with a history of heart disease or metabolic disorders. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As new information continues to emerge, discussions may lead to fresh guidelines or label requirements that highlight potential cardiovascular considerations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, moderate consumption and a balanced diet remain popular approaches. Artificial sweeteners may fit into certain meal plans, but the recent research from Cleveland Clinic invites extra thought about possible drawbacks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reading labels and talking with trusted healthcare professionals can help people figure out the best mix of sweet options in daily life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That awareness may allow many to avoid unwelcome surprises while still keeping their favorite flavors on the menu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full study was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/ATVBAHA.124.321019" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Arteriosclerosis Thrombosis and Vascular Biology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 20 Mar 2025 20:46:23 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqAFBVV95cUxQalRBSXAwTFd6U2ljYTI1X1dqOS1DM0NidC1vSlNpMS0tc3c2WGZnUUszenNGNWg4b0k4OEhkc1ZWa1E5SHRieTFKMjNWUHgxZ19ITEZ1b0lnbHA5czlPQjlHcEplTHhoQ1MyaFpQOXVSbGF6anh3Rk15TnB1QjNwMklscnlaZ1ZaRF9Fd2R3SWtTdXM2dXRkVTRMVW9oQ1pTV1FuZmtza18</guid></item><item><title>Brain’s Memory Maps Constantly Evolve to Capture Changing Experiences - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif0FVX3lxTE0zUFV5VVd1UWQzeWdOYzhqSk41RFpyU0hsaTJyc1M1LUlHU0JIem5yQmJMYXdoUF9EekhuWGhyQU4yQVFUUTFfNndncjFDejJnbVNUUzdLMkVKRWxRS0E0cGNsY0p4a012blJyVkdocV9WS1BDVFZMdjBTS0Z5dG8?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;A new study reveals that memory-related brain activity continues to shift even after learning, challenging traditional views of stable neural representations. Researchers analyzed hippocampal neurons in mice and found that their “place cells,” which encode spatial memory, subtly changed each time the mice revisited a familiar environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using computational modeling, the study showed that traditional Hebbian plasticity (neurons that fire together wire together) could not fully explain these shifts, while a newer model called Behavioral Timescale Synaptic Plasticity (BTSP) did. BTSP, triggered by calcium spikes in neurons, was found to be more influential in shaping how memories are recorded in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dynamic memory maps:&lt;/strong&gt; Brain cells continuously update spatial memories rather than stabilizing them.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New plasticity rule:&lt;/strong&gt; BTSP better explains shifting memory representations than traditional learning models.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Encoding experiences:&lt;/strong&gt; Place cells may capture subtle differences in time, environment, and context.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Chicago&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As animals experience new things, the connections between neurons, called synapses, strengthen or weaken in response to events and the activity they cause in the brain.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neuroscientists believe that synaptic plasticity, as these changes are called, plays an important role in storing memories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108209"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/synaptic-plasticity-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/synaptic-plasticity-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/synaptic-plasticity-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/synaptic-plasticity-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/synaptic-plasticity-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/synaptic-plasticity-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/synaptic-plasticity-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/synaptic-plasticity-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/synaptic-plasticity-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/synaptic-plasticity-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/synaptic-plasticity-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/synaptic-plasticity-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/synaptic-plasticity-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/synaptic-plasticity-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/synaptic-plasticity-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Although the research shows that hippocampal activity is much more dynamic during memory formation than previously thought, it’s still not clear what purpose these shifting representations could serve. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the rules governing when and how much synapses change are not well understood. The traditional view is that the more two neurons fire together, the stronger their connection becomes; when they fire separately, their connection weakens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New research from the University of Chicago on the hippocampus, a brain area essential for memory, suggests that this is not the whole story. Other rules of synaptic plasticity appear to have a bigger effect and better explain how brain activity continually reshapes the way memories are recorded in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patterns of activity and their neuronal representations change a lot as an animal becomes more familiar with a new environment or experience. Surprisingly, those patterns keep evolving even once something is learned, albeit more slowly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When you go into a room, it’s new at first but it quickly becomes familiar to you every time you come back,” said Mark Sheffield, PhD, Associate Professor of Neurobiology and the Neuroscience Institute at UChicago and senior author of the new study published in &lt;em&gt;Nature Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So, you might expect that neuronal activity representing that room would settle and become stable, but it continues to change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These changes in representation, during learning and after, must be driven by synaptic plasticity, but what kind of plasticity exactly? It’s hard to know, because we don’t have the technology to measure that directly in behaving animals,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shifting place cells&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 2014 Nobel Prize in Medicine was awarded for the discovery of “place cells”: neurons in the hippocampus that activate only when an animal is at a certain spot in a room, called the “place field.” Different neurons have their place fields at different locations in the room, covering the entire environment and forming what’s known as a cognitive map.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the new study, Antoine Madar, PhD, a postdoctoral researcher in Sheffield’s lab, studied place cell activity recorded in the brains of mice as they scampered through different environments. The mice first ran through a familiar environment, then switched to an unfamiliar one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers expected to see the same patterns of activity when the mice were in a place they knew, and different patterns as they learned a new environment. Instead, they saw that the activity was slightly different every time, and reasoned that these changes reflected synaptic plasticity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand what drives these constant changes in neuronal representations, Madar built a computational model of hippocampal neurons, and then applied different plasticity rules to see if they would make place cells behave in the same patterns seen in the mouse data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of the traditional “neurons that fire together wire together” rule, known as Hebbian &lt;em&gt;Spike Timing-Dependent Plasticity&lt;/em&gt; (STDP), a different, non-Hebbian rule called &lt;em&gt;Behavioral Timescale Synaptic Plasticity&lt;/em&gt; (BTSP) best explained the shifting place field dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some changes in place cell activity were subtle; the cell fired in a slightly different location than the previous time. Others were more drastic, jumping to a completely different location. STDP could only explain the small gradual shifts, Madar said, but BTSP could explain the whole range of shifting trajectories, including the big nonlinear shifts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We know a lot about the physiology that supports synaptic plasticity, but we usually don’t know how important those things are for learning,” Madar said. “Our study provides evidence that BTSP is more impactful than STDP in shaping hippocampal activity during familiarization.”   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BTSP is a fairly recent discovery, so Madar said that comparing their data and models allowed them to learn a lot about this new plasticity rule. For instance, they knew that BSTP is triggered by large jumps in the amount of calcium inside cells, but they didn’t know how frequently these jumps happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new research shows that while these jumps are rare, they occur more frequently when an animal is learning and forming new memories. The researchers also found that once a place field forms, the probability of these BTSP-triggering events follows a simple decaying pattern, with only slight variations across brain regions or familiarity levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is enough to explain the awesome diversity in individual place field dynamics that we observed,” Madar said.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Encoding the entire experience&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the research shows that hippocampal activity is much more dynamic during memory formation than previously thought, it’s still not clear what purpose these shifting representations could serve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Continually evolving neuronal representations could help the brain distinguish between similar memories that happened in the same place but at different times, a very important process to avoid pathological memory confusion, a hallmark of multiple neurological and cognitive disorders,” Madar said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sheffield starts to sound Proustian when considering this question.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Every time you come back into the room that you’re sitting in, you’re somehow able to track that you’re in the same room. But it’s a different day and a different time, right? You can never completely replicate an experience, and somehow the brain tracks all that,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So, one idea is that these dynamics in memory representations are encoding just that. They’re encoding slight changes in the experience, like maybe you have a coffee one time and later you have lunch in the same room.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These subtle differences in setting, odors, time — all these slight changes in experience could be encoded into the memory through the changes in these place fields. They’re not just encoding the environment; they’re encoding the entire experience that occurs there.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;The study, “Synaptic Plasticity Rules Driving Representational Shifting in the Hippocampus,” was funded by the National Institutes of Health (DP2NS111657, F32MH126643), the Whitehall Foundation, the Searle Scholars Program and the Sloan Foundation.

BTSP-triggering events are rare, but more frequent during new experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During exploration, their probability is dynamic—it decays after PF onset, but continually drives a population-level representational drift.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, our results show that BTSP occurs in CA3 but is less frequent and phenomenologically different than in CA1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, our study provides a new framework to understand how synaptic plasticity continuously shapes neuronal representations during learning.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Thu, 20 Mar 2025 20:38:13 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMif0FVX3lxTE0zUFV5VVd1UWQzeWdOYzhqSk41RFpyU0hsaTJyc1M1LUlHU0JIem5yQmJMYXdoUF9EekhuWGhyQU4yQVFUUTFfNndncjFDejJnbVNUUzdLMkVKRWxRS0E0cGNsY0p4a012blJyVkdocV9WS1BDVFZMdjBTS0Z5dG8</guid></item><item><title>CDC confirms D1.3 genotype in recent H5N1 case in Ohio - University of Minnesota Twin Cities</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMioAFBVV95cUxOLXlEVjJuNUJoOXM5VTBDNUpkNWJmUU9DRVRpaFJLSHctQk9wd25QdlhYaHlEVkRPdEltMXhHYktwX3J5akVZSGVHOFZpZE9lOEZyZHg2X0QzTW1NWWlwVUZNc2VnV3gzTzlMVkhXSVdSUTFkaUNQVXVFMGtCV2tlRFpBcmxhTGFvOURDbHdxTnZJTzY3MjVVVjg4VEc4aUM2?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/spotlights/h5n1-response-03192025.html"&gt;update&lt;/a&gt; yesterday on scientific investigations related to H5N1 avian flu activity, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said genetic sequencing had identified the D1.3 genotype in a sample from an Ohio poultry culler whose infection was reported in the middle of February.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, the CDC reported serology findings from the investigation into a January H5N1 infection in a San Francisco child whose exposure to the virus remains unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other developments, the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) today announced new funding to battle avian flu in poultry, as its Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) confirmed more H5N1 detections in poultry from four states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;First known illness involving D1.3 genotype&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the early months of 2025, Ohio’s commercial poultry sector emerged as one of the worst affected by H5N1 outbreaks, and the poultry worker had prolonged contact with birds that had been sick. He was hospitalized with both respiratory and nonrespiratory symptoms. The patient had initially tested negative on upper-respiratory samples but was positive on lower respiratory tract sampling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC said sequencing shows the virus is a clade 2.3.4.4b virus of the D1.3 genotype, which like the D1.1 genotype descended from the A3 genotype that was introduced to North America in 2022 and has since reassorted with North American wild bird avian flu viruses. D1.1 has been circulating in wild birds and poultry and recently jumped to dairy cattle in Nevada and Arizona. It has also been implicated in a few human infections, two of them severe and one fatal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Genetic analysis of the D1.3 virus didn’t identify any markers that would impact the effectiveness of antivirals or candidate vaccine viruses, the CDC said, adding that it did not see any changes that would allow the virus to more easily adapt to or spread among mammals. Efforts to isolate the live virus are still underway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Serology in California probe rules out human-to-human spread&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In another update, the CDC said its scientists have completed serology testing on blood samples from close contacts of a San Fransico child whose mild illness from an undetermined source was first announced in February.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The child’s blood had antibodies to H5N1, but testing on samples from the child’s close contacts were negative for previous infection with the virus, suggesting that none of them were infected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These findings are reassuring,” the CDC said, noting that so far, no human-to-human H5N1 transmission has been detected in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings are reassuring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In its report, the CDC also spotlighted two recently published ferret studies that found pre-existing antibodies from earlier infection with the 2009 H1N1 seasonal flu virus might provide some protection against H5N1. One of the two studies, published this week in &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanmic/article/PIIS2666-5247(24)00338-0/fulltext"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Lancet Microbe&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, also found that the ferrets with previous exposure to H1N1 were less likely to pass the virus to animals in the same enclosure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same study also found that ferrets with ocular exposure to the B3.13 genotype H5N1 virus developed severe and transmissible disease, similar to when they were infected by the respiratory route, which the CDC said supports the recommendation for wearing eye protection when exposed to infected or potentially infected animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;USDA announces funding for poultry avian flu measures&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other H5N1 developments, the USDA today &lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/news/agency-announcements/usda-announces-next-steps-effort-support-fight-against-avian-influenza"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; up to $100 million in funding for projects to battle avian flu in poultry and reduce the price of eggs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The three priority areas are novel therapeutics and improved diagnostics, research to better understand how the virus is introduced into poultry flocks and to inform biosecurity mitigation steps, and novel vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agency said it consulted with other federal health agencies in setting the funding opportunities. The USDA emphasized that no vaccines are currently authorized and that any decision to move forward with use will involve input from federal agencies, states, veterinarians, farmers, the public health system, and the American public. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;More poultry outbreaks in 4 states&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the USDA’s APHIS confirmed more H5N1 detections in &lt;a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/livestock-poultry-disease/avian/avian-influenza/hpai-detections/commercial-backyard-flocks"&gt;poultry flocks&lt;/a&gt; from four states, including a layer pullet facility Indiana that has more than 1.3 million birds and a commercial duck breeding farm&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, the virus hit backyard flocks in Illinois, Kansas, and Montana.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;Tristan Yates has no doubt about her first memory, even if it is a little fuzzy.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I was about three and a half in Callaway Gardens in Georgia," she recalls, "just running around with my twin sister trying to pick up Easter eggs."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But she has zero memories before that, which is typical. This amnesia of our babyhood is pretty much the rule.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We have memories from what happened earlier today and memories from what happened earlier last week and even from a few years ago," says &lt;a href="https://tristansyates.github.io/" target="_blank"&gt;Yates&lt;/a&gt;, who's a cognitive neuroscientist at Columbia University. "But all of us lack memories from our infancy."&lt;/p&gt;   
   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Is that because we don't make memories when we're babies, or is there something else responsible? Now, in new research published by Yates and her colleagues in the journal &lt;a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adw1923" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, they propose that babies are able to form memories, even if they become inaccessible later in life.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;These results might reveal something crucial about the earliest moments of our development. "That's the time when we learn who our parents are, that's when we learn language, that's when we learn how to walk," Yates says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"What happens in your brain in the first two years of life is magnificent," says &lt;a href="https://ntblab.yale.edu/" target="_blank"&gt;Nick Turk-Browne&lt;/a&gt;, a cognitive neuroscientist at Yale University. "That's the period of by far the greatest plasticity across your whole life span. And better understanding how your brain learns and remembers in infancy lays the foundation for everything you know and do for the rest of your life."&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Babies are the worst — subjects&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;There's a reason we don't know much about infant memories. One of the best ways to look deep in the brain is with an fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) machine, which requires a person to remain still for an extended period of time — but just try to get a baby to cooperate with that!&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"Infants in many ways are the worst possible subject population," admits Turk-Browne. "They don't understand instructions. It's like taking a photograph — you get a blurry picture [so] you can't move a millimeter. And also they have really short attention spans. So we had to adapt."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Turk-Browne and his colleagues have spent nearly a decade figuring out how to do fMRI research on babies. They have come up with all sorts of tricks to keep them happy and engaged. If they cry, the experiment stops so the baby can play or go for a walk. "We have them bring comfort items like a pacifier or a blanket or a toy," he says. "I've given babies a bottle during these scans."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The researchers nestle the baby in bedding, the child's parent is always in the room with them, and the tasks required of them are short. "It's the only way to be able to ask what's going on in the infant's mind despite not being able to ask them questions," says Turk-Browne. "You can look at their brain and their brain has the answers."&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Screen time in the name of science&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Here's how this particular experiment went down. The babies were shown a video inside the fMRI machine. Throughout, the background displays a green kaleidoscopic pattern — "this kind pf psychedelic screen meant to have infants fixate towards the center of the screen," says Yates.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Then, one image at a time appears for two seconds before disappearing. These are images that they have never seen before — a canyon, a dog toy, a woman's face.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"About a minute later," says Yates, "we show them one image they just saw alongside a different image from the same category." That could be the canyon, say, alongside a waterfall.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;If the baby remembered seeing the canyon earlier, the child will look longer at the canyon than at the waterfall. "It's as if you're still learning about it, so you're looking at it more," says Turk-Browne. "It's only really when they have a preference for the familiar thing that we take that as evidence of successful memory formation."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;This procedure gave the researchers an indication as to which images the baby remembered, and which they forgot.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the fMRI was snapping pictures of the baby's brain, including its hippocampus, "a region that we know is super important for memory in adults," says Yates.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The scans revealed that starting at about 12 months of age, the more activity there was in the baby's hippocampus when seeing an image for the first time — like that canyon — the more likely they were to remember that image later.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"What we're able to conclude is that the hippocampus can encode individual memories, even in human infants," says Yates. She and her colleagues say it's evidence that a memory has formed in the baby's hippocampus.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Unlocking our earliest moments&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;These results allow scientists to "put the time stamp of our first memory a little bit earlier than when we thought possible," says &lt;a href="https://www.biozentrum.unibas.ch/about/administration/administration-a-z/overview/unit/research-group-flavio-donato" target="_blank"&gt;Flavio Donato&lt;/a&gt;, a neurobiologist at the University of Basel who wasn't involved in the research.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;He says it now appears that infancy isn't a passive, forgettable stage of our lives — a relevant consideration for how we raise and educate children, and even how we understand early trauma or stress.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's an important question," says Donato, "how these traumatic events might lead to memories or traces in the brain that might persist for a long time and might even influence the way in which this person will develop."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;There's still a lot to figure out. Just how durable are the memories we may be storing as infants? And if they're still there, locked away in our older brains, are they forever off limits?&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The question is," asks Turk-Browne, "could you circumvent that in some way to help kids, or adults even, potentially reactivate old memories?"&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;To try to answer this question, the researchers are performing another study in which they ask families to record home videos from their baby's perspective. Later, in the lab, when they play those videos for the infants, they will look to see what's happening in the infant's hippocampus — and just how long those earliest of memories may persist.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new discovery highlights how the network that is involved in creating and storing word memories is dispersed throughout the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is particularly crucial for helping to understand conditions such as epilepsy, in which patients may have difficulty with remembering words. The researchers hope that their findings will help guide neurosurgical treatment for patients with epilepsy by helping surgeons to avoid parts of the brain important for language and memory, that may otherwise be affected, when doing operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Corresponding author, Professor John Duncan (UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology) said: “Being able to remember and recall words is important for day-to-day memory to work well. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Detailed MRI brain scans are used to find out the causes of epilepsy and can show if any parts of the brain are shrunken. By measuring the parts of the brain that are shrunken and how well a person can remember words, we can work out which parts of the brain are used for making and storing memories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In addition, if medication has not stopped seizures occurring, this helps us to guide neurosurgical treatment for a person’s epilepsy, to avoid damaging the parts of the brain that are needed for memory to work well.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the first study of its kind, the researchers examined 84 people with temporal lobe epilepsy (epilepsy arising from the temporal lobe at the sides of the head) and hippocampal sclerosis (a condition in which part of the brain is scarred, and memory is affected) and 43 healthy people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The patients were divided into those with left-sided and right-sided hippocampal sclerosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;High-resolution MRI scans were used to measure the size and shape of different parts of the brain, including the cerebral cortex (the outer layer of the brain responsible for thinking, memory, attention, perception, awareness, and language) and specific areas within the hippocampus (the part of the brain that helps with learning, memory, and spatial navigation).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All participants underwent standardised tests to assess their verbal memory. These tests were part of the Adult Memory and Information Processing Battery, which measures how well people can remember and recall words.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers then compared the memory test scores to the sizes of different brain areas, to see if smaller brain parts were linked to worse memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found that smaller sizes in certain brain areas, like the prefrontal, temporal and cingulate cortices, and parts of the hippocampus, were linked to worse memory for words in people with epilepsy arising in their temporal lobes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings are also important for understanding how the brain organises and remembers words.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lead author, Dr Giorgio Fiore (National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, UCLH) said: “This research is important as it helps us to understand how memory may fail and may help guide the designing of neurosurgical operations for epilepsy that will not make memory worse.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;This work was funded by the Epilepsy Research UK and supported by the National Institute for Health and Care Research University College London Hospitals Biomedical Research Centre (NIHR UCLH BRC).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this language and neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#05752b716a686776457066692b64662b706e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Poppy Tombs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://ucl.ac.uk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;UCL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Poppy Tombs – UCL&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1093/braincomms/fcaf067" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Cortico-hippocampal networks underpin verbal memory encoding in temporal lobe epilepsy&lt;/a&gt;” by John Duncan et al. &lt;em&gt;Brain Communications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cortico-hippocampal networks underpin verbal memory encoding in temporal lobe epilepsy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Knowledge of the structural underpinnings of human verbal memory is scarce. Understanding the human verbal memory network at a finer anatomical scale will have important clinical implications for the management of patients with verbal memory impairment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this cross-sectional study, we aimed to assess the contributions of cerebral cortex and hippocampal subfields to verbal memory encoding in temporal lobe epilepsy. We included consecutive patients (&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 84) with radiologically and pathologically defined hippocampal sclerosis (HS) (44 left-sided) and unilateral temporal lobe epilepsy, and healthy volunteers (&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 43) who were comparable regarding age and sex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The morphometric and volumetric measures of cerebral cortex and hippocampal subfields were extracted from high-resolution MRI scans. People included in this study underwent standardized neuropsychological evaluation, including measures of verbal memory assessed through the Adult Memory and Information Processing Battery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Verbal memory performances were &lt;em&gt;Z&lt;/em&gt;-scores corrected by using means and standard deviations published for sample standardization. Associations between verbal learning &lt;em&gt;Z&lt;/em&gt;-scores and the grey matter volume of the cerebral cortex and hippocampal subfields were investigated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reduction of grey matter volumes in the left and right medial and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;corr&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001), superior and middle temporal gyri (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;corr&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001), anterior and posterior cingulate cortex (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;corr&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001) and of the left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;corr&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001) and parietal–temporal–occipital junction (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;corr&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001) were associated with worse verbal learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings were consistent across both the entire cohort and in a subgroup analysis focused exclusively on HS patients. Within hippocampi, smaller volumes of the left dentate gyrus (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = 0.003), cornu ammonis 4 (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = 0.005) and cornu ammonis 3 (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = 0.03) were associated with worse verbal learning &lt;em&gt;Z&lt;/em&gt;-scores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study demonstrates that verbal learning in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy is strongly related to the volume of distinct regions of the prefrontal, temporal and cingulate cortices and left dentate gyrus, cornu ammonis 4 and cornu ammonis 3 hippocampal subfields.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It provides the basis to suggest a corticohippocampal network for verbal learning in these patients, improving our understanding of human verbal memory. These biomarkers may inform attractive targets for forthcoming modulating therapies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future work may also analyse the impact of sparing part of the left dentate gyrus, cornu ammonis 4 and cornu ammonis 3 as a protective measure against verbal memory impairment after surgery for temporal lobe epilepsy.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Thu, 20 Mar 2025 20:03:52 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiY0FVX3lxTFA2VHdleFhTRXl6SFVKSUc0VGtqVF96U3o4akY1YTVIYngybUpLNXRRVV9POE9xZ2V2R2d6eWd2VldBRFQxWUpzc2tTUHZadms2Z3NqaHBvVC1IRGFWQkJFMXJ1Zw</guid></item><item><title>Changes in Sleep Patterns Could Predict Dementia Risk - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMickFVX3lxTE9fTWZKWU9GcWJnZ3ZuRl9JMzlyRzJoeFdEeWdSMnA1ZFBldV9pZi1oMnI3SVBjVnVaeFAzemdEWkxpUUF5cGQ4Nk8ydVN3VGItdHFNdFR2Z3NqdUhSOVJqS0c3TWZKVlh1WGhQZHV2cWhlZw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;A new study finds that women in their 80s who develop increasing daytime sleepiness over five years are twice as likely to develop dementia.

Increasing sleepiness included increases in both daytime and nighttime sleep duration and quality, along with worsening circadian rhythms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers then looked at how these changes were linked to the risk of developing dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of those in the stable sleep group, 25, or 8%, developed dementia. In the declining nighttime sleep group, 39, or 15%, developed dementia. In the increasing sleepiness group, 29, or 19%, developed dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After adjusting for age, education and race, and health factors such as diabetes and high blood pressure, researchers found that participants in the increasing sleepiness group had double the risk of dementia compared to those in the stable sleep group. No association was found in the declining nighttime sleep group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We observed that sleeping, napping and circadian rhythms can change dramatically over only five years for women in their 80s,” Leng said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This highlights the need for future studies to look at all aspects of daily sleep patterns to better understand how changes in these patterns over time can be linked to dementia risk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A limitation of the study was that it included primarily white people, so the results cannot be generalized to more diverse populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;The study was funded by the National Institutes of Health and the National Institute on Aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this sleep, aging, and dementia research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#3745435244445a5659775656591954585a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Renee Tessman&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://aan.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;AAN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Renee Tessman – AAN&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;The findings will appear in &lt;em&gt;Neurology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Thu, 20 Mar 2025 19:52:41 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMickFVX3lxTE9fTWZKWU9GcWJnZ3ZuRl9JMzlyRzJoeFdEeWdSMnA1ZFBldV9pZi1oMnI3SVBjVnVaeFAzemdEWkxpUUF5cGQ4Nk8ydVN3VGItdHFNdFR2Z3NqdUhSOVJqS0c3TWZKVlh1WGhQZHV2cWhlZw</guid></item><item><title>This mom’s whole body MRI scan revealed a potentially life-threatening ‘ticking time bomb’ - Fortune</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigwFBVV95cUxNc2x3eDRvQnA4NnJxSFppYnJfb3hvTkxRa215RDhGV1RfckxrbFZkbDJNTTJlcTF1ZTE4Smdyem1BUlFDa0hQVURYYWgyeXF0b2JxUkRQdWhwOEV3bXFWSEpRbkZncWE3YUQtblUwa2tDY3pxSEtKSkpMOUV6andSczBOZw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-cy="article-image" class="sc-fac7c12f-7 ifTevn"&gt;&lt;img alt='"I was just so certain that this was going to give me peace of mind and that they were not going to find anything serious," Sarah Blackburn shared in a video ahead of her whole body MRI.

                &lt;li class="ai-article-summary__item"&gt;New research reveals why adults cannot recall infant memories despite having formed them during early development.&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li class="ai-article-summary__item"&gt;Yale University researchers studied brain activity in 26 infants using fMRI scans while showing them images.&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li class="ai-article-summary__item"&gt;The study found hippocampus activity was stronger in babies who were 12 months or older during memory encoding.&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li class="ai-article-summary__item"&gt;Researchers tracked infants' eye movements to determine which images they recognized from previous viewings.&lt;/li&gt;

            Do you ever wonder what it was like to be a baby? But no matter how hard you try, you can’t remember any of the details?
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8g2k6fi0004356mxzgfqjpx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s not that you don’t have memories from infancy — it’s that you simply can’t access them later in life, new research shows.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8g2k6fi0005356mttk9xbbu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The study, published Thursday in the journal &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.adt7570" target="_blank"&gt;Science&lt;/a&gt;, examined 26 infants ranging from 4.2 to 24.9 months, split into two age groups: those younger than 12 months and those 12 to 24 months.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8g2k6fi0006356m6ldx4npa@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            During the experiment, babies were placed in an &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diagnostics/25034-functional-mri-fmri" target="_blank"&gt;fMRI&lt;/a&gt; machine and shown a series of unique images for two seconds each. Researchers aimed to record activity in the &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/hippocampus" target="_blank"&gt;hippocampus&lt;/a&gt; — the portion of the brain associated with emotions, memory and the autonomic nervous system.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “The hippocampus is a deep brain structure that is not visible to standard methods, so we had to develop a new approach for conducting memory experiments with babies inside an MRI machine,” said Dr. Nick Turk-Browne, lead study author and professor in the department of psychology at Yale University, via email. “This kind of research has previously been done mostly while infants are asleep, because they wiggle a lot, cannot follow instructions and have short attention spans.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8g2k6fi0008356mg3q3qd2q@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Simona Ghetti, a professor in the department of psychology at the University of California, Davis, whose research focuses on the development of memory in childhood, acknowledged that while many studies have already demonstrated infants’ capacity to encode memories, this latest research is unique in that it links memory encoding to hippocampal activation. Ghetti was not involved in the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            After a momentary delay, the babies were then shown two images side by side: one of familiar images they had seen before and one that was new. Researchers tracked the babies’ eye movements, noting which image they focused on longer.

            If an infant spent more time looking at the familiar image, it suggested they recognized it, indicating memory recall. If they didn’t show any preference, it likely meant their memory was less developed, according to the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “Eye movements have been used in hundreds of studies on infant memory and  categorization,” Ghetti said via email. “Infants look at what they find interesting, and researchers have long leveraged this spontaneous behavior to derive information about memory functioning.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  



    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8g2jioi0000356m6c6djnu1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Once they collected the initial data, the team analyzed fMRI scans of babies who looked at the familiar image longer, comparing them with those who had no preference. Trials were excluded if the baby wasn’t focused on the screen and moved or blinked excessively.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8g2kyah000l356mm2f4iqht@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The findings revealed that the hippocampus was more active in older infants when encoding memories. Additionally, only older infants exhibited activity in the &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15134840/" target="_blank"&gt;orbitofrontal cortex&lt;/a&gt;, which plays a key role in memory-related decision-making and recognition.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8g2kyah000m356mwdwbfcr1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “One thing we have learned about memory in adults is that the information we tend to capture and encode into memory are things that are highly relevant to our experience,” said Dr. Lila Davachi, a professor in the department of psychology at Columbia University, who was not involved in the study. “The amazing thing about this study is convincingly showing hippocampal encoding processes in babies for stimuli that are, in some sense, unimportant to them.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8g2kyah000n356mimym7cw1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Though it’s still unclear why memory encoding seems to be stronger in babies more than 12 months old, it’s likely a result of major alterations taking place in the body.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8g2kyah000o356mi234e78e@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The infant brain undergoes many perceptual, linguistic, motor, biological and other changes around this time, including the rapid anatomical growth of the hippocampus,” Turk-Browne said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8g2kyah000p356mkyq1i3wf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Turk-Browne and his team are actively working to test why the brain is unable to retrieve these early memories in life, but he speculates that the brain processing in infants may suggest the hippocampus isn’t receiving the accurate “search terms” to find the memory as it was stored based on the experiences the baby was having at the time.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8g2kwml000j356m9trz9z7t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Ghetti encourages parents to think about the impact infancy has on their children, even if the children can’t retrieve memories they experienced at such an early age.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8g2ll8e000y356mxipkbbdg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Babies are learning an enormous amount at this age, which is how they begin to take in&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;an entire language by associating sounds with meanings, Ghetti said. She added that infants are also forming expectations around their family members and studying properties of objects and the world around them.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8g2ll8e000z356masojst20@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Parents often see this learned behavior when they sing the same song or read the same book, which Davachi&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;noted produces a familiar response in older children.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8g2ll8e0010356mf34dp69l@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Using repetition with babies will open up a greater connection between parent and baby,” she said via email.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8g2ll8e0011356mc4pdm3l0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Even though you can’t recall those earliest memories as an adult, it’s fair to say that you’re learning from those experiences, which can be true for both neutral and emotional information, Ghetti said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8g2ll8e0012356mdwfd7362@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “This can remind parents that infancy is not idle&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;time&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;and that infants are learning a great deal,” Ghetti said. “Offering opportunities for visual exploration may be important for cultivating learning skills.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

Kennedy Jr. proposed a novel fix to the nation’s &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/topic/bird-flu" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="bird flu" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67dc3a1fe4b0ca0f703623ba" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="/topic/bird-flu" data-vars-target-content-type="feed" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="0"&gt;bird flu&lt;/a&gt; epidemic: Let the virus spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They should consider maybe the possibility of letting it run through the flocks so that we can identify the birds, and preserve the birds, that are immune to it,” Kennedy said of poultry farmers and federal authorities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is the nation’s agriculture secretary, Brooke Rollins, who has authority over the nation’s poultry management, not Kennedy. But Rollins appears to be in agreement with her counterpart at HHS.

The surviving birds could then be studied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there are reasons that scientists recommend immediately culling infected flocks, and letting the virus run rampant could have dire consequences. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bird flu, H5N1, has a near 100% fatality rate in chickens and turkeys, and has already &lt;a href="https://www.yalemedicine.org/news/h5n1-bird-flu-what-to-know" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="killed millions of wild birds" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67dc3a1fe4b0ca0f703623ba" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.yalemedicine.org/news/h5n1-bird-flu-what-to-know" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="2"&gt;killed millions of wild birds&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the ways it can spread to healthy poultry farms is by a single infected duck visiting a flock and shedding the virus through feces. H5N1 kills relatively quickly, causing respiratory distress, swelling, lack of coordination &lt;a href="https://www.avma.org/resources-tools/animal-health-and-welfare/animal-health/avian-influenza/avian-influenza-companion-animals" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="and other symptoms before death" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67dc3a1fe4b0ca0f703623ba" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.avma.org/resources-tools/animal-health-and-welfare/animal-health/avian-influenza/avian-influenza-companion-animals" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="3"&gt;and other symptoms before death&lt;/a&gt;. (Culling is therefore considered more humane.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The virus has cropped up on farms and in backyard flocks around the country, resulting in some 166 million birds culled so far — resulting in the alarmingly high egg prices seen around the country. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although not common, humans can become infected with H5N1, and one person in the U.S. has died of the infection. Most of the human cases so far have been seen in those who have had prolonged contact with infected birds or dairy cows. There has been no human-to-human transmission &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/spotlights/h5n1-response-01142025.html" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="observed in the United States" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67dc3a1fe4b0ca0f703623ba" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/spotlights/h5n1-response-01142025.html" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="4"&gt;observed in the United States&lt;/a&gt; so far. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that could change. As with other viruses, mass spread gives H5N1 the chance to mutate as it multiplies, running the risk of a mutation that allows the virus to spread easily from human to human.

Kennedy Jr. proposed a novel fix to the nation’s &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/topic/bird-flu" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="bird flu" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67dc3a1fe4b0ca0f703623ba" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="/topic/bird-flu" data-vars-target-content-type="feed" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="0"&gt;bird flu&lt;/a&gt; epidemic: Let the virus spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They should consider maybe the possibility of letting it run through the flocks so that we can identify the birds, and preserve the birds, that are immune to it,” Kennedy said of poultry farmers and federal authorities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is the nation’s agriculture secretary, Brooke Rollins, who has authority over the nation’s poultry management, not Kennedy. But Rollins appears to be in agreement with her counterpart at HHS. As &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/18/health/kennedy-bird-flu.html" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="The New York Times noted" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67dc3a1fe4b0ca0f703623ba" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/18/health/kennedy-bird-flu.html" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="1"&gt;The New York Times noted&lt;/a&gt;, she floated the idea of a pilot program that would allow the disease to ravage a flock, while extra layers of protection contained the spread within a certain perimeter. The surviving birds could then be studied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there are reasons that scientists recommend immediately culling infected flocks, and letting the virus run rampant could have dire consequences. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bird flu, H5N1, has a near 100% fatality rate in chickens and turkeys, and has already &lt;a href="https://www.yalemedicine.org/news/h5n1-bird-flu-what-to-know" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="killed millions of wild birds" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67dc3a1fe4b0ca0f703623ba" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.yalemedicine.org/news/h5n1-bird-flu-what-to-know" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="2"&gt;killed millions of wild birds&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the ways it can spread to healthy poultry farms is by a single infected duck visiting a flock and shedding the virus through feces. H5N1 kills relatively quickly, causing respiratory distress, swelling, lack of coordination &lt;a href="https://www.avma.org/resources-tools/animal-health-and-welfare/animal-health/avian-influenza/avian-influenza-companion-animals" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="and other symptoms before death" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67dc3a1fe4b0ca0f703623ba" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.avma.org/resources-tools/animal-health-and-welfare/animal-health/avian-influenza/avian-influenza-companion-animals" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="3"&gt;and other symptoms before death&lt;/a&gt;. (Culling is therefore considered more humane.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The virus has cropped up on farms and in backyard flocks around the country, resulting in some 166 million birds culled so far — resulting in the alarmingly high egg prices seen around the country. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although not common, humans can become infected with H5N1, and one person in the U.S. has died of the infection. Most of the human cases so far have been seen in those who have had prolonged contact with infected birds or dairy cows. There has been no human-to-human transmission &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/spotlights/h5n1-response-01142025.html" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="observed in the United States" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67dc3a1fe4b0ca0f703623ba" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/spotlights/h5n1-response-01142025.html" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="4"&gt;observed in the United States&lt;/a&gt; so far. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that could change. As with other viruses, mass spread gives H5N1 the chance to mutate as it multiplies, running the risk of a mutation that allows the virus to spread easily from human to human. Experts are already alarmed at the fact that the virus has jumped &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/22/bird-flu-virus-trump" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="from birds to dairy cows" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67dc3a1fe4b0ca0f703623ba" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/22/bird-flu-virus-trump" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="5"&gt;from birds to dairy cows&lt;/a&gt;, as it represents a leap between different species. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mortality rate in humans is estimated to be &lt;a href="https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/wpro---documents/emergency/surveillance/avian-influenza/ai_20250131.pdf" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="around 50%" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67dc3a1fe4b0ca0f703623ba" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/wpro---documents/emergency/surveillance/avian-influenza/ai_20250131.pdf" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="6"&gt;around 50%&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emily Hilliard, the HHS deputy press secretary, told The New York Times that Kennedy was merely trying to say that “culling puts people at the highest risk of exposure” due to the close contact it requires, which is why the secretary and National Institutes for Health “want to limit culling activities.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title"&gt;Go Ad-Free — And Protect The Free Press&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message-container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message support-huffpost-control"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next four years will change America forever.

&lt;p&gt;Cod liver oil contains high levels of vitamin A, which is sometimes administered to measles patients under a physician's supervision. But the supplement is mostly a supportive treatment in children with vitamin deficiencies, and taking too much can cause toxicity. Nevertheless, Kennedy has touted the vitamin and falsely claimed that good nutrition protects against the virus, &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/03/measles-outbreak-hits-208-cases-as-federal-outbreak-response-goes-off-the-rails/"&gt;much to the dismay of pediatricians&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"They had a really good, quick recovery," the mother said of her other four children, attributing their recovery to the unproven treatments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tragic misinformation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most children do recover from measles, regardless of whether they're given cod liver oil. The fatality rate of measles &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/signs-symptoms/index.html"&gt;is nearly 1 to 3 in 1,000 children&lt;/a&gt;, who die with respiratory (e.g., pneumonia) or neurological complications from the virus, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tommey noted that the sibling who died didn't get the alternative treatments, leading the audience to believe that this could have contributed to her death. She also questioned what was written on the death certificate, noting that the girl's pneumonia was from a secondary bacterial infection, not the virus directly, a clear effort to falsely suggest measles was not the cause of death and downplay the dangers of the disease. The parents said they hadn't received the death certificate yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tommey then turned to the MMR vaccine, asking if the mother still felt that it was a dangerous vaccine after her daughter's death from the disease, prefacing the question by claiming to have seen a lot of "injury" from the vaccine. "Do you still feel the same way about the MMR vaccine versus measles?" she asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Yes, absolutely; we would absolutely not take the MMR. The measles wasn't that bad, and they got over it pretty quickly," the mother replied, speaking again of her four living children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"So," Tommey continued, "when you see the fearmongering in the press, which is what we want to stop, that is why we want to get the truth out, what do you say to the parents who are rushing out, panicking, to get the MMR for their 6-month-old baby because they think that that child is going to die of measles because of what happened to your daughter?"&lt;/p&gt;

So what I mean by that is no one's going to their doctor and saying "I feel different" or "I feel as though my functional status has changed," but what's happening is, silently in the background, things are changing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="pullquote"&gt;&lt;span class="text-items"&gt;&lt;span class="pullquote-quotation"&gt;&lt;svg class="pullquote-quotation-open" version="1.1" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewbox="0 0 52.157 39.117" enable-background="new 0 0 52.157 39.117"&gt;&lt;g&gt;&lt;g&gt;&lt;path fill="000000" d="M22.692,10.113c-5.199,1.4-8.398,4.4-8.398,8.801c0,2.4,2,3,3.6,4.199c2.2,1.602,3.4,3.4,3.4,6.602   c0,3.799-3.4,6.799-7.4,6.799c-4.6,0-8.8-3.199-8.8-10.6c0-13.6,7-20,17.599-21.799V10.113z M45.692,10.113   c-5.199,1.4-8.399,4.4-8.399,8.801c0,2.4,2,3,3.601,4.199c2.2,1.602,3.399,3.4,3.399,6.602c0,3.799-3.399,6.799-7.399,6.799   c-4.601,0-8.8-3.199-8.8-10.6c0-13.6,7-20,17.599-21.799V10.113z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/g&gt;&lt;/g&gt;&lt;g display="none"&gt;&lt;g display="inline"&gt; &lt;path fill="000000" d="M6.648,29.759c5.199-1.4,8.398-4.4,8.398-8.801c0-2.398-2-3-3.599-4.199c-2.2-1.6-3.399-3.4-3.399-6.6   c0-3.801,3.399-6.801,7.399-6.801c4.599,0,8.8,3.201,8.8,10.6c0,13.6-7,20-17.6,21.801V29.759z M29.648,29.759   c5.199-1.4,8.398-4.4,8.398-8.801c0-2.398-2-3-3.599-4.199c-2.2-1.6-3.401-3.4-3.401-6.6c0-3.801,3.401-6.801,7.401-6.801   c4.599,0,8.8,3.201,8.8,10.6c0,13.6-7,20-17.6,21.801V29.759z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/g&gt;&lt;/g&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;For the longest time in the field of immunology, there was the sort of adage that your immune system needs to be tested every now and again to stay strong.

There was a recent 2024 &lt;a href="http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2311330" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; that showed us that individuals who survive an acute COVID-19 infection — these are not individuals who are getting diagnosed with long COVID — on average will lose somewhere in the neighbourhood of two to six IQ points per infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Really, with each infection?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;According to the most recent study, yes. So there is a cumulative effect that can be occurring with each infection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Early in the pandemic, we actually published a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35768006/" target="_blank"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; where we showed that, even in animal models — when we infected mice with a very, very mild case of SARS-CoV-2 infection — which only caused lung inflammation, we still saw these inflammatory chemicals called chemokines emerging from the infected lungs and starting to attack central nervous system structures such as the spinal cord and the brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wow. So in other words, COVID is doing more than just infecting the lungs; it's going to other parts of the body&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Exactly. You know, this is a virus that, once it enters the body, is very capable of entering the &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s44161-023-00336-5" target="_blank"&gt;bloodstream&lt;/a&gt;, creating immune responses that travel all over the body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;COVID is largely known as a respiratory disease. Can you walk me through the range of other body systems that might be vulnerable to long-term damage?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Well, in all of the peer-reviewed literature that has emerged on &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adl0867" target="_blank"&gt;long COVID&lt;/a&gt;, we've seen that it is a very diffuse clinical syndrome where every single organ system can be affected. And at last count, over 200 symptoms have been catalogued as potential symptoms of long COVID. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;When we actually dig into the science of why long COVID is causing the symptoms that it's causing, we see that there are problems such as what we call "&lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.adk3295" target="_blank"&gt;viral persistence&lt;/a&gt;." Meaning the SARS-CoV-2 virus is not being effectively cleared by the body and it's sticking around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;It's hiding out in different areas of the body in what we typically call "immune privileged sites," which mean that immune cells don't actually go there and can't sort of seek out and destroy the virus. So that can happen in a number of different locations in the body, which leads to a wide array of symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;We also see that the virus can cause prolonged chronic inflammation that can be whole-body wide. So it can affect every single organ and so often, many of the symptoms that people are experiencing are more related to which organ is most susceptible to them given their past medical history. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;So we see things that are quite insidious. People who were pre-diabetic are suddenly diabetic. People who were having a few issues with gallbladder, suddenly can't digest fat anymore. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;figure class="imageMedia image full"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="image-caption"&gt;COVID infections can lead to long-term health effects in nearly every organ system in the body.  (Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Well, what is it about the coronavirus that enables it to spread throughout the body like that? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;In 2021, two colleagues of mine published a really wonderful &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/microbiology/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2021.698169/full" target="_blank"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; that I think is very prescient and it spoke about why SARS-CoV-2 presents such an increased threat to cause persistent symptoms. The reality of that situation is that this virus has a lot of very unique qualities that specifically cause immune damage to the host.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;So it's not just about infecting you and causing respiratory illness and fever and all of the things that we usually get with the viral infection. This virus also specifically causes your immune system to become weaker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;It disrupts what we call "interferon signalling," which is part of the immune system that helps you to fight off infections or latent infections, such as Epstein Barr virus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Typically our immune system can keep these things suppressed, but when SARS-CoV-2 enters the picture, it starts to cause altered interferon signalling. It causes immune damage and dysregulation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="pullquote"&gt;&lt;span class="text-items"&gt;&lt;span class="pullquote-quotation"&gt;&lt;svg class="pullquote-quotation-open" version="1.1" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewbox="0 0 52.157 39.117" enable-background="new 0 0 52.157 39.117"&gt;&lt;g&gt;&lt;g&gt;&lt;path fill="000000" d="M22.692,10.113c-5.199,1.4-8.398,4.4-8.398,8.801c0,2.4,2,3,3.6,4.199c2.2,1.602,3.4,3.4,3.4,6.602   c0,3.799-3.4,6.799-7.4,6.799c-4.6,0-8.8-3.199-8.8-10.6c0-13.6,7-20,17.599-21.799V10.113z M45.692,10.113   c-5.199,1.4-8.399,4.4-8.399,8.801c0,2.4,2,3,3.601,4.199c2.2,1.602,3.399,3.4,3.399,6.602c0,3.799-3.399,6.799-7.399,6.799   c-4.601,0-8.8-3.199-8.8-10.6c0-13.6,7-20,17.599-21.799V10.113z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/g&gt;&lt;/g&gt;&lt;g display="none"&gt;&lt;g display="inline"&gt; &lt;path fill="000000" d="M6.648,29.759c5.199-1.4,8.398-4.4,8.398-8.801c0-2.398-2-3-3.599-4.199c-2.2-1.6-3.399-3.4-3.399-6.6   c0-3.801,3.399-6.801,7.399-6.801c4.599,0,8.8,3.201,8.8,10.6c0,13.6-7,20-17.6,21.801V29.759z M29.648,29.759   c5.199-1.4,8.398-4.4,8.398-8.801c0-2.398-2-3-3.599-4.199c-2.2-1.6-3.401-3.4-3.401-6.6c0-3.801,3.401-6.801,7.401-6.801   c4.599,0,8.8,3.201,8.8,10.6c0,13.6-7,20-17.6,21.801V29.759z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/g&gt;&lt;/g&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;Although your immune system can take on [a COVID] infection, you want to avoid testing it as much as possible because your body is sustaining damage with each infection that it survives.&lt;svg class="pullquote-quotation-close" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewbox="0 0 52.157 39.117" enable-background="new 0 0 52.157 39.117"&gt;&lt;g display="none"&gt;&lt;g display="inline"&gt;&lt;path fill="000000" d="M22.692,10.113c-5.199,1.4-8.398,4.4-8.398,8.801c0,2.4,2,3,3.6,4.199c2.2,1.602,3.4,3.4,3.4,6.602   c0,3.799-3.4,6.799-7.4,6.799c-4.6,0-8.8-3.199-8.8-10.6c0-13.6,7-20,17.599-21.799V10.113z M45.692,10.113   c-5.199,1.4-8.399,4.4-8.399,8.801c0,2.4,2,3,3.601,4.199c2.2,1.602,3.399,3.4,3.399,6.602c0,3.799-3.399,6.799-7.399,6.799   c-4.601,0-8.8-3.199-8.8-10.6c0-13.6,7-20,17.599-21.799V10.113z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/g&gt;&lt;/g&gt;&lt;g&gt;&lt;g&gt;&lt;path fill="000000" d="M6.648,29.759c5.199-1.4,8.398-4.4,8.398-8.801c0-2.398-2-3-3.599-4.199c-2.2-1.6-3.399-3.4-3.399-6.6   c0-3.801,3.399-6.801,7.399-6.801c4.599,0,8.8,3.201,8.8,10.6c0,13.6-7,20-17.6,21.801V29.759z M29.648,29.759   c5.199-1.4,8.398-4.4,8.398-8.801c0-2.398-2-3-3.599-4.199c-2.2-1.6-3.401-3.4-3.401-6.6c0-3.801,3.401-6.801,7.401-6.801   c4.599,0,8.8,3.201,8.8,10.6c0,13.6-7,20-17.6,21.801V29.759z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/g&gt;&lt;/g&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;cite class="pullquote-source"&gt;- David Putrino, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;And suddenly, not only does your body have trouble clearing the SARS-CoV-2 virus itself, but it also starts to have trouble keeping some of these other viruses that have been latent from reactivating and causing problems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;In addition to SARS-CoV-2's ability to dysregulate the immune system and suppress the immune system, the spike protein itself is very damaging to blood vessel structures as well as red blood cells and platelets themselves. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;And so between those two features, the ability to dysregulate the immune system and the ability to cause systemic damage throughout the bloodstream, you have a very dangerous novel virus on your hands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;figure class="imageMedia image full"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="image-caption"&gt;A scanning electron micrograph of an cell heavily infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus.

In 2023, we published a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06651-y" target="_blank"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; in Nature where we showed that individuals with long COVID were much more likely than a cohort of healthy controls to express signs of what we call "T-cell exhaustion." Meaning that their T cells, which are parts of the immune system that are typically used to fight off infections, are starting to present as exhausted — that there has been a persistent stimulation of these T cells for long enough that their responses over time are starting to weaken. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;As a result, in this study we saw immune dysregulation, we saw hormonal dysregulation, we saw reactivation of herpes viruses that were previously thought to be latent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;And as we have made leaps and bounds in our ability to understand the role of these persistent pathogens, these things that we used to think, "Everybody's got Epstein-Barr virus, but don't worry, it sort of just lays dormant in your body and it doesn't cause any trouble."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;What we're learning is that, well, it very much can cause trouble. If it's mixed with another pathogen and that pathogen causes the reactivation, then people can get very, very sick. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;For the longest time in the field of immunology, there was the sort of adage that your immune system needs to be tested every now and again to stay strong. That's an old-fashioned idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The more new-fashioned and evidence-based idea is that, although your immune system can take on [a COVID] infection, you want to avoid testing it as much as possible because your body is sustaining damage with each infection that it survives. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>CBC.ca</author><pubDate>Thu, 20 Mar 2025 18:04:49 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMia0FVX3lxTFBDdlhRS0J3MnAzeU00QUh5R3FuTTY0eGM4NVV6SEgtdm5VWTVadE85bnNNV2hmZ01HdW9PWW01eWUwTVBiRjVMeDF3SlN6V3YwMlJPdjJkaDFlZktzUTBiS3BmZ29xX2dNZ3Fv0gFHQVVfeXFMTzNCQXJQVFJMblBpQXRlYTAxekZyOG9WV1I3VDVTSThBdVhDVFpQM2t1eWxXT3pPWUplSTBjY1ZsVXgzV3dZaW8</guid></item><item><title>This Study Says This Is the Healthiest Diet in the World - Glamour</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilAFBVV95cUxQRTh6OGdENkw1RWZ3TjUyR3FhZkFPMkItbjJTQjRzdU5CUlMwMmJxVnV5eDFvUEtMdmhnOTJ4aDEzMklXLTNycGprbER5TzVYSDVRRlZSV3JXZkdpWFJsVFFPdk14OG9XaGI4a0gxYTZMbW1SN1JvQmpFclIya3hVbTRmWGFCYkdLUEt6c0g0MTJUaVBM?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="body__inner-container"&gt;&lt;p&gt;What’s the healthiest diet one can eat? A study claims to have finally found the answer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s not such an easy task, considering there are so many hyped diets out there. Chances are you know somebody who’s adopted a keto, paleo, pescatarian, or vegan diet in recent years—if that wasn’t you yourself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002916523005117?via%3Dihub" target="_blank"&gt;2023 study&lt;/a&gt; looked at how healthy six of the most common diets are and compared how they affect not only the body, but also the environment. The researchers used data from a statistical survey by the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). In the study, 16,800 adults were asked about their diet between 2005 and 2010. If participants could not be clearly assigned to one type of diet, they were excluded. The researchers were able to categorize the remaining results into six of the most common diets, from vegan to pescatarian to omnivorous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div name="accordion" class="AccordionWrapper-hIuJtK jKxoyb"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemWrapper-eGPSID czXIDr"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionContainer-fEnXXG iQXARC"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="accordion-item-container" class="AccordionItemContainer-jbkqX ckSoPI"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemContainerLabel-hZxKcV fiEZuU"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most common diets, according to the study&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;button class="BaseButton-bLlsy ButtonWrapper-xCepQ bXyBUt rQqEH button button--utility AccordionItemContainerButton-eCWroF XOSgO" data-event-click='{"element":"Button"}' data-testid="Button" role="button" type="button"&gt;&lt;span class="ButtonLabel-cjAuJN bBWXSg button__label"&gt;AccordionItemContainerButton&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemContainerContent-cezZtS iTPNai opening-animation"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study examined six common diets that emerged from the survey. Those were:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vegan&lt;/strong&gt;: Vegans eat an exclusively plant-based diet and avoid animal products.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vegetarian&lt;/strong&gt;: Vegetarians do not eat meat or fish, but will eat animal products like milk and eggs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pescatarian&lt;/strong&gt;: Pescatarians eat fish, seafood, and other animal products such as eggs and milk, but no meat.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paleo:&lt;/strong&gt; This diet is based on the Stone Age, before humans became sedentary. Meat, eggs, and nuts are on the menu.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keto:&lt;/strong&gt; In the ketogenic diet, over 80 percent of calories come from healthy fats and the diet all but eliminates carbohydrates.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Omnivorous diets:&lt;/strong&gt; This is how the study categorized all other diets, which more or less include all the food groups.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemWrapper-eGPSID czXIDr"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionContainer-fEnXXG iQXARC"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="accordion-item-container" class="AccordionItemContainer-jbkqX ckSoPI"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemContainerLabel-hZxKcV fiEZuU"&gt;&lt;p&gt;How the researchers evaluated the individual diets&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;button class="BaseButton-bLlsy ButtonWrapper-xCepQ bXyBUt rQqEH button button--utility AccordionItemContainerButton-eCWroF XOSgO" data-event-click='{"element":"Button"}' data-testid="Button" role="button" type="button"&gt;&lt;span class="ButtonLabel-cjAuJN bBWXSg button__label"&gt;AccordionItemContainerButton&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemContainerContent-cezZtS iTPNai opening-animation"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;To determine which diet is the healthiest—both for you and the planet—the scientists evaluated the dietary information according to quality and climate footprint. In terms of quality, or how healthy the diet is, points were awarded for certain food groups. The higher the score, the closer the diet is to the recommendations for a healthy diet in general. The average greenhouse gas emissions of each diet were also taken into account.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="and-the-healthiest-diet-is" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;And the healthiest diet is…&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The diet with the highest score in terms of health and environmental impact is the pescatarian diet. This is also consistent with &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/322522#Fishing-for-details" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/322522#Fishing-for-details"}' href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/322522#Fishing-for-details" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;other studies&lt;/a&gt; that have found that people who eat fish regularly live longer on average. This is mainly due to the omega-3 fatty acids fish contains, which can help lower your blood pressure and thus lower the risk for cardiovascular diseases and blood clots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-bkChBi byNLHx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pescatarian diet was closely followed by the vegetarian and vegan diets, with their emphasis on plant-based foods, while the lowest scores went to the paleo and keto diets. These results are generally in line with the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/sites/default/files/2020-12/Dietary_Guidelines_for_Americans_2020-2025.pdf#page=114" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/sites/default/files/2020-12/Dietary_Guidelines_for_Americans_2020-2025.pdf#page=114"}' href="https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/sites/default/files/2020-12/Dietary_Guidelines_for_Americans_2020-2025.pdf#page=114" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Dietary Guidelines for Americans&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; which recommends prioritizing fruits, vegetables, whole grains, dairy, and lean proteins like seafood, poultry, eggs, legumes, nuts, seeds, and soy products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In terms of carbon footprint, the vegan diet scored best followed by the vegetarian diet. The meat-heavy paleo and keto diets fared the worst.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="what-are-the-benefits-of-a-pescatarian-diet" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The benefits of a pescatarian diet&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interested in becoming a pescatarian now? We asked Tamar Samuels, MS, RD, and the cofounder of &lt;a data-offer-url="https://culinahealth.com/" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://culinahealth.com/"}' href="https://culinahealth.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Culina Health&lt;/a&gt;, about some of the diet’s benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A well-planned pescatarian diet offers numerous health benefits, mainly due to the nutritional value of fish and the inclusion of plant-based foods,” the expert says. “Fish is an excellent source of high-quality protein, providing essential amino acids necessary for muscle maintenance, immune function, and overall health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fish is rich in omega-3 fatty acid content.&lt;/strong&gt; “One of the most significant benefits of consuming fish is its rich omega-3 fatty acid content, particularly EPA (eicosatetraenoic acid) and DHA (docosahexaenoic acid),” Samuels says. “These essential fats play a crucial role in heart health by reducing inflammation, lowering triglycerides, and supporting healthy blood pressure levels. Omega-3s are also vital for brain function, contributing to cognitive health, reducing the risk of neurodegenerative diseases, and supporting mental well-being. Additionally, DHA is essential for fetal brain development during pregnancy, making fish consumption particularly beneficial for expecting mothers.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A lower risk for cardiovascular disease and better long-term health.&lt;/strong&gt; “Pescatarians tend to have a more favorable cardiovascular risk profile, including lower BMI, cholesterol, and hypertension levels compared to omnivores,” says Samuels. “This diet is also linked to lower DNA damage than vegetarian diets, which may contribute to better long-term health outcomes.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Better eye health over time.&lt;/strong&gt; “Regular fish consumption in a pescatarian diet is associated with reduced risk of visual impairment, such as age-related macular degeneration,” Samuels adds.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Pescatarian diet risks&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For all its many benefits, Samuels recommends being mindful about making sure you can still get all the nutrients you need before adopting a pescatarian diet as there are risks involved. Talk to a doctor about your dietary requirements if you have any questions or concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Without careful planning, pescatarian diets can lead to deficiencies in nutrients like iron, particularly in women of reproductive age,” the expert explains. “A well-planned pescatarian diet offers numerous health benefits, but several key considerations should be kept in mind to ensure optimal nutrition and minimize potential risks.” Some of those are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nutrient balance.&lt;/strong&gt; “One important factor is nutrient balance—while fish provides high-quality protein and essential omega-3 fatty acids, a pescatarian diet should also include a variety of plant-based foods, such as legumes, whole grains, nuts, and seeds, to ensure adequate fiber, vitamins, and minerals,” Samuels says.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mercury exposure.&lt;/strong&gt; “Another critical factor is mercury exposure, as some fish contain high levels of mercury, which can be harmful, particularly for pregnant women and young children,” says Samuels. “To reduce risk, it is advisable to prioritize low-mercury seafood options such as salmon, sardines, trout, and shrimp while limiting intake of high-mercury fish like tuna, swordfish, and king mackerel.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The sustainability of seafood choices.&lt;/strong&gt; “Beyond individual health concerns, the sustainability of seafood choices is an important consideration,” advises Samuels. “Overfishing and unsustainable fishing practices contribute to environmental damage, so opting for seafood certified by organizations like the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) or following recommendations from guides such as the Monterey Bay Aquarium’s Seafood Watch can help reduce ecological impact.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A version of this post was previously published in &lt;a href="https://www.glamour.de/artikel/studie-diese-ernaehrungsform-ist-die-gesuendeste-der-welt" target="_blank"&gt;Glamour Germany.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Glamour</author><pubDate>Thu, 20 Mar 2025 18:01:54 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilAFBVV95cUxQRTh6OGdENkw1RWZ3TjUyR3FhZkFPMkItbjJTQjRzdU5CUlMwMmJxVnV5eDFvUEtMdmhnOTJ4aDEzMklXLTNycGprbER5TzVYSDVRRlZSV3JXZkdpWFJsVFFPdk14OG9XaGI4a0gxYTZMbW1SN1JvQmpFclIya3hVbTRmWGFCYkdLUEt6c0g0MTJUaVBM</guid></item><item><title>Don’t remember being a baby?

                &lt;li class="ai-article-summary__item"&gt;New research reveals why adults cannot recall infant memories despite having formed them during early development.&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li class="ai-article-summary__item"&gt;Yale University researchers studied brain activity in 26 infants using fMRI scans while showing them images.&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li class="ai-article-summary__item"&gt;The study found hippocampus activity was stronger in babies who were 12 months or older during memory encoding.&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li class="ai-article-summary__item"&gt;Researchers tracked infants' eye movements to determine which images they recognized from previous viewings.&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li class="ai-article-summary__item"&gt;Despite memory inaccessibility later in life, early experiences contribute significantly to language acquisition and learning.&lt;/li&gt;

            Do you ever wonder what it was like to be a baby? But no matter how hard you try, you can’t remember any of the details?
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8g2k6fi0004356mxzgfqjpx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s not that you don’t have memories from infancy — it’s that you simply can’t access them later in life, new research shows.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8g2k6fi0005356mttk9xbbu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The study, published Thursday in the journal &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.adt7570" target="_blank"&gt;Science&lt;/a&gt;, examined 26 infants ranging from 4.2 to 24.9 months, split into two age groups: those younger than 12 months and those 12 to 24 months.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8g2k6fi0006356m6ldx4npa@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            During the experiment, babies were placed in an &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diagnostics/25034-functional-mri-fmri" target="_blank"&gt;fMRI&lt;/a&gt; machine and shown a series of unique images for two seconds each. Researchers aimed to record activity in the &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/hippocampus" target="_blank"&gt;hippocampus&lt;/a&gt; — the portion of the brain associated with emotions, memory and the autonomic nervous system.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8g2k6fi0007356m09ipz7ow@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The hippocampus is a deep brain structure that is not visible to standard methods, so we had to develop a new approach for conducting memory experiments with babies inside an MRI machine,” said Dr. Nick Turk-Browne, lead study author and professor in the department of psychology at Yale University, via email. “This kind of research has previously been done mostly while infants are asleep, because they wiggle a lot, cannot follow instructions and have short attention spans.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8g2k6fi0008356mg3q3qd2q@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Simona Ghetti, a professor in the department of psychology at the University of California, Davis, whose research focuses on the development of memory in childhood, acknowledged that while many studies have already demonstrated infants’ capacity to encode memories, this latest research is unique in that it links memory encoding to hippocampal activation. Ghetti was not involved in the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8g2k6fi0009356mcq2d1tp5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            After a momentary delay, the babies were then shown two images side by side: one of familiar images they had seen before and one that was new. Researchers tracked the babies’ eye movements, noting which image they focused on longer.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8g2k6fi000a356m5exf4vug@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If an infant spent more time looking at the familiar image, it suggested they recognized it, indicating memory recall. If they didn’t show any preference, it likely meant their memory was less developed, according to the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8g2k6fi000b356m3jpod1ja@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Eye movements have been used in hundreds of studies on infant memory and  categorization,” Ghetti said via email. “Infants look at what they find interesting, and researchers have long leveraged this spontaneous behavior to derive information about memory functioning.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  



    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8g2jioi0000356m6c6djnu1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Once they collected the initial data, the team analyzed fMRI scans of babies who looked at the familiar image longer, comparing them with those who had no preference. Trials were excluded if the baby wasn’t focused on the screen and moved or blinked excessively.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8g2kyah000l356mm2f4iqht@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The findings revealed that the hippocampus was more active in older infants when encoding memories. Additionally, only older infants exhibited activity in the &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15134840/" target="_blank"&gt;orbitofrontal cortex&lt;/a&gt;, which plays a key role in memory-related decision-making and recognition.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8g2kyah000m356mwdwbfcr1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “One thing we have learned about memory in adults is that the information we tend to capture and encode into memory are things that are highly relevant to our experience,” said Dr. Lila Davachi, a professor in the department of psychology at Columbia University, who was not involved in the study. “The amazing thing about this study is convincingly showing hippocampal encoding processes in babies for stimuli that are, in some sense, unimportant to them.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8g2kyah000n356mimym7cw1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Though it’s still unclear why memory encoding seems to be stronger in babies more than 12 months old, it’s likely a result of major alterations taking place in the body.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8g2kyah000o356mi234e78e@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The infant brain undergoes many perceptual, linguistic, motor, biological and other changes around this time, including the rapid anatomical growth of the hippocampus,” Turk-Browne said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8g2kyah000p356mkyq1i3wf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Turk-Browne and his team are actively working to test why the brain is unable to retrieve these early memories in life, but he speculates that the brain processing in infants may suggest the hippocampus isn’t receiving the accurate “search terms” to find the memory as it was stored based on the experiences the baby was having at the time.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8g2kwml000j356m9trz9z7t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Ghetti encourages parents to think about the impact infancy has on their children, even if the children can’t retrieve memories they experienced at such an early age.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8g2ll8e000y356mxipkbbdg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Babies are learning an enormous amount at this age, which is how they begin to take in&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;an entire language by associating sounds with meanings, Ghetti said. She added that infants are also forming expectations around their family members and studying properties of objects and the world around them.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8g2ll8e000z356masojst20@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Parents often see this learned behavior when they sing the same song or read the same book, which Davachi&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;noted produces a familiar response in older children.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8g2ll8e0010356mf34dp69l@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Using repetition with babies will open up a greater connection between parent and baby,” she said via email.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8g2ll8e0011356mc4pdm3l0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Even though you can’t recall those earliest memories as an adult, it’s fair to say that you’re learning from those experiences, which can be true for both neutral and emotional information, Ghetti said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8g2ll8e0012356mdwfd7362@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “This can remind parents that infancy is not idle&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;time&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;and that infants are learning a great deal,” Ghetti said. “Offering opportunities for visual exploration may be important for cultivating learning skills.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The Texas Department of State Health Services &lt;a href="https://dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-feb-25-2025" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-feb-25-2025" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-feb-25-2025" aria-label="reported"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; its measles outbreak had grown to 279 cases as of Tuesday, with 36 of the patients having been hospitalized and one person, a child, confirmed dead from the illness.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;div class="key-facts-element"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Texas health department said just two of the cases are in vaccinated people, with the remainder of the 277 sick patients being unvaccinated or having an unknown vaccination status.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;div class="key-facts-element"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There are some 301 cases in the U.S. so far this year, the CDC reported last week, surpassing the 285 measles cases recorded in the entirety of 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;div class="key-facts-element"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In New Mexico, which has the second-highest number of measles cases in the country, Lea County is home to 36 of the state’s &lt;a href="https://www.nmhealth.org/about/erd/ideb/mog/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.nmhealth.org/about/erd/ideb/mog/" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.nmhealth.org/about/erd/ideb/mog/" aria-label="38 confirmed measles cases"&gt;38 confirmed measles cases&lt;/a&gt;, and is about 47 miles from Gaines County, Texas, where the majority of Texas’ measles cases have been detected.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;div class="key-facts-element"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The spread of measles recently increased in Kansas, where the state’s &lt;a href="https://kshealthdata.kdhe.ks.gov/t/KDHE/views/InfectiousDiseaseCaseDashboard/DiseaseCharts?%3Aembed=y&amp;amp;%3AisGuestRedirectFromVizportal=y" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://kshealthdata.kdhe.ks.gov/t/KDHE/views/InfectiousDiseaseCaseDashboard/DiseaseCharts?%3Aembed=y&amp;amp;%3AisGuestRedirectFromVizportal=y" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://kshealthdata.kdhe.ks.gov/t/KDHE/views/InfectiousDiseaseCaseDashboard/DiseaseCharts?%3Aembed=y&amp;amp;%3AisGuestRedirectFromVizportal=y" aria-label="health department"&gt;health department&lt;/a&gt; has reported six cases so far this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align"&gt;Where In Texas Is The Measles Outbreak?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some 191 of the measles cases are located in Gaines County, a rural area about an hour-and-a-half west of Lubbock. The remaining cases are in Terry County (36), Dawson County (11), Yoakum County (11), Dallam County (6), Martin County (3), Lubbock County (5), Ector County (2) and Lynn County (2). Measles cases not associated with the larger outbreak in West Texas include cases in Harris County (3), Lamar County (2), Rockwall County (1) and Travis County (1).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="vestpocket" vest-pocket=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align"&gt;What Age Groups Is The Measles Outbreak Impacting In Texas?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 120 of the cases have been among people aged five to 17, while 88 cases were among children between the ages of zero and four and 52 were reported among adults aged 18 and above. The ages of 19 patients have not been stated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;fbs-ad position="inread" progressive="" ad-id="article-0-inread" aria-hidden="true" role="presentation"&gt;&lt;/fbs-ad&gt;
&lt;h2 class="subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align"&gt;Are There Outbreaks In Other States?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, there is an outbreak in New Mexico, where &lt;a href="https://www.nmhealth.org/about/erd/ideb/mog/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.nmhealth.org/about/erd/ideb/mog/" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.nmhealth.org/about/erd/ideb/mog/" aria-label="38 cases"&gt;38 cases&lt;/a&gt; have been reported, 36 of which are in Lea County, an area on the border with Texas. Outside of Texas and New Mexico, anywhere from one to nine cases have been &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" aria-label="reported by the CDC"&gt;reported by the CDC&lt;/a&gt; in California, Washington, Alaska, Georgia, Kentucky, Florida, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Vermont, New Jersey, New York and Rhode Island. Health officials from Kansas, which is not marked on the CDC’s measles tracker, &lt;a href="https://www.kdhe.ks.gov/CivicAlerts.aspx?AID=1483" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.kdhe.ks.gov/CivicAlerts.aspx?AID=1483" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.kdhe.ks.gov/CivicAlerts.aspx?AID=1483" aria-label="reported"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; Thursday six cases of measles about a week after the illness first showed up in the state, marking its first measles case since 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align"&gt;What Are Measles Symptoms?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Symptoms of measles include a fever, rash, cough, fatigue, runny nose and red eyes. The symptoms do not appear until 10 to 14 days after someone is exposed to the virus and can appear as late as 21 days after exposure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="article_paragraph_7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align"&gt;How Contagious Is Measles?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measles is highly contagious and can spread from one person to nine out of 10 people close to them, according to the CDC, which notes a person infected with measles can spread it to others four days before through four days after the rash appears. Measles can spread through coughing, sneezing and infected surfaces and linger in the air and on surfaces for up to two hours after infected people leave a given area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align"&gt;What Is The Isolation Protocol For Measles?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People infected with measles should isolate for four days after they develop a rash, with the day of rash onset being considered day zero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align"&gt;Is There A Measles Vaccine?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, and it is &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/index.html#:~:text=MMR%20is%20safe%20and%20effective,especially%20if%20planning%20to%20travel." rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/index.html#:~:text=MMR%20is%20safe%20and%20effective,especially%20if%20planning%20to%20travel." data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/index.html#:~:text=MMR%20is%20safe%20and%20effective,especially%20if%20planning%20to%20travel." aria-label="highly effective and safe"&gt;highly effective and safe&lt;/a&gt;, according to the CDC. The measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine, which has been available for over half a century, is about 97% effective at preventing measles with the standard two doses and 93% effective with one dose. The vaccine is typically given to people when they are children, with one dose administered between 12 to 15 months and another administered between four to six years old. The vaccine generally provides long-term or lifelong protection. There is no problem with getting the vaccine if you are an adult unsure of their vaccination status, Dr. William Schaffner, a professor of infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, told &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/21/nx-s1-5304458/measles-vaccine-booster-health" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/21/nx-s1-5304458/measles-vaccine-booster-health" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/21/nx-s1-5304458/measles-vaccine-booster-health" aria-label="NPR"&gt;NPR&lt;/a&gt;. Adults born after 1957 and vaccinated before 1968 should consider getting revaccinated, NPR reported, noting early measles vaccines are not as effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align"&gt;What Has Rfk Jr. Said About The Measles Outbreak And Vaccine?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After claiming the outbreak is “not unusual,” Kennedy changed his stance and considered it “serious,” saying in a March 3 &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2025/03/03/measles-outbreak-call-to-action-for-all-of-us.html" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2025/03/03/measles-outbreak-call-to-action-for-all-of-us.html" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2025/03/03/measles-outbreak-call-to-action-for-all-of-us.html" aria-label="statement"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; “the measles outbreak in Texas is a call to action for all of us to reaffirm our commitment to public health.” Kennedy, a &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/17/health/rfk-jr-covid-vaccines.html" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/17/health/rfk-jr-covid-vaccines.html" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/17/health/rfk-jr-covid-vaccines.html" aria-label="vaccine skeptic"&gt;vaccine skeptic&lt;/a&gt;, said vaccines contribute to community immunity, but did not explicitly tell people to get vaccinated and noted the “the decision to vaccinate is a personal one.” He also supported the use of vitamin A under the supervision of a physician to treat people with mild, moderate, and severe infection, creating concerns among health experts who have cautioned about the vitamin’s effectiveness. Sue Kressly, president of the American Academy of Pediatrics, told &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/03/04/measles-outbreak-vitamin-a-concerns/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/03/04/measles-outbreak-vitamin-a-concerns/" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/03/04/measles-outbreak-vitamin-a-concerns/" aria-label="The Washington Post"&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/a&gt; that solely relying on vitamin A instead of the MMR vaccine is “dangerous and ineffective” and can put children at risk, noting too much vitamin A can “cause serious health problems, including liver damage.” Meanwhile, advocacy non-profit Children’s Health Defense, which was founded and once chaired by RFK Jr., has attacked the effectiveness of the MMR vaccine and &lt;a href="https://x.com/ChildrensHD/status/1897089684725006488" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://x.com/ChildrensHD/status/1897089684725006488" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://x.com/ChildrensHD/status/1897089684725006488" aria-label="quoted skeptics"&gt;quoted skeptics&lt;/a&gt; who claimed measles was “an insignificant inconvenience until we turned it into a literal neurological damage nightmare through the MMR vaccine campaign.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align"&gt;Crucial Quote&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Due to the highly contagious nature of this disease, additional cases are likely to occur in the outbreak area and the surrounding communities,” according to The Texas Department of State Health Services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align"&gt;Key Background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Texas measles outbreak began in late January with just two cases and has become the state’s largest outbreak of the virus in 30 years. The Texas Department of State Health Services said in a &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/sites/default/files/LIDS-Immunizations/pdf/2023-2024_Annual_Report_of_Immunization_Status_of_Students.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/sites/default/files/LIDS-Immunizations/pdf/2023-2024_Annual_Report_of_Immunization_Status_of_Students.pdf" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.dshs.texas.gov/sites/default/files/LIDS-Immunizations/pdf/2023-2024_Annual_Report_of_Immunization_Status_of_Students.pdf" aria-label="report"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; of student immunization status for the 2023-2024 school year that 5.64% of Texas kindergarten students were not vaccinated for measles, while 2.34% of seventh graders had not received the vaccine. Measles was fully eliminated from the U.S. in 2000, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" aria-label="CDC"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;, meaning the virus was not spreading within the country and new cases only came from people who contracted measles abroad and returned to the U.S. In 2024, a total of 285 measles cases were reported across 33 states.&lt;/p&gt;

A separate &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7669595/"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; from 2021 showed that women also face higher rates of anxiety, PTSD and anorexia. As someone with both an autoimmune disease and anxiety, I found this information fascinating. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, as if the TikTok algorithm had read my thoughts, I was served a video titled “unprocessed anger is making you sick.” It got me wondering, could a major factor behind these statistics be not just &lt;a href="/news/ap-stanford-university-washington-rna-dna-b2488953.html"&gt;biological&lt;/a&gt; but behavioural? Specifically, could suppressed anger be contributing to women’s declining health?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="article-im-prompt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like many women, I’ve struggled with expressing anger. Therapy has helped me recognise how deeply ingrained this issue is – women are conditioned to self-silence, to be caretakers while keeping quiet and polite. Anger, in particular, is seen as a masculine emotion, but it’s something we all experience and should be able to express in healthy, regulated ways. When we don’t express it, does it then manifest in our bodies as illness?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the late 1980s, psychologist &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://cedar.wwu.edu/fairhaven_facpubs/14/"&gt;Dana Jack&lt;/a&gt; identified a pattern among her female patients: a tendency for “self-silencing”, suppressing needs, pleasing others and avoiding conflict. She linked this behaviour to a heightened risk of depression. More recently, a study from the &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11479187/"&gt;University of Pittsburgh&lt;/a&gt; found that suppressed anger in women of colour correlated with a 70 per cent increased risk of atherosclerosis, raising their risk of heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea that bottled-up anger can affect physical health resonates with many women. Sarah, 37, from London, was diagnosed with pernicious anaemia at 21 after struggling with anorexia. Later, at 34, she was diagnosed with fibromyalgia following multiple emotional and physical traumas. “A recurring theme was the overwhelming sense that I wasn’t being heard,” she says. “The more I fought for support, the less I received, leading me to retreat into silence.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The anger I felt – toward friends, family, perpetrators and society – had nowhere to go. It settled in my body, manifesting as pain in my gut, chest, shoulders and throat. I realised this pain was somatic, a physical manifestation of unprocessed emotions. To release it, I turned to ecstatic dance, massage, diaphragmatic breathing, body scanning and grounding techniques. Sometimes, after an intense session, I cry and physically feel the trapped emotion leaving my body.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, Sarah actively practices these tools to prevent both old and new pain from accumulating. “If I don’t, my body shuts down; widespread pain, skin sensitivity (allodynia), headaches, jaw tension, extreme fatigue, &lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/memoractiv-brain-fog-supplements-b2638539.html" title="I tried the brain fog supplements recommended by Karlie Kloss – here’s what happened"&gt;memory fog&lt;/a&gt; and emotional instability. While my fibromyalgia specialist prescribes painkillers, physiotherapy and homeopathic medicine, we both agree that physical somatic action is the best way to manage my condition.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/hypnotherapy-anxiety-b2689797.html" title="I tried hypnotherapy to cure my anxiety and noticed results after just one session"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I tried hypnotherapy to cure my anxiety and noticed results after just one session&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 epFywa"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Stress and the immune system&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dilly, 29, also from London, has Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, an autoimmune disorder where the immune system attacks the thyroid gland, slowing down metabolism. “I experience muscle pain, &lt;a href="/life-style/health-and-families/thinning-hair-loss-balding-how-to-volume-style-b2709263.html" title="Here’s why your hair is thinning – and what you can do about it"&gt;hair loss&lt;/a&gt;, cold intolerance and dry skin. My &lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/what-is-kombucha-b2718177.html" title="I’ve been drinking kombucha for years and it’s transformed my gut health – here’s how"&gt;gut slows down&lt;/a&gt;, leading to weight gain, but worst of all, it affects my mood and energy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her symptoms worsened after a particularly stressful year involving personal and work-related issues. “That’s when I finally sought medical advice and was diagnosed. My GP suspected my thyroid had been under active for years without me realising it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dilly, who is currently training to be a doctor, has found little time to process her diagnosis or emotions. “My GP was nonchalant when they told me, which made me question my own anxiety around taking lifelong medication. I suppressed my feelings, and I believe it negatively impacted my health. Recently, I had to increase my dosage despite stable levels for three months.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some experts believe there is a connection between suppressed emotions and physical illness. &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.drbrighten.com/"&gt;Dr Jolene Brighten&lt;/a&gt;, a board-certified naturopathic endocrinologist, explains, “Suppressing emotions, particularly anger, has been linked to increased stress, dysregulated immune function and chronic inflammation, which may contribute to the development or worsening of autoimmune diseases.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She points to research showing that emotional repression can trigger prolonged activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, leading to immune system dysfunction. This can worsen conditions like rheumatoid arthritis, lupus and multiple sclerosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 lafNeh sc-482ou5-3 fdIcNP image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 lkeWpK"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="2" class="sc-482ou5-0 ceuKtN"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/03/20/16/52/iStock-918812934.jpg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/03/20/16/52/iStock-918812934.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/03/20/16/52/iStock-918812934.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Some experts believe that high stress levels can affect the immune system, leading to chronic health issues" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 bNNNXy inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-482ou5-1 cFynzd dcZiNS" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base-light"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-ohzviw-0 klhTsW inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-42543"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-ohzviw-1 bDzDal"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 fWLHSZ hfwDDP"&gt;Some experts believe that high stress levels can affect the immune system, leading to chronic health issues&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 eUTWtv"&gt; (Getty Images/iStockphoto)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/the_health_psychologist_/?hl=en"&gt;Dr Sula Windgassen&lt;/a&gt;, a Health Psychologist, CBT Therapist and EMDR Therapist, notes that health is inherently biopsychosocial – shaped by biological, psychological, social and environmental factors. “When addressing health or illness, we must consider all three aspects together rather than in isolation.” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While some studies suggest emotional suppression may be linked to immune system dysfunction, Windgassen cautions that research is still evolving. “There haven’t been enough studies specifically on suppressed anger and its effects on &lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/immunity-vitamins-flu-season-b2661357.html" title="These are the supplements you should take for flu season"&gt;immunity&lt;/a&gt;. However, psychoneuroimmunology research provides compelling evidence that emotional suppression can impact immune functioning.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="/health-and-wellbeing/sleep-insomnia-women-health-b2678733.html" title="Mind the sleep gap: Why no one ever notices when women are exhausted"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mind the sleep gap: Why no one ever notices when women are exhausted&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 epFywa"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The body’s response to suppression&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All emotions are biologically mediated through brain activity, autonomic nervous system changes, and hormonal secretion. However, no single physiological signature corresponds to a specific emotion like anger or sadness. Windgassen explains, “It’s not that emotions themselves are harmful, it’s how we respond to them that can put strain on the body.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suppression, she says, is one of the most depleting responses. It activates higher-order brain regions, like the prefrontal cortex, while decreasing activation in emotion-processing centres like the amygdala. This leads to increased cortisol secretion, which can disrupt immune function. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Cortisol can both inhibit immune responses, making the system slow to react, or over activate it, leading to inflammation, a sign of immune dysfunction.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While research continues, the growing body of evidence suggests that suppressing emotions, including anger, may have significant physiological consequences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 epFywa"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Finding healthy outlets&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, what can women do to prevent emotional suppression from affecting their health? Dr Brighten suggests developing emotional awareness and expression through journaling, therapy, or somatic practices. “Engaging in regular physical activity, mindfulness and &lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/breathing-exercises-stress-anxiety-b2676660.html" title="An expert says you should be doing these four breathing exercises every day"&gt;breathwork&lt;/a&gt; can help regulate the nervous system and reduce the physiological impact of suppressed anger.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She also emphasises the importance of setting boundaries, cultivating assertive communication, and fostering supportive relationships. “Expressing anger in constructive ways can help reduce the stress-related risks of immune dysfunction and inflammation.” she explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-ii" class="sc-looa6c-0 kWYnHL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sarah and Dilly’s experiences reflect what research and experts suggest – that unprocessed emotions can manifest physically, contributing to chronic health conditions. Whether through therapy, movement or mindfulness, properly acknowledging and processing your emotions – especially anger – may be a crucial step in maintaining both mental and physical health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/how-to-avoid-burnout-b2668054.html" title="How to spot the symptoms of burnout and treat them, according to wellbeing experts"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to spot the symptoms of burnout and treat them, according to wellbeing experts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Thu, 20 Mar 2025 17:48:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikAFBVV95cUxNaFdkT09zVXE1WVctVW1uRzhUZ2NfNWhGTTFOQ01DRmVvWER4ZDhaalIzd3lqa3puNUFnbXZHQV9ULXRTYVVyT2VDVXcybldMODJRMmFFOUZNOG9hMTl2aXhBYk5EcFdmTlVKQnVCRzZ4Y0VEUmV4TEdNT3h5LWM4Mzd4T3VHSjh3d0NDUUtaNG0</guid></item><item><title>6 Kansans under age 18 test positive for measles: KDHE - KAKE</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiyAFBVV95cUxNRERaQU4xZE53NWlibXQ5dWFMZ0tyMGtMZ0FpX3pSOGZtazZaeXlsUHNWTVgxcmlPT2NoWnBtRjBnYXFPR01nRl9TOUNVNVFFTnVEWVJQQ1kzY0ljMGx3TDM2aGhESzBxYUphaWdDdk42SUxUSzNqX2JyUnpYend5ZzYxdGJFY21XYmV4TEFOUVNuMl9GNWFpdXQwYzc0bnhINEEtNlVpRS03LTIwTEw3SV8teG03bFE1Y2E4ajNlaWhYLUI0akFYaQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="form-group-flex"&gt;

This evolution, they caution, suggests that older vaccine formulas may lose effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This study shows a trend of weakening binding affinity of existing antibodies against H5 isolates over time, indicating that the H5N1 virus is evolving immune escape from our therapeutic and immunological defenses,” noted the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-rapid-shifts-in-bird-flu-virus"&gt;Rapid shifts in bird flu virus&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;By running large-scale computational models of specific viral proteins binding with neutralizing antibodies, the research team discovered “an overall worsening in &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/experts-have-found-powerful-antibodies-that-neutralize-all-covid-variants/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;antibody&lt;/a&gt; affinity to more recent H5N1 isolates.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If one makes an H5N1 vaccine with a previous vaccine candidate virus, the vaccine will have less efficacy, based on our measurements of how much the virus has evolved in recent years,” explained lead author Colby T. Ford, a visiting scholar at UNC Charlotte’s &lt;a href="https://cipher.charlotte.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Center for Computational Intelligence to Predict Health and Environmental Risks&lt;/a&gt; (CIPHER).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conducted under the guidance of assistant professor Richard Allen White III, and CIPHER co-director Daniel Janies, the UNC Charlotte team joined forces with &lt;a href="https://web.mit.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Massachusetts Institute of Technology&lt;/a&gt; (MIT) researchers Rafael Jaimes III and Phillip J. Tomezsko to explore how the H5N1 virus is adapting so quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-mounting-zoonotic-risk"&gt;Mounting zoonotic risk&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analyzing 1,804 antigen-antibody interactions, the researchers examined how the virus’s hemagglutinin subunit changed from 1996 to 2018. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By applying high-performance computational techniques, they tracked the virus’s “antigenic drift” – small cumulative mutations that hamper the effectiveness of immune defenses from earlier infections or vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new measurements of how much the bird flu virus has evolved in recent years confirmed that H5N1 is becoming less recognizable to established antibodies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These results indicate that the virus has potential to move from epidemic to pandemic status,” wrote the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-emergence-across-multiple-species"&gt;Emergence across multiple species&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though H5N1 has primarily circulated in birds, it has jumped to &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/avian-influenza-h5n1-marine-mammals-spreading-worldwide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;mammals&lt;/a&gt; and, rarely, to humans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the past year, the virus was found in dairy cattle in at least 17 U.S. states, and the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt; (CDC) reported 70 human cases, including one fatality, in the United States since January 2022. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Worldwide, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt;, H5N1 has been linked to 466 human deaths since 2003.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Between January 2022 and March 2025, the CDC also documented 12,510 H5N1 outbreaks among wild birds within the U.S., virus detections in 51 jurisdictions and 166,417,923 affected poultry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such widespread, cross-species infections strongly indicate that avian influenza can be considered a pandemic among animal populations, raising fears of a future human pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-birds-flu-vaccination-and-public-health"&gt;Birds flu vaccination and public health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In discussing how to avert the looming threat, the authors argue that a new approach to &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/universal-influenza-vaccine-could-offer-lifetime-immunity/"&gt;vaccine&lt;/a&gt; development may be needed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings indicate that once the bird flu virus modifies itself significantly, older vaccines will have less efficacy, making it essential to develop and regularly update H5N1 vaccines reflecting the virus’s continuous genetic changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the study’s results highlight the power of high-performance computing in mapping viral evolution. By integrating AI-based protein folding with physics-based simulations, researchers can anticipate changes in viral structure and better inform policy decisions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-bird-flu-s-potential-for-pandemic-status"&gt;Bird flu’s potential for pandemic status&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;With H5N1 already widespread among wild birds and expanding its foothold in mammalian hosts, the virus’s cross-species jumps present a significant concern. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the experts, more robust monitoring, updated vaccination strategies, and ongoing computational analyses will be crucial in mitigating a potential outbreak. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Janies concluded, computational modeling can help experts “tune our intuition to the right approaches” for vaccine design and intervention strategies before a fast-adapting virus gains an uncontrollable edge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the journal &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ebiom.2025.105632" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;eBioMedicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/eric-ralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 20 Mar 2025 17:40:15 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikAFBVV95cUxNSTZadGNfdzk0QXhJOWFZWDdYdHNzZXEzVVAwRWZMOG5YY1dtemFWYVdGRWJDVFNZWkd1T1A0VVc4c1J6RUs4UXhWQkhJQXhZNUpRRHA3ZEFOMmhGOVc0VEwyQXVJS0xpVUN4dEV4RFVpc0dSY1lTM01Zc0wyWkF2b2lSNXlpdEtvX1pVMEREUVk</guid></item><item><title>Byron Mom In Murder-Suicide Had Depression, Anxiety Meds In System - Cowboy State Daily</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqgFBVV95cUxNbnY0NTF6RVVqMURJUWllMUhzVno3a2pNWHZMTEM5OXRwUXdNUVgtX0REWWZ1Y1gxWG5BWFc4dGFKTjh6OUhLck9uejZrU1VyUDZkMXgzRGRwQWJMWlhsME0xejZ4MS11SmtvcHZfY1ZBbzctT1JadHZwcW9vTlE2bzRzWTFTTnZILTNDUVd1dUE1N3ItSnBaSXJ4THpVVWp6Rm40RjhJNkozZw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="_1sy4yg80 _1t01cac0"&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Byron, Wyoming, woman who shot her four children then herself last month had both ketamine, a drug for post-traumatic stress disorder and depression, and clonazepam — an anti-anxiety drug — in her system, the coroner’s office says.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Big Horn County Coroner’s Office released relevant toxicology results and other details on Thursday about 32-year-old Tranyelle Harshman’s death to Cowboy State Daily after the outlet requested them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Harshman suffered what &lt;a href="https://cowboystatedaily.com/2025/02/12/husband-of-woman-in-byron-murder-suicide-says-she-was-depressed-struggling/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;has been described as a mental health break&lt;/a&gt; Feb. 10 at her home in Byron, Wyoming.

NIH-funded study uses cutting-edge imaging techniques to reconstruct features underlying learning and memory in the mouse brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a study supported by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), researchers revealed the structural underpinnings of memory formation across a broad network of neurons in the mouse brain. This work sheds light on the fundamentally flexible nature of how memories are made, detailing learning-related changes at the cellular and subcellular levels with unprecedented resolution. Understanding this flexibility may help explain why memory and learning processes sometimes go awry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The findings, published in &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;, showed that neurons assigned to a memory trace reorganized their connections to other neurons through an atypical type of connection called a multi-synaptic bouton. In a multi-synaptic bouton, the axon of the neuron relaying the signal with information contacts multiple neurons that receive the signal.  According to the researchers, multi-synaptic boutons may enable the cellular flexibility of information coding observed in previous research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The researchers also found that neurons involved in memory formation were not preferentially connected with each other. This finding challenges the idea that “neurons that fire together wire together,” as would be predicted by a traditional theory of learning.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, the researchers observed that neurons allocated to a memory trace reorganized certain intracellular structures that provide energy and support communication and plasticity in neuronal connections. These neurons also had enhanced interactions with support cells known as astrocytes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using a combination of advanced genetic tools, 3D electron microscopy, and artificial intelligence, Scripps Research scientists Marco Uytiepo, Anton Maximov, Ph.D., and colleagues reconstructed a wiring diagram of neurons involved in learning and identified structural changes to these neurons and their connections at the cellular and subcellular levels.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To examine structural features associated with learning, the researchers exposed mice to a conditioning task and examined the hippocampus region of the brain about 1 week later. They selected this time point because it occurs after memories are first encoded but before they are reorganized for long-term storage. Using advanced genetic techniques, the researchers permanently labeled subsets of hippocampal neurons activated during learning, which enabled reliable identification. They then used 3D electron microscopy and artificial intelligence algorithms to produce nanoscale reconstructions of the excitatory neural networks involved in learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This study provides a comprehensive view of the structural hallmarks of memory formation in one brain region. It also raises new questions for further exploration. Future studies will be crucial in determining whether similar mechanisms operate across different time points and neural circuits. In addition, further investigation into the molecular composition of multi-synaptic boutons is needed to determine their precise role in memory and other cognitive processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research was supported by funding from the National Institute of Mental Health, the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, and NIH’s &lt;em&gt;Brain Research Through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies&lt;/em&gt;® Initiative, or The BRAIN Initiative®.&lt;/p&gt;

It said anyone identified as a “close contact” will be screened for the disease. Tuberculosis, a bacterial illness, can be fatal if not properly treated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was no immediate comment from the county health services office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The positive case comes as the number of reported tuberculosis cases in New Jersey and across the United States has been on the rise since 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2023, the year for which most recent data is available, most states reported an increase in tuberculosis cases, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/tb-surveillance-report-2023/summary/reporting-area.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;. The number of tuberculosis cases in New Jersey jumped from 289 in 2022 to 343 in 2023, an 18.7% increase, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/tb-surveillance-report-2023/tables/table-2.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New Jersey also has a higher rate of tuberculosis cases than the national average, at 3.7 cases per 100,000 people in 2023. For the same period, New York City had an incidence rate of 8.3 cases per 100,000 persons, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/tb-surveillance-report-2023/summary/reporting-area.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt; data. The remainder of New York state had an incidence rate of 1.9 cases per 100,000 persons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tuberculosis mainly affects the lungs but can also damage the kidneys, liver, heart, bones, joints, and blood vessels.

Hailing from the Mennonite community, they argued that if measles patients had access to untested treatments, the MMR vaccines would be entirely unnecessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We spent the morning at Dr. Ben Edwards' clinic, and the parents are all still sitting there saying they would rather have this than the MMR vaccination because they've seen so much injury, which we have as well," journalist Polly Tommey said while interviewing the couple. "Do you still feel the same way about the MMR vaccine versus measles and the proper treatment with Dr. Ben Edwards?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Absolutely [do] not take the MMR [vaccine]," said the mother. "The measles wasn't that bad. [The other children] got over it pretty quickly. And Dr. Edwards was there for us."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The parents described the symptoms of the illness their child exhibited, beginning with a fever, respiratory symptoms and the notorious rash that often accompanies it. However, days after contracting the illness, the child's fever continued and respiratory symptoms worsened as she began struggling to breathe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The girl's parents took her to a hospital emergency room where she was admitted and diagnosed with pneumonia. After being placed on a ventilator in the Intensive Care Unit, the child passed away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The measles outbreak in Texas has spurred many public and &lt;a href="https://www.latintimes.com/top-hhs-spokesperson-quit-due-rfk-jrs-muted-response-measles-outbreak-days-before-kennedys-577361" rel="nofollow"&gt;political figures&lt;/a&gt; to take to their platforms and encourage residents to get vaccinated and vaccinate their children.

Kennedy Jr, the man in charge of the USA's health policy, has come up with a new plan for tackling the potential threat of bird flu: let it spread like wildfire through farms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="piano-gate" id="piano-gate"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, avian influenza is devastating chickens in the US, with &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/over-20-million-us-chickens-killed-by-bird-flu-contributing-to-egg-price-rises-77639" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;over 20 million&lt;/a&gt; birds dying of the disease, according to the US Department of Agriculture (USDA). At the moment, though the infection has caused many distressing deaths in poultry and &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/new-h5n1-bird-flu-virus-genotype-found-in-us-cows-in-second-spillover-event-77933" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;livestock&lt;/a&gt;, humans are relatively safe from the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Since April 2024, 70 human cases of avian influenza A(H5) virus infection have been reported in the United States. Of these, 41 cases were associated with exposure to sick dairy cows and 26 were associated with exposure to avian influenza A(H5N1) virus-infected poultry," the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/spotlights/h5n1-response-03192025.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The source of the exposure in three cases, &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/h5n1-bird-flu-spreading-silently-in-us-as-cdc-data-reveals-unknown-infections-in-vets-78052" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;could not be determined&lt;/a&gt;. To date, human-to-human transmission of influenza A(H5) virus has not been identified in the United States. The immediate risk to the general public from H5 bird flu remains low."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, that &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/how-concerned-do-we-need-to-be-about-bird-flu-in-the-us-77916" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;might not always&lt;/a&gt; be the case. As the world no doubt remembers from COVID-19, all it takes is a few mutations for a disease to spread amongst humans. Proper management of the disease in birds – including culling infected animals, enhancing biosecurity, and reporting of cases – is needed to keep the disease from making that &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/how-spillover-events-propel-animal-diseases-into-human-populations-67727" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;sustained leap to humans&lt;/a&gt;, where human-to-human transmission could develop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="trendmd-suggestions" data-pid-resource="RRUGNY3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a recent interview with Fox News, Robert F. Kennedy Jr, US Secretary of Health and Human Services, outlined a different idea, saying farmers “should consider maybe the possibility of letting it run through the flock so that we can identify the birds, and preserve the birds, that are immune to it," per &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/18/health/kennedy-bird-flu.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;The New York Times&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="piano-inline"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though decisions on farm policy fall to the USDA rather than the health department, agriculture secretary Brooke Rollins has floated the same idea, reportedly telling Fox News “there are some farmers that are out there that are willing to really try this on a pilot as we build the safe perimeter around them to see if there is a way forward with immunity."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem with this idea? Just about everything, according to experts. The primary risk to humans is that letting it loose through farms would give the virus more chance to &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/first-severe-human-infection-of-bird-flu-virus-in-the-us-shows-signs-of-mutation-77410" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;mutate&lt;/a&gt; into one that can be transmitted from human to human.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="isPasted"&gt;"Every new infection in an animal and person is like throwing a pair of thousand-sided dice," Dr James Lawler of the University of Nebraska Medical Center's Global Center for Health Security in Omaha told &lt;a href="https://www.medpagetoday.com/infectiousdisease/birdflu/114731" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;MedPageToday&lt;/a&gt;. "It may take a while, but eventually it will come up snake-eyes."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Kennedy claimed that some chickens may have natural immunity to the disease, which could be identified as the virus devastates a flock, experts are not impressed&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="isPasted"&gt;"The way we raise birds now, there's not a lot of genetic variability," Dr Gail Hansen, a former state veterinarian for Kansas, added to The New York Times. "They're all the same bird, basically."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="isPasted"&gt;"You’re setting yourself up for bad things to happen,” Hansen added. “It’s a recipe for disaster.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As well as being terrible for humans, the disease causes a lot of pain and discomfort for the birds, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/virus-transmission/avian-in-birds.html#:~:text=Low%20Pathogenic%20Avian%20Influenza%20(LPAI,virus%20as%20those%20birds%20migrate." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;nearly all&lt;/a&gt; of which will end up dying of the disease. &lt;a href="https://www.rspb.org.uk/birds-and-wildlife/avian-influenza-updates" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Symptoms include&lt;/a&gt; respiratory distress, coordination loss and tremors, swollen heads, and hemorrhages.

They discussed the medications that could increase the risk of Alzheimer's disease&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia, a group of neurological disorders that impact memory, language, problem-solving, and other cognitive abilities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the Alzheimer's Association, an estimated 6.7 million Americans are living with Alzheimer's disease in 2023. Dr Helman's warning comes as that number is &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-6195005/Alzheimers-burden-DOUBLE-2060-CDC-report-warns.html"&gt;expected to double by 2060&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Speaking in a &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@robertwblove/video/7481346201606999339"&gt;TikTok video&lt;/a&gt; with neuroscientist Robert Love, Dr Helman pointed to antihistamines as one type of drug that could increase the risk fo Alzheimer's disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Available over-the-counter or with a prescription, the most popular examples include Benadryl, Zyrtec, Claritin, and Clarinex. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Antihistamines block the effects of histamine, a chemical released by the body during an allergic reaction. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, antihistamines like Benadryl have also been shown to block the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, which Dr Helman notes is 'very important for nerve transmission.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Acetylcholine carries messages from the brain to the body through nerve cells, controlling functions like memory. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Drugs like Benadryl are considered anticholinergics.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Patients with Alzheimer's disease have been shown to have low acetylcholine in their brains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaneurology/fullarticle/2514553"&gt;2016 study&lt;/a&gt; of more than 450 adults found that patients taking anticholinergics had greater levels of brain atrophy or wasting than those not on them, a sign of dementia.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Helman said: 'I'm not saying never take Benadryl, but what I am saying is you don't want to be taking these types of medications every night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'If you're taking something like Benadryl every night, you're actually slowly leading to brain damage.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Common allergy medications like Benadryl may block important brain pathways for memory, Dr Helman said (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Helman also pointed to benzodiazepines, nicknamed 'benzos' or 'downers.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These include prescription drugs Valium, Xanax, Ativan, and Klonopin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Benzodiazepines act as sedatives, slowing down activity in the brain and nervous system by activating the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12916-024-03437-5"&gt;study published last year&lt;/a&gt; of more than 5,000 older adults suggested the use of benzodiazepines was associated with shrinking of the brain's memory centers, the hippocampus and the amygdala.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While these areas of the brain naturally shrink with age, the process appeared to occur faster in patients on benzodiazepines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This can cause symptoms of dementia like memory loss.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study authors wrote: 'It is important to carefully consider the necessity of prolonged benzodiazepine use in light of potential detrimental effects on brain health.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group floatRHS"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Helman cautioned against quitting these medications altogether and instead suggested speaking with your doctor to avoid withdrawal&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/two-types-of-drugs-you-may-want-to-avoid-for-the-sake-of-your-brain#:~:text=In%20the%20study%2C%20the%20greater%20people's%20cumulative%20dose%20of%20benzodiazepines%2C%20the%20higher%20their%20risk.&amp;amp;text=But%20those%20who%20had%20taken%20a%20benzodiazepine,risk%20than%20those%20who%20hadn't%20taken%20one."&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; from researchers in France and Canada found that people who had taken a benzodiazepine for three to six months had a 32 percent increased risk of developing Alzheimer's compared to those who had never taken one. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Those on one of these drugs for more than six months were at an 84 percent increased risk.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Chronic benzodiazepine use has also been shown to reduce the brain's neuroplasticity, or its ability to change or adapt over time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This could lead to the brain's neurons degrading over time, leading to Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Helman also warned against the prolonged use of statins, a drug taken by 92million Americans to lower cholesterol. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Statins work by inhibiting an enzyme called HMG-CoA reductase which produces cholesterol. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While the science on statins and Alzheimer's disease has been mixed, several recent reports show the drugs could lead to cognitive issues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://jnm.snmjournals.org/content/62/supplement_1/102"&gt;2021 study&lt;/a&gt; found patients with mild cognitive impairment - a precursor to Alzheimer's disease - were more than twice as likely to develop dementia from taking statins like lipohilic statins like Lipitor than those not on these medications. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers said this could be because scans showed these patients had declines in the posterior cingulate cortex, the region of the brain most affected by early stages of Alzheimer's disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, other studies have suggested statins may protect against Alzheimer's disease, so research is still mixed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Thu, 20 Mar 2025 16:02:40 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>KDHE: 6 Kansas residents - all under age 18 - confirmed positive for measles - KSHB 41 Kansas City News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirAFBVV95cUxNd3c3NmNhZDYxTm5kRTlFeFdmSEtSdW9LNlRqSmp6SkRjWjNwWXNTY0hRYzN0Wmh3MnFiSnB2OC15QWZmRm03WVVLbmZTbThsUmJ5YWlMUzVIZ3JKcThFTnIzalJEOTg4TFFfQVNQZlpla2VKRzd0Q1Q4dTlFWV93MXJ3eUczeld2ZzF2X01NV2pNdjZUQ3prNEV4ZmhyemxwdDJ1YW5hWDBrRlhX?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="RichTextArticleBody-body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;KANSAS CITY, Mo. — Six Kansas residents - all under the age of 18 - have tested positive for measles in the last four weeks, state heath data showed Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="Link" href="https://kshealthdata.kdhe.ks.gov/t/KDHE/views/InfectiousDiseaseCaseDashboard/DiseaseCharts?%3Aembed=y&amp;amp;%3AisGuestRedirectFromVizportal=y" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;Data from the Kansas Department of Health and Environment&lt;/a&gt;

Friedman, a psychiatrist at UC San Diego School of Medicine and lead author of the new study, said: ‘Although xylazine has been most prevalent on the East Coast of the United States, this new evidence confirms its presence in Tijuana, on the U.S.-Mexico border, posing numerous health risks for people in this region.’ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Xylazine, a veterinary sedative, is the latest substance to appear in the illicit drug supply. Officially used to tranquilize animals, it’s increasingly being mixed with fentanyl and consumed by injection or snorting &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Tijuana is a major port of entry and the final checkpoint on the path that traffickers take to pass their products &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/news/article-9326877/How-NINE-Mexican-cartels-responsible-flooding-streets-United-States-drugs.html"&gt;through Mexico and into the US&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The city sits atop a labyrinth of tunnels complete with lighting and ventilation systems drug traffickers wind through to pass their products to American hands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The CDC reported last spring that deaths involving both fentanyl and xylazine across 20 states and DC increased from 3 percent in January 2019 to 11 percent in June 2022. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Xylazine-related overdose deaths in the US rose from 102 in 2018 to 3,468 in 2021. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;By 2022, xylazine was detected in &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/72/wr/mm7226a4.htm#F1_down"&gt;nearly 11 percent&lt;/a&gt; of fentanyl-related deaths across 20 states, the equivalent of around 5,000 deaths. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers, funded, in part, by the National Institute on Drug Abuse and the National Institute of Mental Health, looked at anonymous records from a free clinic in the town.&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They tested urine samples and drug paraphernalia collected from 23 patients who had admitted to using illegal opioids in the previous 24 hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;All of the patients had used fentanyl, and most had used methamphetamine or heroin. Xylazine was detected in 19 urine samples and on 15 needles, pipes, and baggies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Xylazine is often mixed in with fentanyl to augment the high that users experience. Drug seizures by border officials have risen steadily over the past six or seven years&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In addition to xylazine and fentanyl, test strips also detected black tar heroin, meth, lidocaine, and tramadol, a prescription opioid, in urine and paraphernalia samples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Fifteen of the 23 subjects – 22 of whom were men – were unhoused when they went to the clinic, and seven of them had severe skin lesions at the time of their visit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Xylazine constricts blood vessels that carry oxygenated blood throughout the body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When bodily tissues don’t get the oxygen they need, they die, leading to open sores and ulcers on the skin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If those gaping sores go untreated, they can result in a devastating infection that can require amputation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;America’s streets, already contending with a flood of deadly fentanyl in the illicit drug supply, are increasingly seeing it cut with the veterinary tranquilizer drug xylazine, which leaves users in a zombie-like state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The drug is not an opioid but is often mixed with opioids — such as fentanyl — to augment the high and reduce the number of times an addict needs to get a shot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers also determined that test strips returned false positives in samples that were found to contain the sedative lidocaine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Xylazine constricts blood vessels, reducing oxygen flow to tissues. This oxygen deprivation causes tissue death, leading to open sores and ulcers on the skin&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It was only after conducting more rigorous, highly precise testing that they detected xylazine, suggesting that drug users with test strips may still be unknowingly taking tranq. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Still, researchers argue test strips are worthwhile, as not all samples contained lidocaine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Friedman said: ‘This study underscores the importance of expanding drug-checking efforts in border regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Our findings also support the use of xylazine test strips as a harm reduction tool, providing people who use drugs and healthcare providers with critical information about exposure risks.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The latest findings were published in the Journal of Addiction Medicine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Xylazine is increasingly appearing in drug seizures by customs and the Drug Enforcement Administration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The DEA said in September 2023 that the drug had &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.dea.gov/stories/2023/2023-09/2023-09-22/dea-and-dhs-issue-joint-update-sources-illicit-xylazine?fbclid=IwY2xjawJJBJhleHRuA2FlbQIxMAABHd54bzWb7MdxEFFIhr2YSNfrnhKdNgbr8peI6AJQG7wwsNvm7y9l1Nupog_aem_2Vxkdet1Wyuo6b8nkfHbPQ"&gt;entered the US in several ways&lt;/a&gt; – ‘in solid form from China and other countries, in liquid form either diverted from veterinary supply chains or packaged to resemble a veterinary drug, and, to a lesser degree, mixed with fentanyl seized at the southwest border.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The drug comes from Europe, as well. Last fall, Customs and Border Protection officers in Philadelphia intercepted a package containing a kilo of xylazine that had shipped from Spain and was labeled ‘mica powder for makeup.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;By 2022, xylazine was detected in nearly 11 percent of fentanyl-related deaths across 20 states, the equivalent of around 5,000 deaths&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Adam Streetman, CBP's Area Port of Philadelphia Director, said at the time: ‘Customs and Border Protection officers know the challenges our country faces in protecting our citizens from the deadly threats posed by dangerous drugs trafficked by transnational criminal organizations, including dangerous synthetics like xylazine, and from fentanyl and fentanyl precursors.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The most powerful and well-organized trafficking organization in Mexico is the Sinaloa Cartel, spearheaded by El Chapo Guzman since the 1980s until his most recent imprisonment in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The cartel drives the bulk of fentanyl trafficking into the US. Less is known about its role in producing and distributing xylazine, though the Sinaloa Cartel is known to mix its supplies with other substances to keep customers wanting more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

                          &lt;ul class="summary-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Katie Couric has advocated for colon cancer awareness since losing her husband to the disease in 1998.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;He was diagnosed at 41 years old, with symptoms like fatigue and digestive changes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Detecting colon cancer early is key to treatment, and innovations in AI and blood testing could help.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Katie Couric's husband, Jay Monahan, was diagnosed with &lt;a target="_blank" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/colon-cancer-misdiagnosis-young-people-ibs-gluten-allergy-symptoms-2025-3" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;colon cancer&lt;/a&gt; at 41 years old, it came as a complete shock. By the time he was diagnosed, the cancer was stage 4. He died nine months later, weeks after his 42nd birthday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Colon cancer didn't even cross our minds. He of course had symptoms, and in hindsight, I wish we had known what they were," Couric told Business Insider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monahan had been tired, but that was understandable — he was a busy lawyer and legal analyst for NBC News and a parent to their two daughters. That fatigue, along with some digestive changes, were vague symptoms of his illness. They're common early &lt;a target="_blank" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/what-to-know-about-colon-cancer-symptoms-diagnosis-chadwick-boseman" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;signs of colon cancer&lt;/a&gt; that can be easy to miss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the time of his diagnosis in 1997, the recommended age for having a colonoscopy was 50. Now, it's 45 — changed in 2021 in response to a concerning &lt;a target="_blank" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/where-colon-cancer-on-the-rise-reasons-why-2024-12" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;rise of colon cancer among younger people&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since his death, Couric said, she's made it her mission to help others catch colon cancer before it was too late.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Two of the worst words in the English language are 'what if.' You don't want to be wondering, 'What if I had gotten screened?' when it's too late," Couric said. "I hate to be that blunt, but it's true."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Couric spoke to BI during Colorectal Awareness Month as part of her partnership with Cologuard Classic by Exact Sciences, a PGA tournament to support patients and caregivers affected by the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After 27 years of advocacy, Couric shared what she now knows about how to spot colon cancer early and new breakthroughs that could transform how people are diagnosed and treated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="1318266f-a643-411f-a426-18049ca180f3" data-toc-id="1318266f-a643-411f-a426-18049ca180f3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Early warning signs of colon cancer to watch for&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's been a disturbing &lt;a target="_blank" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/colon-cancer-cases-doubled-young-people-2024-5" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;increase in colon cancer diagnoses&lt;/a&gt; in people in their 20s, 30s, and 40s over the past two decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Potential factors like &lt;a target="_blank" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/scientists-uncover-processed-foods-fuel-colon-cancer-how-offset-damage-2024-12" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;diets high in processed foods&lt;/a&gt; and red meat, drinking habits, and microplastics could all be driving the &lt;a target="_blank" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/colon-cancer-environmental-causes-microplastics-antibiotics-sleep-2025-1" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;rising rates of colon cancer in younger people&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Couric said she's grateful that there's now more awareness of major symptoms of colon cancer, such as:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fatigue&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Unintentional weight loss&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Changes in bowel habits&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Blood in stool&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;One reason colon cancer is misdiagnosed or missed is that symptoms can be vague and attributed to other digestive illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the recommended age to start screening for colon cancer was lowered to 45 in 2021, Couric said she finds it "very disturbing" that only about 20% of people between 45 and 49 have been screened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you or someone you know falls into that category, please get your butt to the doctor!" she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="9c586540-8d9a-4409-8b5a-56fbd9dacb55" data-toc-id="9c586540-8d9a-4409-8b5a-56fbd9dacb55"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Before a colonoscopy, you can try an at-home stool test&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;But don't wait for a blood test or other future innovations if you're worried about your risk now. Colon cancer is very treatable when detected early, so getting screened is crucial.&lt;/p&gt;
                      
                        
                      &lt;p&gt;Colonoscopies are one option, especially for people with known risk factors such as a family history of colon cancer or polyps or digestive diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another less-invasive option for people with average risk is a stool test, which can be done at home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I've learned the best test is the one that gets done, so do your research and figure out what works best for you," Couric said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said her advice is to pay attention to anything out of the ordinary, get medical attention, and advocate for yourself at the doctor's office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The important thing is to talk to your doctor, and if your doctor isn't taking either your symptoms or desire to get screened seriously, find another doctor, preferably a gastroenterologist," Couric said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="4b72b231-3f2a-46cf-980f-c051e01e25a3" data-toc-id="4b72b231-3f2a-46cf-980f-c051e01e25a3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2 scientific breakthroughs could help prevent colon cancer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Major scientific breakthroughs in diagnostic blood tests and innovations driven by artificial intelligence could &lt;a target="_blank" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/colon-cancer-doctor-prevention-risk-oncologist-2024-3" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;prevent colon cancer&lt;/a&gt; and make it more treatable than ever, Couric said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm excited to see the capabilities that AI will have on new treatments and screening opportunities," Couric said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FDA approved a first-of-its-kind &lt;a target="_blank" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/fda-approved-blood-test-detect-colon-cancer-early-2024-7" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;blood test for colon cancer&lt;/a&gt; screening in 2024. It works by detecting warning signs in the blood, such as DNA shed by tumors, although it's not a substitute for other screening such as colonoscopies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AI is already being used to further colon cancer research. It can organize datasets so scientists can better understand the difference between healthy and diseased cells, leading to breakthroughs like the "&lt;a target="_blank" class="" href="https://www.gutcellatlas.org/" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=" nofollow"&gt;gut atlas&lt;/a&gt;," a map of 1.6 million cells that make up the most comprehensive look at the human digestive system to date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The technology could eventually &lt;a target="_blank" class="" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10647850/" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;make screenings more accurate&lt;/a&gt; by helping doctors spot polyps and other abnormal growths, although more refinements are needed to reduce AI-related false alarms.&lt;/p&gt;
                      
                        &lt;/section&gt;

Did he want to die at home, or in the hospital?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Coates, then 37 and living in Renton, Wash., was barely conscious. For months, he had been battling a rare blood disorder called POEMS syndrome, which had left him with numb hands and feet, an enlarged heart and failing kidneys. Every few days, doctors needed to drain liters of fluid from his abdomen. He became too sick to receive a stem cell transplant — one of the only treatments that could have put him into remission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“I gave up,” he said. “I just thought the end was inevitable.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;But Coates’s girlfriend, Tara Theobald, wasn’t ready to quit. So she sent an email begging for help to a doctor in Philadelphia named David Fajgenbaum, whom the couple met a year earlier at a rare disease summit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;By the next morning, Dr. Fajgenbaum had replied, suggesting an unconventional combination of chemotherapy, immunotherapy and steroids previously untested as a treatment for Coates’s disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Within a week, Coates was responding to treatment.

&lt;p&gt;Pollen counts likely will exceed historical averages in 39 states this year as warmer weather starts to blanket much of the U.S., meteorologists are warning.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Experts are urging those who suffer from seasonal allergies to take heed and prepare for an intense allergy season that could last longer and linger into the fall months.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;“About one-quarter of U.S. adults have been diagnosed with seasonal allergies, and nearly one in five children have seasonal allergies,” Alan Reppert, a senior meteorologist at AccuWeather, &lt;a href="https://www.accuweather.com/en/weather-news/allergy-forecast-for-the-us-in-2025/1756039" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;said in statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Millions of people living with seasonal allergies will be struggling with more intense symptoms that will likely stick around longer this year in many areas,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Reppert attributed these complications to the wet and warm weather patterns anticipated later this year, which he projected would lead to these unwelcome spikes in pollen. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He and his colleagues also looked to the colder and snowier winter that much of the country experienced, which will now be upended by warmer spring temperatures overall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s2n-player" data-stn-player="k036p9v5" data-s2n-api="minuteMediaS2NApi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The hotter weather would be consistent with springs in recent years and foster longer growing seasons and earlier starts to allergy season, added Brett Anderson, a senior meteorologist and climate expert for AccuWeather.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Thanks to changing climate conditions, Anderson said in a statement that seasonal allergy seasons are lasting one to four weeks longer in many parts of the country, in comparison to 50 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;“There will be variability year to year depending on spring temperatures, storm tracks, and additional moisture from tropical storms and hurricanes, but the overall trend is clear,” Anderson said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Tree pollen, the first of three primary allergens in the U.S., begins in the spring once ground temperatures climb to 40-45 degrees Fahrenheit, according to an AccuWeather report. Next in line is a wave of grass pollen in the late spring and early summer, followed by weed pollen in the late summer and fall.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The cold start to the year in much of the eastern half of the country will keep tree pollen levels lower to start, but there can still be a week period of very high levels,” Reppert said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="civic-science-article-container civic-science-less-14 civic-is-mr3" id="civsci-id-civsci-id-596708068" data-civicscience-widget="3f127ebd-287e-0b64-a901-d55ec286348a"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The meteorologists projected that the worst of the tree pollen would strike the Gulf Coast, the Central Plains, the Northern Rockies and the Pacific Northwest.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Tree pollen levels may be higher than the historical averages across a 2,000-mile-long zone, spanning 22 states, per the report.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, Reppert noted that dry weather in the Southwest through the spring should ultimately help the season end there after a ferocious start.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The Northeast and the Pacific Northwest will likely face the most severe grass-related allergy seasons, particularly in June and July amid a probable warm and wet start to summer, according to AccuWeather.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As for weed pollen, these allergens are expected to do their worst and peak in July across the Tennessee Valley, but they may also usher in a second peak due to a rise in moisture toward the end of the summer, the report found. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As the planet continues to warm, Anderson warned that the trend of longer and more intense allergy seasons will likely persist over the next decade. Contributing to this phenomenon is the burning of fossil fuels, which releases carbon dioxide into the air and creates warmer air — which in turn, can hold more moisture, he explained.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;“The combination of more rainfall that can boost plant growth, higher spring temperatures, longer growing seasons, and more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere triggering increased pollen production is the reason why more people are experiencing seasonal allergy symptoms for the first time, and many longtime allergy suffers are dealing with worsening symptoms,” Anderson added.&lt;/p&gt;

That can be reflected in cholesterol numbers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-many-pecans-do-you-have-to-eat-to-see-benefits" data-node-id="15" class="body-h2 css-1coetfg emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="15.0"&gt;How many pecans do you have to eat to see benefits?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="16" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;It’s best to aim for two ounces of pecans a day, which is about two medium handfuls, Petersen says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-else-can-nuts-do-for-your-health" data-node-id="17" class="body-h2 css-1coetfg emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="17.0"&gt;What else can nuts do for your health?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="18" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Nuts are a solid source of plant-based protein and a heart-healthy food, Cording says.

This welcome respite has largely resulted from the lull in significant bird flu outbreaks in recent weeks, perhaps due to seasonal patterns in the virus’s transmission. North American flyways typically remain quiet in February as migratory birds have yet to start their journeys from their winter habitats.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But this reprieve may be short-lived: With spring approaching, wild birds are resuming their seasonal migrations, potentially triggering renewed outbreaks of the deadly virus. Such developments could once again strain domestic poultry populations, bringing renewed focus on the measures being undertaken by U.S. authorities to curb the spread of infection.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Since the virus first appeared in North America in 2022, approximately &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/situation-summary/data-map-commercial.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;166 million egg-laying hens have been culled from infected farms&lt;/a&gt;. Once the virus infiltrates a flock, it spreads with alarming speed and proves nearly always fatal to the infected hens. Consequently, culling becomes an unfortunate necessity to spare the birds from a near-certain and agonizing death and minimize the virus’s transmission risk to neighboring farms.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/18/health/kennedy-bird-flu.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;has proposed allowing the virus to spread freely through flocks&lt;/a&gt;, hoping to pinpoint hens that display natural immunity. Yet this approach is impractical: Hens bred specifically for maximum egg production tend to have inherently fragile immune systems. Worse, permitting unchecked transmission could inadvertently incubate viral mutations, potentially transforming the outbreak into an even more dangerous threat. Most of these farms have hundreds of thousands or millions of chickens, so even when poultry farmers try to isolate one part of an infected flock, the disease will inevitably spread across their entire flock. The virus can spread through contaminated equipment moved between farms, via wild birds, or, in some instances, possibly through &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/avian-influenza-bird-flu/can-avian-flu-spread-wind-cant-be-ruled-out-experts-say" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;airborne dander traveling short distances&lt;/a&gt; and contaminating nearby water sources.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The most effective strategy is prevention — ensuring flocks never become infected in the first place and fortifying them against potential exposure. U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins recently unveiled a &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/opinion/agriculture-secretary-brooke-rollins-my-plan-to-lower-egg-prices-6be0f881" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;five-part strategy&lt;/a&gt; designed to curb avian flu transmission among domestic, egg-laying hens. Her comprehensive plan calls for heightened biosecurity measures to protect farms against initial infection and internal spread. It also explores vaccine options for hens, among other measures. Before wild birds resume migrating, the U.S. has time to take additional steps to fortify farm defenses against such threats and boost the supply of eggs available to consumers.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;A sensible first step is to seriously consider strategies for vaccinating egg-laying hens, an approach that agricultural officials have viewed with some skepticism. We have vaccines for bird flu made by American companies and used overseas, but so far, federal officials don’t seem poised to use them here.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt; Admittedly, this strategy faces technical challenges. Chickens can receive bird flu vaccinations at around 14 to 21 days of age. Since many hens already receive injections of other vaccines when they are chicks or young pullets, some experts propose integrating an avian influenza vaccine into this existing regimen. However, egg-laying hens would likely require two vaccinations over their commercial life span, complicating the logistics. To make vaccination practical, scientists may need to develop ways to aerosolize the vaccine, enabling more efficient delivery. With roughly &lt;a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/livestock-poultry-disease/avian/avian-influenza/hpai-detections/commercial-backyard-flocks" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;378 million egg-laying hens&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S. and &lt;a href="https://www.nationalchickencouncil.org/chicken-processors-redoubling-efforts-to-keep-essential-workers-safe-and-healthy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;nearly 10 billion broiler chickens&lt;/a&gt; raised annually for meat, individually injecting millions of adult birds could become complex and costly, requiring new strategies for delivery.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yet, technological difficulties aren’t the only obstacles; political considerations also loom large. Trade issues present a significant hurdle. Europeans may object to importing live chicks from the U.S. because the available vaccines are viewed as non-sterilizing — that is, while vaccination reduces virus transmission and makes hens a lot less susceptible, poultry can still contract and potentially spread the virus. So, vaccination can complicate the identification of infected birds, raising concerns that stricken poultry could remain undetected within flocks destined for export. Many European countries worry about importing the virus unwittingly among vaccinated hens.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, these concerns about vaccination can be addressed with stepped-up biosecurity to reduce the chances that the virus will get into birds destined for export. Other nations — &lt;a href="https://www.unmc.edu/healthsecurity/transmission/2023/02/17/bird-flu-vaccination-policies-by-country/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;including France, China, and Mexico&lt;/a&gt; — already vaccinate poultry against H5N1. Some, such as France, are cleared by other nations to export these birds because France has proven that it can reduce the odds of subclinical infections from infiltrating their flocks. Therapeutic measures alone are not a panacea; their effectiveness hinges upon the concurrent application of enhanced biosecurity practices, many of which Rollins has strongly advocated, such as better efforts to sanitize equipment shared across farms, or protect water supplies used by hens.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If these efforts fail to prevent any renewed outbreak of the virus, or if officials can’t be convinced to undertake a vaccination campaign, there are additional steps that U.S. regulators can adopt to boost egg supply. The price of eggs at the consumer level is highly sensitive to marginal changes in supply — much like oil prices in economic terms, where the cost is often determined by the last incremental barrels available on the market. Similarly, when it comes to eggs, even modest increases in production can significantly lower consumer prices.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Breeders produce a subset of eggs originally intended for hatching into new hens. If these fertilized eggs fail to hatch, they can still safely enter the food supply under carefully controlled conditions. Some of these eggs can be designated as table eggs, which others may serve as “breaker eggs” that are cracked open, pasteurized, and incorporated into liquid egg products — such as Egg Beaters — sold in cartons. During previous outbreaks of avian influenza, when egg supplies became constrained, some members of the egg industry advocated for using breeder eggs to ease shortages. However, longstanding Food and Drug Administration regulations have generally limited use of these eggs for human consumption. The FDA’s primary concern is that breeder eggs, having been held at warmer temperatures to promote hatching rather than promptly refrigerated after laying, carry an elevated risk of contamination by pathogens such as salmonella, thus posing potential health risks to consumers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But the risk can be reduced. If the breeder eggs are earmarked for consumption as breaker eggs, they would still undergo pasteurization. If egg producers were able to also refrigerate these eggs more rapidly — bringing them to a temperature of 45 degrees within 36 hours — they might achieve a sufficient cumulative reduction in the risk of bacterial contamination, enough to open a pathway for their safe consumption. If small increases in the supply of eggs can translate into meaningfully lower prices for consumers, this might be one path to creating a more sustainable marginal capacity for more eggs available on store shelves.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Demand for eggs will likely remain strong, particularly with the Easter holiday drawing near. And our current respite from avian flu outbreaks may prove short-lived. The avian influenza strains now in circulation have persisted continuously among birds and mammals for nearly two years, and there’s growing evidence that it could become a permanent feature of North America — part of a new normal to which the poultry industry must inevitably adjust for both the physical and economic health of Americans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A panel of experts at a leading speciality society announced in &lt;a href="https://www.gastrojournal.org/article/S0016-5085(25)00035-6/fulltext" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a new clinical guideline &lt;/a&gt;that they have decided not to decide whether to recommend AI-assisted colonoscopies. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After reviewing studies and using existing information to model outcomes, experts enlisted by the American Gastroenterological Association determined that using AI definitely increases adenoma detection rate (ADR), or colonoscopies that find polyps. But they figure, with low certainty, that using AI in screening only leads to 2 fewer colorectal cancer-related deaths per 10,000 people over 10 years. Citing a close call and fuzzy evidence, the panel decided not to issue a recommendation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The unsatisfying shrug of conclusion underscores the trade-offs involved in enlisting new technology to screen for disease. Usually, the ADR is an important measure of quality as it &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4036494/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;is associated with better outcomes&lt;/a&gt;. But using technology to boost ADR can lead to more testing, more procedures, and higher health care costs, and we don’t really know that it meaningfully reduces the number of cancers and deaths. The authors note that the increase in ADR is “primarily attributable to detection of diminutive to small polyps with low potential for progression.” Authors Benjamin Lebwohl and Shahnaz Sultan told me by email that there is a long time lag between finding these extra polyps and the potential benefit, so these data will not be available soon. Short of hard data on mortality, evidence that AI helps find more problematic polyps might sway the decision-makers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The guideline itself is actually an interesting read. Apparently the authors released a draft recommending AI-assisted screening but ultimately walked it back after receiving comments. The non-recommendation was arrived at by vote because there was no consensus on the panel. The guideline will be revisited in a year or two when there is new data available.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-nvidia-announces-platform-for-ai-powered-robots-in-health-care-and-more"&gt;Nvidia announces platform for AI-powered robots in health care and more&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This week Nvidia held its GTC event, and consequently, a few big names in health care got to briefly bask in the electronic chip maker’s limelight. As the main supplier of chips used to train large language models and other AI technologies, Nvidia props up, in one way or another, a lot of the AI tech we talk about.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Announcements were lofty and occasionally inscrutable:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buried in Microsoft’s &lt;a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/microsoft-and-nvidia-accelerate-ai-development-and-performance/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;press release &lt;/a&gt;was a quote from Epic Systems VP of cloud and analytics Drew McCombs who said the company plans to run open source generative AI models on an offering from Nvidia and Microsoft. He also noted that the company is working with UW Health and UC San Diego Health on “researching methods to evaluate clinical summaries with these advanced models.” &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2023/04/20/microsoft-epic-generative-ai/" rel=""&gt;Collaboration between the medical centers, Microsoft and Epic goes back to 2023&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Elsewhere, &lt;strong&gt;GE HealthCare&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://investor.gehealthcare.com/news-releases/news-release-details/ge-healthcare-and-nvidia-reimagine-diagnostic-imaging-autonomous#:~:text=With%20NVIDIA%20as%20a%20world,to%20help%20solve%20some%20of" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;announced &lt;/a&gt;it’s working with Nvidia to “reimagine diagnostic imaging with autonomous X-ray and ultrasound solutions.” The company said it hopes that Nvidia’s &lt;a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/introducing-nvidia-isaac-for-healthcare-an-ai-powered-medical-robotics-development-platform/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;new platform &lt;/a&gt;for AI-powered health care robots and synthetic data will “help to automate repetitive tasks performed by a technologist in the patient exam room.” The company cites this effort as way to address radiology staff shortages.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;While we’re on Nvidia, earlier this month, at the &lt;strong&gt;TD Cowen &lt;/strong&gt;Healthcare Conference, the chip giant’s VP of healthcare Kimberly Powell pitched a vision for how life science research companies — such as its partners &lt;strong&gt;Genentech&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Relation Therapeutics&lt;/strong&gt; — can use NVIDIA’s BioNeMo platform “in the loop” to squeeze the most value out of data and their scientists’ knowledge: “Every single experiment that you do, every idea your scientist has, can now be captured and codified to build upon an institutional knowledge that otherwise is maybe sitting in an electronic lab notebook somewhere. But how could you represent even those decades of electronic lab notebooks in a model, and then every single experiment you make, put it back in? And so, we’ve invented a platform called BioNeMo to serve just that.” (&lt;em&gt;Brittany Trang contributed to this item&lt;/em&gt;.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-medicare-advisors-suggest-telehealth-isn-t-fading"&gt;Medicare advisors suggest telehealth isn’t fading&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As expected, the stop-gap funding bill passed by Congress last week included an extension of Medicare coverage for telehealth. Brace yourself, we’ll be talking about this again in September.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The day before that bill passed, the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission released &lt;a href="https://www.medpac.gov/document/march-2025-report-to-the-congress-medicare-payment-policy/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;its March report &lt;/a&gt;to Congress. It noted that while some changes to the pandemic care landscape have reverted, others, like telehealth, may prove longer lasting. They note that in their 2024 survey of beneficiaries, 33% reported using telehealth, adding that as more claims from outside the pandemic become available they’ll continue to monitor the impact.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Survey responses don’t necessarily reflect reality or even Medicare cost impact. As an interesting counterpoint, the &lt;a href="https://data.cms.gov/sites/default/files/2024-12/f5b35fbf-002a-425d-924d-f99aa362a63f/Medicare%20Telehealth%20Trends%20Snapshot%2020241127_508.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;most recent data&lt;/a&gt; published by Medicare says that in 2023, 24% of beneficiaries used telehealth at least once.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-oura-epiwatch-and-the-legacy-of-apple-s-researchkit"&gt;Oura, EpiWatch, and the legacy of Apple’s ResearchKit&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This week, an app that uses the Apple Watch for detecting seizures &lt;a href="https://www.einpresswire.com/article/795082833/epiwatch-inc-announces-fda-510-k-clearance-for-the-epiwatch-continuous-seizure-monitor" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; clearance from the Food and Drug Administration. The summary documents haven’t been posted to the&lt;a href="https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfpmn/pmn.cfm?ID=K243515" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt; FDA website yet&lt;/a&gt;. Originally developed by at Johns Hopkins, EpiWatch was one of the very earliest research projects &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/mt/newsroom/2015/10/15Apple-Announces-New-ResearchKit-Studies-for-Autism-Epilepsy-Melanoma/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;launched &lt;/a&gt;on Apple’s ResearchKit platform in 2015. EpiWatch been spun out into &lt;a href="https://www.epiwatch.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a company &lt;/a&gt;that’s developing care programs around the detection tech. This is a similar trajectory to a Parkinson’s research project announced in 2015, which has &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2023/10/24/apple-watch-parkinsons-disease-apps-parky-strivepd-neurorpm/" rel=""&gt;also blossomed into a few companies.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you go back to that 2015 ResearchKit press release above, you’ll see a quote from Ricky Bloomfield about &lt;a href="https://dihi.org/project/autism-beyond/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Autism &amp;amp; Beyon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://dihi.org/project/autism-beyond/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;d&lt;/a&gt;, a study using Apple’s tech to study young children’s mental health in hopes of developing screening tools for autism and other conditions. Bloomfield was then a director of mobile technology strategy and assistant professor at Duke University.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In 2016, Bloomfield went to Apple where he worked for over eight years. Until now. Today, he &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250320135730/en/URA-Appoints-Ricky-Bloomfield-MD-as-Chief-Medical-Officer" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;was announced&lt;/a&gt; as the new chief medical officer of smart ring maker Oura. The hire comes as Oura seeks to evolve from a wellness fad to a player in the health care space. Oura in particular cites Bloomfield’s work on data interoperability at Duke as something they’re excited about.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-hospital-at-home-merger"&gt;A hospital at home merger&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Medically Home and DispatchHealth &lt;a href="https://www.dispatchhealth.com/dispatchhealth-and-medically-home-to-merge-increasing-access-to-hospital-level-care-at-home-for-americans/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;announced a plan&lt;/a&gt; to merge. The former is one of the key companies helping health systems to provide hospital at home services. A pandemic-era Medicare program that allowed hospitals to &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2022/12/21/hospital-at-home-cms-medicare-health/" rel=""&gt;deliver inpatient care &lt;/a&gt;in people’s homes was last week extended until September, though, I was told the timing is coincidental. DispatchHealth also provides hospital at home care, but it’s biggest and longest running service delivers same-day at-home care for serious and chronic medical conditions that helps avoid trips to the emergency department.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-amazon-exits"&gt;Amazon exits&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After abruptly leaving his post as chief medical officer at Amazon Pharmacy in February, Vin Gupta revealed he’s &lt;a href="https://www.manatt.com/insights/press-releases/2025/prominent-national-health-leaders-join-manatt-s-renowned-health-care-group" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;joining &lt;/a&gt;consultancy Manatt, along with former CDC director Mandy Cohen, as the firm aims to build a public health communications practice.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, Trent Green, CEO of Amazon’s One Medical &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/05/amazons-one-medical-ceo-stepping-down-after-less-than-two-years.html#:~:text=Sullivan%20%7C%20Getty%20Images-,One%20Medical%20CEO%20Trent%20Green%20will%20step%20down%20from%20the,said%20in%20a%20release%20Tuesday." rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; he would be leaving the company in April to take a new job as the CEO of analytics company National Research Corp. He held the One Medical CEO job for less than two years.&lt;/p&gt;

And a new study has just identified 16 new genes linked to Alzheimer’s disease, which may eventually lead to better testing and even treatments. The findings are a little technical, but we turned to the experts to hear what they think.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's everything to know, plus how experts interpret the findings and what it means for your life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meet the experts&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href="https://www.providence.org/doctors/profile/203880-clifford-segil" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Clifford Segil, DO;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Clifford Segil, DO&lt;/a&gt;, is a neurologist at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, CA; &lt;a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.nychealthandhospitals.org/doctors/postelnik-amy/__;!!Ivohdkk!mKQLGkLqeAudZx-H1p4n_IVj-gzDgoLOKfxscWClbVFKPy3IlJv51kJD7nG7a3ZFmb7EzQGbw9luz83ibDcKSA$" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Amy Postelnik;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Amy Postelnik&lt;/a&gt;, MD, is the chief of neurology at NYC Health + Hospitals/Lincoln; &lt;a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://researchers.mgh.harvard.edu/profile/15961636/Dmitry-Prokopenko__;!!Ivohdkk!mKQLGkLqeAudZx-H1p4n_IVj-gzDgoLOKfxscWClbVFKPy3IlJv51kJD7nG7a3ZFmb7EzQGbw9luz82BaYCCkw$" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dmitry Prokopenko,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Dmitry Prokopenko,&lt;/a&gt; PhD, is a study co-author and assistant professor of neurology at the Genetics and Aging Research Unit, McCance Center for Brain Health, Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School; &lt;a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://researchers.mgh.harvard.edu/profile/3824747/Rudolph-Tanzi__;!!Ivohdkk!mKQLGkLqeAudZx-H1p4n_IVj-gzDgoLOKfxscWClbVFKPy3IlJv51kJD7nG7a3ZFmb7EzQGbw9luz80nyqBZNg$" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Rudolph Tanzi;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Rudolph Tanzi&lt;/a&gt;, PhD, is a study co-author, director of the genetics and Aging Research Unit at Massachusetts General Hospital, and a professor of neurology at Harvard Medical School.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What did the study find?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, which was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/alz.14592" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Alzheimer’s &amp;amp; Dementia;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Alzheimer’s &amp;amp; Dementia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, focused on whole-genome sequencing data from more than 49,000 people. The study included 12,074 participants who were clinically diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease, as well as 37,075 people who were diagnosed based on their family history (meaning they had symptoms that seemed like Alzheimer's and a prior family member also had the disease).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After analyzing the sequencing data, the researchers detected 16 new genetic signals linked with Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While previous studies have mostly looked at caucasian participants, this research focuses on a diverse group of people, says &lt;a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://researchers.mgh.harvard.edu/profile/15961636/Dmitry-Prokopenko__;!!Ivohdkk!mKQLGkLqeAudZx-H1p4n_IVj-gzDgoLOKfxscWClbVFKPy3IlJv51kJD7nG7a3ZFmb7EzQGbw9luz82BaYCCkw$" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dmitry Prokopenko,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Dmitry Prokopenko,&lt;/a&gt; PhD, study co-author and assistant professor of neurology at the Genetics and Aging Research Unit, McCance Center for Brain Health, Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School. "Our new paper emphasizes the importance of studying populations of diverse ethnic ancestries to get a more comprehensive understanding of genetic susceptibility to disease," he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Which genes are linked with a greater risk of Alzheimer’s?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of these genes likely won't be recognizable (unless you're a doctor), but here’s a breakdown of the genes linked with Alzheimer’s disease from this study, in case you're interested:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;FBN2/SCL27A6&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;AC090115.1&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;DYM&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;KCNG1/AL121785.1&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;TIAM1&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;VWA5B1&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;RNU6-755P/LMX1A&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;MOB1A&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;MORC1-AS1&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;LINC00989&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;PDE4D&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;RNU2-49P/CDO1&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEO1&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;SLC35G3/AC022916.1&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;RPL23/LASP1&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;CEBPA/AC008738.6&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do I know if I have these genes?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Right now, there’s no way to know if you have these genes. “This is not a clinically available test, nor will it be for a while,” says &lt;a href="https://www.providence.org/doctors/profile/203880-clifford-segil" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Clifford Segil, DO;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Clifford Segil, DO&lt;/a&gt;, a neurologist at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, CA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Dr. Segil says there is an existing test for Alzheimer’s disease, called the APOE4 gene test or just APOE test. The apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene is a well-known gene that influences Alzheimer’s risk, he explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"[Tests] are usually ordered by a cognitive neurologist in conjunction with a geneticist and these panels are still in the research phase," says &lt;a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.nychealthandhospitals.org/doctors/postelnik-amy/__;!!Ivohdkk!mKQLGkLqeAudZx-H1p4n_IVj-gzDgoLOKfxscWClbVFKPy3IlJv51kJD7nG7a3ZFmb7EzQGbw9luz83ibDcKSA$" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Amy Postelnik;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Amy Postelnik&lt;/a&gt;, MD, chief of neurology at NYC Health + Hospitals/Lincoln. "In the future, they may become part of a standardized assessment for dementia risk and more likely in patients with a strong family history that have a higher pretest probability of developing dementia."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Will I definitely develop Alzheimer’s if I have these genes?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Short answer: No. Why? "Everyone carries these genes," says &lt;a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://researchers.mgh.harvard.edu/profile/3824747/Rudolph-Tanzi__;!!Ivohdkk!mKQLGkLqeAudZx-H1p4n_IVj-gzDgoLOKfxscWClbVFKPy3IlJv51kJD7nG7a3ZFmb7EzQGbw9luz80nyqBZNg$" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Rudolph Tanzi;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Rudolph Tanzi&lt;/a&gt;, PhD, study co-author, director of the genetics and Aging Research Unit at Massachusetts General Hospital, and a professor of neurology at Harvard Medical School. "The question is whether they have inherited the mutations in these genes that influence risk for Alzheimer’s disease."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But even if tests come back positive for the mutations, it only suggests an increased risk of getting dementia, Dr. Segil says. There’s no guarantee that a positive result means you &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; get dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Everyone gets a fresh deck of cards” in life, Dr. Segil says, pointing out that even people who have a genetic risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease can lower their risk by living a healthy lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers also stress, like Dr. Segil, that people shouldn't jump to conclusions if they find they have these genetic mutations. "Until we understand more about exactly how mutations in these genes increase or decrease risk for Alzheimer’s disease, we would recommend it is better to wait for further characterization of their effects on risk," Prokopenko says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What else can I do to lower my risk of developing Alzheimer’s?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have a family history of Alzheimer’s disease and you’re worried about your own risk, Dr. Segil recommends contacting a neurologist for an evaluation and consultation. “Try to see if there are modifiable risk factors that you can adjust,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, Dr. Segil recommends doing your best to manage any underlying health conditions you have, stay active, and try to live an overall healthy lifestyle. (Dr. Postelnik points out doing something as specific as addressing hearing loss can reduce your dementia risk.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Dr. Postelnik points out, "you cannot control your genetics but you can control your lifestyle."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL</author><pubDate>Thu, 20 Mar 2025 13:56:52 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMif0FVX3lxTE1CMUhVWWpWN3QtZ1VSTzh0eUxqdFlSVzVFMnBORzZrQkdnOTFtaVN1bnNKZ3VOOE55WURObWd1eXhnblNxYkVPN2RLNDNLQlQ4NnZGOV8tV1RlVk5GTVZydWxPb2c3dnRRM2dLNk43Rmg1bXFPVUlVTXBJRE9DVFU</guid></item><item><title>Brain Activity Reveals How We Learn From Mistakes - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiakFVX3lxTE1WZGhQSUpSOGdldXVuMGt2RTZIRWM3T0REbGdWRnFOWnFqV1hQeDJXUGExLWRadEZZZXVXUEl2QVM4YTFHX25rZjUtbGFINnUzVmYtNDZZVzZsRVhqanVjMmU1UEMzNFNpUnc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;New research uncovers how the brain processes learning by identifying the exact moment an animal learns a new skill. By observing individual neurons in mice, scientists found that learning occurs much faster than previously thought, in as few as 20 to 40 tries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, this learning activity takes place in the sensory cortex, a region typically associated with perception rather than cognition. The study also found that even after mastering a task, mice continued to make errors, suggesting they were deliberately testing their knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rapid Learning:&lt;/strong&gt; Mice learned tasks in just 20-40 attempts, much faster than expected.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sensory Cortex Role:&lt;/strong&gt; Learning occurred in the sensory cortex, not just higher-order brain areas.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Error Testing:&lt;/strong&gt; Mice continued making mistakes after learning, suggesting strategic exploration.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Johns Hopkins University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By revealing for the first time what happens in the brain when an animal makes a mistake, Johns Hopkins University researchers are shedding light on the holy grail of neuroscience: the mechanics of how we learn.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team pinpointed the exact moment mice learned a new skill by observing the activity of individual neurons, confirming earlier work that suggested animals are fast learners that purposely test the boundaries of new knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108193"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/mistakes-learning-brain-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/mistakes-learning-brain-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/mistakes-learning-brain-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/mistakes-learning-brain-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/mistakes-learning-brain-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/mistakes-learning-brain-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/mistakes-learning-brain-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/mistakes-learning-brain-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/mistakes-learning-brain-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/mistakes-learning-brain-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/mistakes-learning-brain-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/mistakes-learning-brain-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/mistakes-learning-brain-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/mistakes-learning-brain-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/mistakes-learning-brain-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Although the ability to learn quickly would benefit any animal in the wild, animals studied in labs seem to learn slowly and methodically. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The federally funded work, which upends assumptions about the speed of learning and the role of the sensory cortex, and which the researchers believe will hold true across animal species including humans, is newly published in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Looking at a tiny part of the brain in a mouse, we can understand how the brain learns, and we can makes predictions about how the human brain might work,” said Kishore Kuchibhotla, a Johns Hopkins neuroscientist who studies learning in humans and animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The field of neuroscience has made great progress decoding motor activity and how the brain processes sight and sound. But a holy grail of this type of research is thought—what comes between the hearing and the doing—we’re all still trying to understand the patterns of brain activity that underly higher-order cognitive processes. These findings are a step in that direction.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the ability to learn quickly would benefit any animal in the wild, animals studied in labs seem to learn slowly and methodically. It typically takes mice, for instance, thousands of tries to learn a task, several hundred at best.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kuchibhotla’s lab previously found that animals’ performance doesn’t necessarily sync with their knowledge—or that animals might know a lot more than they demonstrate in tests. The lab also found that animals that seem to be slow learners might be testing their new knowledge. But by merely watching animals struggle at tasks, they couldn’t tell a slow learner from a strategic tester of boundaries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are interested in the idea that humans and other animals may know things about the world, things that they choose not to show,” Kuchibhotla said. “Our core question is what is the neural basis of this distinction between learning and performance.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers taught mice to lick when they heard one tone but not to lick when they heard a different sound. From the moment training began, the team recorded the activity of neurons in the auditory cortex, an area of the brain associated with hearing and perception.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were two major surprises. First, the mice learned in 20 to 40 tries, “extraordinarily fast,” according to Kuchibhotla. And second, this learning activity happened in the sensory cortex, something that has typically been associated with nonsensory brain areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This work illustrates the importance of assessing how brain activity impacts behavior at different stages of the learning process and in different conditions,” said first author Celine Drieu, a postdoctoral fellow studying neuroscience at Johns Hopkins. “Our results show that a sensory cortex does more than processing sensory inputs; it is also crucial to form associations between sensory cues and reinforced actions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the mice continued to make errors, licking at the wrong times long after their neural activity showed they’d learned the task, their brain activity confirmed to the researchers that the mice knew the rules of the game—they were just experimenting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘We were able to decode the cognitive driver of an error,” Kuchibhotla said. “We could tell if the animal was making a mistake or just wanted to give the other option a shot.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the mice had mastered the task and ceased their exploratory behavior, this higher-order activity started to diminish, and the sensory cortex was no longer involved in the task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We think this means that animals are smarter than we think, and that there are distinct brain dynamics related to learning. You might know something, but there’s a parallel process related to how you use it. The brain seems wired to do that well, to allow us to toggle between performance and learning as we get better and better at something.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this learning and neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#177d6578647279577d7f6239727362" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Jill Rosen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://jhu.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Johns Hopkins University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Jill Rosen – Johns Hopkins University&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-08730-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Rapid emergence of latent knowledge in the sensory cortex drives learning&lt;/a&gt;” by Kishore Kuchibhotla et al. &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rapid emergence of latent knowledge in the sensory cortex drives learning&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rapid learning confers significant advantages on animals in ecological environments. Despite the need for speed, animals appear to only slowly learn to associate rewarded actions with predictive cues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This slow learning is thought to be supported by gradual changes to cue representation in the sensory cortex. However, evidence is growing that animals learn more rapidly than classical performance measures suggest, challenging the prevailing model of sensory cortical plasticity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here we investigated the relationship between learning and sensory cortical representations. We trained mice on an auditory go/no-go task that dissociated the rapid acquisition of task contingencies (learning) from its slower expression (performance).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Optogenetic silencing demonstrated that the auditory cortex drives both rapid learning and slower performance gains but becomes dispensable once mice achieve ‘expert’ performance. Instead of enhanced cue representations, two-photon calcium imaging of auditory cortical neurons throughout learning revealed two higher-order signals that were causal to learning and performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A reward-prediction signal emerged rapidly within tens of trials, was present after action-related errors early in training, and faded in expert mice. Silencing at the time of this signal impaired rapid learning, suggesting that it serves an associative role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A distinct cell ensemble encoded and controlled licking suppression that drove slower performance improvements. These ensembles were spatially clustered but uncoupled from sensory representations, indicating higher-order functional segregation within auditory cortex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our results reveal that the sensory cortex manifests higher-order computations that separably drive rapid learning and slower performance improvements, reshaping our understanding of the fundamental role of the sensory cortex.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Thu, 20 Mar 2025 13:46:53 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiakFVX3lxTE1WZGhQSUpSOGdldXVuMGt2RTZIRWM3T0REbGdWRnFOWnFqV1hQeDJXUGExLWRadEZZZXVXUEl2QVM4YTFHX25rZjUtbGFINnUzVmYtNDZZVzZsRVhqanVjMmU1UEMzNFNpUnc</guid></item><item><title>WHO calls for urgent action to address worldwide disruptions in tuberculosis services putting millions of lives at risk - World Health Organization</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi8gFBVV95cUxNNnh1YWx1X2VjNUlMeFhtVG4yVVBRMUFZMjBrODA5Mk1QSUc4djZHQy11eXdmd2NiMFd3QXRWalNqcVdLWmxFcWVVcTJRVHlOWjgtQmlQM05mNmV0T3I0RDdFcXdpUktWX00yQkE1cXVYa3FCX0Y1VUVlWk5RNEQ3LVQ2U2NwMW9UakVnSE91U2dLX1Q3amFPMTNuaG54Q3g5WHJFdnBGT2VYa3dFako2eFQ2RjZrcVZBWUFuVEhmV2tqX2p4b05md1ZtYXdyZXVqUmZJbGRrZHFnUDFNNVh3NlAwY1lwbzA3VVVHYUIxUXJTQQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the occasion on World Tuberculosis (TB) Day, marked on 24 March, the World Health Organization (WHO) is calling for an urgent investment of resources to protect and maintain tuberculosis (TB) care and support services for people in need across regions and countries. TB remains the world’s deadliest infectious disease, responsible for over 1 million people annually bringing devastating impacts on families and communities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Global efforts to combat TB have saved an estimated 79 million lives since 2000. However, the drastic and abrupt cuts in global health funding happening now are threatening to reverse these gains. Rising drug resistance especially across Europe and the ongoing conflicts across the Middle-East, Africa and Eastern Europe, are further exacerbating the situation for the most vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Under the theme &lt;em&gt;Yes! We Can End TB: Commit, Invest, Deliver&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="/campaigns/world-tb-day/2025"&gt;World Tuberculosis Day 2025&lt;/a&gt; campaign highlights a rallying cry for urgency, and accountability and hope. &lt;em&gt;“The huge gains the world has made against TB over the past 20 years are now at risk as cuts to funding start to disrupt access to services for prevention, screening, and treatment for people with TB,” &lt;/em&gt;said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General&lt;em&gt;. “But we cannot give up on the concrete commitments that world leaders made at the UN General Assembly just 18 months ago to accelerate work to end TB. WHO is committed to working with all donors, partners and affected countries to mitigate the impact of funding cuts and find innovative solutions.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Funding: threat to global TB efforts&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Early reports to WHO reveal that severe disruptions in the TB response are seen across several of the highest-burden countries following the funding cuts. Countries in the WHO African Region are experiencing the greatest impact, followed by countries in the WHO South-East Asian and Western Pacific Regions. Twenty seven countries are facing crippling breakdowns in their TB response, with devastating consequences, such as:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;li&gt;Human resource shortages undermining service delivery;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Diagnostic services severely disrupted, delaying detection and treatment;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Data and surveillance systems collapsing, compromising disease tracking and management;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Community engagement efforts, including active case finding, screening, and contact tracing, deteriorating, leading to delayed diagnoses and increased transmission risks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nine countries report failing TB drug procurement and supply chains, jeopardizing treatment continuity and patient outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 2025 funding cuts further exacerbate an already existing underfunding for global TB response. In 2023, only 26% of the US$22 billion annually needed for TB prevention and care was available, leaving a massive shortfall. TB research is in crisis, receiving just one-fifth of the US$5 billion annual target in 2022—severely delaying advancements in diagnostics, treatments, and vaccines. WHO is leading efforts to accelerate TB vaccine development through the TB Vaccine Accelerator Council, but progress remains at risk without urgent financial commitments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Joint statement with civil society&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In response to the urgent challenges threatening TB services worldwide, WHO’s Director-General and Civil Society Task Force on Tuberculosis have issued a decisive statement. The &lt;a href="/news/item/01-05-2023-who-director-general-and-civil-society-task-force-on-tb-release-joint-statement-on-key-priorities-in-the-lead-up-to-2nd-un-high-level-meeting-on-tb"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="/news/item/18-03-2025-who-director-general-and-civil-society-task-force-on-tb-release-joint-statement-on-sustaining-the-momentum-to-end-tb"&gt;joint statement &lt;/a&gt;released this week, demands immediate, coordinated efforts from governments, global health leaders, donors, and policymakers to prevent further disruptions. The statement outlines five critical priorities: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Addressing TB service disruptions&lt;/em&gt; urgently, ensuring responses match the crisis's scale;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Securing sustainable domestic funding&lt;/em&gt;, guaranteeing uninterrupted and equitable access to TB prevention and care;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Safeguarding essential TB services&lt;/em&gt;, including access to life-saving drugs, diagnostics, treatment and social protections, alongside cross-sector collaboration;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Establishing or revitalizing national collaboration platforms&lt;/em&gt;, fostering alliances among civil society, NGOs, donors, and professional societies to tackle challenges;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Enhancing monitoring and early warning systems&lt;/em&gt; to assess real-time impact and detect disruptions early.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This urgent call is timely and underscores the necessity of swift, decisive action to sustain global TB progress and prevent setbacks that could cost lives,” said Dr Tereza Kasaeva, Director of WHO’s Global Programme on TB and Lung Health. “Investing in ending TB is not only a moral imperative but also an economic necessity—every dollar spent on prevention and treatment yields an estimated US$43 in economic returns.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;New guidance on TB and lung health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As one of the solutions to combating growing resource constraints, WHO is driving the integration of TB and lung health within primary healthcare as a sustainable solution.   &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240107526/" data-sf-ec-immutable="" data-sf-marked=""&gt;New technical guidance&lt;/a&gt; released by WHO outlines critical actions across the care continuum, focusing on prevention, early detection of TB and comorbidities, optimized management at first contact and improved patient follow-up. The guidance also promotes better use of existing health systems, addressing shared risk factors such as overcrowding, tobacco, undernutrition and environmental pollutants. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By tackling TB determinants alongside communicable and non-communicable diseases, lung conditions, and disabilities through a unified strategy, WHO aims to reinforce the global response and drive lasting improvements in health outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On World TB Day, WHO calls on everyone: individuals, communities, societies, donors and governments, to do their part to end TB. Without concerted action from all stakeholders, the TB response will be decimated, reversing decades of progress, putting millions of lives at risk and threatening health security.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="article-content-area"&gt;&lt;p id="article-123"&gt;Richard Anthounma Jakpa, a figure who was dishonourably discharged from the army and has since carried out raids on ex-government officials; raids many have described as illegal, has become a central topic of discussion in the country.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Before the lead-up to the 2024 Election and his acquittal in the infamous ambulance trial case by the former New Patriotic Party-led government involving Dr &lt;a target="_blank" href="/GhanaHomePage/people/person.php?ID=2581"&gt;Cassiel Ato Forson&lt;/a&gt;, the current Minister of Finance, Jakpa was relatively unknown in larger political circles. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
While he was recognised by members of the &lt;a target="_blank" href="/GhanaHomePage/people/person.php?ID=3181"&gt;National Democratic Congress&lt;/a&gt; (NDC), his name was still not widely known by the general public.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
This changed with the resurfacing of the ambulance trial, which had been ongoing for some time. In July 2024, the Court of Appeal acquitted and discharged both Ato Forson and Jakpa of wrongdoing in the purchase of some ambulances under the first tenure of President &lt;a target="_blank" href="/GhanaHomePage/people/person.php?ID=1349"&gt;John Dramani Mahama&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Following this, Jakpa quickly became a known figure in political and national discussions during the electioneering period. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
He publicly declared his support for the NDC and was subsequently appointed by the party as an agent supervisor for the 2024 Election ballot printing.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
But who is Richard Jakpa, the operative who has emerged as a figure leading raids against former government officials, sparking widespread conversations and controversies?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Profile&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Richard Jakpa is a businessman, founder, and executive chairman of Las Adventuras Ltd, a civil engineering and building contracting company. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The company began as a general civil works contractor in 2009 and has since expanded its scope to become a main contractor, handling projects of various scales, including industrial and commercial developments.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Military record&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Jakpa was dishonorably discharged from the Ghana Armed Forces due to unsatisfactory conduct and acts of indiscipline. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
He was commissioned as a Lieutenant on August 21, 1998, as part of Regular Career Course Intake 38 and was initially posted to the Army Reece Regiment.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Between 2000 and 2007, Jakpa made eight unsuccessful attempts to pass the Level A PROMEX, a written promotional exam for military officers seeking advancement. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Officers primarily take this exam with the rank of Flying Officer or Flight Lieutenant, who are eligible for promotion to higher ranks.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
In addition to his failure in promotional exams, Jakpa's disciplinary record further contributed to his discharge. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Notably, in 2004, he went AWOL (Absent Without Leave), for which he was tried and charged. He was severely reprimanded, with the forfeiture of 14 days' pay.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Jakpa, among other misconducts, was sacked for unsatisfactory conduct and inefficiency in the discharge of his duties under Article 15 item 2 (a) of the GAF regulations, where inefficiency under the said regulation meant continuous lack of application and interest, as stated in the rules.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
In summary, Jakpa was released from the service in 2007. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Government appointment&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Jakpa was appointed as the Director of Special Operations at the National Security Secretariat, with his appointment taking effect on January 31, 2025.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
In this role, Jakpa oversees the planning and execution of covert and overt operations. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
His duties also include developing early warning systems for emerging threats such as terrorism, insurgency, and organised crime.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Additionally, he ensures the readiness of special forces and rapid response units, leads crisis response efforts during national security emergencies, and handles other strategic assignments from the National Security Coordinator or Chief Director.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Raids&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Since assuming office, Richard Jakpa has led raids on two high-ranking former government officials: Ken Ofori-Atta, the former Minister of Finance, and Dr. Ernest Addison, the former Governor of the Bank of Ghana.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
These raids have sparked widespread discussions about the legalities and the "Rambo-style" approaches often employed during these operations.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
He also led a raid that resulted in a bust, seizing a large, unspecified amount of US dollars and Ghanaian cedis, including counterfeit currencies, as well as gold bars hidden in twelve 20-ft shipping containers.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The containers, which were tracked to a warehouse at Sapeiman within the Ga South Municipality, were discovered as part of a special operation conducted by National Security, following a tip-off.&lt;br&gt;

Bird flu “is adapting to mammals, and it continues to show new tricks,” Nelson tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge. &lt;/em&gt;The virus is spreading widely in domestic and wild animals, while exact transmission routes remain unclear. Confirmed human cases are rising, particularly among farmworkers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1"&gt;More than &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/avian-timeline/2020s.html"&gt;two years into&lt;/a&gt; the US outbreak, we’re stuck with H5N1 for the long haul. The risk that it mutates to spread readily from person to person and that we could find ourselves in the middle of another pandemic is entrenched. As the Trump administration hacks away at scientific institutions and rapid federal changes impede the flow of information, the threat looms especially large. To mitigate those chances, animal agriculture, wildlife management, trade policy, and even cat owners may have to adapt to manage the virus on multiple fronts — indefinitely. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--block-placement _1o279nj2 _1o279nj0 duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-pullquote qnnwq0"&gt;&lt;p class="qnnwq1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup qnnwq2 _1xwtict9"&gt;It’s like “watching a train wreck in slow motion.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1"&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), along with many virologists and epidemiologists outside the agency, continue to describe the threat that the virus poses to the public as low. Yet the likelihood of an H5N1 human pandemic “is growing,” says Nelson. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1"&gt;The vast majority of the 70 confirmed human cases in the US have been mild. But since last November, at least four people have been hospitalized with H5N1 in North America (three in the US and &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2415890"&gt;one in Canada&lt;/a&gt;). In January, one person died in Louisiana after contracting the virus from a backyard poultry flock. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1"&gt;Until recently, Nelson and other bird flu experts held out hope that, with some basic interventions, the H5N1 outbreak among cows and poultry would burn itself out and that cases among wild animals might fade away, as they did during a &lt;a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/media/document/2086/file"&gt;brief 2014-2015 outbreak&lt;/a&gt;. But the latest events prove that isn’t likely. “It’s hard to imagine a scenario where it’s no longer a pandemic threat,” Nelson says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1"&gt;Since the virus was first detected in cows in March 2024, almost 1,000 dairy herds have been infected. Despite that spread, scientists saw a silver lining: for nearly the whole year, all of those cases were infections of a viral genotype called B3.13, believed to have entered the cattle population from a &lt;a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.05.01.591751v1"&gt;single spillover event in Texas&lt;/a&gt;, wherein a cow caught the virus from a wild bird. “We thought this was a one-off: one bird to one cow, and we wouldn’t see that again,” says &lt;a href="https://ghi.wisc.edu/directory/peter-halfmann/"&gt;Peter Halfmann&lt;/a&gt;, a virologist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison’s Influenza Research Institute. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1"&gt;Yet the more severe human cases are concurrent with the spread of a recently mutated, potentially more dangerous version of the virus called the D1.1 genotype. D1.1. is now circulating among wild birds and poultry, and it has &lt;a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/news/program-update/aphis-confirms-d11-genotype-dairy-cattle-nevada-0"&gt;spilled over&lt;/a&gt; into dairy cows &lt;a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/news/program-update/aphis-confirms-d11-genotype-dairy-cattle-nevada-0"&gt;at least twice&lt;/a&gt; in 2025, according milk testing data from the Agriculture Department. With D1.1, Halfmann explains that the threshold for cross-species transfer is “much lower than we previously thought.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--block-placement _1o279nj2 _1o279nj0 duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-pullquote qnnwq0"&gt;&lt;p class="qnnwq1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup qnnwq2 _1xwtict9"&gt;“There is absolutely no chance of containment, and we now have to think about mitigation and monitoring.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1"&gt;Bird flu infections have also been confirmed &lt;a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/livestock-poultry-disease/avian/avian-influenza/hpai-detections/mammals"&gt;among rats&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/avian-influenza-bird-flu/usda-reports-more-h5n1-detections-mice-and-cats"&gt;mice&lt;/a&gt; near farms. Many other wild mammals, including fox, deer, and skunks are &lt;a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/livestock-poultry-disease/avian/avian-influenza/hpai-detections/mammals"&gt;testing positive&lt;/a&gt; for the virus, but rodents are a particular concern given their notorious propensity to infest human dwellings and act as vectors of disease, says &lt;a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/faculty/3059/meghan-frost-davis"&gt;Meghan Davis&lt;/a&gt;, an epidemiologist and veterinarian at Johns Hopkins University. “When you have one of these classic reservoir hosts with highly pathogenic avian influenza, it gives you pause,” she says. “If this host could set up to be a reservoir, what implications would that have for our control strategies?” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1"&gt;It’s not yet known if mice or rats transmit the virus onward or are simply dead ends. However, research into 2023 H5N1 outbreaks &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/30/4/23-1725_article"&gt;among marine mammals&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/spotlights/ferret-study-results.html?CDC_AAref_Val=https://www.cdc.gov/flu/avianflu/spotlights/2023-2024/ferret-study-results.htm"&gt;lab experiments in ferrets&lt;/a&gt; suggest that H5N1 can spread from mammal to mammal in certain cases. And at least &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2076-0817/13/9/764"&gt;one recent study&lt;/a&gt; of rats found the virus replicates in their respiratory tract, priming the rodents to shed it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1"&gt;The good news is that there’s still been no confirmed instances of human-to-human transmission, and no human case clusters without clear ties to farmwork. These two things would signal a significant uptick in pandemic risk, Nelson says, and there’s no guarantee either will occur. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1"&gt;The bad news is that there’s ample opportunity for H5N1 to make that leap, says &lt;a href="https://med.emory.edu/departments/microbiology-immunology/research/labs/lakdawala/index.html"&gt;Seema Lakdawala&lt;/a&gt;, an epidemiologist studying avian influenza at Emory University. According to her, with multiple species acting as wild reservoirs, eradication is effectively impossible. “I think it’s endemic,” she says. And a December 2024 study, published in &lt;em&gt;Science, &lt;/em&gt;concluded that just &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adt0180"&gt;a single mutation&lt;/a&gt; could make the currently circulating H5N1 virus readily transmissible between humans. “What we’re allowing this virus to do is like 1,000 shots on goal,” Lakdawala says&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1"&gt;H5N1 has been around for decades. The virus first evolved in waterfowl like ducks and geese, but it has long been transmissible among many other types of birds including seabirds and songbirds. It was initially isolated following an outbreak in Scottish chickens &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/avian-timeline/1880-1959.html"&gt;in 1959&lt;/a&gt;. The first human infections and deaths occurred during a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/avian-timeline/1960-1999.html"&gt;1997 outbreak&lt;/a&gt; in Hong Kong. In the years since, public health authorities have contained periodic outbreaks as they’ve happened, and the worst case hasn’t materialized yet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--block-placement _1o279nj2 _1o279nj0 duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-pullquote qnnwq0"&gt;&lt;p class="qnnwq1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup qnnwq2 _1xwtict9"&gt;“If you look at the last 80 years, we’ve never seen anything like this with H5.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1"&gt;Now, though, “we’re in a whole new ballgame,” says &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/michael-t-osterholm-phd-mph"&gt;Michael T. Osterholm&lt;/a&gt;, an epidemiologist and director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota. “If you look at the last 80 years, we’ve never seen anything like this with H5.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.michigan.gov/mdhhs/inside-mdhhs/executive-staff-bios/dr-natasha-bagdasarian"&gt;Natasha Bagdasarian&lt;/a&gt;, an epidemiologist and the chief medical executive in Michigan, has been at the forefront of the state’s &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2024/06/12/h5n1-bird-flu-michigan-testing-more-animals-humans-than-other-states/"&gt;much-lauded multipronged response&lt;/a&gt; to the H5N1 outbreak. Last spring, she was hopeful that the spread could be stamped out through thoughtful communication with farmworkers and disease-monitoring strategies in just a handful of states. Less than a year on, despite the fact that new cases in Michigan dairies have stalled, that optimism is gone. “At this point, I would say there is absolutely no chance of containment, and we now have to think about mitigation and monitoring.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1"&gt;With a virus like rabies, wildlife managers will sometimes disperse an oral vaccine through food to control local outbreaks among animals. With H5N1, &lt;a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/faculty/1972/andrew-stanley-pekosz"&gt;Andrew Pekosz&lt;/a&gt;, a virologist at Johns Hopkins University, says that’s not a viable option. It’s in too many different species across too large of an area. Even if we had some readily dispersible bait that all of these animals were attracted to, there is no oral H5N1 vaccine to use. In lieu of that far-fetched hypothetical, Pekosz says mitigation means doubling down on reducing risk at the interfaces between wildlife, domestic animals, and humans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1"&gt;Backyard poultry and pets — especially cats — are vulnerable to the virus and worrying potential transmission sources to the public, says Davis. Health officials have confirmed dozens of infections in domestic cats, most recently in &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/14/nyregion/pet-cats-bird-flu-new-york-city.html"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1"&gt;In February, the CDC published, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/06/health/cdc-bird-flu-cats-people.html"&gt;deleted&lt;/a&gt;, then &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7405a2.htm"&gt;rereleased an unsettling report&lt;/a&gt; describing two instances where indoor cats in the households of dairy workers fell ill with bird flu. Out of five cats, three got sick and two died. Some people in the households, including those who had no direct exposure to farm animals or raw milk, also showed symptoms of illness. Despite layers of safety precautions, H5N1 found its way in and potentially spread from cow to human, human to cat, clothes to cat, cat to cat, or cat to human. The web of possible transmissions and infections remains unclear and unconfirmed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1"&gt;Davis advocates for pets to be &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/03/04/h5n1-avian-flu-cats-transmission-pets-companion-animals-disease-surveillance/"&gt;included in viral surveillance&lt;/a&gt; efforts. In the interim, &lt;a href="https://www.popsci.com/health/how-to-protect-your-pets-from-bird-flu/"&gt;pet owners&lt;/a&gt; should keep track of H5N1 reports in their area, be sure to always supervise pets outside, and avoid feeding animals raw milk or meat products. Those with backyard chickens or other fowl should implement hygiene measures, in &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/healthy-pets/about/backyard-poultry.html"&gt;accordance with federal&lt;/a&gt; and local guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1"&gt;Yet, for now, the biggest locus of prevention over the long term remains farms. Michigan and other states, like California — where the virus has hit about &lt;a href="https://www.cdfa.ca.gov/AHFSS/Animal_Health/HPAI.html"&gt;70 percent&lt;/a&gt; of dairies — should commit to increased and constant surveillance on farms, coupled with immediate interventions upon detection, Lakdawala says, adding, “But I think it’s going to be really hard. I don’t know if the farmers are ready for something like that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--block-placement _1o279nj2 _1o279nj0 duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-pullquote qnnwq0"&gt;&lt;p class="qnnwq1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup qnnwq2 _1xwtict9"&gt;“It’s going to be really hard. I don’t know if the farmers are ready for something like that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1"&gt;The USDA began &lt;a href="https://www.usda.gov/about-usda/news/press-releases/2024/12/06/usda-announces-new-federal-order-begins-national-milk-testing-strategy-address-h5n1-dairy-herds"&gt;requiring states&lt;/a&gt; to submit samples of raw milk for H5N1 testing last December, but that doesn’t identify individual infected cows or stop the virus from spreading among an entire herd or farm. To reduce overall human exposure to H5N1, and minimize the chances the virus makes a significant jump from cows to humans or spills back into wildlife, we need to be testing individual cows on affected farms, Lakdawala says. Such a regimen would also help scientists better understand the virus, offering a window into the number of sick cows and how the flu is spreading. The current prevailing belief is that most transmission between cows occurs via contaminated milking equipment, yet it’s important to monitor for evidence of other forms of spread, she explains, because that would mean a significant change in the virus and a rise in risk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1"&gt;Biosecurity efforts on farms should also be ramped up and sustained, Pekosz says. The types of flock containment measures that have been deployed for poultry need to be strengthened and translated to dairy cattle, he explains. “For most of the poultry industry, there is no such thing as free-range chickens.” On many farms, birds are held in closed facilities, and all people and equipment entering undergo a disinfection process: changing clothes and sanitizing boots. “A cow isn’t a bird, but the same principles can be applied,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1"&gt;Many states have already advised or mandated farms to institute new biosecurity protocols, including sanitizing vehicles and equipment, preventing contact between wildlife and farmed animals, restricting animal transport, and recommending protective equipment like masks and face shields to workers. Yet major challenges remain, says Tim Boring, director of the Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development. “The prospect of completely segregating out wildlife from dairy farms would certainly be a daunting task,” he says, adding that it would also be an expensive one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1"&gt;More wildlife testing could help farms defray costs by catching new viral mutations and trends of local spread even earlier, Pekosz says. With sufficient wildlife monitoring, farmers could hold off on the most intensive defense strategies unless and until nearby wild animals test positive. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1"&gt;Though a wildlife vaccination campaign isn’t feasible, the USDA &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; investigating the use of avian flu vaccines in &lt;a href="https://www.usda.gov/about-usda/news/press-releases/2025/02/26/usda-invests-1-billion-combat-avian-flu-and-reduce-egg-prices"&gt;poultry&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/news/agency-announcements/usda-builds-actions-protect-livestock-public-health-h5n1-avian-influenza"&gt;cows&lt;/a&gt;. Despite some countries already vaccinating poultry, the US has so far avoided the practice as many trade partners ban imports of vaccinated birds. Moving forward, global trade agreements will likely &lt;a href="https://www.woah.org/en/avian-influenza-vaccination-why-it-should-not-be-a-barrier-to-safe-trade/"&gt;require renegotiation&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1"&gt;It’s a good sign that the US is seriously considering vaccines, Halfmann says, but he warns that any vaccination effort will require sustained investment to be effective. “We can’t have one season where we vaccinate and then stop. This is a long-term endeavor that we’re going to have to go through that’s going to cost money and require buy-in from farmers. It’s a lot of hurdles.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--block-placement _1o279nj2 _1o279nj0 duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-pullquote qnnwq0"&gt;&lt;p class="qnnwq1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup qnnwq2 _1xwtict9"&gt;“It’s hard to imagine a scenario where it’s no longer a pandemic threat.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1"&gt;An animal vaccine would need to be regularly assessed and updated to keep pace with viral mutations, just like the seasonal human flu has historically been, he explains. Given that the Food and Drug Administration is now helmed by &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(24)02603-5/fulltext"&gt;prominent&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00709-9"&gt;anti-vaxxer&lt;/a&gt; Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and that the agency recently &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/26/us/politics/fda-flu-vaccine.html"&gt;canceled a meeting&lt;/a&gt; for the seasonal flu vaccine selection process without explanation, Halfmann is skeptical that the federal government is up to the task. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1"&gt;He’s not the only one. While the virus is evolving quickly, so are US regulatory agencies. Lakdawala says there are fewer updates on federal efforts around H5N1. Until recently, Davis participated in regular small group briefings with the CDC, where governmental and nongovernmental experts would share data and insights on the virus. Now, she says those meetings have completely stopped. “What’s been most concerning to me is the lack of communication,” she says. “The backbone of outbreak response is communication.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1"&gt;Without up-to-date information, virologists, epidemiologists, and state public health officials are left in the dark, with little to guide their science or policy. At the same time, research institutions are facing real and threatened major budget cuts and are enacting extensive layoffs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1"&gt;“We are flirting with a massive global pandemic that could be equal to or greater than COVID-19,” Nelson says; yet, all the knowledge and tools we built during the pandemic aren’t being harnessed. It feels, she adds, like “watching a train wreck in slow motion.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="b1p9676 _1f7jm892 _1f7jm890 _1f7jm896"&gt;&lt;a class="duet--article--comments-link b1p9679" href="/science/632605/forever-war-with-bird-flu#comments"&gt;&lt;span class="coral-count" data-coral-id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6NjMyNjA1" data-coral-url="https://www.theverge.com/science/632605/forever-war-with-bird-flu"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Verge</author><pubDate>Thu, 20 Mar 2025 13:35:53 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMic0FVX3lxTE4wR1djTGFJMDAyMmNzdDVsa3FEMEU2UVF3amg3QjkxUGFiV0VBa2czRUttbFllTkY3TkxQM0FEV1gtcW9hb0RVZ2FDaXp4ZDBqU0FQc2NIblc2S2V5RzBlZ2ZiUGV1NVVRSllJQUlxMXVhZVE</guid></item><item><title>Earlier Suspected Measles Cases Now Confirmed - MyMotherLode.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinwFBVV95cUxNMjNTXzFBZC1HellkRmZiblRjengxU0JjTmp5TlBTODNWdHByM3NsNWQ2T1M0TlMzZEdmY3hJT2pxbmlFVW5UaDdDMkl3NXU4a0Y0SlVTZ1FFRjRkRDFCVTdFZlMtcy1SRzBfcTdQcDBtZGp2WjBtLWFvTWdFeDBxd1BLZUpsM1c3MnpRWlgwMTg1SmNETVB1dGxwWnBRQjA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article id="post-3665659" class="post-3665659 post type-post status-publish format-standard has-post-thumbnail  category-local category-uncategorized tag-health tag-top-stories single-post-content"&gt;

										&lt;p&gt;Sonora, CA — What was originally reported as being two suspected measles cases in Tuolumne County, is now two confirmed positive cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Tuolumne County Public Health Department reports that it is an adult and a child from the same household who had recently traveled internationally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Public Health is actively working to identify and contact those who may have been exposed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We understand that there may be a lot of questions and concerns,” says Tuolumne County Public Health Director Michelle Jachetta. “The investigation is still ongoing, and we will provide updates as they are available. We want to remind the public that measles is a highly contagious disease and to take steps to protect yourself and your family by ensuring current vaccination status for measles, monitoring for symptoms, and staying home when you feel sick.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Public Health Department reports that the vaccination status of the two positive cases is unconfirmed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior to the two cases in Tuolumne County, there had only been five confirmed cases of measles in California this year. &lt;a href="https://www.mymotherlode.com/news/local/3659548/suspected-measles-cases-involving-summerville-high-and-ahs.html"&gt;We reported earlier&lt;/a&gt; that public health was investigating possible exposure at Summerville High and Adventist Health Sonora.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More details on measles from the California Department of Public Health &lt;a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/OPA/Pages/Communications-Toolkits/Measles.aspx"&gt;can be found here. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="article-content-area"&gt;&lt;p id="article-123"&gt;Richard Jakpa, a figure who was dishonourably discharged from the army and has since carried out raids on ex-government officials; raids many have described as illegal, has become a central topic of discussion in the country.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
In the lead-up to the 2024 Election and his acquittal in the infamous ambulance trial case by the former New Patriotic Party-led government involving Dr &lt;a target="_blank" href="/GhanaHomePage/people/person.php?ID=2581"&gt;Cassiel Ato Forson&lt;/a&gt;, the current Minister of Finance, Jakpa was relatively unknown in larger political circles. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
While he was recognised by members of the &lt;a target="_blank" href="/GhanaHomePage/people/person.php?ID=3181"&gt;National Democratic Congress&lt;/a&gt; (NDC), his name was still not widely known by the general public.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
This changed with the resurfacing of the ambulance trial, which had been ongoing for some time. In July 2024, the Court of Appeal acquitted and discharged both Ato Forson and Jakpa of wrongdoing in the purchase of some ambulances under the first tenure of President &lt;a target="_blank" href="/GhanaHomePage/people/person.php?ID=1349"&gt;John Dramani Mahama&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Following this, Jakpa quickly became a known figure in political and national discussions during the electioneering period. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
He publicly declared his support for the NDC and was subsequently appointed by the party as an agent supervisor for the 2024 Election ballot printing.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
But who is Richard Jakpa, the operative who has emerged as a figure leading raids against former government officials, sparking widespread conversations and controversies?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Profile&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Richard Jakpa is a businessman, founder, and executive chairman of Las Adventuras Ltd, a civil engineering and building contracting company. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The company began as a general civil works contractor in 2009 and has since expanded its scope to become a main contractor, handling projects of various scales, including industrial and commercial developments.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Military record&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Jakpa was dishonorably discharged from the Ghana Armed Forces due to unsatisfactory conduct and acts of indiscipline. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
He was commissioned as a Lieutenant on August 21, 1998, as part of Regular Career Course Intake 38 and was initially posted to the Army Reece Regiment.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Between 2000 and 2007, Jakpa made eight unsuccessful attempts to pass the Level A PROMEX, a written promotional exam for military officers seeking advancement. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Officers primarily take this exam with the rank of Flying Officer or Flight Lieutenant, who are eligible for promotion to higher ranks.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
In addition to his failure in promotional exams, Jakpa's disciplinary record further contributed to his discharge. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Notably, in 2004, he went AWOL (Absent Without Leave), for which he was tried and charged. He was severely reprimanded, with the forfeiture of 14 days' pay.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Jakpa, among other misconducts, was sacked for unsatisfactory conduct and inefficiency in the discharge of his duties under Article 15 item 2 (a) of the GAF regulations, where inefficiency under the said regulation meant continuous lack of application and interest, as stated in the rules.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
In summary, Jakpa was released from the service in 2007. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Government appointment&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Jakpa was appointed as the Director of Special Operations at the National Security Secretariat, with his appointment taking effect on January 31, 2025.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
In this role, Jakpa oversees the planning and execution of covert and overt operations. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
His duties also include developing early warning systems for emerging threats such as terrorism, insurgency, and organised crime.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Additionally, he ensures the readiness of special forces and rapid response units, leads crisis response efforts during national security emergencies, and handles other strategic assignments from the National Security Coordinator or Chief Director.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Raids&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Since assuming office, Richard Jakpa has led raids on two high-ranking former government officials: Ken Ofori-Atta, the former Minister of Finance, and Dr. Ernest Addison, the former Governor of the Bank of Ghana.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
These raids have sparked widespread discussions about the legalities and the "Rambo-style" approaches often employed during these operations.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
He also led a raid that resulted in a bust, seizing a large, unspecified amount of US dollars and Ghanaian cedis, including counterfeit currencies, as well as gold bars hidden in twelve 20-ft shipping containers.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The containers, which were tracked to a warehouse at Sapeiman within the Ga South Municipality, were discovered as part of a special operation conducted by National Security, following a tip-off.&lt;br&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;The pursuit of a cure for  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="154970" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; disease is becoming an increasingly competitive and contentious quest with recent years witnessing several important controversies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In July 2022, &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/potential-fabrication-research-images-threatens-key-theory-alzheimers-disease"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt; magazine&lt;/a&gt; reported that a key &lt;a href="https://doi.org/doi:10.1038/nature04533"&gt;2006 research paper, published in the prestigious journal &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which identified a subtype of brain protein called beta-amyloid as the cause of Alzheimer's, may have been based on fabricated data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One year earlier, in June 2021, the &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/postmarket-drug-safety-information-patients-and-providers/aducanumab-marketed-aduhelm-information"&gt;US Food and Drug Administration had approved aducanumab&lt;/a&gt;, an antibody-targeting beta-amyloid, as a treatment for Alzheimer's, even though the data supporting its use were incomplete and contradictory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some physicians believe aducanumab never should have been approved, while others maintain it should be given a chance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With millions of people needing an effective treatment, why are researchers still fumbling in this quest for a cure for what is arguably one of the most important diseases confronting humankind?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_142437" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-142437" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/AmyloidPlaquesAmongNeurons_R_U_642-642x500.jpg" alt="Clumps of yellow forming among purple neurons" class="size-medium wp-image-142437" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/AmyloidPlaquesAmongNeurons_R_U_642-642x500.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/AmyloidPlaquesAmongNeurons_R_U_642-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/AmyloidPlaquesAmongNeurons_R_U_642-768x598.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/AmyloidPlaquesAmongNeurons_R_U_642-600x467.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/AmyloidPlaquesAmongNeurons_R_U_642.jpg 1204w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-142437" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Illustration of beta-amyloid plaques (yellow) amongst neurons. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MADq3tpYQR4/"&gt;Science Photo Library/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Escaping the beta-amyloid rut&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For years, scientists have been focused on trying to come up with new treatments for Alzheimer's &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2020.11.192"&gt;by preventing the formation of brain-damaging clumps of this mysterious protein&lt;/a&gt; called beta-amyloid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, we scientists have arguably got ourselves into a bit of an intellectual rut concentrating almost exclusively on this approach, often neglecting or even ignoring other possible explanations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regrettably, this dedication to studying the abnormal protein clumps has not translated into a useful drug or therapy. The need for a new "out-of-the-clump" way of thinking about Alzheimer's is emerging as a top priority in brain science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My laboratory at the Krembil Brain Institute, part of the University Health Network in Toronto, is devising a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/trc2.12283"&gt;new theory of Alzheimer's disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on our past 30 years of research, we no longer think of Alzheimer's as primarily a disease of the brain. Rather, we believe that Alzheimer's is principally &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.2174/1567205018666211202141650"&gt;a disorder of the immune system within the brain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The immune system, found in every organ in the body, is a collection of cells and molecules that work in harmony to help repair injuries and protect from foreign invaders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a person trips and falls, the immune system helps to mend the damaged tissues. When someone experiences a viral or bacterial infection, the immune system helps in the fight against these microbial invaders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exact same processes are present in the brain. When there is head trauma, the brain's immune system kicks into gear to help repair. When bacteria are present in the brain, the immune system is there to fight back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_144645" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-144645" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/WhiteBloodCellsImmuneSystem642.jpg" alt="Bright green cells with orange spots in between them" class="size-full wp-image-144645" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/WhiteBloodCellsImmuneSystem642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/WhiteBloodCellsImmuneSystem642-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/WhiteBloodCellsImmuneSystem642-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-144645" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;White blood cells of the immune system activated to fight a bacterial infection. Green shows expression of molecules in their surfaces, and orange shows synthesis of molecules inside the cells. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MAC8pLP43hw/"&gt;Dlumen/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Alzheimer's as autoimmune disease&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We believe that beta-amyloid is not an abnormally produced protein, but rather is a normally occurring molecule that is part of the brain's immune system. It is supposed to be there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When brain trauma occurs or when bacteria are present in the brain, beta-amyloid is a key contributor to the brain's comprehensive immune response. And this is where the problem begins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of striking similarities between the fat molecules that make up both the membranes of bacteria and the membranes of brain cells, beta-amyloid cannot tell the difference between invading bacteria and host brain cells, and mistakenly attacks the very brain cells it is supposed to be protecting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This leads to a chronic, progressive loss of brain cell function, which ultimately culminates in dementia – all because our body's immune system cannot differentiate between bacteria and brain cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When regarded as a misdirected attack by the brain's immune system on the very organ it is supposed to be defending, Alzheimer's disease emerges as an autoimmune disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many types of autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, in which autoantibodies play a crucial role in the development of the disease, and for which steroid-based therapies can be effective. But these therapies will not work against Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brain is a very special and distinctive organ, recognized as &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK234155/#"&gt;the most complex structure in the Universe&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_144646" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-144646" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/OlderCoupleReadingABookTogether642.jpg" alt="A senior man and woman looking at a book together" class="size-full wp-image-144646" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/OlderCoupleReadingABookTogether642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/OlderCoupleReadingABookTogether642-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/OlderCoupleReadingABookTogether642-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-144646" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Alzheimer's is arguably one of the most important diseases confronting humankind. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MAD5TsR1koQ/"&gt;Robert Kneschke/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In our model of Alzheimer's, beta-amyloid helps to protect and bolster our immune system, but unfortunately, it also plays a central role in the autoimmune process that, we believe, may lead to the development of Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though drugs conventionally used in the treatment of autoimmune diseases may not work against Alzheimer's, we strongly believe that targeting other immune-regulating pathways in the brain will lead us to new and effective treatment approaches for the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Other theories of the disease&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to this autoimmune theory of Alzheimer's, many other new and varied theories are beginning to appear. For example, some scientists believe that &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mito.2022.05.001"&gt;Alzheimer's is a disease of tiny cellular structures called mitochondria&lt;/a&gt; – the energy factories in every brain cell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mitochondria convert oxygen from the air we breathe and glucose from the food we eat into the energy required for remembering and thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some maintain that it is the end-result of a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.4103/1673-5374.339476"&gt;particular brain infection&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/prd.12429"&gt;bacteria from the mouth often being suggested as the culprit&lt;/a&gt;. Still others suggest that the disease may arise from an &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/biom12050714"&gt;abnormal handling of metals within the brain&lt;/a&gt;, possibly zinc, copper, or iron.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is gratifying to see &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/jnnp-2021-327370"&gt;new thinking about this age-old disease&lt;/a&gt;. Dementia currently affects more than 50 million people worldwide, with a new diagnosis being made every three seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often, people living with Alzheimer's disease are unable to recognize their own children or even their spouse of more than 50 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer's is a public health crisis in need of innovative ideas and fresh directions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_144650" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-144650" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/YoungPersonKissingASeniorLadyOnTheCheek642.jpg" alt="A young person kissing an older lady on the cheek" class="size-full wp-image-144650" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/YoungPersonKissingASeniorLadyOnTheCheek642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/YoungPersonKissingASeniorLadyOnTheCheek642-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/YoungPersonKissingASeniorLadyOnTheCheek642-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-144650" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Often, people living with Alzheimer's disease are unable to recognize their own children.
