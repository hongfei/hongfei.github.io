(Unsplash/Representative image)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p id="readMoreFTUser"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Taking to Instagram, Dr Sumit Kapadia, who, according to his bio, is a vascular surgeon and varicose vein specialist, wrote that most people assume that hitting their step goal in the evening cancels out a sedentary workday, but he explained that the body doesn’t work that way. Dr Kapadia said that even if someone achieves their daily 10,000 steps, spending the entire day desk-bound from 9 am to 7 pm still harms circulation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="mt-10 mb-10 htEchoRecirculationWidget"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="mt10 mb10 htEchoArticlePromo"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="predictorShow mb20" data-vars-predictor="true" data-vars-quiz="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="quizShow mb20" data-vars-minimized="false" data-vars-predictor="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“This is something I tell my patients almost every day. You can hit your step goal in the evening…but if you’ve been desk-bound from 9 AM to 7 PM, your veins have already taken the damage,” he wrote in the caption of his Instagram post.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Dr Kapadia explained that vein health depends less on the total distance walked and more on how often a person moves throughout the day. “Circulation doesn’t depend on how much you walk. It depends on how often you move,” he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the doctor, prolonged sitting leads to blood stagnation, weakening of vein valves, swelling, and a higher risk of varicose veins and even blood clots. The damage, he said, begins long before people lace up their shoes for an evening walk.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Even a healthy step count cannot reverse 10 hours of immobility,” he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr Kapadia urged people to break long sedentary stretches by standing up every hour, stretching, walking briefly and engaging the calf muscles, which he described as the body’s “peripheral heart” due to their key role in supporting blood flow.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Tiny breaks. Huge difference. Your veins don’t need marathons. They need movement,” he concluded.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Social media reactions&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reacting to the post, one user wrote, “I think I’m already facing the consequences.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“On average, how long should you be sitting and standing per day to achieve the best health?” asked another.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I was sitting for almost 10-11 hours and my side hips, lower back pains alot also i cant walk and stand for longer time. thankfully i have left the job,” shared a third user, urging others to prioritise health before it's too late.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Hindustan Times</author><pubDate>Sun, 23 Nov 2025 16:23:06 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>为什么自身免疫性疾病在50岁后急剧上升-华尔街日报</title><link>https://www.wsj.com/health/wellness/autoimmune-diseases-increase-age-41733014</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Wall Street Journal</author><pubDate>Sun, 23 Nov 2025 15:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigwFBVV95cUxPdjR6T1ItbnpYY1JQNFozd0hmUjh4TzVOR0ltd0cyTTVCVVNwOElXUVIyUXA2TlVhWlpvcDlpZjRMOXhOZjFmZjc2NDI2RVFiT1ZBeDdlWmVnemtNbXl0c3BNRWRkRmozVEVnSm1EY0ViTjZWQTZqQlVKdzVJa3NTM1VKcw</guid></item><item><title>更好的睡眠对心脏健康：饭后立即步行15分钟的五大好处-印度时报</title><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/better-sleep-to-heart-health-top-5-benefits-of-walking-for-15-minutes-right-after-meals/photostory/125518685.cms</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="COQxt" data-ua-type="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most powerful benefits of a 15‑minute walk after eating is its ability to blunt the post-meal glucose spike. Research shows that even brief, moderate-intensity walking shortly after a meal can significantly reduce blood sugar peaks.&lt;br&gt;An American Diabetes Association &lt;a href="https://diabetesjournals.org/care/article/36/10/3262/30770/Three-15-min-Bouts-of-Moderate-Postmeal-Walking"&gt;study &lt;/a&gt;conducted on older adults at risk of impaired glucose tolerance found that 15 minutes of walking, done 30 minutes after each meal, was just as effective in improving 24-hour glycemic control as a single 45‑minute walk. &lt;br&gt;These findings suggest that the timing plays a key role, i.e., walking soon after eating makes the muscles take up more glucose for energy, helping reduce the sugar circulating in your blood. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Sun, 23 Nov 2025 14:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>增强一种蛋白质有助于大脑保护自己免受阿尔茨海默氏症的侵害- ScienceDaily</title><link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/11/251123085550.htm</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p id="first" class="lead"&gt;Researchers at Baylor College of Medicine have identified a natural process in the brain that can remove existing amyloid plaques in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease while also helping preserve memory and thinking ability. This process relies on astrocytes, star shaped support cells, which can be guided to clear out the toxic plaque buildup commonly seen in Alzheimer's. When the team increased the amount of Sox9, a protein that influences many astrocyte functions during aging, the cells became more effective at removing amyloid deposits. The findings, reported in &lt;em&gt;Nature Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;, suggest that strengthening astrocyte activity could one day help slow cognitive decline linked to neurodegenerative disorders.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Astrocytes perform diverse tasks that are essential for normal brain function, including facilitating brain communications and memory storage. As the brain ages, astrocytes show profound functional alterations; however, the role these alterations play in aging and neurodegeneration is not yet understood," said first author Dr. Dong-Joo Choi, who conducted this work while at the Center for Cell and Gene Therapy and the Department of Neurosurgery at Baylor. Choi is now an assistant professor at the Center for Neuroimmunology and Glial Biology, Institute of Molecular Medicine at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focusing on Sox9 as a Key Regulator&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this project, the investigators set out to understand how astrocytes change with age and how those changes relate to Alzheimer's disease. Their attention centered on Sox9, a protein that influences a wide network of genes involved in astrocyte aging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We manipulated the expression of the Sox9 gene to assess its role in maintaining astrocyte function in the aging brain and in Alzheimer's disease models," explained corresponding author Dr. Benjamin Deneen, professor and Dr. Russell J. and Marian K. Blattner Chair in the Department of Neurosurgery, director of the Center for Cancer Neuroscience, member of the Dan L Duncan Comprehensive Cancer Center at Baylor and principal investigator at the Jan and Dan Duncan Neurological Research Institute at Texas Children's Hospital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Testing the Approach in Symptomatic Alzheimer's Models&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"An important point of our experimental design is that we worked with mouse models of Alzheimer's disease that had already developed cognitive impairment, such as memory deficits, and had amyloid plaques in the brain," Choi said. "We believe these models are more relevant to what we see in many patients with Alzheimer's disease symptoms than other models in which these types of experiments are conducted before the plaques form."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In these models, the researchers either increased or removed Sox9 and then monitored each mouse's cognitive performance for six months. During this period, the animals were tested on their ability to recognize familiar objects and locations. After the behavioral studies were completed, the team examined the brains to measure plaque accumulation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Higher Sox9 Levels Improve Plaque Removal and Memory&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results showed a clear difference. Lowering Sox9 led to faster plaque buildup, reduced structural complexity in astrocytes and diminished plaque clearing. Raising Sox9 had the opposite effect, increasing the cells' activity, supporting plaque removal and preserving cognitive performance. The protective benefits suggested that strong astrocyte engagement may help slow the cognitive decline associated with neurodegenerative disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We found that increasing Sox9 expression triggered astrocytes to ingest more amyloid plaques, clearing them from the brain like a vacuum cleaner," Deneen said. "Most current treatments focus on neurons or try to prevent the formation of amyloid plaques. This study suggests that enhancing astrocytes' natural ability to clean up could be just as important."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Future Potential and Ongoing Research Needs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Choi, Deneen and their colleagues note that additional research is needed to understand how Sox9 behaves in the human brain across time. Still, these results point toward the possibility of developing therapies that harness astrocytes' natural cleaning abilities to combat neurodegenerative disorders.&lt;/p&gt;

Or maybe you ate more dessert than felt comfortable at a family gathering. We’ve all been there. But then the inevitable happens. You wake up the next morning feeling not so great and maybe a little anxious and guilty. And you’re wondering what to do next.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While you may have the overwhelming urge to restrict calories, cut out carbs or resort to an expensive cleanse, dietitians recommend you let it go and get back into your regular routine. There is no need to take any extreme measures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/amazon-black-friday-deals-2025-11833194" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The 56 Best Amazon Black Friday Deals Start at Just $4: Brooks, All-Clad, Vitamix and More Top Brands ;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;The 56 Best Amazon Black Friday Deals Start at Just $4: Brooks, All-Clad, Vitamix and More Top Brands &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The First Thing You Should Do&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;You might think the best way to recover from a sugar-filled night is to double down on rigid food rules. But with that approach, you can really get caught in a vicious cycle. Instead, let it go and get back to your regularly scheduled programming!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Resist the urge to “undo” the sugar with more restriction, says &lt;a href="https://revvhealth.com/about/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Marissa Beck, M.S., RDN;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Marissa Beck, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;. “Get back into a routine with ample self-care, tune into hunger and fullness cues, and aim for regular meals and snacks that include all macronutrients,” she says. If you focus on balance and nourishing your body, you can get on with the show in a way that supports your physical and mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What’s the first step you should take? Start your day with a nourishing protein- and fiber-rich breakfast to set the tone.

Eating a nutrient-dense breakfast that’s rich in protein and fiber supports &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/simple-ways-to-keep-blood-sugar-in-check-11791785" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:balanced blood sugar;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;balanced blood sugar&lt;/a&gt; and will keep you feeling energized and ready to take on the day. It can also prevent cravings and overeating later in the day so you don’t repeat the same cycle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, aim to eat balanced meals and snacks for the rest of the day. Skipping meals in an attempt to compensate for overeating can backfire. When you deprive your body of the nutrition it needs, it may respond by ramping up hunger hormones, which may lead to eating more later in the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To stay consistent, Beck suggests a midmorning snack of strained strained (Greek-style) yogurt with berries, nuts and chia seeds. Lunch could be a fiber-filled grain bowl like this 10-minute &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/263359/buffalo-chicken-grain-bowl/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Buffalo Chicken Grain Bowl;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Buffalo Chicken Grain Bowl&lt;/a&gt;. If you’re hungry between lunch and dinner, have an afternoon snack like our satisfying &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/7913705/chickpea-snack-salad/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Chickpea Snack Salad;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Chickpea Snack Salad&lt;/a&gt;.

Restriction leads to bingeing, and bingeing leads to restricting. Give yourself some grace, eat a balanced meal and put a stop to the binge-restrict cycle before it starts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I often tie this back into the broader picture of developing a healthy relationship with food,” says &lt;a href="https://www.lextalknutrition.com/philosophy" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Alexis Silver, M.P.H., RDN;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Alexis Silver, M.P.H., RDN&lt;/a&gt;. “At some points in your life, you’re going to eat more sugar, sodium or fat. But your overall habits and lifestyle choices are what really determine your health. We’re all human!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Other Tips &amp;amp; Strategies&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to nourishing your body and eating regular meals and snacks, there are other things you can do to alleviate any unpleasant physical or emotional symptoms. These strategies can help you get back on track and move on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Go for a walk.&lt;/strong&gt; “It will help lower your blood sugar and clear your head,” says &lt;a href="https://www.soundbitesnutrition.com/about-lisa" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Lisa Andrews, M.Ed., RD, LD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Lisa Andrews, M.Ed., RD, LD&lt;/a&gt;. “One night of overindulgence won't destroy your health, but moving your body may improve your mood if you feel crappy after too much sugar.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stay hydrated. &lt;/strong&gt;While there’s nothing magical about drinking water, and it doesn’t negate sugar, it is important for digestion and overall health. You might be feeling &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7921422/why-bloating-can-be-normal-healthy-according-to-a-dietitian/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:bloated;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;bloated&lt;/a&gt; or sluggish. “Oftentimes this sluggish feeling is due to dehydration and less an effect of the sugar consumption,” says &lt;a href="https://www.arugalyssa.com/about" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Alyssa Smolen, M.S., RDN, CDN;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Alyssa Smolen, M.S., RDN, CDN&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be kind to yourself and get curious. &lt;/strong&gt;It's important to remember that no foods are good or bad, and that you don't need to feel shame about what or how much you eat. Eating isn't a moral or shameful act. This will help you learn from your experience. What was going on that caused you to eat that much sugar? Were you having a rough day? Were you bored? Was the ice cream just tasting too good? Answering these questions creates self-awareness and prepares you to make a different choice the next time you’re in a similar situation. It may be helpful to talk to a healthcare provider if you consistently have binge-eating episodes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Our Expert Take&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eating too much sugar happens to all of us. But there’s no need to panic or punish yourself the next day. Skip the restrictive diets and cleanses. Instead, focus on getting back to your regular routine with balanced meals, staying hydrated and moving your body. Acknowledge the moment with kindness, reflect on what happened and let it go. Your health is determined by your overall habits, not one sugary night.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-to-do-if-you-ate-too-much-sugar-last-night-11846839" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:EatingWell;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;EatingWell&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Sun, 23 Nov 2025 13:41:41 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidkFVX3lxTE1Xb01xN0MtaEFLQjRWcjlTMWg0Z1VkS2JaQmRLXzVoblhfZlVYb056eFM5SXRKTGxOSXAzajF4SzFJaXdMdjFrMTJ1VmlyajVDWkxFR2t6QUJfa0RwYjZqRDhoazhsdVdvdFlZWDRpN0xHWHB2aFE</guid></item><item><title>TOP DOC揭示的4种早期癌症检测测试-印度时报</title><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/4-tests-for-early-cancer-detection-as-revealed-by-top-doc/photostory/125517401.cms</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="COQxt" data-ua-type="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Genetic testing looks for inherited mutations in cancer‑predisposition genes such as BRCA1/2, TP53, and others that dramatically raise lifetime risk of breast, ovarian, colorectal and many other &lt;a href="https://www.facingourrisk.org/XRAY/NCCN-update-HCEG-HBOPP"&gt;cancers&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike imaging or blood tests, this is usually done once (or a few times) in life, and can reveal risk long before any cells become precancerous, allowing screening and prevention to start earlier and be more intensive. Updated expert guidelines now advise broader use of hereditary cancer testing, including considering testing for anyone diagnosed with certain cancers under age 55 and for people with strong family histories or known syndromes like hereditary breast–ovarian–pancreatic or hereditary colorectal–endometrial–gastric cancer syndromes. When a mutation is found, doctors can tailor a risk‑reduction plan: for example, starting MRI breast screening at a younger age, doing annual colonoscopy, adding whole‑body MRI in some syndromes, or discussing preventive medications and, in selected cases, risk‑reducing surgery. Genetic information also helps family members, who can be tested and offered intensified screening before disease appears.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Sun, 23 Nov 2025 12:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>60年后，糖尿病药物意外影响大脑- ScienceAlert</title><link>https://www.sciencealert.com/after-60-years-diabetes-drug-found-to-unexpectedly-affect-the-brain</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metformin"&gt;Metformin&lt;/a&gt; has been prescribed to people with type 2  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="182061" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; to manage blood sugar for more than 60 years, but scientists haven't been exactly sure how it works. A recent study suggests it works directly in the brain, which could lead to new types of treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers from the Baylor College of Medicine in the US identified a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_pathway"&gt;brain pathway&lt;/a&gt; that the drug seems to work through, in addition to the effects it has on biological processes in other areas of the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's been widely accepted that metformin lowers blood glucose primarily by reducing glucose output &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1120781"&gt;in the liver&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1476-5381.1994.tb13128.x"&gt;Other studies&lt;/a&gt; have found that it acts through the gut," &lt;a href="https://www.bcm.edu/news/how-does-metformin-lower-blood-sugar"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Makoto Fukuda, a pathophysiologist at Baylor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We looked into the brain as it is widely recognized as a key regulator of whole-body glucose metabolism. We investigated whether and how the brain contributes to the anti-diabetic effects of metformin."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-diabetes-pill-works-as-well-as-ozempic-for-weight-loss-trial-finds"&gt;New Diabetes Pill Works as Well as Ozempic For Weight Loss, Trial Finds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1172/jci.insight.142545"&gt;Previous work&lt;/a&gt; by some of the same researchers had identified a protein in the brain called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rap1"&gt;Rap1&lt;/a&gt; as having an impact on glucose metabolism, particularly in a part of the brain called the ventromedial hypothalamus or (VMH).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In their 2025 study, tests on mice showed metformin traveling to the VMH, where it helps tackle &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/soups-and-shakes-diet-can-put-type-2-diabetes-into-remission-study-finds"&gt;type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt; by essentially turning off Rap1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watch the clip below for a summary of their findings;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the researchers bred mice without Rap1, metformin then had no impact &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-distinct-new-form-of-diabetes-is-officially-recognized"&gt;on a diabetes-like condition&lt;/a&gt; – even though other drugs did. It's strong evidence that metformin works in the brain, through a different mechanism than other drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_182622" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-182622" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Computer-artwork-of-the-brain-showing-the-hypothalamus-red-642x361.jpg" alt="Computer artwork of the brain in bright blue on a black background, with one small red section " class="size-medium wp-image-182622" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Computer-artwork-of-the-brain-showing-the-hypothalamus-red-642x361.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Computer-artwork-of-the-brain-showing-the-hypothalamus-red-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Computer-artwork-of-the-brain-showing-the-hypothalamus-red-600x338.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Computer-artwork-of-the-brain-showing-the-hypothalamus-red.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-182622" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Computer artwork of the brain showing the hypothalamus (red).

It works by reducing the glucose produced by the liver and increasing how efficiently the body uses insulin, helping to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/time-restricted-eating-helps-control-blood-sugar-in-type-2-diabetes"&gt;manage the symptoms&lt;/a&gt; of type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now we know it very probably works through the brain, as well as the liver and the gut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clearly, this needs to be shown in human studies as well, but once that's established, we might be able to find ways to boost metformin's effects and make it more potent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-642x337.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-181305" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-642x337.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-768x403.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-600x315.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/breakthrough-diabetes-treatment-may-deliver-insulin-through-a-skin-cream"&gt;Breakthrough Diabetes Treatment May Deliver Insulin Through a Skin Cream&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This also ties into other interesting studies that have found the same drug can &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/common-diabetes-medication-slows-brain-aging-in-monkeys"&gt;slow brain aging&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/common-diabetes-drug-linked-to-exceptional-longevity-in-women"&gt;improve lifespan&lt;/a&gt;.

We spoke with doctors to find out:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brain Changes To Expect Once You Hit Your 50s&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In your 50s, your brain is already shrinking. “The cortex ― outer layer of the brain ― becomes thinner, the myelin sheath surrounding the fibers of neurons may begin to degrade, and receptors don’t fire as quickly,” explained &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/staff/14072-dylan-wint" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Dylan Wint" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="691f82fce4b047290e295ebf" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/staff/14072-dylan-wint" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="1"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr. Dylan Wint&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, a neurologist and neuropsychiatrist at the Cleveland Clinic.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;That being said, most people are still pretty sharp in their 50s — but they may start to notice some changes in their cognition. “In your 50s, cognitive functions such as on-demand recall of names and numbers, processing speed, rapid task-switching and spatial skills can diminish,” Wint said. “This tends to continue in the decades ahead.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;More noticeably, during this time you might see a subtle decline in what is called episodic memory, or “the mental diary that includes ‘meta-tags,’ such as who was present at a meeting last week and on what day that meeting was held,” Wint said. “On the upside, other facets of cognition, such as moral judgment, wisdom and emotional regulation, usually continue to improve during this period.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.apollohealthco.com/dr-bredesen/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Dale Bredesen" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="691f82fce4b047290e295ebf" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.apollohealthco.com/dr-bredesen/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr. Dale Bredesen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;a neuroscience researcher at the Pacific Neuroscience Institute, added that hormonal changes can contribute to cognitive changes as well. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“In our 50s, hormonal changes due to menopause in women, and andropause in men, typically occur,” he said. “Cognitive decline can occur due to a sudden drop in hormones, such as the drop in estradiol associated with menopause. People often find more fat accumulation in the 50s as well, which is associated with cognitive decline.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;As you enter your 60s, Wint said, brain shrinkage becomes more noticeable. “Although you retain your lifetime of accumulated knowledge, your brain becomes less efficient at accessing that knowledge and adding to it,” he explained.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Bredesen noted that issues that are more likely to pop up in your 60s, such as heart disease and chronic inflammation, can further contribute to cognitive decline. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Thomas Barwick via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Thomas Barwick via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;Your brain shrinks as you get older, but exercise and other healthy habits can keep it as sharp as possible.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Normal Signs Of An Aging Brain — And When To Worry&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It’s normal to experience some cognitive decline as we age. But when is forgetfulness a sign of something more serious? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“The most prominent effect of typical aging is probably the slowing of mental processes, particularly coming up with names, switching tasks, changing ingrained habits and incorporating new information,” Wint said. “Our brains usually compensate for these changes, so we can still function robustly and independently.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Cognitive decline becomes concerning when it starts to interfere with daily functioning. “This is never normal, and is formally called dementia,” Wint said. “However, in between typical cognitive aging and dementia is a zone of mild cognitive impairment (MCI), where cognition is not normal for age — formal testing may be necessary to detect this — but does not interfere with routine daily activities. About 50% of people with MCI will progress to develop dementia over the next three to five years.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If you are experiencing forgetfulness, trouble with communication, or other symptoms that concern you, Wint suggested that you consider a consultation with a geriatrician or neurologist. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“It doesn’t mean you have Alzheimer’s disease or another type of dementia, but a specialist can help to narrow down the cause and any potential treatments or lifestyle changes that may be helpful,” he said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How To Keep Your Brain Healthy As You Age&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;While there’s not a lot that can be done about the natural brain shrinkage that comes with aging, both Wint and Bredesen emphasized that lifestyle can make a huge difference for your brain.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Exercise has the largest effect on brain health,” Wint said. “Regular, moderate aerobic exercise reduces the risk of cognitive decline. It’s also important to stay connected as we age, as a rich in-person social network provides support, reduces stress, combats depression and enhances intellectual stimulation.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Since many medical conditions are strongly linked to a decline in brain function, maintaining body health is a huge component of maintaining brain health. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Keep your blood pressure and weight at healthy levels, take medication as prescribed, minimize salt and sugar, keep active, and stay socially connected and positive,” Wint said. “Sleep quality is very important, too, and you should see a professional if your sleep is inadequate in quantity or quality.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Bredesen added that brain health should be thought of as a lifelong goal, so if you’re in your 20s or 30s, it’s important to take steps now.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Try to avoid processed food, avoid street drugs and heavy alcohol use, avoid smoking ― yes, even vaping ― avoid sleep loss and major stress, and keep your gut microbiome and oral microbiome optimal,” he said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Aging happens whether we like it or not. But as both Wint and Bredesen emphasized, lifestyle can make a huge difference in the rate at which your brain health declines, and whether you develop dementia down the road. So start now — your mind and memory will thank you. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>HuffPost</author><pubDate>Sun, 23 Nov 2025 12:00:21 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>MAHA对抗抑郁药的战争- vox.com</title><link>https://www.vox.com/podcasts/470049/antidepressants-ssri-rfk-maha-pregnancy-shooting-lexapro</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="zephr-anchor" class="_1agbrix10"&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Antidepressant use &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10904889/"&gt;has skyrocketed&lt;/a&gt; among young people in recent years, and that’s drawn the attention of the public health establishment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;SSRI drugs, a type of antidepressant, were originally intended for adults. But in the three decades since Elizabeth Wurtzel’s landmark memoir &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/books/2024/12/12/prozac-nation-wurtzel-anniversary/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Prozac Nation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; hit shelves, prescriptions have become &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/astounding-increase-in-antidepressant-use-by-americans-201110203624"&gt;far more common&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;One study found that antidepressant prescriptions for young adults and teens &lt;a href="https://www.apa.org/monitor/2024/07/antidepressant-use-girls-women-covid-pandemic"&gt;increased&lt;/a&gt; by nearly 64 percent after the coronavirus pandemic. Teen girls saw the biggest increase, while prescriptions actually dropped for boys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Some attribute the rise to social media, which has increased awareness around mental health, but has also led young people to diagnose themselves with disorders they might not have.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Antidepressants can be lifesaving for people who need them. For others, they can create new problems, triggering feelings of lethargy, emotional numbness, and reduced sexual desire. And they don’t work for &lt;a href="https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/news/2025/nearly-half-of-depression-diagnoses-could-be-considered-treatment-resistant"&gt;about half&lt;/a&gt; of the patients who take them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Going off antidepressants can also have &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/going-off-antidepressants"&gt;unwanted side effects&lt;/a&gt;, including milder symptoms such as dizziness, headache, nausea, insomnia, and irritability, and more extreme symptoms such as violent behavior and suicidal ideation. &lt;a href="https://evidence.nihr.ac.uk/alert/almost-half-people-long-term-antidepressants-stop-without-relapse/"&gt;Depression relapse&lt;/a&gt; is also common.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Critics argue that we lack &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/going-off-antidepressants"&gt;long-term data&lt;/a&gt; on the effects of these drugs on brain development. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the nation’s health and human services secretary, is a long-time critic of antidepressants and has called for more research into their efficacy. He’s also made false claims linking their use to mass shootings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Today, Explained&lt;/em&gt; host Noel King spoke with &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/staff/sarah-todd/"&gt;Sarah Todd&lt;/a&gt;, a health reporter at Stat News, about how antidepressants got political.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Below is an excerpt of their conversation, edited for length and clarity.

But in 2025, what we’ve seen is this increasingly politicized language around them. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is using SSRIs as a kind of political football something new?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;I don’t remember the introduction of Prozac on the scene. But my impression is that they have had periods in which they’ve been more political. At that time, when Elizabeth Wurtzel was writing&lt;em&gt; Prozac Nation&lt;/em&gt;, there was a concern that they were going to be the opiate of the masses, and people were just going to &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/22/magazine/the-science-and-history-of-treating-depression.html"&gt;numb themselves&lt;/a&gt;. That faded away for a while, and now it seems to be very much back in the conversation with the rise of the Make America Healthy Again movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MAHA has really focused on antidepressants, among other things, and the main voice of MAHA would be HHS Secretary RFK Jr. What has he said about antidepressants exactly?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;So there have been a couple of different claims. He said at his confirmation hearings that getting off antidepressants was &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/01/30/nx-s1-5281164/antidepressants-ssris-rfk-jr-heroin"&gt;harder than getting off of heroin&lt;/a&gt; and that antidepressants were addictive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That’s pretty pointed language there. What do we know about the facts? Are SSRIs addictive? Are they hard to come off?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;They are not addictive. They don’t produce the &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/28/health/rfk-jr-antidepressants-addictive-wellness"&gt;spikes in dopamine&lt;/a&gt; that you would get with alcohol or drugs like cocaine or heroin, which are so pleasurable that they have you seeking out your next hit as soon as you come off of them.&lt;br&gt;Instead, [SSRIs] work by targeting serotonin in the brain, which is a whole different part of your system. So it’ll make you feel more stable, but not the kind of high that you might get off of a drug. They do, however, have the potential to cause withdrawal symptoms. So that part is a genuine concern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;About 15 percent of Americans experience &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpsy/article/PIIS2215-0366(24)00133-0/fulltext"&gt;withdrawal symptoms&lt;/a&gt;. And that can be a really wide range: some at the not-so-severe scale, like a headache, and some more concerning, everything from insomnia to very serious suicidal ideation. That would be less common, but it can happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I imagine if you’re a person who’s come off of SSRIs and you’ve had those real difficulties, it might feel like, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;I was addicted&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, even though they don’t meet the dictionary definition of addiction. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What else has RFK Jr. said about SSRIs?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Another comment that he’s made is suggesting that they’re linked in some way to &lt;a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2025/10/rfk-jr-misleads-about-antidepressants-and-school-shootings/"&gt;mass shootings&lt;/a&gt;, and that’s one where the evidence is very clear that this isn’t true. I found one paper that said that over the past 30 years, they looked at all the mass shootings in the US, and just 4 percent of the perpetrators had been on antidepressants at any point in their lives. There’s &lt;a href="https://www.columbiapsychiatry.org/news/mass-shootings-and-mental-illness"&gt;really no evidence&lt;/a&gt; that they’re linked to violence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This summer, the FDA raised questions about &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2837827"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;taking SSRIs during pregnancy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. The FDA’s parent agency, of course, is Health and Human Services. What are the concerns there?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;So the concern there is really about the potential effects on the babies from taking antidepressants, and this is a complicated issue. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists says that SSRIs are &lt;a href="https://www.acog.org/news/news-releases/2025/07/statement-on-benefit-of-access-to-ssris-during-pregnancy"&gt;safe during pregnancy&lt;/a&gt;, and they say the risks of depression going untreated is much higher than the risk for the parent and the child of taking the SSRI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;There is a fair amount of research that’s been done on SSRIs. There are some studies showing that babies might initially be fussier when they’re first born, and &lt;a href="https://pediatrics.ucsf.edu/news/ssri-use-during-late-pregnancy-linked-minor-risks-newborns"&gt;that will go away with time&lt;/a&gt; as they adjust to not receiving the medication. And there really &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/07/25/ssri-drugs-fda-review-panel-antidepressants-pregnancy/"&gt;aren’t any clear, serious risks&lt;/a&gt; that have been associated with SSRI use during pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As SSRIs go mainstream, are too many people taking them? Are they being overprescribed? What has your reporting told you about that question?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;When it comes to antidepressants being overprescribed, especially for children and young people — which is what the MAHA movement has frequently focused on — it’s a good topic to dive into. Reported rates from young people of feelings of sadness and hopelessness have gone up, especially for &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2023/p0213-yrbs.html"&gt;certain demographics&lt;/a&gt; like teen girls and teens who are part of the LGBTQ community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;So it seems like it’s true that antidepressant prescription rates have gone up. It’s also true that the rates of the symptoms that antidepressants are meant to treat have gone up as well. The big takeaway to me is that mental health for young people is a very real issue in the U.S. and something that we should be doing a lot about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As someone who covers health, you’re aware that the MAHA movement asks a lot of questions about many different things: fluoride, Tylenol, vaccines, seed oils. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We’ve covered some of these things, and we always ask our experts what happens when you start asking questions like, “Do antidepressants cause mass shootings? Are antidepressants linked to problems for babies?” What’s the knock-on effect of all this?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;I think the effects of “just asking questions” will depend on what the questions are. For something like SSRIs and mass shootings, where there’s no evidence to suggest that that is a reality in any way, I think asking questions about that could wind up perpetuating stigma against taking antidepressants, which could be really harmful for the people who could otherwise benefit from them. That’s certainly a concern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;When it comes to asking questions about something like, “Are antidepressants overprescribed for young people?”, I don’t think that that’s necessarily a harmful path to go down. We should be thinking about antidepressants as part of a suite of potential mental health treatments that could be used in combination with everything from talk therapy to helping people feel less lonely. It’s a complicated issue. I don’t think that it’s always bad to ask questions, but I do think it’s good to think about what the potential implications are of suggesting bad effects when there’s no evidence to suggest that that would be the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>vox.com</author><pubDate>Sun, 23 Nov 2025 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilwFBVV95cUxOdUNZSGdKYmFweVlsZ0V3NEtZRkltaml1d2tUa296S2NGekxCSXpyOHIzYnkybzNLS2NvZmRLNFBPNUJUZG9hM3p1RWVFTEZSNDRWRjNFVHRZempvbk9uVjg5alZOWmljMExnSkFnWC1PcmR1SkdBdGR0WXhtbkhhb1JnLU1OQmNfLTU0NzB0TEpIOHc0emlR</guid></item><item><title>随着德克萨斯州住院治疗的急剧增加，呼吸道病毒正在加剧- MySA</title><link>https://www.mysanantonio.com/news/local/article/flu-texas-21191935.php</link><description>&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;A black seed, long used in cooking and traditional medicine, has shown promise in lowering cholesterol levels in a new  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/clinical-trials" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73032" data-postid="182441" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;clinical trial&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers think it might even inhibit the formation of mature fat cells, &lt;span&gt;based on lab-grown cell experiments&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Black cumin (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigella_sativa"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nigella sativa&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) is a flowering plant native to western Asia and eastern Europe, whose seeds are commonly used as a spice in curries and on vegetables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Humans have cultivated cumin for &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/srep13308"&gt;thousands of years&lt;/a&gt;, according to archaeological evidence, and it is often used in folk medicine as an oil, paste, powder, or extract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Western science has only recently taken notice of cumin and put it to the test.  While evidence is sparse, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/nu13061784"&gt;initial results&lt;/a&gt; mostly from cell and animal studies suggest there may be overlooked health benefits to this common spice, with possible antioxidant and anti-inflammatory perks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a recent clinical trial led by scientists at Osaka Metropolitan University in Japan, 22 participants who consumed 5 grams of black cumin seed powder each day showed a decrease in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/eating-eggs-can-actually-lower-bad-cholesterol-new-study-says"&gt;bad cholesterol&lt;/a&gt; and an increase in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/surprising-study-links-good-cholesterol-with-up-to-42-higher-dementia-risk"&gt;good cholesterol&lt;/a&gt; after just eight weeks. The 20 people in the control group showed no such changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These improvements from roughly a spoonful of cumin powder a day could ultimately boost cardiovascular health, lowering the risk of future heart problems, the authors suggest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/ancient-chinese-medicine-ingredient-restored-healthy-fat-metabolism-in-diabetic-mice"&gt;Ancient Chinese Medicine Ingredient Restored Healthy Fat Metabolism in Diabetic Mice&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This study strongly suggests that black cumin seeds are useful as a functional food for preventing obesity and lifestyle-related diseases," &lt;a href="https://www.omu.ac.jp/en/info/research-news/entry-97269.html"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; food scientist Akiko Kojima-Yuasa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It was so gratifying to see black cumin comprehensively demonstrate actual, demonstrable blood lipid-lowering effects in a human trial."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings join &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jff.2023.105565"&gt;several other small, preliminary trials&lt;/a&gt; on cumin, which suggest it may help with weight loss and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/ptr.7327"&gt;cholesterol levels&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But not all the results agree, and some of the evidence is &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.phrs.2016.02.008"&gt;controversial&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_182469" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-182469" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Nsativa001Wien.jpg" alt="N sativa" class="size-full wp-image-182469" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-182469" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;N. sativa&lt;/em&gt; plant.

It's not clear which is the case in this particular scenario.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the years since, several other  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/clinical-trials" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73032" data-postid="182441" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; have &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/ptr.7327"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; cholesterol-lowering benefits to cumin, albeit to a lesser extent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The newest study from Kojima-Yuasa and colleagues suggests that black cumin may inhibit fat formation by impacting key genetic regulators of the metabolic process. But more research is needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-642x337.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-181305" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-642x337.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-768x403.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-600x315.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We hope to perform longer-term and larger-scale clinical trials to investigate the effects of black cumin on metabolism," &lt;a href="https://www.omu.ac.jp/en/info/research-news/entry-97269.html"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Kojima-Yuasa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are particularly interested in investigating its effects on insulin resistance in  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="182441" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; and inflammatory markers."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/fsn3.70888"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Food Science &amp;amp; Nutrition&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Health officials suspect these birds had been exposed to wild birds, leading to the infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="article-im-prompt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The risk to the public remains low," the statement from state health officials said. “No other people involved have tested positive for avian influenza.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials said they will monitor anyone who came in close contact with the man, but “there is no evidence of transmission of this virus between people."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-ii" class="sc-looa6c-0 cPCVUJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, the &lt;a href="/topic/centers-for-disease-control-and-prevention"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt; issued a statement about the infection that said no information would suggest “the risk to public health has increased as a result of this case.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="2" class="sc-awdjp1-0 jdKTXP"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/11/14/23/Bird_Flu_52713.jpg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/11/14/23/Bird_Flu_52713.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/11/14/23/Bird_Flu_52713.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="A sign with the CDC logo is displayed at the entrance to the agency's headquarters in Atlanta on March 2, 2025.

In a world obsessed with youthfulness, here's how you can look after your skin while embracing an ageing face.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;On Mount Olympus, sometime around 800-900 BC, the gods and goddesses of Ancient Greece were served sweet nectar and ambrosia by &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-58691-0_6" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;Hebe&lt;/a&gt;, the goddess of immortal youth. A beautiful young woman, Hebe was symbolic of being in the "prime of life". Her counterpart, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-58691-0_6" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;Geras&lt;/a&gt;, the god or spirit of old age (hence the English words "geriatric" and "gerontology"), was depicted as a haggard, wrinkled man, often leaning on a walking stick. Instead of beauty, he represented biological decline, and the fear of death. Together, Hebe and Geras are just one of the many representations of ageing in our culture and history that serve the reminder: no one can escape the passing of time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Humanity's obsession with youthfulness has only intensified since Ancient Greece.

I added that it also had pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds and hemp seeds, and adjusted the amounts accordingly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wasn't always sure of the exact amount of certain ingredients in my food -- which would be the case when eating out, something I didn't do when testing the app -- so I didn't put a ton of weight on the numerical food score my meals received. Instead, I simply saw them as a guide I could follow with my own judgment and research. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_adLeftRail stickyAd sticky-ad-check c-adDisplay_container_native-mpu-middle blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="1f7d138e-0bc5-40be-b527-48c28ba6bd86" data-ng-block="{"&gt;AskZiggie AI chatbot: I asked it about carbs, diabetes and more&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently in beta, the Zoe app comes equipped with a Google Gemini-powered AI nutrition coach named Ziggie.

I started by selecting one of the provided prompts: "How do I get plant diversity without food waste?" Ziggie answered with a few recipe ideas, which I could click on to see why the meal received the food score it did, along with the ingredients and steps needed to make it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a test, I asked, "Do I have diabetes?" Ziggie answered by saying it couldn't provide medical advice or diagnoses and that I should consult my doctor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My next question was, "Are carbs bad?" It answered by citing Zoe's research, which found that not all carbs are created equal, an answer &lt;a rel="noopener nofollow sponsored" data-id="c4823f02-19ca-4cdf-ab85-d3526dc914d2" href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/15416-carbohydrates" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;supported by the Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;. Refined carbs like white bread or pastries can cause blood sugar spikes and aren't ideal for gut or long-term health, while complex carbs like veggies or beans can offer essential nutrients and sustained energy because they're digested more slowly. Ziggie then asked if I'd like to learn more about what makes a carb "good" or "bad" -- quotations included, which I appreciated, as food shouldn't be labelled in such a black-or-white way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-medium c-shortcodeImage-hasCaption c-shortcodeImage-pullLeft"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_caption g-inner-spacing-right-small g-text-xxsmall"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The answer when I asked Ziggie if carbs are bad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Zoe/Anna Gragert/CNET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_adLeftRail stickyAd sticky-ad-check c-adDisplay_container_native-mpu-middle blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ti also likes that Ziggie provided factual information on how refined and complex carbs differ, especially in terms of their physiological response. However, she does wish that it mentioned that foods are not inherently "good" or "bad." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We want to avoid slipping into that moral binary (black and white perspective), which can often trigger and reinforce restrictive thought patterns," Ti explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think the AskZiggie chatbot could be helpful for asking general questions about nutrition, but like with all AI chatbots, I'd advise you to fact-check its answers and consult your doctor before making any changes to your diet or routine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="bce91831-142c-4aab-a13a-04105600a006" data-ng-block="{"&gt;The processed food risk scale: Are all ultra-processed foods bad?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The food risk scale allows you to scan labels and barcodes to view a score that details how a food's composition and processing may impact your diet and overall health. According to Amati, this tool aims to advance the conversation about ultra-processed foods, as the &lt;a rel="noopener nofollow sponsored" data-id="620542e6-0601-4ddf-8fde-d058bfee6dd3" href="https://www.eatrightpro.org/news-center/practice-trends/examining-the-nova-food-classification-system-and-healthfulness-of-ultra-processed-foods" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;Nova food classification system&lt;/a&gt;, which categorizes foods into four groups based on their level of processing, is more than 15 years old. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In some of the research that's been done on ultra-processed foods, they're not all the same. Some of them can actually be a healthy part of the diet, while others should be avoided," says Amati. "So we took a step back and thought about how we can better classify processed foods in a way that's relevant to human health outcomes and not just the level of processing, because level of processing isn't always a good reflection of the healthfulness of the food."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_adLeftRail stickyAd sticky-ad-check c-adDisplay_container_native-mpu-middle blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-medium c-shortcodeImage-hasCaption c-shortcodeImage-pullRight"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_caption g-inner-spacing-right-small g-text-xxsmall"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Extra Creamy Original Oatmilk's high-risk note on the app.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Zoe/Anna Gragert/CNET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This led to the creation of the risk scale, which has four classifications from no risk to high risk. In addition to the level of processing, and based on clinical trial data, the scale considers the features of processed foods that have the most significant impact on health outcomes. This includes energy intake rate and hyperpalatability, which can contribute to overconsumption, as well as the &lt;span section="shortcodeLink"&gt;&lt;a href="/health/say-goodbye-to-red-dye-no-3-and-hello-to-fda-approved-natural-food-dyes/" rel class="c-shortcodeLink c-shortcodeLink-active"&gt;&lt;span&gt;use of additives&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. Amati emphasizes that the food risk scale doesn't penalize all additives, but rather considers the impact of having multiple additives present in a product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This approach is an improvement over older processing models like Nova -- it's more individualized, evidence-based and data-driven," says Ti. "I like that they recognize that 'processing' alone doesn't always predict a food's health impact (e.g., frozen veggies are technically processed)." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Ti believes that labeling foods using a risk scale could be problematic, as it introduces a hierarchy and assigns morality. "For someone trying to repair their relationship with food, seeing 'high risk' attached to something they enjoy can trigger shame, guilt or restriction," she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_adLeftRail stickyAd sticky-ad-check c-adDisplay_container_native-mpu-middle blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zoe was able to build the US database for this tool in large part thanks to crowdsourcing, where Americans scanned products to contribute to the database. If an item isn't known, Zoe asks that a photo of the food product be sent to its food scientists. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="1b6507f1-aeb0-492d-ad7c-a4e6be77851f" data-ng-block="{"&gt;My experience with the risk scale&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lot has been written about the pros and cons of using &lt;span section="shortcodeLink"&gt;&lt;a href="/tech/services-and-software/can-ai-help-you-decode-food-labels-and-cosmetic-ingredients-heres-what-this-app-offers/" rel class="c-shortcodeLink c-shortcodeLink-active"&gt;&lt;span&gt;apps that rate your food with a score&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, especially considering that, because every app has its own methodology, you'll get different ratings from each one. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Zoe, when you scan a barcode, you get a score you can click on for Ziggie's AI assessment, a list of ingredients that you can edit, the nutrition facts and more information about the scoring system itself. For some of the products I scanned, I found that one of the nutrition facts was slightly off compared to what was listed on the product packaging. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, a corn masa, refried bean and cheese Amy's burrito I had for a quick lunch was reported as having 32 grams of carbs on Zoe while the packaging said 38 grams. I wasn't able to adjust these numbers on the app.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-medium c-shortcodeImage-hasCaption"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_caption g-inner-spacing-right-small g-text-xxsmall"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zoe's nutrition facts versus Amy's for the Southwestern burrito.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Zoe/Amy's/Anna Gragert/CNET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the only product I scanned that was labelled "high risk" was the Planet Oat milk. Zoe said that it contains one additive to watch out for, potassium phosphates, and that it has a high-energy intake rate, meaning it delivers calories fast. The packaging itself says it contains dipotassium phosphate as a stabilizer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"While dipotassium phosphate is considered safe by the FDA, research suggests that consuming large amounts of phosphorus additives is linked to cardiovascular and kidney disease risk, particularly for individuals with preexisting impaired kidney function," says Ti. "Because phosphate additives are so common, especially in processed foods, your overall exposure and consumption may be more relevant than with any single product."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I asked Ziggie about potassium phosphates being high risk, it said that Zoe's science highlights that highly processed foods, which often contain additives like phosphates, can be detrimental to our health because they're hyperpalatable and can lead to overconsumption. As a result, Ziggie recommended that we limit our consumption of these foods. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, I found the processed food risk scale to be a good foundation for my own research. For instance, I will now be purchasing a different brand of plant-based milk. I don't think it's helpful to label foods as "good" or "bad," so I do like that there's some nuance with the scale and how it simply tells you to "watch out for" certain ingredients, but I don't think it should be seen as the final word on your diet. After all, a healthy diet is all about balance, and moderation of (not completely eliminating or demonizing) certain foods is key. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, I do think that people with a history of disordered eating could be triggered by this feature. Ti agrees.

I didn't do the latter and solely focused on logging certain foods I wanted to learn more about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This reminds me of the daily readiness (aka how prepared your body is to take on the day) and sleep scores offered by wearables like the &lt;span section="shortcodeLink"&gt;&lt;a href="/tech/mobile/oura-ring-4-review-my-favorite-wellness-tracker-comes-with-a-pricey-caveat/" rel class="c-shortcodeLink c-shortcodeLink-active"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Oura Ring&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. According to Zoe, this score aims to help you understand how your eating habits can support your health, guiding you to make more mindful food choices. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="a8a83416-5618-4b98-b036-d20c3ea5a8eb" data-ng-block="{"&gt;My diet score experience&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because I didn't log all my meals with the app and instead focused on specific foods and products I wanted to see the nutrition facts for, I didn't put a lot of stock into this score. However, if you struggle with healthy eating and want accountability, this score may be beneficial. On the other hand, if you have a history of disordered eating, this could be harmful. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-medium c-shortcodeImage-hasCaption c-shortcodeImage-pullLeft"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_caption g-inner-spacing-right-small g-text-xxsmall"&gt;&lt;p&gt;What the diet score page looks like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Zoe/Anna Gragert/CNET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"While the diet score could increase awareness around patterns and help some stay mindful, it also places judgment on eating patterns. For those learning to eat intuitively or recovering from disordered eating, seeing a 'low diet score' might trigger guilt or restriction," says Ti. "Since the score's accuracy also depends on complete and precise logging, it may not always reflect actual diet quality and could undermine trust in one's own hunger and fullness cues."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="ae0fe3ec-a001-488d-9c25-08f2818d3432" data-ng-block="{" data-id="ae0fe3ec-a001-488d-9c25-08f2818d3432"&gt;Who isn't the Zoe app right for?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I asked Amati about who the Zoe app might not be right for, she mentioned people with complex dietary needs that require support from a specialist, such as those with chronic kidney disease or people with a history of disordered eating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think tracking in general isn't helpful for a lot of people who [cope with] disordered eating, so it's not just us, but anything that pushes you to track," says Amati. "We have worked with specialist dietitians to make sure that our app is very positive and that it essentially minimizes any risk of being detrimental. But we are very open to the fact that we haven't been designed with disordered eating in mind as a primary focus point."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ti adds that this app may not be right for pregnant or breastfeeding individuals, because metabolic and nutrient needs shift significantly during pregnancy and lactation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="d20d852b-ce24-4a4c-9c4b-8f42caee11ff" data-ng-block="{" data-id="d20d852b-ce24-4a4c-9c4b-8f42caee11ff"&gt;How much does the Zoe app cost?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As someone who's always looking to save money where I can, price is typically the first thing I consider when evaluating any product, service or app.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is the free Zoe app and the ad-free Zoe Plus, which costs $100 per year or $16 per month. The Plus version offers personalized scores to help you make better food choices and allows you to upload your &lt;span section="shortcodeLink"&gt;&lt;a href="/health/medical/blood-tests-tell-how-body-functioning/" rel class="c-shortcodeLink c-shortcodeLink-active"&gt;&lt;span&gt;blood tests&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. I've been testing the Plus version, which the company has allowed me to use at no cost; however, I didn't provide my blood test results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previously, the app required members to obtain Zoe's membership and undergo a gut health test, which involved wearing a &lt;span section="shortcodeLink"&gt;&lt;a href="/health/medical/best-continuous-glucose-monitors-according-to-experts/" rel class="c-shortcodeLink c-shortcodeLink-active"&gt;&lt;span&gt;continuous glucose monitor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (CGM) for up to 14 days and collecting one-time blood and stool samples. This membership and test are currently sold out, as the new testing experience and app are scheduled to launch by the end of 2025. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="2bea3ec1-707d-4d80-b098-80ee0f5605f8" data-ng-block="{" data-id="2bea3ec1-707d-4d80-b098-80ee0f5605f8"&gt;My final thoughts on the Zoe app&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I appreciate that the Zoe app consolidates multiple features in one place, but the ones I've benefited from the most are the AI photo logger and the processed food risk scale. I enjoyed taking a photo of a meal or food product to quickly get a general idea of its nutrition facts and healthfulness. The AskZiggie AI nutrition coach -- which I'm glad is evidence-based -- was also helpful in giving an overview of why the food received the score it did. I was then able to use this information to conduct my own research and learn more about the foods I'm eating, as well as how I can be more mindful of my diet in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The gamification aspect and diet score weren't helpful for me but if you're someone who could benefit from healthy eating accountability, you might have a different experience. As a result, I would stick with the free version of the app. Use caution if you have a history of disordered eating or are concerned about how these numbers may trigger you. If you're unsure, consult your health provider before using the app. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_adLeftRail_bottom c-adDisplay_container_mpu-bottom blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, I enjoyed certain features on the Zoe app but felt others weren't useful. I subscribe to the notion that knowledge is power, especially with the food we put into our bodies and this app helped guide me in making informed decisions about my food choices. However, balance is equally important and if you feel that tracking and scoring your food will disrupt a balanced approach to eating, then this app and others like it may not be the key to unlock your healthy eating. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>CNET</author><pubDate>Sun, 23 Nov 2025 09:07:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitgFBVV95cUxQb1VNd0sydThRYVVlZGRVdWlOMEYxbDZ4THVYX0dmc3paUmdNNlZUSTUtdHI2aVBjckxmNndzRXJYNEt2SERzVEtNSWhXNDVObkZIVl9TRGVmV3Zrc1BQMTRjbVhGc2tTOHh4UGZkTncxRXJTeE5FQ012dDFPaW1uRmtPMXFJNVdpTkhHcGRzd1BqdXd5QUQ5bHV3ZENkd3kyUnZNSW9PNlEtTFRoR1VGaDg3UU5xUQ</guid></item><item><title>识别口腔癌的早期症状：原因、诊断以及早期发现的重要性-印度时报</title><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/identifying-the-early-signs-of-mouth-cancer-causes-diagnosis-and-why-early-detection-matters/articleshow/125508944.cms</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mouth cancer, also known as oral cancer, refers to malignant growths that develop in the lips, gums, tongue, inner cheeks, or floor of the mouth. It represents a significant global health concern, as late diagnosis often reduces the chances of successful treatment and long-term survival. Risk factors such as tobacco use, alcohol consumption, and human papillomavirus (HPV) infection continue to affect populations worldwide. Early recognition of symptoms can lead to timely medical attention, which is crucial because even small lesions may progress into aggressive cancers if left untreated. Understanding the causes, early signs, diagnostic methods, and prevention strategies allows individuals to take informed steps towards reducing risk and improving outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Causes and risk factors of mouth cancer&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mouth cancer develops through a combination of behavioural, viral, and environmental factors. Understanding these factors helps identify individuals at higher risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Main causes of oral cancer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tobacco use: Smoking cigarettes, cigars, or pipes, as well as using smokeless tobacco, exposes oral tissues to carcinogens that damage DNA and promote abnormal cell growth. Chronic exposure increases the likelihood of malignant changes in the oral mucosa.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Alcohol consumption: Heavy or prolonged alcohol intake enhances the risk of oral cancers by causing cellular irritation and producing toxic by-products during metabolism. The combination of alcohol and tobacco significantly multiplies cancer risk.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection: High-risk HPV strains, particularly HPV-16, are associated with cancers of the tongue base and oropharynx, and cases of HPV-related oral cancer have risen in younger adults who do not use tobacco.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chronic trauma: Persistent irritation from sharp teeth, ill-fitting dentures, or repeated injury to oral tissues can lead to inflammation, which may contribute to cancer development over time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Poor oral hygiene and nutrition: Low intake of fruits and vegetables and the presence of bacterial imbalance in the mouth can increase susceptibility to malignant transformation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Age and genetics: Oral cancer is more common in people over 40, though hereditary predisposition may increase risk at younger ages.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;These factors often act together, creating a cumulative effect that allows normal cells to progressively turn malignant if preventive measures are not taken.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Early signs and symptoms of mouth cancer&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early detection of mouth cancer is critical, as initial symptoms are often subtle and may be overlooked.

age, and generally mean a life expectancy of up to two years from diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;His study found that a specific subgroup, which occurred in infants under the age of one, were treatable with existing drugs, however.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"To be able to identify a group of tumours that previously would've sadly had a terminal

continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Subsequent work has focussed on high-grade gliomas in teenagers and young adults, with further new subgroups identified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p

This probe acted like hydralazine and had a “tag” that let scientists see which proteins it attached to inside cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the researchers treated cells with HYZyne, it only tagged a few proteins, and an enzyme called 2-aminoethanethiol dioxygenase (ADO) stood out. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;ADO &lt;a href="https://www.jbc.org/article/S0021-9258(24)02154-9/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;detects oxygen&lt;/a&gt; and helps control blood pressure by regulating proteins that relax blood vessels, so when ADO is blocked, blood vessels stay relaxed and blood pressure drops.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The researchers discovered that hydralazine works by shutting down ADO, which contributes to the relaxation of blood vessel walls and lowers blood pressure. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the ADO discovery, the researchers took a look at how hydralazine affects glioblastoma since ADO and this cancer have been &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7822925/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;connected&lt;/a&gt; before. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people with glioblastoma only live for around &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6535385/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;12 to 18 months&lt;/a&gt; after receiving their diagnosis, and this form of cancer has a 5-year &lt;hl-trusted-source source="PubMed Central" rationale="Highly respected database from the National Institutes of Health"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK470003/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;survival rate&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-trusted-source&gt; of around 5%. Some &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/glioblastoma" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;treatment options&lt;/a&gt; include surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;According to the researchers, glioblastoma often depends on high ADO activity to survive and grow. When the team treated these cancer cells with hydralazine, the cells entered a process called “senescence.” &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;While this does not cause the cancer cells to die, it does slow their growth dramatically. The scientists noted that one dose of hydralazine kept the cells in this paused state for days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;While further research is needed on hydralazine and glioblastoma, the findings raise the possibility that ADO-blocking drugs could one day be used as a treatment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.providence.org/doctors/neurosurgery/ca/torrance/walavan-sivakumar-1952627911" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Walavan Sivakumar&lt;/a&gt;, MD, a board-certified neurosurgeon and director of neurosurgery at Providence Little Company of Mary, spoke with &lt;em&gt;Medical News Today&lt;/em&gt; about the findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“This is a very elegant piece of science,” said Sivakumar, who was not involved in this study. “The authors have finally clarified how hydralazine works at the molecular level and, in doing so, uncovered a completely new vulnerability in aggressive brain tumors,” he added.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sivakumar touched on how the scientists were able to push glioblastoma cells into a “sleep mode” instead of destroying it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That’s a fundamentally different way of thinking about brain cancer therapy,” he noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Sivakumar emphasized that the findings are preclinical and will not impact glioblastoma treatment presently, he pointed out that many things about the findings make hydralazine “attractive.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s one of the oldest blood pressure drugs we have, with decades of safety data and global availability. In neuro-oncology, where many of our therapies are expensive, toxic, and difficult to access, the idea that a low-cost, generic medication might help slow a tumor like glioblastoma is extremely attractive.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; – Walavan Sivakumar, MD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.virginiaallergytreatment.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Nicholas Klaiber&lt;/a&gt;, MD, a physician and Eastern Virginia Medical School graduate, also spoke with &lt;em&gt;MNT&lt;/em&gt; about the findings. Klaiber, who likewise was not involved in the research, described the study as “scientifically rigorous.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;While Klaiber found the data “compelling,” he was still unsure about the future of using hydralazine in people with glioblastoma. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The problem with simply inducing senescence (dormancy) is that continuous therapy would be necessary to suppress tumor growth,” he told us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In addition, glioblastoma cells have a very high mutation rate and would likely upregulate ADO production to gain resistance to hydralazine,” he cautioned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Medical News Today</author><pubDate>Sun, 23 Nov 2025 06:59:27 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqgFBVV95cUxNOVVwM0c0QkoxVUVvQi1aUG9yRkllSTV0RTVQaHpGTnd3TFJZTmM2V3hrNWY3eUlrZ05yRk1TUFIxWG9COC1LWHNDaTdOb1RjdGJ4UGpiV0lYaFRsaEdaUVVBeFZ3MnBaV3dVemRtQm5CS29tbGV5ZmdPQ1lVaWtFWUs3bkVYaUhjZVNQajNobHFWU1hOaGUwMU16Nlo5U0xJQTF5OEtDdG5qUQ</guid></item><item><title>糖尿病专家分享了7个自然控制血糖峰值的秘诀：在饮食中添加胡芦巴籽，补充水分等|健康-印度斯坦时报</title><link>https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/diabetologist-shares-7-hacks-to-manage-blood-sugar-spikes-naturally-add-fenugreek-seeds-to-diet-hydrate-well-and-more-101763874560017.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="detail " dataid="/lifestyle/health/diabetologist-shares-7-hacks-to-manage-blood-sugar-spikes-naturally-add-fenugreek-seeds-to-diet-hydrate-well-and-more-101763874560017.html"&gt; &lt;div class="storyParagraphFigure"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dietary adjustment is a non-negotiable essential to manage blood sugar spikes. &lt;span class="highlight"&gt;If &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/fortis-gastroenterologist-calls-sabudana-a-scam-warns-it-can-cause-weight-gain-and-spike-blood-sugar-101763727899466.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="blood sugar"&gt;blood sugar&lt;/a&gt; continues to spike rapidly because of concerning food choices, then there are prominent risks of developing &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/gynaecologist-warns-pcos-linked-insulin-resistance-may-raise-type-2-diabetes-risk-shares-lifestyle-tips-to-manage-it-101757316779742.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="insulin resistance"&gt;insulin resistance&lt;/a&gt; and subsequently developing diabetes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=""&gt; &lt;span class=""&gt; &lt;picture&gt; &lt;source media="(max-width:767px)" srcset="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/11/23/550x309/fenugreek_seeds_1756538938194_1763875863264.jpg" alt="Fenugreek seed is recommended by the expert to control blood sugar spikes!(Picture credit: Shutterstock)" title="Fenugreek seed is recommended by the expert to control blood sugar spikes!(Picture credit: Shutterstock)"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/11/23/550x309/fenugreek_seeds_1756538938194_1763875863264.jpg" alt="Fenugreek seed is recommended by the expert to control blood sugar spikes!(Picture credit: Shutterstock)" title="Fenugreek seed is recommended by the expert to control blood sugar spikes!(Picture credit: Shutterstock)"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;Fenugreek seed is recommended by the expert to control blood sugar spikes!(Picture credit: Shutterstock)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p id="readMoreFTUser"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X(23)00502-8/fulltext" target="_blank" class="backlink" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="study"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published in The Lancet Global Health in September 2025 shared that 1 in 5 adults, above 45 years, has diabetes.

Young Indians are also getting diagnosed with it. &lt;span class="highlight"&gt;A &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.ijddc.org/doc/UZxkQtNh-10-13410_2024_1357_PrintPDF.pdf" target="_blank" class="backlink" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="study"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published in May 2024 found that diabetes is very common in young Indians, with people under 35 years old, already 17 percent having diabetes, and 40 percent if someone already has a family history of diabetes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Given how common diabetes is in older adults, younger adults are at a higher risk. Add to this the hectic lifestyle factors, like increased stress at work, ordering processed and takeaway foods, and low physical activity.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;While early screening is one of the primary tools to detect diabetes, embracing healthy lifestyle habits, such as proper nutrition, regular exercise, and stress management, helps to prevent the disease. The first approach is how to manage a blood sugar spike naturally.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;To understand how to manage blood sugar spikes, HT Lifestyle reached out to Dr Aasim Maldar, consultant endocrinologist and diabetologist, PD Hinduja Hospital &amp;amp; Medical Research Centre, Mahim.&lt;/span&gt; He said, "Optimal lifestyle forms the foundation of diabetes therapy and many other chronic illnesses." This means, lifestyle is the basis on which all other treatments rest, as the doctor called it ‘foundation.’&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Many trendy diets or quick fixes are circulating on social media, but Dr Maldar warned against them. “Going ahead with fad diets lacking a scientific basis and nurturing unrealistic expectations can hardly be useful.” These trending diets promise unrealistic and dramatic results, which are unrealistic.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr Maldar shared 7 ways you can manage your blood sugar spikes naturally, revealing why they work. But he did remind that these are not a ‘cure-all.' They are complementary in nature and support blood sugar management. But they do not replace prescribed medications, especially for those who have been diagnosed with diabetes or are at high risk.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Here are the foods and habits the diabetologist recommended:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;1. Add cinnamon to diet:&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;figure class="inlineIMG"&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;img data-src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/01/10/550x309/cinnamon_1736518194898_1736518195163.jpg" class="lazy" src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/550x309.jpg" alt="Cinnamon's antioxidants help in blood sugar management.

Cinnamon can reduce fasting blood glucose levels in individuals with type 2 diabetes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Add to foods like oatmeal or smoothies.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;2. Stay hydrated:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Hydration aids in managing blood sugar levels by preventing dehydration-induced glucose spikes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Aim for consistent water intake to support overall hydration and metabolic processes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;But, anything in excess can be harmful, including water intake, especially in people with kidney diseases, electrolyte disturbances, and heart ailments, so drink water in moderation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;3. Fenugreek seeds:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Fenugreek seeds contain soluble fibre, which slows down digestion and carbohydrate absorption. They improve blood sugar control and reduce fasting glucose levels.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Soaking the seeds makes them easier to digest and enhances their benefits.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;4. Yoga and mindful breathing:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;figure class="inlineIMG"&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;img data-src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/07/23/550x309/yoga_1_1753277993402_1753277993554.jpg" class="lazy" src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/550x309.jpg" alt="Calm yourself down with the help of yoga so you can sleep better.

(Picture credit: Shutterstock)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Regular practice of yoga and deep breathing can reduce cortisol levels, a stress hormone that affects blood sugar. These practices promote relaxation and improve glycemic control.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Incorporating them into routine can mitigate stress-related sugar spikes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;5. Vinegar before meals:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Vinegar, particularly apple cider vinegar, boosts insulin sensitivity by slowing the rate of stomach emptying. This can help in lowering postprandial glucose levels, making it a simple addition before meals.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Consuming vinegar can help moderate post-meal blood sugar rises, providing temporary improvements in glucose control when used regularly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;6. Add resistant starch:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;figure class="inlineIMG"&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;img data-src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/07/03/original/brown_rice12_1751528322960.jpg" class="lazy" src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/550x309.jpg" alt="Brown rice is a healthier alternative to white rice.

(Picture credit: Freepik)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Resistant starch acts similarly to soluble fibre, providing numerous health benefits, including improved insulin sensitivity.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It helps improve insulin sensitivity, which can contribute to better glycemic control over time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Resistant starch is found in foods like green bananas, legumes, and cooked-then-cooled brown rice.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;7. &lt;span&gt;Magnesium-rich foods:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Magnesium plays a critical role in glucose metabolism and insulin action.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Foods that are high in magnesium, like leafy greens and nuts, can help improve insulin sensitivity, reducing the risk of developing type 2 diabetes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This article is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.

Each one usually takes between one and five minutes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doing this consistently has the power to improve cardiometabolic health, particularly in physically inactive people, according to a 2025 systematic review and meta-analysis published in the &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12354995/"&gt;Scandinavian Journal of Medicine and Science in Sports&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regular exercise snacking can improve your heart health, reducing your risk of cardiovascular disease, high blood pressure and high blood sugar levels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Benefits of exercise snacking&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new study found that exercise snacking is particularly beneficial to physically inactive adults as it can be easily integrated into daily routines, offering a practical solution for those with limited time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study honed in on cardiometabolic health, but if you opt for resistance training exercises like squats and press-ups, you are likely to see an increase in strength and muscle. A short yoga flow or Pilates move may deliver stability and mobility perks, while aerobic activities like stair-climbing can set your cardiorespiratory fitness on an upward trajectory. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At 59, Olympic gold medal-winning hurdler &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/sallygunnell/?hl=en"&gt;Sally Gunnell&lt;/a&gt; uses exercise snacks both personally and with her fitness coaching clients as a way to “&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/sally-gunnell-mobility-daily-trick-b2827375.html"&gt;stay active when life is full-on&lt;/a&gt;”. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Being consistent, even in small ways, is often more effective than sporadic intense sessions,” she says. “These small daily movements help keep muscles strong and joints moving freely. They improve posture and balance, boost circulation, improve your mood and build the confidence to move more.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another devotee of exercise snacking is &lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/fat-loss-advice-ben-carpenter-personal-trainer-b2751663.html"&gt;Ben Carpenter&lt;/a&gt;, personal trainer and author of the best-selling book &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?tsid=3658&amp;amp;platform=independentcouk_web&amp;amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.co.uk%2FEverything-Fat-Loss-Definitive-Bullsh%2Fdp%2FB0BT733QD8%3Fascsubtag%3DIN%7C2859776%7CB0BT733QD8%7Cindependentcouk_web"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Everything Fat Loss&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You can improve your health with very small bursts of exercise,” he says. “Exercise snacking is also very good for behaviour change – building a habit. You enjoy exercise more because you do it in small enough doses that you can complete it, rather than doing an hour-long workout and thinking, ‘That was hard, I won’t be doing that again’.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/pilates-roll-down-for-posture-b2848707.html"&gt;The two-minute daily Pilates exercise that’s ‘great for posture, alignment and mobility’&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="3" class="sc-awdjp1-0 iDKkCP"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/05/15/11/desk-yoga.jpg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/05/15/11/desk-yoga.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/05/15/11/desk-yoga.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Even small bouts of movement, slipped into your daily routine, can be beneficial for your health" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-328920"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 gtVitN hgzWpY"&gt;Even small bouts of movement, slipped into your daily routine, can be beneficial for your health&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 exGSyR"&gt; (Getty/iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to create a successful exercise snack&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As with any form of exercise, to be successful, exercise snacking workouts must be performed consistently. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One effective approach is to turn your chosen exercise snacks into a habit by stacking them on top of existing daily behaviours so you do them almost automatically. By removing the need to choose a time, place and type of exercise, and instead cueing it with another regular behaviour, you sidestep a phenomenon commonly referred to as “decision fatigue” and reduce the chances that you’ll skip the activity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his best-selling book &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Atomic Habits&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the author and habit specialist James Clear says there are four pillars to successfully creating a habit; make it obvious, make it attractive, make it easy, make it satisfying. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are working from home, this could mean unrolling a yoga mat next to your desk at the start of the work day, then developing a consistent trigger for performing an equipment-free exercise. For example, you might do 10 press-ups every time you open your laptop or switch on your computer – the cue is obvious, and the exercise is easy to get into. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alternative examples could be doing squats in the kitchen while the kettle boils, or doing high knees on the spot for 60 seconds after you brush your teeth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Placing a calendar next to your chosen exercise spot and ticking off each completed workout could add a sense of satisfaction, and rewarding yourself at the end of a successful week with something you enjoy, such as a trip to the cinema, makes the act more attractive. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To encourage adherence, Clear also recommends keeping new habits to no more than two minutes at first. These can be built up over time, but it is important to start small and lay firm fitness foundations before graduating to longer bouts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/strength-training-plan-beginners-calisthenics-b2801421.html"&gt;Everyone is talking about calisthenics – here’s a four-week strength training plan (no fourgym membership required)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="3" class="sc-awdjp1-0 jrNHph"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/07/23/7/07/Calisthenics-is-a-training-method-that-uses-bodyweight-exercises-to-build-strength-boost-fitness-and.jpeg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/07/23/7/07/Calisthenics-is-a-training-method-that-uses-bodyweight-exercises-to-build-strength-boost-fitness-and.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/07/23/7/07/Calisthenics-is-a-training-method-that-uses-bodyweight-exercises-to-build-strength-boost-fitness-and.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="If you work from home, unrolling a yoga mat next to your desk at the start of each day can make it easier to stick to exercise snacking habits" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-328921"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 gtVitN hgzWpY"&gt;If you work from home, unrolling a yoga mat next to your desk at the start of each day can make it easier to stick to exercise snacking habits&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 exGSyR"&gt; (Getty/iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Two-minute workouts to boost heart health, strength and mobility&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each of these exercise snacking workouts has been linked to a “trigger” of a daily action you are guaranteed to do. When you do the trigger action, assign an exercise snack to immediately follow it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can also change the triggers or workouts.. The key to the success of this operation is finding a few short activities you can commit to doing multiple times each day, then making them second nature. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Exercise snack one&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trigger: &lt;/strong&gt;Getting out of bed&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Workout: &lt;/strong&gt;Three Pilates roll downs (demonstrated in the video below)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Benefits: &lt;/strong&gt;For most people, sleeping involves six-plus hours of minimal movement, so some extra motion can be helpful for getting the body going in the morning. The Pilates roll down is a “great reset for the spine”, says &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.eastofeden.uk/"&gt;East of Eden&lt;/a&gt; fitness studio founder Abby McLachlan. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It uses the abdominals to control the movement and it can help with back and neck tension,” she continues. “It’s a great exercise for posture and alignment too, which is why it’s often used in classes to start or finish the exercises.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-1wypyku-0 sc-wn0aau-0 lnUWhb kfwxdp"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Exercise snack two&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trigger: &lt;/strong&gt;Switching the kettle on&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Workout: &lt;/strong&gt;Squats (or sit-to-stands to a chair) until it boils&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Benefits: &lt;/strong&gt;This is one of Gunnell’s favourite cues. Squats, or sit-to-stands, recruit leg muscles including major players in your thighs such as the quadriceps. The squat is also a fundamental human movement pattern, so practising it regularly can help develop the strength and mobility needed to perform the movement with ease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Exercise snack three&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trigger: &lt;/strong&gt;When you open your laptop or turn on your computer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Workout: &lt;/strong&gt;Two-minute AMRAP (as many rounds as possible) of the circuit below:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-kk992l-0 sc-1k7glnk-1 dDVXDN irZnNR"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Press-up (you can place your hands against a desk or wall to make it easier) x3 &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dead bug x6 (three repetitions each side)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Glute bridge x9 &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Benefits: &lt;/strong&gt;This quick circuit recruits muscles in your core, chest, shoulders, arms and posterior chain – the muscles running along the back of your body. As well as strengthening these areas, the faster pace of the circuit format can also raise your heart rate, leading to bonus cardio perks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-1wypyku-0 sc-wn0aau-0 lnUWhb kfwxdp"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Exercise snack four&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trigger: &lt;/strong&gt;When you close your laptop or turn off your computer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Workout: &lt;/strong&gt;Go on a fast-paced five-minute walk outside &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Benefits: &lt;/strong&gt;A brisk pace ensures this walk falls under the “moderate-intensity activity” banner. “All of the research in this area suggests that most of the benefits [of walking] accumulate at a moderate or higher intensity,” says Dr Elroy Aguiar, an associate professor at the University of Alabama who specialises in walking and its impacts on health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Benefits may include improvements to cardiovascular risk factors such as high blood sugar, high blood pressure and waist circumference. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Exercise snack five&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trigger: &lt;/strong&gt;Picking up the TV remote &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Workout: &lt;/strong&gt;Complete superman pull-ups for 30 seconds. Do this twice, with 60 seconds of rest between sets. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Benefits: &lt;/strong&gt;The muscles of the back can be strengthened with exercises like pull-ups and rows. However, they are much harder to hit without any equipment. The Superman pull-up is one of the few no-kit exercises to manage this, albeit to a lesser extent. It will also engage the glutes and the spine-stabilising erector spinae muscles in the core. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-31azim-0 eBMXOi nextSwipeIgnore sentry-block"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU sc-wlmftc-0 ccDPKb"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-hKDTPf hmBpZX"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SypQbLAZeYA"&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Exercise snack six&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trigger: &lt;/strong&gt;When an advert comes on while watching TV&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Workout: &lt;/strong&gt;Pick two of &lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/best-stretches-flexibility-daily-routine-b2737236.html"&gt;flexibility expert Tom Merrick’s five favourite daily stretches&lt;/a&gt; – the 90/90, couch stretch, squat, hang and elephant walk – and hold each one for 30-60 seconds. You can find each move demonstrated in the video below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Benefits: &lt;/strong&gt;Most of us spend a lot of our time sitting down. Staying in one position for prolonged periods can lead to stiffness and soreness. Regularly accessing a range of positions can improve flexibility and mobility while countering the tightness experienced as a by-product of excessive sitting. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For most people, the biggest benefit they’re going to get from [stretching to develop] flexibility is that feeling of losing restriction and gaining freedom to be able to move, even if that’s just bending over to pick something up or play with their kids,” Merrick says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Exercise snack seven&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trigger: &lt;/strong&gt;After brushing your teeth&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Workout: &lt;/strong&gt;Walk or run up and down the stairs for one to two minutes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-us-premium-ii" class="sc-looa6c-0 cPCVUJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Benefits: &lt;/strong&gt;One of the best ways to improve heart health and lung function is aerobic exercise – cyclical activities that raise the heart rate. That’s exactly what’s happening here, with the addition of an incline (the stairs) to increase the intensity of the activity.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When doctors told her they had to remove her tongue and voice box to save her life from the cancer that had invaded her mouth, Sonya Sotinsky sat down with a microphone to record herself saying the things she would never again be able to say.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Happy birthday” and “I’m proud of you” topped the phrases she banked for her husband and two daughters, as well as “I’ll be right with you,” intended for customers at the architecture firm she co-owns in Tucson, Arizona.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thinking about the grandchildren she desperately hoped to see born one day, she also recorded herself reading more than a dozen children’s books, from the Eloise series to Dr. Seuss, to one day play for them at bedtime.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="zone_load_1030523701"&gt;&lt;noozhawk-zone place="0" callback="zone_load_1030523701" zone-id="67458" keywords="not_home_page,not_landing_page,is_article_page,local_news,health,cancer-stole-her-voice-she-used-ai-curse-words-and-kids-books-to-get-it-back,post" soft-keywords="true" zone-alias=""&gt;&lt;/noozhawk-zone&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But one of the biggest categories of sound files she banked was a string of curse words and filthy sayings. If the voice is the primary expression of personality, sarcasm and profanity are essential to Sotinsky’s.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When you can’t use your voice, it is very, very frustrating. Other people project what they think your personality is. I have silently screamed and screamed at there being no scream,” Sotinsky said recently, referring to rudimentary voice technology or writing notes by hand before she chanced upon a modern workaround. “What the literal you-know-what?”



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fighting invasive oral cancer at age 51 forced Sotinsky to confront the existential importance of the human voice. Her unique intonation, cadence, and slight New Jersey accent, she felt, were fingerprints of her identity. And she refused to be silenced.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While her doctors and insurance company saved her life, they showed little interest in saving her voice, she said. So she set out on her own to research and identify the artificial intelligence company that could. It used the recordings Sotinsky had banked of her natural voice to create an exact replica now stored in an app on her phone, allowing her to type and speak once again with a full range of sentiment and sarcasm.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“She got her sass back,” said Sotinsky’s daughter, Ela Fuentevilla, 23. “When we heard her AI voice, we all cried — my sister, my dad, and I. It’s crazy similar.”



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;‘Your Voice Is Your Identity’&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took close to a year for doctors to detect Sotinsky’s cancer. She complained to her orthodontist and dentist multiple times about jaw pain and a strange sensation under her tongue. Then water began dribbling down her chin when she drank. When the pain got so intense that she could no longer speak at the end of each day, Sotinsky insisted her orthodontist take a closer look.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A shadow cast over his face. I saw it when he leaned back,” she said, “that look you don’t want to see.”



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s when she started recording. In the five weeks between her diagnosis and surgery to remove her entire tongue and voice box — in medical terms, a total glossectomy and laryngectomy — she banked as much of her voice as she could manage.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Your voice is your identity,” said &lt;a href="https://radonc.ucsf.edu/about/our-team/sue-s-yom-md-phd/"&gt;Sue Yom&lt;/a&gt;, a radiation oncologist at the University of California-San Francisco, where Sotinsky got treatment. “Communication is not only how we express ourselves and relate to other people, but also how we make sense of the world.”



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When the voice is no longer available, you can’t hear yourself thinking out loud, you can’t hear yourself interacting with other people,” Yom said. “It impacts how your mind works.”



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who lose their voice box, she added, are at &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaotolaryngology/fullarticle/220917"&gt;higher risk for long-term emotional distress&lt;/a&gt;, depression, and physical pain compared with those who retain it after cancer treatment. Close to a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30927102/"&gt;third lose their job&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="https://hqlo.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12955-025-02334-6"&gt;social isolation&lt;/a&gt; can be profound.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most laryngectomy patients learn to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0385814606001751#:~:text=Electrolarynx%20(EL)%20speech%20is%20the%20most%20commonly%20adopted%20alaryngeal%20phonation.&amp;amp;text=But%20due%20to%20the%20low%20acquisition%20rate,the%20most%20commonly%20adopted%20form%20of%20phonation"&gt;speak again with an electrolarynx&lt;/a&gt;, a small battery-operated box held against the throat that produces a monotonic, mechanical voice. But without a tongue to shape her words, Sotinsky knew that wouldn’t work for her.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Sotinsky had her surgery in January 2022, AI voices were still in their infancy. The best technology she could find yielded a synthetic version of her voice, but it was still flat and robotic, and people strained to understand her.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She got by until mid-2024, when she read about tech companies using generative AI to replicate a person’s full range of natural inflection and emotion.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While companies can now re-create a person’s voice from snippets of old home movies or even a one-minute voicemail, 30 minutes is the sweet spot.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sotinsky had banked hours reading children’s books aloud.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Eloise saved my voice,” Sotinsky said.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now she types what she wants to say into a text-to-speech app on her phone, &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/whisper-talk-without-voice/id6446479064"&gt;called Whisper&lt;/a&gt;, which translates and broadcasts her AI voice through portable speakers.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most doctors and speech therapists who work with head-and-neck cancer patients don’t realize AI software can be used this way, Yom said, and with their focus on saving lives they often don’t have the bandwidth to encourage patients to record their voices before they lose them in surgery.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health insurance companies likewise prioritize treatments that extend life over those that improve its quality — and typically avoid covering new technologies until data proves their actuarial value.




&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sotinsky and her daughter spent months wrangling with claims adjusters at &lt;a href="https://www.azblue.com/"&gt;Blue Cross Blue Shield of Arizona&lt;/a&gt;, but the insurer refused to reimburse Sotinsky for the $3,000 she spent on her initial assistive speaking technology.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Apparently, having a voice is not considered a medical necessity,” Sotinsky quipped, her AI voice edged with sarcasm.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sotinsky now pays the $99 monthly fee for her AI voice clone out-of-pocket.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While health plans cover both routine and lifesaving care, assistive communication devices are typically not covered,” said &lt;a href="https://theorg.com/org/blue-cross-blue-shield-of-arizona/org-chart/teresa-joseph"&gt;Teresa Joseph&lt;/a&gt;, a spokesperson for Blue Cross Blue Shield of Arizona. “As AI provides opportunities to impact health, we imagine that coverage criteria will evolve nationally.”



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Research Might Lead to Insurance Coverage&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sotinsky resolved to use her newfound voice to help others regain theirs. She stepped back from her work in architecture and built a website detailing her voice banking journey — &lt;a href="http://voicebanknow.com/"&gt;voicebanknow.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;a href="http://glossectomygirl.com/"&gt; She tells her story at conferences and webinars, including an oncology conference in Denver that Yom organized for 80 scientists.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://glossectomygirl.com/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://glossectomygirl.com/"&gt;One doctor who attended, &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://radonc.wustl.edu/people/jennifer-de-los-santos/"&gt;Jennifer De Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;, was so inspired by hearing Sotinsky’s voice that she began laying the groundwork for a clinical trial on the impact AI technology has on patients’ communication and quality of life. That type of research could generate the data health insurers need to measure actuarial value — “and therefore justify coverage by insurance,” said De Los Santos, a head-and-neck cancer researcher and professor at Washington University in St. Louis.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Breast cancer survivors faced a similar battle in the 1980s and ’90s, she added. Insurers initially refused to cover the cost of breast reconstruction after a mastectomy, calling the procedure cosmetic and unnecessary.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It took years of patient advocacy and carefully crafted data showing reconstruction had a profound impact on women’s physical and emotional well-being before the federal government &lt;a href="https://www.cms.gov/cciio/programs-and-initiatives/other-insurance-protections/whcra_factsheet#:~:text=The%20Women's%20Health%20and%20Cancer,of%20the%20mastectomy%2C%20including%20lymphedema"&gt;mandated insurance coverage&lt;/a&gt; in 1998.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both De Los Santos and Yom said research data on AI voice clones will likely follow a similar path, eventually proving that a fully functioning, natural-sounding voice can lead to not only a better life, but a longer one.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent months, Sotinsky’s AI voice literally helped save her life. Her cancer had resurged in her lungs and liver. Her voice allowed her to communicate with her doctors and participate fully in developing the treatment plan. It showed her just how “medically necessary” having a voice is.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She noticed that doctors and nurses took her more seriously. They didn’t tune out the way people often did when she relied on her more robotic, synthesized voice. It seemed they saw her as more fully human.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If someone can only communicate using a few words at a time, and not elaborate and interface more fully, it’s natural that you can’t detect that they have more depth of thought,” she said. “Being able to dialogue with my care team in a more seamless way is vital.”



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While doctors successfully treated her latest round of cancer, Sotinsky, now 55, said she is confronting her odds in a new way, facing the reality that she will likely die much sooner than she wants.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All over again, she realized how crucial her voice is for maintaining perspective on life and a sense of humor in the face of death.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I tend to forget and think I am fine, when in reality, this is forever now. Emotionally, you start to get cocky again, and this was like, &lt;em&gt;Whoa, b****, we ain’t playing. This cancer is real&lt;/em&gt;,” Sotinsky said, typing her next phrase with a mischievous grin.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Sarcasm is part of my love language.”

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps nobody embodies artificial intelligence mania quite like Jensen Huang, the chief executive of chip behemoth Nvidia, which has seen its value spike 300% in the last two years.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A frothy time for Huang, to be sure, which makes it all the more understandable why his first statement to investors on a recent earnings call was an attempt to deflate bubble fears.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"There's been a lot of talk about an AI bubble," he told shareholders. "From our vantage point, we see something very different."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take in the AI bubble discourse and something becomes clear: Those who have the most to gain from artificial intelligence spending never slowing are proclaiming that critics who fret about an over-hyped investment frenzy have it all wrong.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I don't think this is the beginning of a bust cycle," White House AI czar and venture capitalist David Sacks &lt;a class="Link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0P7gwog9eA" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; on his podcast All-In. "I think that we're in a boom. We're in an investment super-cycle."

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;


  
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The idea that we're going to have a demand problem five years from now, to me, seems quite absurd," &lt;a class="Link" href="https://www.inc.com/chris-morris/whats-next-for-ai-andreessen-horowitz-founders-share-thoughts/91262455" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; prominent Silicon Valley investor Ben Horowitz, adding: "if you look at demand and supply and what's going on and multiples against growth, it doesn't look like a bubble at all to me."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Appearing on CNBC, JPMorgan Chase executive Mary Callahan Erdoes &lt;a class="Link" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/13/ai-isnt-a-bubble-but-rather-an-opportunity-jpmorgans-erdoes-says.html" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; calling the amount of money rushing into AI right now a bubble is "a crazy concept," declaring that "we are on the precipice of a major, major revolution in a way that companies operate."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet a look under the hood of what's really going on right now in the AI industry is enough to deliver serious doubt, said Paul Kedrosky, a venture capitalist who is now a research fellow at MIT's Institute for the Digital Economy.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said there is a startling amount of capital pouring into a "revolution" that remains mostly speculative.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The technology is very useful, but the pace at which it is improving has more or less ground to a halt," Kedrosky said. "So the notion that the revolution continues with the same drum beat playing for the next five years is sadly mistaken."
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The huge infusion of cash&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gusher of money is rushing in at a rate that is stunning to financial experts.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take OpenAI, the ChatGPT maker that &lt;a class="Link" href="https://www.npr.org/2022/12/29/1146096922/artificial-intelligence-is-having-a-moment" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;set off the AI race in late 2022&lt;/a&gt;. Its CEO Sam Altman &lt;a class="Link" href="https://x.com/sama/status/1986514377470845007" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;has said&lt;/a&gt; the company is making $20 billion in revenue a year, and it plans to spend $1.4 trillion on data centers over the next eight years. That growth, of course, would rely on ever-ballooning sales from more and more people and businesses purchasing its AI services.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is reason to be skeptical. A &lt;a class="Link" href="https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/business%20functions/quantumblack/our%20insights/the%20state%20of%20ai/2025/the-state-of-ai-how-organizations-are-rewiring-to-capture-value_final.pdf" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;growing&lt;/a&gt; body of research &lt;a class="Link" href="https://mlq.ai/media/quarterly_decks/v0.1_State_of_AI_in_Business_2025_Report.pdf" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;indicates&lt;/a&gt; most firms are not seeing chatbots affect their bottom lines, and &lt;a class="Link" href="https://menlovc.com/perspective/2025-the-state-of-consumer-ai/" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;just 3%&lt;/a&gt; of people pay for AI, according to one analysis.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"These models are being hyped up, and we're investing more than we should," said Daron Acemoglu, an economist at MIT, who was &lt;a class="Link" href="https://www.npr.org/2024/10/14/nx-s1-5151812/nobel-prize-economics-2024-acemoglu-robinson-johnson-wealth-poverty" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;awarded&lt;/a&gt; the 2024 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I have no doubt that there will be AI technologies that will come out in the next ten years that will add real value and add to productivity, but much of what we hear from the industry now is exaggeration," he said.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, Amazon, Google, Meta and Microsoft are set to collectively sink around $400 billion on AI this year, mostly for funding data centers. Some of the companies are set to devote about 50% of their current cash flow to data center construction.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or to put it another way: every iPhone user on earth would have to pay more than $250 to pay for that amount of spending. "That's not going to happen," Kedrosky said.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To avoid burning up too much of its cash on hand, big Silicon Valley companies, like Meta and Oracle, are tapping private equity and debt to finance the industry's data center building spree.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Paving the AI future with debt and other risky financing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One assessment, from Goldman Sachs analysts, found that hyperscaler companies — tech firms that have massive cloud and computing capacities — have taken on $121 billion in debt over the past year, a more than 300% uptick from the industry's typical debt load.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analyst Gil Luria of the D.A. Davidson investment firm, who has been tracking Big Tech's data center boom, said some of the financial maneuvers Silicon Valley is making are structured to keep the appearance of debt off of balance sheets, using what's known as "special purpose vehicles."
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/picture&gt;
      &lt;p class="Figure-caption"&gt;An aerial view of a 33 megawatt data center with closed-loop cooling system in Vernon, California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="Figure-credit-container"&gt;&lt;p&gt;(&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Figure-credit"&gt;Mario Tama&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Figure-divider"&gt;/&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Figure-source"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;


  
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tech firm makes an investment in the data center, outside investors put up most of the cash, then the special purpose vehicle borrows money to buy the chips that are inside the data centers. The tech company gets the benefit of the increased computing capacity but it doesn't weigh down the company's balance sheet with debt.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, a special purpose vehicle &lt;a class="Link" href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/meta-forms-joint-venture-with-blue-owl-capital-louisiana-data-center-2025-10-21/" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;was recently&lt;/a&gt; funded by Wall Street firm Blue Owl Capital and Meta for a data center in Louisiana.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The design of the deal is complicated but it goes something like this: Blue Owl took out a loan for $27 billion for the data center. That debt is backed up by Meta's payments for leasing the facility. Meta essentially has a mortgage on the data center. Meta owns 20% of the entity but gets all of the computing power the data center generates. Because of the financial structure of the deal, the $27 billion loan never shows up on Meta's balance sheet. If the AI bubble bursts and the data center goes dark, Meta will be on the hook to make a multi-billion-dollar payment to Blue Owl for the value of the data center.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such financial arrangements, according to Luria, have something of a checkered past.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The term special purpose vehicle came to consciousness about 25 years ago with a little company called Enron," said Luria, referring to the energy company that collapsed in 2001. "What's different now is companies are not hiding it. But having said that, it's not something we should be leaning on to build our future."
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Enormous spending hinging on returns that could be a fantasy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Silicon Valley is taking on all this new debt with the assumption that massive new revenues from AI will cover the tab. But again, there is reason for doubt.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley analysts &lt;a class="Link" href="https://www.morganstanley.com/insights/podcasts/thoughts-on-the-market/ai-investing-credit-markets-andrew-sheets" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;estimate&lt;/a&gt; that Big Tech companies will dish out about $3 trillion on AI infrastructure through 2028, with their own cash flows covering only half of that.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"If the market for artificial intelligence were even to steady in its growth, pretty quickly we will have over-built capacity, and the debt will be worthless, and the financial institutions will lose money," Luria said.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twenty-five years ago, the original dot-com bubble burst after, among other factors, debt financing built out fiber-optic cables for a future that had not yet arrived, said Luria, a lesson, it appears, tech companies are not worried about repeating.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"If we get to the point after spending hundreds of billions of dollars on data centers that we don't need a few years from now, then we're talking about another financial crisis," he said.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Circular deals raise even more concern&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another aspect of the over-heated AI landscape that is raising eyebrows is the circular nature of investments.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a recent $100 billion &lt;a class="Link" href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/openai-and-nvidia-announce-strategic-partnership-to-deploy-10gw-of-nvidia-systems" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;deal&lt;/a&gt; between Nvidia and OpenAI.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nvidia will pump that amount into OpenAI to bankroll data centers. OpenAI will then fill those facilities with Nvidia's chips. Some analysts say this structure, where Nvidia is essentially subsidizing one of its biggest customers, artificially inflates actual demand for AI.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The idea is I'm Nvidia and I want OpenAI to buy more of my chips, so I give them money to do it," Kedrosky said. "It's fairly common at a small scale, but it's unusual to see it in the tens and hundreds of billions of dollars," noting that the last time it was prevalent was during the dot-com bubble.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/picture&gt;
      &lt;p class="Figure-caption"&gt;Open AI CEO Sam Altman speaks during Snowflake Summit 2025 at Moscone Center in June.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="Figure-credit-container"&gt;&lt;p&gt;(&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Figure-credit"&gt;Justin Sullivan&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Figure-divider"&gt;/&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Figure-source"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;


  
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lesser-known companies are getting in on the action, too.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CoreWeave, once a crypto mining startup, pivoted to data center building to ride the AI boom. Major AI companies are turning to CoreWeave to train and run their AI models.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OpenAI has entered deals with CoreWeave worth tens of billions of dollars in which CoreWeave's chip capacity in data centers is rented out to OpenAI in exchange for stock in CoreWeave, and OpenAI, in turn, could use that stock to pay its CoreWeave renting fees.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nvidia, meanwhile, which also owns part of CoreWeave, has a deal guaranteeing that Nvidia will gobble up any unused data center capacity through 2032.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The danger," said the MIT economist Acemoglu,"is that these kinds of deals eventually reveal a house of cards."
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Some high profile investors see bubble-popping on the horizon&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some influential investors are showing signs of bubble jitters.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tech billionaire Peter Thiel &lt;a class="Link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-17/peter-thiel-s-fund-sold-off-entire-nvidia-stake-in-third-quarter" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;sold off&lt;/a&gt; his entire stake in Nvidia worth around $100 million earlier this month. That came after SoftBank sold a nearly $6 billion stake in Nvidia.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in recent weeks, AI bubble pessimists have rallied around Michael Burry, the hedge-fund investor who made hundreds of millions of dollars betting against the housing market in 2008. He was the subject of the 2015 film &lt;i&gt;The Big Short&lt;/i&gt;. Since then, though, he's had a mixed reputation for market predictions, having warned about imminent collapses that never came to pass.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For what it's worth, Burry is now betting against Nvidia, accusing the AI industry of hiding behind a bunch of fancy accounting tricks. He's homed in the circular deals between companies.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"True end demand is ridiculously small. Almost all customers are funded by their dealers," Burry &lt;a class="Link" href="https://x.com/michaeljburry/status/1991292814647259297" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;wrote &lt;/a&gt;on X. He later &lt;a class="Link" href="https://x.com/michaeljburry/status/1991312209322913805" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt;: "OpenAI is the linchpin here. Can anyone name their auditor?"
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As tech companies sink billions into data centers, some executives themselves are freely admitting there looks to be some over exuberance.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OpenAI CEO Sam Altman &lt;a class="Link" href="https://fortune.com/2025/08/19/wall-street-ai-bubble-sam-altman/" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;told reporters&lt;/a&gt; in August: "Are we in a phase where investors as a whole are overexcited about AI? My opinion is yes. Is AI the most important thing to happen in a very long time? My opinion is also yes."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Google chief executive Sundar Pichai &lt;a class="Link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYx63PKKPvg" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;told the BBC&lt;/a&gt; recently that "there are elements of irrationality" in the AI market right now.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked how Google would fare if the bubble burst, Pichai responded: "I think no company is going to be immune, including us."

In an interview with the Times of India, Dr Minakshi Bisen, Ayurvedic expert at Traya Health (B.A.M.S., PGDCC), explained, “The cold season naturally elevates the Vata (air/ether) and Kapha (water/earth) doshas, which can significantly dampen Agni (digestive fire). While the cold weather increases the appetite, eating improperly can lead to sluggishness, gas, and the accumulation of toxins, known as Ama, weakening gut health. Therefore, Ayurveda recommends focusing on practices and foods that are inherently warming and easily digestible.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, winter is not just a time for soups and shawls, it is a season to consciously nurture your digestion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Bloated tummy woes?

Two more cases are still being evaluated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials have also confirmed that one or more of these students did attend school or school activities while infectious during school hours on November 14, 17 and 18 and a school play on Saturday on November 15.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We did have a wastewater test indicate the presence of measles in the community on November 6, and with cases existing in other parts of the state, we weren’t surprised to see cases here," said health department director Jonelle Fitzgerald. “The cases we have confirmed at the high school are not connected to each other, and because of that, we suspect that other cases may start to pop up in the community."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are the first confirmed cases of Measles in Wasatch County.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials also state that immediate action is being taken to investigate the circumstances and to limit further spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles vaccine recommendations:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="rte2-style-ul"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Children&lt;/b&gt; should receive two doses of measles vaccine: one dose at 12 to 15 months of age and another at 4 to 6 years. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Adults born before 1957&lt;/b&gt; generally do not need to be vaccinated because they are likely already immune to measles due to widespread infection and illness before the measles vaccine became available in 1963. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Adults who were vaccinated before 1968&lt;/b&gt; should have a second dose because the vaccine used from 1963–1967 was less effective than the current vaccine, which became available in 1968. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Adults who were vaccinated in 1968 or later&lt;/b&gt; are considered fully protected whether they have one or two doses, though certain higher risk groups (college students, healthcare workers, international travelers) should have two doses.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

Your hands are busy, your mind is free, and the brain goes wandering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="63"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="64"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="65"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Big Bang Theory and the pop-culture parable of presence &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="66"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This idea even made its way into sitcom canon. In &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://bigbangtrans.wordpress.com/series-9-episode-09-the-platonic-permutation/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;The Big Bang Theory &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Season 9, Episode 9, “The Platonic Permutation”), Howard tries to lie his way out of volunteering at a Thanksgiving soup kitchen. After being caught and dragged along, the gang ends up stuck with the most mundane task of all: washing dishes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="72"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Raj, unfazed, delivers an unexpectedly sincere monologue as Howard grumbles beside him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="74"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; “You know,” he says, “I read that washing dishes can be an excellent form of meditation. The key is that while washing the dishes one should only be washing the dishes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="76"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; He explains the whole thing: staying present with the warm water, the smell of soap, the clink of plates, the rhythm of breath. “It’s about simply being.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="80"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later, Howard unexpectedly meets Elon Musk at the soup kitchen where they bonded over washing dishes together and shared a partially eaten piece of pumpkin pie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="84"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s a rare moment in a sitcom that’s mostly about particle physics and sarcasm, but Raj’s point echoes real empirical work, from a 2015 Florida State University study showing how mindful dishwashing can measurably improve mood and focus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="87"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="88"&gt;&lt;h2&gt; What science says happens to your brain when you wash dishes &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="89"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2015, researchers at Florida State University &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12671-014-0360-9" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;published a study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; in the journal &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Mindfulness&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; that remains one of the clearest demonstrations of the mental impact of washing dishes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="95"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lead researcher Adam Hanley divided 51 participants into two groups. One group read a meditation-focused text that encouraged them to experience the sensations of dishwashing fully, the warmth of the water, the smell of detergent, the slickness of soap and the weight of each plate. “While washing the dishes one should be completely aware of the fact that one is washing the dishes,” they were told.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="99"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; The other read factual instructions on how to do washing up without explicitly encouraging them to focus their awareness on the sensations it produces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="101"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; The results were striking:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="103"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="104"&gt;&lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt; The mindfulness group saw a 27% reduction in nervousness.&lt;br&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; They also reported a 25% increase in “inspiration,”  after just six minutes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt; “It is interesting to note that a task potentially construed as unpleasant or a ‘chore’ can be experienced as reducing nervousness and being inspirational,” the authors concluded, simply by shifting one’s attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="107"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Beyond mood, housework has also been linked to longer-term cognitive benefits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10242587/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Research shows&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; that older adults, especially those over 80, who engage in routine chores tend to show better general cognitive functioning and memory recall. Neuroimaging studies confirm that household physical activity correlates with greater grey matter volume in the frontal lobe and hippocampus, both vital for memory and decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="111"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Quiet, repetitive effort, it seems, keeps the mind supple.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="114"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="115"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="116"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The misunderstood superpower of boredom &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="117"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Boredom isn’t the enemy modern culture makes it out to be. It’s often the doorway to creativity. When you’re doing something dull and repetitive, the brain pivots into its internal world, sorting memories, resolving ideas, stitching together loose thoughts into something usable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="119"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; This is why a simple sink full of dishes can become a quiet incubator for clarity. While your hands move automatically, the deeper parts of your mind roam freely. Scientists argue that this is when the brain is at its most inventive, the moment just before a problem unknots itself or a new idea forms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="123"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;So the Next Time You See a Pile of Dishes…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="125"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don’t dread it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="127"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dive in, as Gates does.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="129"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rinse, scrub, stack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="131"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let the warm water run and let your thoughts drift.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="133"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;You might just solve a problem you’ve been stuck on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="135"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;You might get an idea you weren’t expecting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="137"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;And as Bezos, Gates, Obama and Agatha Christie have all demonstrated in their own ways, the humblest domestic chore might be one of the most powerful things you can do for your mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="139"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Sun, 23 Nov 2025 00:03:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>你六岁的孩子像青少年一样争吵吗？欢迎来到摆动牙齿的青春期-印度时报</title><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/parenting/is-your-six-year-old-arguing-like-a-teen-welcome-to-wobbly-tooth-puberty/articleshow/125508937.cms</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;p&gt;At three, Jas Suri was a timid boy who used to get teary-eyed when he had to let go of his mom Mishika’s hand at the school gate. Even at the age of five, he just needed one instruction and he would clean his room, arrange his toys and get ready for classes. Mishika used to secretly thank God for giving her such an obedient son. These days, she prays for a little cooperation. “Something flipped when he turned six. He just stopped listening to me. Now if I ask him to study or eat or pick up his clothes, he says ‘later’ or flatly refuses,” says the Juhu mom. “I don’t know how to react. It’s like he is seven going on 17.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mishika isn’t the only mom who is struggling with her child’s sass. While parents are mentally prepared for sleepless nights with babies, toddler tantrums and teenage drama, most are caught unawares by the mini rebellions of middle childhood (six to 10 years). Scientists are now calling this phase ‘wobbly-tooth puberty’ (a literal translation of the German word Wackelzahnpubertät) as it is akin to the real pubertal phase. German magazine Wunderkind says this stage is marked by “aggressive behaviour, rebellious activism, and deep sadness.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rahela Tayebbi, a parent coach and mom-to-two (boys aged six and 10), admits this phase is way tougher than the toddler years. “When the boys were little, I could lay certain boundaries. Now, they push back so much. It has become a battle to impose even basic rules,” she says. The Indore resident reveals that these days when she announces that TV time is up and hides the remote above the cupboard, the boys climb a stool and retrieve it. “My younger one also rejects food made at home and insists I order pizza. When I tell him we order only on weekends, he argues that his friends get pizza whenever they want. There is drama almost daily now,” she adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The forgotten years&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;While infancy and adolescence are now well-understood, middle childhood has been long neglected and psychologists call it the ‘forgotten years’. But new research is taking place and experts have found that while adolescent rebellion is driven by hormonal changes, ‘wobbly-tooth puberty’ is caused by drastic changes in the brain as it lays the foundation for more mature thoughts and feelings. During this phase, their identity is forming (“Who am I compared to others?”) and their logical reasoning and cause-and-effect thinking develop. That’s why this stage is referred to as l’âge de raison (the age of reason) in France, notes David Robinson in an article for the BBC. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;For parents, this means dealing with more attitude, mood swings and sudden outbursts. Mumbai mom Parul Gupta is finding the rudeness too much to handle. Her six-year-old daughter Niya snaps at her often and says, “Aap jao, mujhe aapse baat nahi karni (Go away…I don’t want to talk to you).” The homemaker adds, “I can understand my 12-year-old son saying such lines because he is going through puberty and his hormones are all over the place, but it breaks my heart when my baby talks like that.” Gupta says Niya has started comparing herself to her elder brother a lot. So, if he is watching TV and she asks Niya to brush, change and sleep, she puts up a big fight (“Why should I go to bed now?”)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Little people, big feelings&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers have found that from the age of four, children gradually develop a ‘theory of mind’ which basically means they are able to understand that other people have feelings and perspectives that may be different from their own. This is also linked to development of a conscience as it allows them to reason about moral dilemmas and experience guilt. Neena Bhatt (name changed) realised this recently when her seven-year-old spilled a secret that had been troubling her. Renee admitted that when the teacher asked what they had done over the weekend, she spoke about a thrilling family treasure hunt. Turns out, Riya had heard about this treasure hunt in an audio story and decided to tell her teacher that she and her sister had played this with their parents instead of saying they just spent the weekend watching TV and reading books. “Riya also admitted that one day when a child told the teacher about a death in the family, she too said that her grandfather had passed away recently to gain their sympathy. Her grandpa had actually passed away years before her birth so, she has never really felt bad about the loss,” says Bhatt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The graphic designer realised her daughter was simply adding masala to her stories or telling white lies to gain attention. “While exaggerating is not exactly a wrong thing or hurting anyone, I was confused about how to react. If I dismiss it as ‘no big deal’, she may lie about bigger things tomorrow,” says Bhatt, adding that she told Renee to stick to the facts then. “I realised that she had developed a conscience and that it was now pricking her about lying which is a good thing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Connect, correct and control&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parenting experts believe that one of the reasons kids struggle in middle childhood is because parents start thinking they are all grown up and don’t need as much attention as they did when they were babies. “Parents tend to give up a little when the kid crosses six years. The child starts looking bigger and we think that they have grown up, now I can do whatever I want to do. It's a very normal feeling,” says parenting researcher Harpreet Grover. He points out that parents need to remember that while kids aged six and above are big enough to understand the world around them, they are not big enough to make their own choices. “It is like the milk teeth have fallen, but the new teeth will take a lot of time to come, so the kids need us as much as before,” says Grover.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;He adds that the “agenda of the world” calls out to the child a lot as they transition from babies to pre-teens and they are lured by everything around them, so the parents need to be super vigilant. “This is the age when kids want to use the mobile phone and play video games. It is the parent’s role to not allow mobile as a companion and stop the kids from playing video games like Roblox which have so much sexual violence,” says Grover, who goes by the name ‘The Curious Parent’ online. He says the onus is on parents to keep the child healthy physically by letting them play and ensuring right nutrition, and mentally by ensuring they're involved with life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tayebbi advises parents to not take the child’s attitude personally. “I remember when we attended the school book fair and my son wanted to buy a book, I said ‘no’ because the book was available for a lesser price on Amazon. He got very angry and said: ‘Aapko to har cheez mein problem hai (You have a problem with everything)’,” she recalls. “Over time, I realised that I should not feel bad because he is just growing up and becoming more expressive. We just need to be prepared to give more logic to convince our kids now.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Sat, 22 Nov 2025 23:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>最好的补充剂是什么？关于哪些有效哪些无效的专家建议-《南华早报》</title><link>https://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/health-wellness/article/3333493/what-are-best-supplements-expert-advice-what-works-and-what-doesnt</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="er6t7fe38 css-19sk4h4 e1pqt1t0" data-qa="ContentBody-ContentBodyContainer"&gt;&lt;p class="js-reading-0-percent-completion-tracker css-19icq8a ekyy9du0" data-qa="useTrackViewedPercentageRender-trackViewedPercentageRenders-TrackPercentageBlock"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p datatype="p" data-qa="Component-Component" class="e8zc9q40 css-1c6uqr6 ec74h0k1"&gt;An obsession with dietary supplements is a relatively recent trend, tied to a spike in social media promotion and a growing interest in longevity, and perhaps partly driven by the seductive idea of a “silver bullet” for an ageing population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p datatype="p" data-qa="Component-Component" class="e8zc9q40 css-1c6uqr6 ec74h0k1"&gt;Supplements are a serious business: the global market is expected to more than double from US$203 billion last year to US$454 billion by 2035.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p datatype="p" data-qa="Component-Component" class="e8zc9q40 css-1c6uqr6 ec74h0k1"&gt;A-list celebrities Jennifer Aniston, Hailey Bieber, David Beckham, Joe Rogan and others endorse supplements that range from protein powders to longevity and brain health boosters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p datatype="p" data-qa="Component-Component" class="e8zc9q40 css-1c6uqr6 ec74h0k1"&gt;Among the fastest-growing supplement categories are those that claim to support cognitive health, including nootropics such as creatine and omega-3 fatty acids, and adaptogens – herbs and plants thought to help the body resist stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p datatype="p" data-qa="Component-Component" class="e8zc9q40 css-1c6uqr6 ec74h0k1"&gt;Gut-health solutions and probiotics are also in high demand, as are beauty supplements such as collagen and hyaluronic acid that are said to boost skin health.

for family drama.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Many families love sticking to traditional meals during the holidays, it’s comforting, and familiar&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Family sharing Thanksgiving dinner with roast turkey and side dishes, highlighting in-laws making fun of woman during holiday meal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p

deeply attached to their traditional favorites&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;When someone says Turkey, most people picture Thanksgiving feasts and tables overflowing with comfort food, the same way hearing Christmas instantly brings to mind gingerbread, plum cakes, and hot chocolate. Food has this magical ability to anchor us to traditions almost instantly. Across cultures, festive dishes become part of the celebration itself, so much so that the holiday feels incomplete without them. Every country has dishes that show up only once a year, making them even more special. It’s amazing how the world celebrates its festivals with a plate in hand.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Desserts follow the same universal rule: no celebration feels whole without something sweet. In many regions, every festival is practically defined by its signature &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cnbctv18.com/market/commodities/india-mithai-sweets-industry-evolving-expanding-experts-19477014.htm" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener nofollow"&gt;&lt;span&gt;dessert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. India is a perfect example, where each celebration has its own sweet tradition. During Holi, families prepare colorful treats that match the vibrancy of the festival. Diwali turns the entire country into a glowing marketplace of mithai boxes. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;According to Statista, the Confectionery &amp;amp; Snacks industry is &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.statista.com/outlook/cmo/food/confectionery-snacks/india?srsltid=AfmBOooXZG2kRwZBMDF78noxEBvMJqsZEsgpRysOMqzWAVHLBI_-12fE" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener nofollow"&gt;&lt;span&gt;enormous&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; and still growing. Revenue in 2025 alone is projected to reach US$23.67 billion. The market is expected to grow annually by 6.31% between 2025 and 2030. By 2030, the total volume is predicted to reach 5.85 billion kilograms. Even 2026 is projected to show a volume growth of 3.8%. All these numbers show just how big and competitive this market really is. People love their snacks and sweets, and demand isn’t slowing down. The industry is evolving quickly, fueled by both tradition and innovation. With stats like these, it’s clear this is a massive space to enter.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In such a huge and traditional market, introducing nontraditional desserts like cakes and brownies isn’t a simple task. People already have strong attachments to the sweets they grew up with. Winning their trust requires patience, creativity, and a lot of tasting. Today, we spoke with Akshita Agarwal from &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/caramella_by_akshita/?hl=en" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener nofollow"&gt;&lt;span&gt;caramella_by_akshita&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, a brand that has carved a space for itself in Kolkata. She specializes in premium artisanal tiramisus and modern desserts. Her journey shows how passion can blend beautifully with innovation. Competing in a mithai-driven landscape is bold, but she has managed to make her mark. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“People absolutely love gulab jamun and ladoos, those are always the first choices for gifting,” Akshita shared. “These classics have been around for so many years that they feel familiar and safe.” She explained how deeply emotional and nostalgic people are about these sweets. They remind them of festivals spent with family, childhood celebrations, and happy moments. For many, these flavors are part of their identity. Getting customers to explore something new was definitely a challenge. Traditional mithai has a charm that’s hard to shake. But rather than fighting this, she chose to understand it. Respecting those preferences became step one.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;It’s always exciting when the older generation is willing to try something new&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“In the beginning, convincing people to try different desserts was tricky,” she laughed. “So we started really small, offering free samples just to break the ice.” Gen Z instantly connected with the brand, but older generations needed more time. They already knew their favorite sweets and rarely stepped outside them. To bridge that gap, she started experimenting with fusion-style creations. Ras Malai Cake, Gulab Jamun Cake Jars and similar flavors soon appeared on the menu. These blends quickly caught people’s attention and became instant favorites. Customers found comfort in the familiar flavors and excitement in the new form. It was the perfect meeting point between tradition and novelty.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“We realized that dessert isn’t just about taste, it’s tied to emotions,” Akshita said. “People want to hold on to their traditions because they carry memories.” Instead of trying to replace classic mithai, her team decided to blend traditional flavors with modern textures. This approach gave customers something new without losing what they love. It honored their nostalgia while still feeling fresh. By respecting emotional connections, they created desserts that appeal across generations. Slowly, this fusion style started winning hearts everywhere. It proved that tradition and creativity can coexist beautifully.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I believe it’s always best to conclude on a simple thought,” Akshita said with a smile. “Tradition doesn’t have to be replaced to make space for something new.” She emphasized that food evolves the same way people do: slowly, naturally, and with an open mind. Her brand’s journey taught her that blending old and new can create something truly memorable. It’s not about proving one dessert better than another; it’s about expanding the table. She feels that every sweet, whether classic or modern, has its own charm. What matters most is the joy it brings to the person eating it. And if a dessert can spark conversation or curiosity, that’s already a win. For her, that’s the perfect note to wrap things up on.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In this particular scenario, it did feel like the woman’s nontraditional dishes were judged a bit too quickly. It’s understandable that people cling to familiar flavors, but such harsh criticism seems unfair. A little openness never hurts, especially when someone puts effort into cooking. Food has a funny way of changing minds when given a chance. Everyone has different tastes, but kindness should stay constant. And honestly, trying a new dish costs nothing, who knows, it might even become the next family favorite.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Readers were quick to call out her in-laws’ behavior, saying it was rude and uncalled for&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comment criticizing in-laws who make fun of woman for Thanksgiving dinner and say she ruined the holiday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comment expressing support for a woman whose in-laws make fun of her Thanksgiving dinner and say she ruined the holiday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Screenshot of a Reddit comment discussing in-laws making fun of a woman for Thanksgiving dinner, blaming her for ruining the holiday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comment emphasizing self-respect and boundaries when dealing with difficult in-laws during Thanksgiving dinner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;User comment in black text on white background expressing difficulty understanding cruelty in in-laws making fun of woman during Thanksgiving dinner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Screenshot of an online comment with strong language about in-laws making fun of a woman for Thanksgiving dinner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Screenshot of an online comment praising a woman’s husband and her amazing food amid in-laws Thanksgiving conflict.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Screenshot of a comment defending a woman against in-laws making fun of her Thanksgiving dinner, calling them closed off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Commenter supports husband addressing in-laws who made fun of woman and ruined Thanksgiving dinner holiday experience.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div id="postPoll-9674236" class="post-poll poll-wrapper single-post" data-poll-viewed="false" data-post-id="9674236" data-main-post-id="" data-poll-id="19308"&gt; &lt;input class="post-9674236-poll-value" type="hidden" value="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"&gt; &lt;div data-bind="if: isInitialised()"&gt;    &lt;div data-bind="if: !isLoading() &amp;amp;&amp;amp; isShowingResults"&gt; &lt;div class="poll-content"&gt; &lt;h3 class="answered-content-title"&gt;Thanks!

_this_isnt_fine_&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Stress can, indeed, lead to weight gain&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When we are stressed, our bodies create more of a hormone called cortisol,” &lt;a href="https://www.brownhealth.org/be-well/does-stress-cause-weight-gain" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener nofollow"&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt; Dr. Kristy Dalrymple, a licensed clinical psychologist, associate director of the outpatient psychiatry practice at Rhode Island Hospital, and director of adult psychology at Rhode Island and The Miriam hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to her, cortisol is partly responsible for how our body responds to danger, acts as an internal alarm clock for waking up and going to sleep, helps control blood pressure and glucose metabolism, and can reduce inflammation. Some medications use cortisol—known as hydrocortisone—to help reduce inflammation, either topically or systemically, such as over-the-counter creams for swelling and itching from bug bites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Too much or too little cortisol can contribute to certain health conditions, including:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;changes in weight (both gain and loss)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;skin conditions&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;muscle weakness&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;anxiety or depression&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;heart disease&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When we feel stressed—as many of us have for the last few years—our bodies can tip toward releasing too much cortisol, leading to weight gain, acne, trouble sleeping, headaches, and digestive problems,” Dalrymple says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The production of cortisol can also trigger your body to release extra insulin, and together these two hormones can lead your body to storing extra fat around the abdomen. Additionally, for many people, eating comforting foods is one way we respond to stress. The problem is that those foods tend to be less nutritionally valuable for our bodies and contain more calories than our body can expend.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;However, changing or sticking to one’s lifestyle is their own personal choice&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lifestyle choices require motivation to come from within, and if the Redditor isn’t interested in making the effort, her boyfriend can’t force her to lose weight. If anyone, it’s her doctor, not him, who should discuss this topic with her. But judging from the post, there are no health issues—which makes her boyfriend look even worse. In fact, it’s entirely possible that the true reason for his dissatisfaction comes from a deeper place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s true that people value looks in their long-term partners. One &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/09/150916162912.htm" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener nofollow"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; suggests that 92 percent of men and 84 percent of women say it’s “desirable/essential” that their potential partner be good-looking, and 80 percent of men as well as 58 percent of women want them to have a slender body. But since this particular couple is six years into a relationship, the situation is a little different.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When people are asked to list the most important qualities in a potential partner, kindness, physical attractiveness, an exciting personality, and income/earning potential tend to top the list,” &lt;a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/close-encounters/201702/5-essential-qualities-for-a-romantic-partner" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener nofollow"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Gwendolyn Seidman, Ph.D., Associate Professor of Psychology at Michigan State University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But once you’re actually involved in a relationship, some of these traits become more important than others.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Research … found that those whose partners meet their ideals in terms of warmth and loyalty are more satisfied with their relationships. Having a partner who meets one’s ideals in terms of physical attractiveness, excitement, status, and wealth, on the other hand, is much less correlated with overall satisfaction,” Seidman explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Research also found that having a partner who fell short on attractiveness, status, and excitement did not affect satisfaction if that partner was also highly warm, kind, and loyal. In other words, those more ‘superficial’ traits were not important at all for those whose partners were kind, understanding, and loyal.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;People have had a lot to say about the guy and his mean comments&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Screenshot of a social media comment discussing a man requiring his girlfriend to return to her previous weight of 110 pounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comment discussing a man requiring his girlfriend to return to a weight she had six years ago, seen as disturbing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comment criticizing a man for requiring his girlfriend to return to her weight from six years ago seen on a social media post.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comment text on a social media post discussing weight loss and a man requiring his girlfriend to return to her previous weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Screenshot of an online comment discussing a man requiring his girlfriend to return to a previous weight from six years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Commenter expressing strong opposition to a man requiring his girlfriend to return to her former weight six years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Screenshot of a comment discussing a man requiring his girlfriend to return to the weight she was 6 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Screenshot of a Reddit comment discussing a man requiring his girlfriend to return to her previous weight of 110 pounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comment criticizing man who requires girlfriend to return to 110 pounds she weighed six years ago, calling it depressing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comment criticizing a man requiring his girlfriend to return to her previous weight, calling the demand stupid and depressing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comment criticizing a man for requiring his girlfriend to return to her previous weight six years ago, calling him shallow and disgusting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comment on Reddit thread questioning if a man demanding his girlfriend return to a past weight is acceptable or okay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reddit comment criticizing a man who requires his girlfriend to return to her weight of 110 pounds from six years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comment about metabolism and weight gain, criticizing a man requiring his girlfriend to return to 110 pounds from six years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comment discussing the emotional impact of requiring a girlfriend to return to a past weight after gaining 10 pounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Screenshot of a social media comment about a man requiring his girlfriend to return to her previous weight of 110 pounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comment on a weight loss demand, urging to avoid toxic partners and focus on self-respect and health over past weights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reddit comment discussing emotional impact of man requiring girlfriend to return to previous weight from six years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Screenshot of a comment discussing a man requiring his girlfriend to return to her weight from six years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comment about wife’s weight gain from 100 to 140 pounds, highlighting health and appreciation themes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comment text criticizing a man requiring his girlfriend to return to a weight she had six years ago, discussing body changes and immaturity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comment discussing a man requiring his girlfriend to return to her previous weight, focusing on weight and relationship pressures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comment discussing unhealthy weight demands from a man requiring girlfriend to return to 110 pounds from six years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comment expressing frustration over a man requiring his girlfriend to return to her weight from six years ago causing upset and sadness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Screenshot of an online comment discussing a man requiring his girlfriend to return to the weight she had six years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comment criticizing a man who requires his girlfriend to return to the weight she had six years ago, calling it stupid and depressing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Screenshot of a social media comment criticizing a man who requires his girlfriend to return to her weight from six years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comment discussing relationship weight and partner's expectations about returning to a previous weight six years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comment about control and insecurity in a discussion on a man requiring girlfriend to return to former weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Screenshot of a Reddit comment discussing stress eating and criticizing a man for requiring his girlfriend to return to a past weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comment text expressing anger at a man requiring his girlfriend to return to 110 pounds she weighed six years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

Never.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Also Read: &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/lonely-not-married-happily-single-peace_n_6919e26de4b0b43a45c0cc95?utm_campaign=yahoo-recirc" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:I Was Eating Alone When A Man Came Up And Said 4 Words That Have Haunted Me Throughout My Life;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;I Was Eating Alone When A Man Came Up And Said 4 Words That Have Haunted Me Throughout My Life&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Of course you do,” I nearly replied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Everyone burps... don’t they?&lt;/em&gt; I thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, I asked, “Well, does that bother you?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Sort of,” he said, shrugging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Family: &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/toddler-tantrums-speech-pathologist-advice_l_68111524e4b0188fc5dab6b0?utm_campaign=yahoo-recirc" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:3 Surprisingly Simple Tricks for Deescalating And Preventing Toddler Tantrums;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;3 Surprisingly Simple Tricks for Deescalating And Preventing Toddler Tantrums&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We returned to our dinner, but his comment remained in the back of my mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Is it even possible that a person just &lt;/em&gt;can’t &lt;em&gt;burp?&lt;/em&gt; I wondered. &lt;em&gt;And, if so, does it even matter?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m not usually a worrier, and I have been guilty of trying to wait things out rather than take my kids to the doctor, not always with good results. One child turned out to have terrible strep and another one was experiencing a bad bout of pneumonia. But, in this case, because it was such an unusual comment, my mom instincts instantly kicked in. I wanted to know if this was a serious issue and, if so, what could be done to fix it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I decided to see what Google had to say on the subject, and it turns out that yes, it is possible that people can’t burp, and yes, it most definitely matters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;The author with Gavin at his college graduation in 2025. &lt;span class="copyright"&gt;Courtesy of Gretchen Scherer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Columbia University Irving Medical Center, the medical name for the inability to burp is &lt;a href="https://www.columbiadoctors.org/news/what-happens-when-you-cannot-burp" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:retrograde cricopharyngeus dysfunction;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;retrograde cricopharyngeus dysfunction&lt;/a&gt; (R-CPD), which is informally known as no-burp syndrome. The diagnosis did not exist before 2019, and instead sufferers were often incorrectly diagnosed with acid reflux, irritable bowel disease or other digestive problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When most people need to let a buildup of air escape from their stomach, the cricopharyngeus muscle relaxes and allows the air to vacate. For reasons that are still somewhat mysterious, some individuals’ cricopharyngeus muscle stays tensed, so they never burp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Also Read: &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/son-picky-eater-arfid-therapy_n_68791c50e4b09816d316744f?utm_campaign=yahoo-recirc" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:I Couldn't Get My Son To Eat Anything.

I Thought He Was Just Picky — But The Truth Was Much More Serious.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The more I thought about it, the more I realized all of the ways in which Gavin’s inability to burp had impacted him throughout his life. He was a terrible spitter-upper as a baby, and he was always more of a snacker than an eater. When he was older, he rarely drank soda, especially out of a can. He also had a reputation in our family for being able to clear a room with his farts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was the smallest of our three boys, and even at the peak of his growth spurt, while he was logging endless miles as a cross-country runner, he only ever ate a small amount of food at each sitting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was common to hear Gavin say he was full after eating only half his meal. No matter how much he loved cheeseburgers, half of it would sit on his plate uneaten. Then, two hours later, he would ask me for another dinner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If I’m being honest, I didn’t always hide my frustration with those requests. But, luckily for both of us, I was always willing to at least make him a peanut butter and jelly sandwich (otherwise I would be wracked with guilt right now).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Also Read: &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/dating-men-women-bisexual-lesbian_n_68e7c3d9e4b0b4458cb74288?utm_campaign=yahoo-recirc" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:When Straight Women Find Out I'm Bisexual, There's 1 Big Misconception I Often Have To Clear Up;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;When Straight Women Find Out I'm Bisexual, There's 1 Big Misconception I Often Have To Clear Up&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although no-burp syndrome is considered relatively rare, people who suffer from it often deal with significant symptoms. Severe bloating, throat gurgling, and terrible flatulence are some of the persistent issues, and they often become worse as a person gets older. The side effects of R-CPD can cause social anxiety and significantly impact quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few weeks after Gavin made that offhanded comment at dinner, he had his annual checkup with his pediatrician. I made sure he raised the burping issue, and Gavin described his symptoms. Unfortunately, his doctor said he’d never heard of R-CPD. Since Gavin was leaving for college the next week, we let it go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, when Gavin came home at Christmas several months later, he brought it up again. The coping methods he had used before — frequently eating small portions and avoiding carbonated beverages — weren’t as easy to maintain at college. Along with experiencing severe bloating, he now found himself occasionally throwing up. He wanted the problem solved, and I was becoming increasingly concerned about how R-CPD could impact him as he got older, so I kept researching.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you google the condition today, an AI overview will tell you everything you need to know. But even just a few years ago, it was incredibly difficult to find a solution, and some of the articles and videos I did find made me worry that it could be doing severe damage to Gavin’s health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Also Read: &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/megyn-kelly-epstein-pedophile-grooming-assault_n_691b4443e4b0023259f639c4?utm_campaign=yahoo-recirc" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:I Was 16 When A Grown Man Groomed And Sexually Assaulted Me. I've Kept This Secret For 30 Years — Until Now.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;I Was 16 When A Grown Man Groomed And Sexually Assaulted Me. I've Kept This Secret For 30 Years — Until Now.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Luckily, a friend of Gavin’s told us about a clinic near Chicago that had pioneered an experimental treatment designed to treat R-CPD by injecting Botox into the throat. We learned that the drug releases the cricopharyngeal sphincter and allows the patient to retrain the sphincter as the injectable slowly wears off. The success rate for a single procedure, which involves three shots, is over 80%, with nearly 20% needing a second procedure in order to be cured.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Armed with that information, I wasted no time trying to find a doctor in Minneapolis that could perform the procedure. Before Gavin returned to the University of Wisconsin for his second semester, I had found a local physician trained to do the throat injections, and I was able to get him evaluated. The doctor numbed Gavin’s throat and performed an endoscopy. Based on that and an evaluation of Gavin’s symptoms, the doctor determined that Gavin most likely did have R-CPD and would be a great candidate for the Botox procedure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gavin headed back to college, and we began the process of getting the injections approved by the insurance company. Our hope was to have the procedure done in Minneapolis, but our insurance rejected the request because the FDA has not approved Botox for this purpose. I made many calls over the next several months to our insurance company, the Minneapolis clinic, and the clinic in Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I finally found a workaround by paying out-of-pocket for the Botox (around $600), so it wasn’t submitted as part of our insurance claim. The rest of the procedure was approved, and, in our case, was 80% covered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two days after finishing his spring exams, Gavin was on his way to the clinic in Chicago because they could see him almost immediately. Once he was there, Gavin underwent another endoscopy, watched a video that explained the procedure, and consulted with a doctor. The next morning, Gavin was put under with general anesthesia and was given three injections of Botox in his throat. Everything went smoothly, and Gavin and his dad were on their way home by 11:30 a.m. that day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;The author's son, Gavin, chugging orange soda. &lt;span class="copyright"&gt;Courtesy of Gretchen Scherer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The worst side effect from the treatment was some temporary discomfort. For the first couple of months, the esophageal sphincter is completely open, and Gavin initially described the feeling in his throat as “a little weird.” Within 24 hours, he started experiencing “micro burps,” which is the first step in retraining the cricopharyngeal sphincter. Some people also experience occasional regurgitation as they practice burping during that first week.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Patients are encouraged to burp as much as possible, so we gave Gavin full permission to burp anytime, anywhere. For most of that summer, burping was his new party trick for friends and family.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Three years after the procedure, Gavin is still burping strong, although he hasn’t quite mastered the alphabet yet. His sphincter is now completely retrained. Gavin said the procedure has been life-changing. Almost immediately, he was able to wolf down entire cheeseburgers for the first time, and the ability to drink carbonated beverages at college parties is a definite plus. I notice that he is happier in general and more energetic because he is not distracted by the discomfort that often came with eating.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I am relieved that we were able to find a solution. My Google searches had turned up stories of the extreme discomfort that some people have to live with on a daily basis. Fortunately, Gavin’s symptoms fell more on the mild to medium side of the spectrum.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The more I tell people about Gavin’s story, the less “rare” R-CPD seems. In fact, it may be more common than originally thought; at least two of my son’s friends have the same issue and one also had the procedure in Chicago. However, very few doctors are familiar with the condition and may not know enough to ask the questions that could lead to a diagnosis. Parents&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; may not even notice that a child who burped fine as a baby stopped burping as they got older.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This journey has reminded me of several important truths about being a parent. &lt;span&gt;First, don’t ignore complaints your kids make about their health — even those that seem small or nonchalant. I could have easily shrugged off Gavin’s initial comment, and I’m so glad I didn’t. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Second, doctors don’t know everything. Gavin’s pediatrician is fantastic, but he was even less familiar with no-burp syndrome than I was. I felt a little sheepish questioning him about it, but I’m really glad I kept looking for information and pushing for an answer. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Finally, don’t automatically take no for an answer from your insurance company. It took time and persistence to get an approval for (most of) Gavin’s procedure, but it was absolutely worth it in the end. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;There are a lot of things I’ve gotten wrong as a parent, but thankfully, this is one of the times I got things absolutely right — and Gavin would love nothing more than to take a big swig of beer and show you himself. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gretchen Scherer is a mother, English teacher, and sometimes writer living in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Her essays and travel articles have appeared in Salon.com, The St. Paul Pioneer Press, Minnesota Monthly Magazine, and a few anthologies. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Do you have a compelling personal story you’d like to see published on HuffPost?
