            Falling childhood vaccine coverage and a large, smoldering outbreak that was kindled in an undervaccinated pocket of West Texas have driven the United States to a troubling new milestone: There have been more measles cases in the US this year than any other since the disease was declared eliminated a quarter-century ago.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmclu6mn600043b6mvzj71np5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There have been at least 1,277 confirmed cases of measles reported in the US in 2025, according to &lt;a href="https://cori.centerforhealthsecurity.org/resources/measles-outbreak-response" target="_blank"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt; from the Johns Hopkins University Center for Outbreak Response Innovation. Just halfway through the year, the case tally has already surpassed the last record from 2019, when there were a total of 1,274 cases.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmclu6mn600053b6mz9tcsdpg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Experts say this year’s cases are likely to be severely undercounted because many are going unreported. Three people have died from measles this year – two children in Texas and one adult in New Mexico, all of whom were unvaccinated – matching the total number of US measles deaths from the previous two and a half decades.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmclu6mn600063b6m1x9vi8r9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Measles was declared eliminated in the US in 2000, meaning there has not been continuous transmission for more than a year at a time. Reaching this status was “a historic public health achievement,” according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, possible in large part because of vaccine development. The measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine that is most commonly used first became widely available in the US in the 1970s.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmclu6mn600073b6ml1mxlwsj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Before this year, there have been an average of about 180 measles cases reported each year since the disease was declared eliminated, according to CDC data.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmclu6mn600083b6m59sk5tgf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In 2019, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/10/health/measles-outbreak-new-york-2019-lessons-learned"&gt;large outbreaks in New York&lt;/a&gt; threatened elimination status; those outbreaks were concentrated in Orthodox Jewish communities in Brooklyn and Rockland County that had been targeted with anti-vaccine disinformation for years.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmclu6mn600093b6m12z6cerq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This year, the vast majority of measles cases have been in Texas, with more than 750 confirmed cases associated with one outbreak that started in late January. If cases associated with that outbreak continue to accumulate through January of next year, the US could lose its measles elimination status.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmclzqcig00043b6me94k1xsq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Most of those cases – more than 400 since the start of the year – have been in Gaines County, according to &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025" target="_blank"&gt;the state health department&lt;/a&gt;, where vaccination rates are well below the recommended level. In the 2024-25 school year, nearly 1 in 4 kindergartners in Gaines County did not have their required MMR vaccine, one of the worst rates in the state.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmclu6mn6000d3b6mr6rd7glk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dozens of cases in New Mexico and Oklahoma have also been linked to the West Texas outbreak, and cases reported in Kansas may also be connected.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmclu6mn6000e3b6mwlqq7hxx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Special &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/04/health/measles-wastewater-us-spread"&gt;vaccination clinics&lt;/a&gt; that have been stood up in response to the outbreak have led to additional coverage for thousands of people. Many of the affected counties have also introduced expanded vaccination guidance, allowing infants to get their first shot as early as 6 months old instead of waiting until 1 year. In New Mexico, nearly twice as many MMR vaccines have been administered this year than there were at this point last year, according to &lt;a href="https://www.nmhealth.org/about/erd/ideb/mog/" target="_blank"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt; from the state health department.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm9daul00033b6mxtsnbbg9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            And a recent &lt;a href="https://www.truveta.com/blog/research/research-insights/2025-early-measles-vaccinations-in-texas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt; of health records by Truveta, a health-care data and analytics company, shows that early vaccination rates jumped among infants in Texas. MMR vaccination rates among 6-month-olds in Texas this year are more than eight times higher than they were in 2019, and in March and April, about 1 in 5 children who received their first measles shot in Texas had gotten it early, before their first birthday.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmclu6mn6000f3b6m83kjht4y@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But as the pace of new cases associated with the West Texas outbreak has slowed, cases have continued to accumulate across the country. There have been at least 27  total outbreaks – defined as three or more related cases – and at least 38&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;states have reported at least one case this year.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmclu6mn6000g3b6m38c8hbxs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Cases rose quickly in Colorado last month when an out-of-state traveler flew while infectious, leading to multiple cases among passengers on the same plane, and others among people who were in the airport at the same time and broader community spread from those cases.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmclu6mn6000h3b6mlz4c0a63@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Other cases among Colorado residents were linked to travel to Chihuahua, Mexico, where there is also a large outbreak concentrated among the local Mennonite population. There is another large outbreak happening in Ontario, Canada, which was linked to multiple cases in Michigan. At least one person has &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/06/health/measles-deaths-canada-mexico"&gt;died from measles&lt;/a&gt; this year in Canada, and there have been nine deaths in Mexico.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmclu6mn6000i3b6muv2fb8p8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In April, Mexico issued a &lt;a href="https://www.gob.mx/cms/uploads/attachment/file/992760/APV-EEUU-EEUU-CANADA-Sarampion_20250425_english.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;warning&lt;/a&gt; for people traveling to the US and Canada due to high measles case rates. The CDC has also stepped up its guidance for travelers, advising that anyone traveling internationally should be vaccinated with two doses of the MMR vaccine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmclu6mn6000j3b6mr0910te8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The vast majority of cases in the US this year have been in people who are unvaccinated; only about 8% of confirmed cases have been in people who had received one or two doses of the MMR vaccine, according to the CDC. At least 155 people with measles – about 1 out of every 8 cases – have been hospitalized this year, CDC data shows, and 28% of cases have been in children younger than 5.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmclui2a300003b6mukid62r6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The MMR vaccine is safe and extremely effective – one dose is 93% effective against measles, and two doses are 97% effective – but measles is one of the most highly transmissible diseases in the world.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmclv0qgb00063b6mk2lk45wd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The US Department of Health and Human Services has set a &lt;a href="https://health.gov/healthypeople/objectives-and-data/browse-objectives/vaccination/maintain-vaccination-coverage-level-2-doses-mmr-vaccine-children-kindergarten-iid-04" target="_blank"&gt;goal&lt;/a&gt; that at least 95% of children in kindergarten will have gotten two doses of the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, a threshold necessary to help prevent outbreaks of the highly contagious disease. The US has now fallen short of that threshold for four years in a row.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmclv0xzz00093b6mer3s8tyc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A &lt;a href="http://cnn.com/2024/10/02/health/measles-vaccine-coverage-kindergarten-school-requirement/index.html"&gt;record share&lt;/a&gt; of US kindergartners had an exemption for required vaccinations in the 2023-24 school year, leaving more than 125,000 new schoolchildren without coverage for at least one state-mandated vaccine, according to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/schoolvaxview/data/index.html?ldkjfdl" target="_blank"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt; published by the CDC in October.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmclu6mn6000k3b6mtrrkcpf9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When the measles case count reached its previous record in 2019 – under the first Trump administration – both the HHS secretary and CDC director at the time released statements emphasizing the safety and effectiveness of the MMR vaccine and encouraging Americans to get vaccinated.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcly58zc000j3b6mywfz9cp0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            However, the CDC still&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;does not have a director, and HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has a &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/12/politics/rfk-jrs-long-complicated-history-with-the-measles-vaccines"&gt;long and complicated history&lt;/a&gt; with measles vaccines.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmclu6mn6000l3b6mxl0cirjl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In April, when there had been about 600 measles cases in the US, Kennedy made his strongest endorsement of vaccination yet – but it stood in stark contrast to years of work against measles vaccines. And last month, Kennedy &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/09/health/rfk-cdc-vaccine-advisers-removed"&gt;dismissed an expert panel of vaccine advisers&lt;/a&gt; that has historically guided the federal government’s vaccine recommendations, a move that concerned public health officials across the country.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmclu6mn6000m3b6mh75ug94j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “With an ongoing measles outbreak and routine child vaccination rates declining, this move will further fuel the spread of vaccine-preventable illnesses,” Dr. Bruce A. Scott, president of the American Medical Association, said in a statement at the time.
    &lt;/p&gt;

A) Generation B) Gigabyte C) Google D) Grid.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;X users were quick to respond with a lot guessing gigabyte wrongly.

During the Covid pandemic, US researchers investigated&lt;span&gt; the effects of radio-frequency radiation generated by the ultra-fast mobile internet and revealed that it had negligible health impacts.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;a target="_self" class="class" href="/sciencetech/article-8510939/Scientific-study-confirms-5G-harmless-benign.html"&gt;The study &lt;/a&gt;came after several 5G masts were vandalized during lockdowns following unfounded conspiracy theories saying the form of wireless communication caused Covid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Theorists claimed the fifth-generation wireless standard emitted radiation that lowers the immune system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite providing essential communications technology during the pandemic, 5G masts were subject to arson attacks throughout the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In their research paper, published in PLOS ONE, the team wrote that the potential for health effects from higher radio-frequency radiation should be examined as concerns 'over their potential health impacts are ongoing'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To learn more, researchers conducted experiments using embryonic zebrafish, an organism often used to discover interactions between potential environmental stressors and biological systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Adult zebrafish in the lab. Around 70 per cent of human genes are found in zebrafish, according to scientists, which makes them well suited as lab models&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The experimental set up used in the experiments for the study.

Redweik had picked up a fungal infection, probably during a visit to Vancouver Island in mid-2016, and there was little doubt he now was near death: He was crashing into walls when he tried to walk and vomiting frequently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="E2CX37KMZ5CNRP3ZJOUANA52OI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“He was probably within a day or two of dying when he got to the hospital,” said Redweik’s wife, Joyce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="D7OIGH5VHNFW3GA6SSOLYE3XSA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Redweik was hospitalized from August to October while doctors blasted the fungus in his system with amphotericin. He&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;lost his hearing and went blind in one eye from the pressure of swelling on critical nerves. His kidneys were damaged by the medication. He couldn’t walk or even swallow, receiving nutrition through a feeding tube in his nose. A former competitive weightlifter, Redweik, who was 58 years old at the time, lost 63 pounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="REY2LD7PBBCNDFNH2SU67ZJSRE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But after six weeks, the amphotericin seemed to have killed the fungus. Laboratory cultures of Redweik’s spinal fluid began to run clear. He started relearning how to walk, swallow and take care of himself. On Oct. 17, he went home to continue recuperating, and a few weeks later, he attended his daughter’s wedding, even walking a few steps down the aisle with her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="SQ3T5C3EKJASLCRNQ6SWCFYCLU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Four days later, though, while sitting on a couch at his home in Arizona, Redweik passed out. At a Tucson hospital, he complained of pain in his eye sockets. The pressure in his brain had soared, and a surgeon there installed a shunt in his head that routed the excess cerebrospinal fluid into his abdomen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="6QNC3DD4MRB4HE6VMEUJ4XQ3IU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But soon, his ability to walk regressed and he lapsed into near-unconsciousness. More amphotericin seemed like the only choice. Yet cultures of his spinal fluid showed definitively the fungus was dead. What good would another round of “amphoterrible” do?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="R6IVR2V5Y5G7JNIUMO3HEIFJUQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Stumped by Redweik’s continuing severe illness, his doctor tracked down a specialist in fungal diseases at the National Institutes of Health who said he knew of cases like Redweik’s. Peter Williamson, chief of the translational mycology section at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, had a hunch about how to treat Redweik. But Redweik needed to come to the NIH’s clinical center, the research hospital for severely ill patients where Williamson worked. Only then was Redweik’s condition identified and treated, saving his life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="Q4O4VGT3RJB2JO7XRMCEZ2HRTA" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="Q4O4VGT3RJB2JO7XRMCEZ2HRTA" data-testid="article-header"&gt;Unbearable headaches&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="P23MVOZXYJBOPL4QQBNM7XOTNE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;When his crushing headaches began in the spring of 2017, Redweik gobbled over-the-counter painkillers and eventually visited the emergency room near his Green Valley, Arizona, home. There he received a common diagnosis for people in hot, dry climates: dehydration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="JDNPEEX4EZEDNKQKMQ46PZ73QQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;He and Joyce didn’t believe it. Redweik had once developed a blood clot in his calf, and they were concerned he had another in his head. They wanted an MRI, but the wait to see a neurologist was four to six months, and Redweik was starting a new job in Plano, Texas, leaving ahead of Joyce, who would join him later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="YVDNFBJTFJDH7FHYSQJKQKMARY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;There, his condition worsened. The headaches were nearly unbearable and had spread down his neck. He began throwing up two or three times a day, and his gait was unsteady.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="BKSCEW3SMZA7FOWJBSNPL4TYCU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“It was like I was intoxicated,” Redweik recalled. “I couldn’t walk steadily. I was hoping people weren’t watching.

By August, Peter Redweik was falling down when he tried to walk. He needed a wheelchair. He finally got in to see a neurologist and had an MRI exam.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="MHEHYRMULZEDBI6JBPF5B3UCYM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;There was no blood clot. But given his condition, Redweik was admitted to the hospital, where tests revealed &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000642.htm" target="_blank"&gt;cryptococcal meningitis&lt;/a&gt;, which, left untreated, can be fatal. He began therapy with amphotericin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="TVOMLTWLIJA2VE3JJS2EZ2P6ZU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The Redweiks had spent their adult lives in the deserts of Arizona and Nevada, so it was unusual that Peter was infected by a fungus, &lt;i&gt;Cryptococcus gattii&lt;/i&gt;, that thrives in a wet, temperate, forested climate. But they had visited Vancouver Island, which had such a climate, the year before, so perhaps that was where Peter was exposed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="4AXBY2J2GBGHRCIXZZGAMRZUXQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;With dangerous pressure building up in his brain, Redweik endured painful lumbar punctures to drain cerebrospinal fluid every few days. Eventually, that procedure was replaced by a lumbar drain installed in his lower back that siphoned off the fluid when the pressure grew too high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="XWTLF3YMWREUXCCYND7WVUMQXI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;After six weeks, laboratory cultures of Redweik’s spinal fluid were negative.

About 1,000 are HIV patients, another 1,000 are people with suppressed immune systems such as transplant recipients, and 1,000 are previously healthy people like Redweik. About a third of the 3,000 die.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="CFBJSDMU5FDMFFPDDOTWDRQHOQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;When Redweik collapsed on his couch and was taken to the hospital again with what seemed like a relapse, his doctors were puzzled. Lab cultures of his spinal fluid showed no evidence of live fungus, but he still showed symptoms of severe meningitis. One test might be wrong, but not several. Should they ignore the results and try to kill the fungus again?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="VJGVXO3OCNHELPFP423TMWDRUA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In a search for that answer, one of Redweik’s physicians found Williamson’s name online and contacted him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="7J6WTGD7JRC3HKEKALVKB7EBEE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;According to Williamson, a subset of the previously healthy patients suffer an autoimmune reaction after the fungus is killed: a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4825797/" target="_blank"&gt;post-infectious inflammatory response syndrome, or PIIRS.&lt;/a&gt; It is not unlike the inflammatory response that has produced long covid in some people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="I7K2QRO56NFDLPJSPSVDRM6I2E" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Williamson was confident that Redweik was one of those patients and his immune system still considered the fungus a threat. It had amped up the various cells that attack invaders, focusing on tiny particles of the fungus — proteins it had released and cell walls that still remained in Redweik’s system after the cryptococcus was vanquished.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="WS7AO25C7NEBNIW6QWQRPNAGSU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;That is what unleashed another round of inflammation and the new symptoms, Williamson theorized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="D6OBDNYWQFFATH6BV5FDAH6U4M" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Redweik was declining quickly when he arrived at the NIH, and Williamson put him on large doses of the steroid methylprednisolone to suppress the immune response, along with the antifungal fluconazole in case the cryptococcus fungus somehow flourished again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="RD77MX2R5REUVNBM6HNZPIW5SY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;It may be that microscopic particles of the fungus were still in Redweik’s brain, triggering swelling and pressure akin to his meningitis as the immune system attacked, according to Williamson. Or perhaps antibodies were able to travel to areas of the brain and produce generalized inflammation, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="GU2UBA56SZAFTJXO2H2JBJWIK4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“It is so counterintuitive,” Williamson said. Doctors “treat again with amphotericin because they don’t know.” But “it’s the delay in diagnosis and the inflammatory response that kills you,” he said. “It’s the edema [swelling] that kills you.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="LAZGJSZ5IJDOJELFF4IPRZPL5U" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;After&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;about three days, Redweik began to respond to the steroids and his symptoms started to fade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ZMZUAIQBWBEJFCCSODN7KNYZJU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The technology available at the NIH hospital for monitoring his immune response was critical to saving him, Williamson said. Advanced flow cytometry allowed doctors to rapidly identify the immune cells in Redweik’s spinal fluid and confirm Williamson’s diagnosis that he was suffering an immune response to the dead fungus, not a recurrence of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="M4LZXT4UYZFGPK5AU6UZPUMR4Y" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;After three weeks at the NIH, Redweik went through rehab again and returned home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="XJ44QXS63VGJNEFKO4VKUROSYA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Today he still has difficulty hearing, he remains blind in his right eye, and his legs are numb below the knees, he said. With Stage 3 kidney disease caused by the amphotericin, he may one day need dialysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="LRYYZQIYRZESXBI2TWPDBPPG3E" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But even with those deficits, Redweik has regained his weight and resumed the retired life he and Joyce had planned.

More than anything, she would like her husband to become the great father she knows he will be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Things have not gone smoothly, however. Since 2022, they have walked along the in vitro fertilization path together, an expensive journey that has caused them to wonder how they could continue to afford the treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her sisters-in-law suggested they raise money through an online fundraising campaign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I normally do things on my own and I don't usually ask for help, but this seemed like another way to raise whatever we can to pay for the treatments," said Megan Worthington, who lives in Bountiful. "We've paid attention to interest rates because we've thought about taking a second mortgage. But this seemed to be something that could work."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Worthingtons set up &lt;a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/support-the-worthington-fertility-fight?attribution_id=sl:a08e9ce2-63d5-4f75-a760-0b37d9a68ac8&amp;amp;lang=en_US&amp;amp;ts=1749573367&amp;amp;utm_campaign=man_sharesheet_dash&amp;amp;utm_content=amp13_c-amp14_t1-amp15_t3&amp;amp;utm_medium=customer&amp;amp;utm_source=copy_link&amp;amp;v=amp14_t1" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;an account on GoFundMe*&lt;/a&gt;, originally asking for $8,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They are not alone. Between 2011 and 2015, 1,602 GoFundMe campaigns were created specifically to raise funds for IVF treatments. GoFundMe reports that more than $3 million has been raised for these campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although GoFundMe does not publicize a listing of IVF campaigns by state, the company confirmed that couples in Payson, Springville and American Fork have also created campaigns to raise funds for IVF treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pullquote"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;q&gt;I want to be able to provide that amazing life-growing experience, but I want to accomplish this before we turn 40.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;h2&gt;–Megan Worthington&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is understandable, given the costs. The average cost for one IVF round of treatment in the U.S. is between $15,000 and $30,000, according to the Stanford for Economic Policy Research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Insurance rarely covers the cost of any fertility treatments, meaning that unless a couple has an extra tens of thousands of dollars available to them, they have to find ways to raise the money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What makes IVF even more difficult to handle for many women is not only the cost of the treatment, but also the fact that there is no guarantee that they will have a baby in the end. In other words, a couple may go through the various rounds of treatments — creating embryos outside of the woman's body and placing them in the uterus — without a guaranteed formation of a fetus that will lead to a baby.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Pew Research Center continues to report that the number of women who use IVF services continues to increase, despite the costs, which also continue to rise. The organization states that one out of every 10 women in the United States between the ages of 15 and 44 has received some form of fertility assistance, including advice, referrals and medical procedures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers at Pew and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have investigated the connection between women having children later in life and the growing use of fertility treatments. What researchers do know is that one of every 42 babies born in the U.S. is a product of IVF.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seeking fertility treatments can also be a struggle in a state like Utah, where families have more children than the national average. Women like Worthington, and others in Utah seeking IVF treatments, have found the entire endeavor frustrating, sometimes causing questions of self-worth and more. They often feel misunderstood by others, including some family members.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of this to say, this process for couples can be exhausting emotionally and for the women, physically, as well. Having friends and family who support the couple is important, as well as considering other ways to parent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I really want to be able to give my husband not just the experience of being a father and watching his child grow up, but also the different growth stages of pregnancy from hearing the first heartbeat, to the first kick and alien belly roll," Worthington wrote on the GoFundMe page. "I want to be able to provide that amazing life-growing experience, but I want to accomplish this before we turn 40."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Worthington has a 13-year-old daughter from a previous relationship and has witnessed her husband loving the girl as his own. They have also considered adopting a child through the foster system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They want to be parents. And even though the path to get there has been a struggle, they know it will happen somehow. For now, they'll focus on raising the money and see what happens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think I can only go through this until I'm 40," Worthington said. "We'll keep trying until then. My sisters-in-law have been really supportive and they've come up with things like having a garage sale. And I think the GoFundMe campaign can be very useful. This was a last-minute decision we made a month ago. This whole thing has been a roller coaster."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;*KSL.com does not assure that the money deposited into the account will be applied for the benefit of the persons named as beneficiaries.

Unlike in your bones, having calcium in your coronary arteries is a bad thing, because it indicates the buildup of plaque comprised of cholesterol, fat, and other lovely things. The higher the calcium score, the more plaque that has built up — and with it, &lt;a href="https://www.houstonmethodist.org/blog/articles/2021/oct/calcium-score-what-is-a-cac-test-do-i-need-one/#:~:text=Wait%2C%20isn%E2%80%99t%20calcium%20a,future%20heart%20attack%20or%20stroke."&gt;the higher the risk&lt;/a&gt; of heart disease and even heart attacks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;A couple of hours after the test, I received a ping on my phone. My CAC score was 7, which indicated the presence of a small amount of calcified plaque, &lt;a href="https://www.droracle.ai/articles/21304/agatston-score-how-to-interprete"&gt;which translates&lt;/a&gt; to a “low but non-zero cardiovascular risk.” Put another way, &lt;a href="https://internal.mesa-nhlbi.org/about/procedures/tools/mesa-score-risk-calculator"&gt;according to one calculator&lt;/a&gt;, it means an approximately 2.1 percent chance of a major adverse cardiovascular event over the next 10 years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;2.1 percent doesn’t &lt;em&gt;sound &lt;/em&gt;high — it’s a &lt;a href="https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/data-science/a-priori-probability/"&gt;little higher&lt;/a&gt; than the chance of pulling an ace of spades from a card deck — but when it comes to major adverse cardiovascular events, 2.1 percent is approximately 100 percent higher than I’d like. That’s how I found myself joining the &lt;a href="https://www.peoplespharmacy.com/articles/do-statins-save-lives-doctors-dont-agree"&gt;tens of millions of Americans&lt;/a&gt; who are currently on statin drugs, which lower levels of LDL cholesterol (aka the “bad” cholesterol). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;I didn’t really want to celebrate my birthday with a numerical reminder of my creeping mortality. But everything about my experience — from the high-tech calcium scan to my doctor’s aggressive statin prescription — explains how the US has made amazing progress against one of our biggest health risks: heart disease, and especially, heart attacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="a-dramatic-drop-in-heart-attack-deaths" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;A dramatic drop in heart attack deaths&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;A heart attack — which usually occurs when atherosclerotic plaque partially or fully blocks the flow of blood to the heart — used to be close to a death sentence. In 1963, the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/series/sr_20/sr20_002acc.pdf"&gt;death rate from coronary heart disease&lt;/a&gt;, which includes heart attacks, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm4830a1.htm"&gt;peaked&lt;/a&gt; in the US, with 290 deaths per 100,000 population. As late as 1970, a man over 65 who was hospitalized with a heart attack &lt;a href="https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2025/06/heart-attack.html?ck_subscriber_id=2771385781&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Heart+attacks+no+longer+leading+cause+of+US+deaths+-+18114390&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=convertkit"&gt;had only a 60 percent chance&lt;/a&gt; of ever leaving that hospital alive. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;A sudden cardiac death is the disease equivalent of homicide or a car crash death. It meant someone’s father or husband, wife or mother, was suddenly ripped away without warning. Heart attacks were &lt;em&gt;terrifying&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Yet today, that risk is much less. According to a &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/JAHA.124.038644"&gt;recent study&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of the American Heart Association&lt;/em&gt;, the proportion of all deaths attributable to heart attacks plummeted by nearly 90 percent between 1970 and 2022. Over the same period, heart disease as a cause of all adult deaths in the US fell from 41 percent to 24 percent. Today, if a man over 65 is hospitalized with a heart attack, he has a 90 percent chance of leaving the hospital alive. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;By my calculations, the improvements in preventing and treating heart attacks between 1970 and 2022 have likely saved tens of millions of lives. So how did we get here?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;In 1964, the year after the coronary heart disease death rate peaked, the US surgeon general released a &lt;a href="https://digirepo.nlm.nih.gov/ext/document/101584932X202/PDF/101584932X202.pdf"&gt;landmark report&lt;/a&gt; on the risks of smoking. It marked the start of a decades-long public health campaign against one of the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/about/cigarettes-and-cardiovascular-disease.html"&gt;biggest contributing factors to cardiovascular disease&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;That campaign has been incredibly successful. In 1970, an estimated 40 percent of Americans smoked. By 2019, that percentage had fallen to 14 percent, and &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/smoking.htm"&gt;it keeps declining&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The reduction in smoking has helped lower the number of Americans at risk of a heart attack. So did the development and spread in the 1980s of statins like I’m on now, which make it far easier to manage cholesterol and prevent heart disease. By one estimate, statins &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X%2821%2900572-6/fulltext"&gt;save&lt;/a&gt; nearly 2 million lives globally each year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;When heart attacks do occur, the widespread adoption of CPR and the development of portable defibrillators — which only began to become &lt;a href="https://www.aedleader.com/blog/history-of-aeds/#:~:text=The%20First%20Portable%20Defibrillators%20in,in%20UK%20ambulances%20until%201990."&gt;common in the late 1960s&lt;/a&gt; — ensured that more people survived long enough to make it to the hospital. Once there, the development of specialized coronary care units, balloon angioplasty and artery-opening stents made it easier for doctors to rescue a patient suffering an acute cardiac event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="our-changing-heart-health-deaths" class="_7ka5u2 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h3 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;Our changing heart health deaths&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Despite this progress in stopping heart attacks, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/heart-disease/data-research/facts-stats/index.html"&gt;around 700,000 Americans&lt;/a&gt; still die of all forms of heart disease every year, equivalent to 1 in 5 deaths overall. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Some of this is the unintended result of our medical success. As more patients survive acute heart attacks and &lt;a href="https://www.healthsystemtracker.org/chart-collection/u-s-life-expectancy-compare-countries/"&gt;life expectancy has risen as a whole&lt;/a&gt;, it means more people are living long enough to become vulnerable to other, more chronic forms of heart disease, like heart failure and pulmonary-related heart conditions. While the decline in smoking has reduced a major risk factor for heart disease, Americans are in many other ways much less healthy than they were 50 years ago. The increasing prevalence of &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/obesity-and-overweight"&gt;obesity&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/php/data-research/index.html"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/hypertension.htm"&gt;hypertension&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2731178"&gt;sedentary behavior&lt;/a&gt; all raise the risk that more Americans will develop some form of potentially fatal heart disease down the line. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Here, GLP-1 inhibitors like Ozempic hold amazing potential to reduce heart disease’s toll. &lt;a href="https://newsroom.heart.org/news/major-cvd-event-risk-cut-by-20-in-adults-without-diabetes-with-overweight-or-obesity"&gt;One study&lt;/a&gt; found that obese or overweight patients who took a GLP-1 inhibitor for more than three years had a 20 percent lower risk of heart attack, stroke, or death due to cardiovascular disease. Statins have saved millions of lives, yet &lt;a href="https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/127172/cdc_127172_DS1.pdf"&gt;tens of millions more Americans&lt;/a&gt; could likely benefit from taking the cholesterol-lowering drugs, especially &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/news/2019/08/19/why-do-women-get-cholesterol-lowering-statins-less-frequently-than-men"&gt;women, minorities, and people in rural areas&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Lastly, far more Americans could benefit from the kind of advanced screening I received. Only &lt;a href="https://rcastoragev2.blob.core.windows.net/3c9c26e329cc22b38adf73d92e6f530f/PMC8105517.pdf"&gt;about 1.5 million Americans&lt;/a&gt; received a CAC test in 2017, but clinical guidelines indicate that &lt;a href="https://www.journalofcardiovascularct.com/article/S1934-5925%2816%2930285-4/fulltext"&gt;more than 30 million people&lt;/a&gt; could benefit from such scans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Just as it is with cancer, getting ahead of heart disease is the best way to stay healthy. It’s an astounding accomplishment to have reduced deaths from heart attacks by 90 percent over the past 50-plus years. But even better would be preventing more of us from ever getting to the cardiac brink at all. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;A version of this story originally appeared in the Good News newsletter. &lt;a href="/pages/good-news-newsletter-signup"&gt;Sign up here!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>vox.com</author><pubDate>Sat, 05 Jul 2025 12:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipAFBVV95cUxOTXB2a0FseURhbDdCWEpEbVJzNjJQY3ZSRzAxaDJiTjFmYzNlcGJ0SWJTbUM0czR6QnJFUTJfMUN2RkRVcjA2VmdOSnhzcHlQZk5GSWZaazlUaFZqYU1yQkdBNzI3N2NvV2RZZXNLM1BjanBzMkZEcU9nNzRuY1hzSE9adE9GRDFreUZsbV9PSk1mVHlsV2E3MWlaQm12TldJdDV2TA</guid></item><item><title>像人类一样与宠物交谈的人通常会表现出这7种独特的情感优势- VegOut | People who talk to their pets as if they’re humans often exhibit these 7 unique emotional strengths - VegOut</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi0AFBVV95cUxPem5WNzh0bHRPZXRYVXBuaEJEREtNQ09rZC1TWDAyNTR4Sk40Nld2d2hRaGVYSnhaMHVKZXYwckE1cURlS3dVSmJmTEZuUG91SC0tQkJCOFpRNmZfeWpSNC1BNVlVcFNmMkpQeXU1ZlJ4LUdPTkZqbEVKWUpuVmdmcmdvTTFyeDJ4OGFQRUhTVEZYUjZCc0JBamVSWFRoZFR1NWREYzZFcXNzWU9kRjNyanJuR3ZuSk9nQi14WGZBaU1CWGk4eDV3djNBSDFubzF3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page__content mt-4"&gt;
							&lt;p data-start="204" data-end="561"&gt;If you’ve ever found yourself asking your cat whether she slept well or telling your dog he’s a “good colleague” while you both work from home, you’re in crowded company. Psychologists call the tendency to treat animals as if they possess human minds anthropomorphism. Far from being flaky, that impulse reveals a cluster of hard‑won emotional skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="563" data-end="965"&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6826447/"&gt;Well‑designed studies&lt;/a&gt; show that anthropomorphism is tied to stronger social bonds, richer imagination, and even measurable biochemical changes such as lower cortisol and higher oxytocin when people interact with their pets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="563" data-end="965"&gt;Below are seven emotional strengths that research consistently links to people who chat with Rover as if he actually understands every word.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="972" data-end="1021"&gt;1. Heightened empathy and perspective‑taking&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1023" data-end="1679"&gt;Imagining an inner world for an animal forces you to practice walking in “someone” else’s shoes—literally a different species. A 2024 &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2024.1391606/full"&gt;Frontiers in Psychology paper&lt;/a&gt; found that attachment to pets mediates a positive relationship between animal empathy and prosocial attitudes toward humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1023" data-end="1679"&gt;In plain English: the same neural wiring that lets you wonder whether your dog is bored also fires when you wonder how a colleague feels. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9597799/"&gt;Meta‑analyses&lt;/a&gt; of anthropomorphism confirm that this habit of mind sharpens our ability to attribute emotions accurately to both animals and people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1681" data-end="1895"&gt;Over time, that reflexive perspective‑taking shows up as warm curiosity in friendships, quicker recognition of non‑verbal cues, and a reputation for being the person who “just gets it” without lengthy explanations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="1902" data-end="1952"&gt;2. Superior emotional regulation under stress&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1954" data-end="2452"&gt;Talking aloud to a pet is a form of co‑regulation: you borrow the animal’s calm presence while narrating your own feelings. &lt;a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/the-friend-who-keeps-you-young"&gt;Johns Hopkins University&lt;/a&gt; highlights how simply stroking a dog reduces the stress hormone cortisol while boosting oxytocin, the same bonding hormone that quiets infants .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1954" data-end="2452"&gt;Because language labels emotion, giving voice to worries (“Buddy, I’ve had a chaotic day!”) helps the prefrontal cortex down‑regulate the amygdala’s alarm bells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2454" data-end="2680"&gt;People who habitually vent to their pets therefore practice a neurological loop of name it → calm it → re‑engage, which translates to quicker recovery from workplace friction and fewer sleepless 3 a.m. rumination sessions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="2687" data-end="2728"&gt;3. Creative and imaginative thinking&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2730" data-end="3315"&gt;Anthropomorphism requires mental flexibility: you are, in effect, writing mini fiction scenes every time you ask your rabbit whether she prefers kale or carrot. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6243028/"&gt;Developmental psychologists note&lt;/a&gt; a positive link between children’s pretend role‑play and their tendency to attribute minds to non‑human agents &lt;span class="" data-state="closed"&gt;&lt;span class="ms-1 inline-flex max-w-full items-center relative top-[-0.094rem] animate-[show_150ms_ease-in]"&gt;&lt;a class="flex h-4.5 overflow-hidden rounded-xl px-2 text-[9px] font-medium text-token-text-secondary! bg-[#F4F4F4]! dark:bg-[#303030]! transition-colors duration-150 ease-in-out" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6243028/?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;span class="relative start-0 bottom-0 flex h-full w-full items-center"&gt;&lt;span class="flex h-4 w-full items-center justify-between overflow-hidden"&gt;&lt;span class="max-w-full grow truncate overflow-hidden text-center"&gt;pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. Adults don’t lose that benefit; the 2018 &lt;em data-start="3119" data-end="3144"&gt;Frontiers in Psychology&lt;/em&gt; review on the “development of anthropomorphism” argues that the practice keeps the imagination muscles supple across the lifespan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3317" data-end="3619"&gt;Creativity researchers describe anthropomorphic thinking as a low‑stakes sandbox for hypothesis testing: “What would a terrier CEO decide in this situation?” Those who keep that sandbox open often score higher on divergent‑thinking tasks and report an easier time brainstorming novel solutions at work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="3626" data-end="3681"&gt;4. Nurturing attachment style and care orientation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3683" data-end="4178"&gt;People who converse with pets display what attachment theorists call a secure base script—they assume their companion is available, responsive, and worthy of care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3683" data-end="4178"&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8614365"&gt;Reviews&lt;/a&gt; of the human–animal bond suggest that anthropomorphic language often reinforces healthy caregiving behaviors and a nurturing self‑identity .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3683" data-end="4178"&gt; That attitude spills over: partners of devoted pet‑talkers report more supportive listening and practical kindness in the relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4180" data-end="4419"&gt;Importantly, the emotional strength here isn’t just kindness but consistency—the daily ritual of greeting the cat after work trains the nervous system for predictable caregiving routines, a key ingredient in building trust with humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="4426" data-end="4466"&gt;5. Healthy self‑compassion dialogue&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4468" data-end="4956"&gt;Listen closely and you’ll notice the words you choose for your pet are gentle, forgiving, and even playful—exactly the tone most of us struggle to use in our internal monologue. Therapists sometimes invite clients to “speak to yourself the way you speak to your dog.” &lt;a href="https://www.thementalwellnesscenter.com/new-blog/2023/10/31/speak-to-yourself-like-you-speak-to-your-dog-a-lesson-in-self-compassion"&gt;Emerging research supports&lt;/a&gt; the idea: a 2023 commentary on self‑compassion notes that mirroring pet‑directed speech can soften harsh self‑criticism and increase self‑acceptance &lt;span class="" data-state="closed"&gt;&lt;span class="ms-1 inline-flex max-w-full items-center relative top-[-0.094rem] animate-[show_150ms_ease-in]"&gt;&lt;a class="flex h-4.5 overflow-hidden rounded-xl px-2 text-[9px] font-medium text-token-text-secondary! bg-[#F4F4F4]! dark:bg-[#303030]! transition-colors duration-150 ease-in-out" href="https://www.thementalwellnesscenter.com/new-blog/2023/10/31/speak-to-yourself-like-you-speak-to-your-dog-a-lesson-in-self-compassion?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;span class="relative start-0 bottom-0 flex h-full w-full items-center"&gt;&lt;span class="flex h-4 w-full items-center justify-between overflow-hidden"&gt;&lt;span class="max-w-full grow truncate overflow-hidden text-center"&gt;thementalwellnesscenter.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4958" data-end="5272"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10163869/"&gt;separate study&lt;/a&gt; of nurses found that pet ownership predicted higher self‑compassion scores, suggesting the spill‑over effect isn’t merely theoretical. People who chat warmly to their pets rehearse that same warmth internally, buffering them against perfectionism and burnout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="5279" data-end="5342"&gt;6. Resilience against loneliness through micro‑connections&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5344" data-end="5756"&gt;Yes, some recent work warns that acquiring a pet isn’t a magic pill for chronic loneliness—but &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2025-04-power-pets-loneliness-social-isolation.html"&gt;programs that &lt;/a&gt;leverage pet interactions to build social bridges do show promise . The distinction is subtle: it’s not owning a dog that matters; it’s the social behavior that ownership sparks—smiling at other walkers, sharing funny “conversations” your parrot had at dinner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5758" data-end="6083"&gt;Pet‑talkers excel here because they naturally weave narrative (“Charlie told me he prefers the park at sunset”) that invites others into dialogue. Psychologists call these narratives “micro‑bids” for connection. People who make them frequently cultivate denser social networks and bounce back faster when isolation threatens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="6090" data-end="6145"&gt;7. Mindful presence and moment‑to‑moment awareness&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6147" data-end="6511"&gt;Mindfulness is often taught through breath or body scans, but interacting intentionally with an animal can evoke the same state. A &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8300148/"&gt;2021 study&lt;/a&gt; compared a brief mindfulness audio with a guided dog‑interaction and found both interventions equally effective at boosting momentary wellbeing and reducing mind‑wandering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6513" data-end="6840"&gt;When you crouch to your pet’s eye level and narrate what you’re both seeing (“Look at that fluttering leaf, champ!”) you anchor your attention to sensory details. Regular practice strengthens the brain’s default‑mode‑network control, improving focus back at the laptop and making you less susceptible to doom‑scrolling spirals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 data-start="6847" data-end="6882"&gt;Putting the strengths to work&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6884" data-end="7160"&gt;If you already greet your goldfish with “Morning, mate!” keep going—you’re running a daily emotional‑fitness circuit. If you feel silly, remember that the payoff isn’t about whether your pet grasps syntax; it’s about the skills you rehearse each time you anthropomorphize:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul data-start="7162" data-end="7389"&gt;
&lt;li data-start="7162" data-end="7182"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7164" data-end="7182"&gt;widening empathy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-start="7183" data-end="7220"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7185" data-end="7220"&gt;labelling feelings to soothe them&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-start="7221" data-end="7253"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7223" data-end="7253"&gt;flexing imaginative thinking&lt;/p&gt;

The analysis compared vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals, focusing on vaccines such as Tdap/Td, shingles (HZ), and pneumococcal immunizations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="5" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results were clear: people vaccinated with Tdap/Td were 30% less likely to develop &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/researchers-turn-coffee-waste-into-a-weapon-against-alzheimers-disease/"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt;. Similarly, shingles and pneumococcal vaccines showed a reduced risk of 25% and 27%, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="how_vaccines_may_protect_the_brain"&gt;How Vaccines May Protect the Brain&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="6" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists believe several mechanisms could explain this protective effect. Vaccines might reduce overall inflammation in your body or help your immune system fight infections that could otherwise speed up cognitive decline. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="7" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paul E. Schulz explained this theory clearly: "We and others hypothesize that the immune system is responsible for causing brain cell dysfunction in Alzheimer's. The findings suggest to us that vaccination is having a more general effect on the immune system that is reducing the risk for developing Alzheimer's."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="8" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Expanding further, Avram Bukhbinder, MD, co-author of the study, suggested vaccines might alter how your immune system reacts to the buildup of harmful proteins in your brain, characteristic of Alzheimer's. "Vaccines may change how the &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/first-ever-study-reveals-the-impact-of-space-travel-on-the-human-immune-system/"&gt;immune system&lt;/a&gt; responds to the build-up of toxic proteins that contribute to Alzheimer's disease, such as by enhancing the efficiency of immune cells at clearing the toxic proteins," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="importance_of_vaccination_data"&gt;Importance of Vaccination Data&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="9" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study utilized advanced analytical tools and large-scale healthcare data to ensure robust and reliable results. Yaobin Ling pointed out the significance of this approach, stating, "It's particularly encouraging to observe consistent results across numerous large-scale healthcare databases."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Paul E.

Existing therapies involving anti-amyloid antibodies slow &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/breakthrough-ai-finds-a-cause-and-treatment-candidate-for-alzheimers/"&gt;Alzheimer's progression&lt;/a&gt; by about 25% to 35%. This vaccine-based prevention strategy, offering similar or even greater risk reduction, highlights a powerful and accessible alternative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="4" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="understanding_tdap_and_td_vaccines"&gt;Understanding Tdap and Td Vaccines&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="12" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Tdap vaccine protects you from three diseases: &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/revolutionary-skin-cancer-vaccine-dramatically-boosts-survival-rates-in-male-patients/"&gt;tetanus&lt;/a&gt;, diphtheria, and pertussis (whooping cough). Tetanus bacteria live in soil and dust, entering your body through cuts to cause muscle stiffness and spasms. Diphtheria, a bacterial respiratory disease, leads to severe breathing problems and heart issues. Pertussis is highly contagious, causing severe coughing fits, especially dangerous for infants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Results of a risk regression model on a) Tdap/Td, b) HZ, and c) pneumococcal vaccinations, stratified by three different ages (65, 75, 85) as measured at baseline.

Health authorities recommend Tdap for adolescents around age 11 or 12, and it’s essential for adults, especially pregnant women, during each pregnancy. Td booster shots are necessary every 10 years to maintain immunity or after severe injuries if your last dose was more than five years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="14" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kristofer Harris emphasized the broader public health significance of their findings. "Our findings are a win for both Alzheimer's disease prevention research and for public health in general, as this is one more study demonstrating the &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/left-or-right-arm-new-study-reveals-why-vaccination-site-matters/"&gt;value of vaccination&lt;/a&gt;," Harris said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="5" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="a_promising_path_forward"&gt;A Promising Path Forward&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="15" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This new study strengthens the argument for routine adult vaccinations beyond traditional disease prevention. Alzheimer’s disease remains incurable, but preventing it by using accessible healthcare measures like vaccination provides hope. Continued research might clarify exactly how vaccines achieve this protective effect, potentially leading to new preventive strategies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="4" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Pairwise Correlation of Covariates in the Unmatched Cohort Prior to Use in the Competing-Risk Regression Model for the Secondary Analysis.

For now, healthcare professionals urge adults to keep current with recommended vaccinations, emphasizing these routine shots as vital tools in &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/six-lifestyle-habits-that-preserve-cognitive-health-and-overall-well-being/"&gt;maintaining cognitive health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="17" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alongside Harris, Ling, and Schulz, this research included efforts by Kamal Phelps, MD; Gabriela Cruz; Jenna Thomas; Luyao Chen, MS; Yejin Kim, PhD; and Xiaoqian Jiang, PhD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="18" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This groundbreaking study adds an exciting chapter to Alzheimer's prevention efforts, reinforcing the critical role of vaccinations for maintaining brain health as you age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr class="MuiDivider-root MuiDivider-fullWidth css-1pbb6nf" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/separator" id=""&gt;&lt;hr class="MuiDivider-root MuiDivider-fullWidth css-1pbb6nf" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/separator" id=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Brighter Side of News</author><pubDate>Sat, 05 Jul 2025 11:49:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiowFBVV95cUxNUDNFVmYzYW9EUTNCYV9rWXpNaEc0a3R2X1pOSUkxeXdHUEFZY19kSXZHMXpvX0F5ejI0elVLNldHZGhQNWgwYmF3QVN4QmdRcnhnWkU0UUphTG5JQmt1N0lzNU4wd01BWG95ZFZ1d09QRTlJeTJzN0QtQkFteS16YVhTVG0yS1YwLXV6U2RUSFA1M1c4eXlzNDFVSjQ0ZFpydnln</guid></item><item><title>房客专栏|我可能会患上无法治愈的疾病。我选择不进行测试。-《华盛顿邮报》 | Guest column | I may get an incurable disease.

She reached out to family members we had fallen out of touch with to hear stories about our dad before he was sick.

But not everyone does. In fact, you can have “silent celiac” and have no idea. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Below, GI specialists explain what silent celiac is, how it’s diagnosed and treated and what to look out for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is silent celiac?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“‘Silent’ celiac disease is when someone has celiac disease, a reaction to the gluten protein, but they do not manifest symptoms from the disease,” said &lt;a href="https://med.nyu.edu/faculty/rabia-a-de-latour" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Rabia De

Latour&lt;/a&gt;, a gastroenterologist and assistant professor of medicine at NYU Grossman School of Medicine. “They can have the physical manifestations of the disease like small bowel inflammation but without the GI symptoms like diarrhea and abdominal pain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;As such, the form of celiac often called “silent” celiac can also be referred to as “asymptomatic” celiac. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is a rare form of celiac, as usually patients develop GI symptoms from the malabsorption, which is secondary to the intestinal damage caused by the celiac disease,” said &lt;a href="https://gastrohealth.com/physicians/kevin-m-cronley-md" target="_blank" role="link"

class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the idea of silent celiac presumes you have no symptoms of the disease, some people might simply not realize they’re experiencing mild symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For probably a portion of those patients who think they have no symptoms, they discover that they did have symptoms and feel much better once they go on a gluten-free diet,” said &lt;a href="https://www.jeffersonhealth.org/find-a-doctor/k/kastenberg-david-m" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link

data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="2"&gt;Dr. David Kastenberg&lt;/a&gt;, chief of the division of gastroenterology and hepatology at Jefferson Health in the Greater Philadelphia area. “They weren’t aware that they had symptoms because they thought things like headaches, joint aches, chronic sinus problems or muscle aches were just part of their normal everyday life rather than celiac.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How is it diagnosed?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because this manifestation of celiac disease does not involve clear symptoms, many people go undiagnosed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Silent celiac disease is underdiagnosed, and physicians should have a low threshold to test for it if there are any laboratory abnormalities suggestive of celiac, family history of celiac disease, or other conditions which celiac can be associated with,” Cronley said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;As he noted, further inspection of lab abnormalities are typically the way people with the disease wind up with a diagnosis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Someone might have silent GI symptoms but may have abnormal lab findings or nonspecific generalized symptoms like fatigue and headaches,” De Latour noted. “Going to your doctor for regular checkups with appropriate blood work can pick up the lab work signs of celiac before your symptoms might. Someone might have blood work findings suggesting they are not absorbing certain nutrients well from their food due to the gut inflammation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a patient’s bloodwork shows iron deficiency or elevated liver function, for instance, doctors may then check for celiac by doing a blood test for certain antibodies, like tissue transglutaminase antibody. They can also do an upper endoscopy to look at the GI tract and take a sample of tissue from the small intestine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Silent celiac might be ‘unsilenced’ if someone is getting an upper endoscopy for something separate like acid reflux and the findings suggest celiac, leading them to go on and do blood tests,” Kastenberg said. “People also need to take notice when someone is at a higher risk for having celiac, like having a first-degree relative with celiac or concomitant medical problem like autoimmune thyroid disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;He noted that conditions like type 1 diabetes, Down syndrome and certain skin rashes are also associated with increased risk of celiac disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How is it treated?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The good news is there’s a clear and effective treatment for celiac disease, silent or otherwise. The bad news is it calls for a big lifestyle change. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The treatment for celiac disease is a gluten-free diet,” Cronley said. “Gluten is a protein that is found in wheat that the body will confuse with the lining of the patient’s intestines, causing damage to the intestines. This intestinal injury can result in symptoms of malabsorption, vitamin deficiencies, and can increase the risk of cancer of the small intestine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;To remove this harmful protein from the equation and reduce the inflammation, patients must completely cut gluten out of their diets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For sicker patients, there are more intense therapies, but this is less common,” De Latour noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, there’s now more awareness and understanding around gluten-free eating than in the past. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Gluten-free diets are popular right now because in general, people feel better on a gluten-free diet by eating less processed foods,” Cronley said. “If you think you may have celiac, seek an evaluation by a physician who can properly evaluate you for the disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you get the celiac diagnosis, it’s important to make those dietary changes, even if you don’t feel symptoms after eating gluten. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost hidden hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title default-title"&gt;20 Years Of Free Journalism&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-once-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-canceled-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message-container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message support-huffpost__message--control"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth. &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/support" class="cli-support-huffpost__message__link js-entry-link" data-vars-item-name="Support our mission" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="main" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="/support" data-vars-target-content-type="feed" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="4"&gt;Support our mission&lt;/a&gt; to keep us around for the next 20 — we can't do this without you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message variation contributor-once-variation"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We remain committed to providing you with the unflinching, fact-based journalism everyone deserves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you again for your support along the way.

If you feel terrible when you have gluten, you get that feedback that you shouldn’t eat that thing. But if you aren’t so sensitive and can eat gluten all the time without feeling it, you aren’t getting that feedback that it’s a problem for you.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;But you need to recognize that silent celiac should be taken just as seriously. Ignoring it can lead to long-term issues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Even if you feel well, your small intestine is not well,” Kastenberg emphasized. “It’s not functioning properly, and there are lots of potential consequences like an increased risk for osteoporosis, nutritional deficiencies, malignancies and even reproductive and pregnancy-related issues like low birth weight or spontaneous abortion. If you have celiac, it’s important to tell your family members to get screened as well. Catching it early makes a big difference.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>HuffPost</author><pubDate>Sat, 05 Jul 2025 11:00:17 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqwFBVV95cUxQXzQ3Rm94T3VOUVVWM0JiZlJ5Nnh5dHpMRjl4eUpIb1FUdmMyc2JERlllcE1Eei12bTdJcG45QzZQQzBGQ19GMXI0QnNqZ1NVTFppV2pzTlFSVWtMZmJYRlA5bW1ObHRYbFQzVjFnWFk3bEZORXY2bmU1TXhCUGJqVjlveDdPZnFfMGdvVnl1VG1JUHVMSUctWGxZVk15Nk9IWjlPM1RGd1UwTm_SAbABQVVfeXFMTlVnenY1cUVic3A5cHROVTNiZnBWMGhZZzFiNUFqakM1MG5oeVpQOUhfMmI5dS0wb1M1LUtud0g3TDAtV25GRGZnbWN4dWJpMk1BTUVnS3hBYTRvVzROLWM5b3B3R2dfT1FNT0JjS2VUNzdNa0dOZHJJX2ZfY09GUUJuUU81bURGV0hBclptTWxWNUQzQXhzb0IyUVhoTWxEc3FGQ2thUWJIazFlS3dqZFY</guid></item><item><title>我们要求3位注册营养师说出最健康的三明治面包，他们都说了同样的话-非常简单 | We Asked 3 Registered Dietitians to Name the Healthiest Sandwich Bread, and They All Said the Same Thing - Real Simple</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijgFBVV95cUxOdURORDFyMFJ4dWFBLXczME9zcGx3NFlOaVl1WTBkbkJwR2RwN2F0WFpaYlo3dDZISldobnR2X3FPV29CSFoyVjJLWE1HNFh3QzRDNjg4VmZwcHg5TDJOanlYaFBtYlNrZ1phWTdtYmNhNmdBZC1Bd3I1Y2otYVpNZkt3V1NXank5TEFGVEp3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="realsimple-sc-page_1-0" class="comp realsimple-sc-page mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-callout--summary realsimple-sc-block-callout mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-summary" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt; &lt;h3 class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__heading"&gt;Key Takeaways&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dietitians unanimously recommend this specific bread as the healthiest sandwich option thanks to its high fiber, protein, and nutrient content.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Look for simple ingredient lists and minimal added sugar and sodium—ideally under 200 mg per slice—to avoid hidden additives and support long-term health goals.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sprouted breads not only offer a lower glycemic response and better digestibility, but they’re also widely available and versatile enough for both sandwiches and creative recipes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The bread aisle is more extensive than ever. With a wide range of options—many marketed as ‘healthy’—it can be tricky to know which loaf to choose, especially for &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/food-recipes/recipe-collections-favorites/best-sandwich-recipes" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;sandwiches&lt;/a&gt;. After all, while store-bought bread can be used in a variety of recipes, a classic sandwich is where many of those slices are ultimately headed.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; But not all sandwich breads are created equal in terms of health benefits. Some are full of whole food ingredients and packed with a variety of nutrients, while others may contain additives, preservatives, added sugar, and &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/healthy-foods-high-in-sodium-7564072" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;sky-high levels of sodium&lt;/a&gt;. “Ingredients and preparation methods make all the difference when choosing a bread,” says Brittany Brown, RD, IBCLC, CDE, registered dietitian and owner of Feeding Babies Nourishing Souls in Nova Scotia, Canada.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “When it comes to labeling bread as healthy or not, calories don't tell the full story. To &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/healthiest-bread-7570769" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;pick healthier bread&lt;/a&gt;, my non-negotiables are &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/how-much-fiber-do-you-need-a-day-7564730" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;fiber&lt;/a&gt; and low added sugar,” shares Kaitlin Hippley, M.Ed, RDN, LD, CDCES, certified diabetes educator and dietitian in Cleveland, Ohio. She often chooses a loaf that has at least three grams of fiber to curb cravings and up satiety levels. Plus, this &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/high-fiber-carbohydrates-7566945" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;complex carbohydrate&lt;/a&gt; conveniently comes with built-in blood sugar regulation&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and digestive health benefits&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. Hippley also shares that “less added sugar means fewer energy crashes, fewer cravings, and a lower risk of inflammation&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and weight gain.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Meanwhile Brown prioritizes low-ingredient sandwich breads. “Remember, you really only need a grain, water, salt, and sometimes yeast to make bread; anything else may be an unnecessary addition,” she explains. Most mystery ingredients—like additives, preservatives, and dyes—also lack the evidence needed to understand their long-term health benefits&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “The healthiest bread is the bread that helps you reach your overall health goals,” adds Alexis Law, RDN, registered dietitian at Top Nutrition Coaching, explaining that some people might require a lower calorie count, while others may look to &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/fibermaxxing-nutrition-trend-is-it-good-for-you-11733806" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;maximize their fiber intake&lt;/a&gt; or minimize sodium consumption with their bread choice. Aiming for sodium levels of less than 200 milligrams per serving is a great rule of thumb to avoid going overboard with this mineral, which can increase blood pressure&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; when over-consumed over long periods.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-the-healthiest-sandwich-bread"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; The Healthiest Sandwich Bread &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When it comes to picking a bread MVP, these three dietitians agree that 100 percent whole wheat sprouted bread is the best sandwich bread choice.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “100 percent whole wheat bread is a great option, because it will offer a high amount of nutrients (like &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/health/nutrition-diet/vitamin-b-foods" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;B vitamins&lt;/a&gt; and minerals like iron, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/foods-high-in-zinc-7511268" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;zinc&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/foods-with-more-potassium-than-bananas-11753287" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;potassium&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/health/nutrition-diet/foods-high-in-magnesium" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;magnesium&lt;/a&gt;, selenium, and phosphorus) and fiber. It contains all three grain layers—germ, bran, and endosperm—to boost fiber content compared to white bread,” explains Law. Plus, it also has a lower glycemic response&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; than &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/signs-bread-is-unhealthy-8778162" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="5"&gt;white bread&lt;/a&gt;, resulting in less extreme spikes and dips in blood sugar (and energy) levels. Whole grain intake (including breads) is associated with lower chronic disease risk&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, too!

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; On the sprouted front, Brown shares that, “sprouted grains are at their peak nutritionally&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, so these breads are higher in protein, fiber, and omega-3s than typical white or &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/food-recipes/cooking-tips-techniques/whole-wheat-whole-grain-breads-0" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;whole wheat breads&lt;/a&gt;.” This results in a more filling, nourishing bread that also helps to mitigate inflammation&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Plus, sprouted breads tend to have a lower gluten content&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; for those sensitive to the wheat protein, and are also often lower in the anti-nutrients&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; found in wheat products that can inhibit the absorption of certain minerals like &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/foods-high-in-iron-8702307" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;iron&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “This type of bread is also usually accessible and found in most stores—often offered by store brands to make them more affordable,” Law adds.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; However, it’s important to not be deceived by certain ‘wheat’ bread brands. “Surprisingly, many ‘wheat breads’ that seem healthy lack fiber and sneak in more added sugar than you'd expect,” shares Hipley. To avoid this, look for ‘100 percent’ or ‘whole’ on wheat breads, and be sure to double check the ingredients list.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-ways-to-enjoy-sandwich-bread"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Ways to Enjoy Sandwich Bread &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Once you have your sprouted whole grain bread home, there are plenty of ways to make a delicious sandwich—and other recipes—with it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Law's go-to sandwiches include &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/tuna-salad-tartines-8419800" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;tuna salad&lt;/a&gt; or turkey and cucumber. “I love adding &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/cucumber-health-benefits-7371080" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;cucumber&lt;/a&gt; to a sandwich along with raw spinach to get a nice crunch and easily add more veggies to a meal,” she shares.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Brown also loves tuna (tuna melt with pickled onions, specifically!), nut butter and &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/food-recipes/shopping-storing/food/how-to-store-bananas" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;banana&lt;/a&gt;, and an ‘egg in a hole’ sandwich—though she has some ingenious uses for stale store-bought sandwich bread, too. “Don’t overlook stale bread; toast the crumbled crusts in a pan with herbs for homemade croutons or salad toppers,” she says.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Meanwhile, Hipley, also often whips up a tuna salad sando or homemade PB and J—but has some other tried and true recipes she adores, too. “&lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/cottage-cheese-health-benefits-7109196" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Cottage cheese&lt;/a&gt; topped with fresh garden tomatoes and a drizzle of olive oil and smashed avocado with an egg or hemp or &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/chia-seeds-vs-flax-seeds-11709668" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;chia seeds&lt;/a&gt; are also some of my favorites,” she adds.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-the-bottom-line"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; The Bottom Line &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; At the end of the day, a healthy sandwich bread can turn a fairly healthy lunch into something particularly nutritious—not the other way around, as bread is often unfairly vilified. “Bread itself is not to be feared, unless there is an allergy or intolerance, and it can be a great way to add fiber easily to the diet,” Law encourages.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For the very healthiest store-bought option, try a sprouted whole wheat loaf. “Sprouted grain breads like Dave’s Killer Bread or Silver Hills are two of my top picks for healthy sandwich breads,” Brown shares. These loaves offer fiber, protein, B vitamins, minerals, and even &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/healthy-fats-8740244" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;healthy fats&lt;/a&gt;, arguably qualifying them as bona fide superfoods.&lt;br&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;The Rock loves it, Zac Efron invests in it, and Equinox gym members are signing up for it in droves. Function Health is the latest hot commodity for &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/simple-longevity-tricks-to-improve-diet-routine-2025-2" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;longevity&lt;/a&gt; seekers looking to optimize their health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The promise is simple: skip the waiting room at the doctor's office and head straight to the lab, for comprehensive medical testing that evaluates the health of key organs, like your &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/test-heart-health-simple-exercises-to-live-longer-cardiologist" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;heart&lt;/a&gt; and kidneys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Function also measures some things that "regular" doctors typically don't, like &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/why-elite-athletes-curb-water-intake-after-4pm-top-dietitian-2025-5" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;electrolyte&lt;/a&gt; levels as well as the so-called "heavy metals" — lead, mercury — potentially poisonous substances that can sometimes lurk in our air, water, and food. It might even find cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wanted to see what all the big buzz was about with this $500 annual blood-and-pee testing service, so I tried it out. Disclaimer: I didn't have to pay for it, because Function Health gave out free trials to journalists as the company is still in beta testing mode.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the end, my Function results led me to seek out more advice from doctors than I usually would, to help me separate the signal from the noise in all the data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="6dc5fe0a-902f-43cc-b07f-efdc842f9024" data-toc-id="6dc5fe0a-902f-43cc-b07f-efdc842f9024"&gt;I freaked out about all the little cholesterol particles hiding out in my blood&lt;/h2&gt;

                      My Function results flagged seven "out of range" tests, and three of those were related to heart health.

              &lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;/figure&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The good news is that Function is not a huge time suck. It takes about 15 minutes to get the initial testing done and you can roll up to just about any Quest Diagnostics lab location nationwide (except in Hawaii and Rhode Island).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their tests measure over 90 different biomarkers in your blood and urine, including almost all the typical stuff you'd find in a doctor's office (except STD testing). Function performed roughly three times the number of tests I had done the last time I went to the doctor's office for routine bloodwork. There were more measurements related to hormones, key nutrients, my metabolism, and heart health. Function Health also measured my "&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-the-maximum-age-of-humans-115-or-older-2023-3" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;biological age&lt;/a&gt;," a scientifically squishy indicator of health and fitness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With so many tests being run, there's a good chance that something you measure when you do Function will come back abnormal. That doesn't always mean there's something wrong with you; sometimes your own "normal" doesn't fit neatly into a given reference range.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Function is OK with having a few errant flags in the data, and encourages re-testing any out of range labs. Their ethos is the more information, the better. It's about creating a more detailed picture of your overall health, not making sure each test is perfect every time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People are "wanting to know more about their biology, and to be advocates for their own health," Dr. Mark Hyman, one of the founders of Function Health, told Business Insider.&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;figure class="figure image-figure-image   " data-type="img" data-e2e-name="image-figure-image" data-media-container="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;
              
              
              
                
              
              &lt;span class="image-source-caption "&gt;

                      Function Health cofounder, Dr. Mark Hyman

              &lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;/figure&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Hyman, a longtime friend of US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., chalks it up "to disillusionment with healthcare in general" in the US. Hyman says many people who use Function's tests may be able to resolve their own health concerns without ever seeing a doctor afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"While you'll need to see a doctor for certain things, the beauty of Function is you come in, follow up, order follow up tests on yourself, and then you can follow the guidance," Hyman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His venture dovetails with the rise of new tech promising to put you in the driver's seat of your own health.

              &lt;/section&gt;
            &lt;h2 id="90d2add0-2e39-4fd9-8e79-7f9136d93ed1" data-toc-id="90d2add0-2e39-4fd9-8e79-7f9136d93ed1"&gt;I ended up overanalyzing my results, and coming to some pretty silly conclusions&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The very first "out of range" marker that was mentioned in my Function report was a cholesterol measurement. While my regular LDL, or "bad" cholesterol number — the one you'd get measured in a doctor's office — looked fine, Function also measured the size of my LDL cholesterol particles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apparently, I had slightly elevated numbers of small and medium sized LDL cholesterol particles, which are more dangerous than larger LDL particles. This "could indicate an increased risk for cardiovascular disease despite normal LDL cholesterol levels," my results said, adding "it is vital to address the out-of-range results."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was a surprise. I had always been told I have "good" cholesterol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I started imagining all those tiny, sticky cholesterol particles racing towards my aging heart. Knowing how important &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/heart-healthy-habits-reverse-biological-age-study-2023-11" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;heart health is for healthy aging&lt;/a&gt;, and that heart disease is the leading cause of death in the US, I started to worry. Should I quit my beloved mayonnaise? Maybe I should at least cut back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After my initial shock, I reached out to independent cardiologists and longevity doctors for this story. I also spoke directly to Hyman about my results. All of those physicians refocused my attention, helping me interpret the results, and zoom in on the more meaningful ways to adjust my lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Frankly, they reminded me why this kind of testing isn't widely recommended, and why we go to the doctor in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="e98fa65b-9a2a-42c9-98de-72b2656c9dd1" data-toc-id="e98fa65b-9a2a-42c9-98de-72b2656c9dd1"&gt;Without help from doctors, I was stressing about the wrong things in my labs and on my plate&lt;/h2&gt;
              &lt;figure class="figure image-figure-image   " data-type="img" data-e2e-name="image-figure-image" data-media-container="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;

                      Function recommended five supplements for me: vitamin D, omega-3, CoQ10, berberine, and fiber.

              &lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;/figure&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Even for me, a seasoned health journalist who isn't generally freaked out by medical test results, this felt like a lot to take in. In addition to the supposedly off-balance cholesterol numbers, there was also low vitamin D, and a few other items that could impact everything from my immunity to metabolism and fertility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without a doctor's advice, I found it was easy to get lost in the noise of all the results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think if you showed any cardiologist or lipidologist your panel, they wouldn't be worrying about you," Dr. Ken Feingold, an emeritus professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco, who is an expert on lipids and lipoprotein metabolism, told BI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cholesterol numbers that really matter were fine, including the basics (total cholesterol, LDL, HDL) but also some of the more niche measurements that doctors are now factoring into clinical decision-making, like lipoprotein A and apolipoprotein B (APOB), Feingold said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think it would be very unfair to expect a consumer, the person that had the lab work done to try and figure it out on their own," Dr. David Sabgir, a cardiologist in Ohio who is also not involved with Function Health, told BI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In theory, Function is designed to help consumers make simple nutrition tweaks they hadn't thought to make — perhaps adding fatty fish for omega-3, vitamin D, or fiber supplements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"80% of people's health issues will never need a doctor," Hyman said. "They're really lifestyle-driven and they can be modified through modifying your diet and your lifestyle."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, as a consumer, I found the barrage of information confusing, making it harder to feel in control of good decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus, while Function gave me diet and supplement recommendations (vitamin D, fiber, berberine, omega-3, and coQ10, along with more fish and eggs), it buried the most important piece of nutrition advice that every doctor I spoke to was quickly able to point out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="2d701cd4-7837-4216-87ac-d73dbbadc187" data-toc-id="2d701cd4-7837-4216-87ac-d73dbbadc187"&gt;Doctors told me to cut back on white bread and enjoy avocados&lt;/h2&gt;
              &lt;figure class="figure image-figure-image   " data-type="img" data-e2e-name="image-figure-image" data-media-container="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;
              
              
              
                
              
              &lt;span class="image-source-caption "&gt;

                      Doctors recommended replacing white bread with whole grains, and enjoying healthy fats like avocados.

              &lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;/figure&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In a follow-up interview with Hyman — which is not standard procedure for Function patients — he told me I could improve my particle numbers by cutting down on, or ideally eliminating, refined starches and sugars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was advice that was not highlighted in my Function dashboard, but other doctors wholeheartedly agreed. It was the first thing they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Miora longevity clinic director Dr. Gregory Pippert uses advanced blood testing that's similar to Function's, often catering to patients who are trying to optimize their health and gains in the gym.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I look at so much green on that," he said of my cholesterol panel. "Then I see particle numbers that are not massively high."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Pippert, the headline was simple: just skip the refined grains more often.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Do I really, really need the big extra thick slice of white bread? Maybe not," Pippert said. "It's making the good choices more than the bad choices, but not obsessing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seeing more granular data may help some patients take general pieces of health advice — to hit the gym five days a week, incorporate more strength training, or adhere to heart healthy diets, like the Mediterranean diet, more seriously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The anxiety associated with the results may trigger more compliance with lifestyle modification," Sabgir said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But how can we be sure we'll pick out the right tweaks on our own? If I'm skipping mayo but not switching to &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/whole-grain-bigger-meals-provide-more-energy-dietitian-advice-2022-2" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;whole grains&lt;/a&gt; or cutting back on sugar, I'm probably not going to have a huge impact on my test results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't know why people are offering this," Feingold said. "It's a way to make a lot of money because sure, they're charging a significant amount of money for this, but you don't really need it to make decisions about who you're going to treat, most of the time."&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;div class="entry-content"&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Online dating apps have transformed the dating market, yet their broader effects remain unclear. We study Tinder’s impact on college students using its initial marketing focus on Greek organizations for identification. We show that the full-scale launch of Tinder led to a sharp, persistent increase in sexual activity, but with little corresponding impact on the formation of long-term relationships or relationship quality. Dating outcome inequality, especially among men, rose, alongside rates of sexual assault and STDs. However, despite these changes, Tinder’s introduction did not worsen students’ mental health, on average, and may have even led to improvements for female students.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is from &lt;a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/app.20240455&amp;amp;from=f" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;a new paper&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;span&gt;Berkeren Büyükeren, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Alexey Makarin, and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Heyu Xiong.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Our bodies are unique and how often we poop varies from person to person.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Symptoms such as bloating or hard stools may indicate that you are not going to the bathroom frequently enough.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Staying hydrated, exercising regularly, getting enough fiber and stressing less can help you stay regular.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When it comes to gut health, most people probably assume that pooping every day is the goal. However, experts agree that you can have a healthy gut and not poop every day. Since every body is a little different, not everyone goes No. 2 with the same frequency. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “It’s not bad if you don’t poop everyday, because we all have a different version of normal. If we think of pooping like taking out the trash, then you want to be sure that you’re doing it regularly. So while you may not poop every day, it’s important that there is regularity,” says &lt;a href="https://amandasauceda.com/about" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Amanda Sauceda, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’ve ever been worried that you aren’t pooping every day, read on to find out why not pooping daily may not be such a bad thing and how to recognize when it may be a problem. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-is-it-bad-if-you-dont-poop-every-day"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Is It Bad If You Don’t Poop Every Day? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; No, you don’t have to poop every day and your gut can still be in tip-top shape. “Bowel habits are variable within the general population. Suppose a person has between three bowel movements per week and three per day, with soft, formed stools and minimal defecatory symptoms. In that case, this is considered within the range of normal bowel patterns,” says &lt;a href="https://atlanticcoastgastro.com/physicians/sandhya-shukla-md/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Sandhya Shukla, M.D.&lt;/a&gt; Shukla goes on to add that there are no negative physiological consequences for otherwise healthy people if you aren’t going No. 2 daily.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; So why is there so much variability when it comes to “normal” bowel habits? Several factors influence how frequently a person poops, including diet, hydration, stress, certain medications and activity levels.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-happens-inside-your-body"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What Happens Inside Your Body? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The moment we take a bite of food or a sip of a beverage, our digestive system begins breaking down the food into essential nutrients. So while you may not go No. 2 every day, there is plenty happening in your gut behind the scenes. As waste is formed, it collects in the colon until your body signals that it’s time to head to the bathroom. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; However, if you aren’t pooping regularly, you may start to notice some uncomfortable symptoms. First, there’s gas and bloating. &lt;a href="https://wholeisticliving.com/about-me/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Jenna Volpe, RDN, LD, CLT&lt;/a&gt;, shares that when stool remains in the intestines, it can ferment, leading to increased gas or bloating.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Research suggests that the composition of your gut microbiome may play a role; individuals prone to constipation often have different strains of bacteria present in their gut microbiome compared to healthy individuals.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In addition to the potential for gas and bloating, you may experience dry and hard stools. “When you aren’t pooping regularly you will be more prone to dry, hard stools. This can mean that when you do poop you may notice that you’re struggling a bit, which puts more pressure on your pelvic floor and can lead to developing hemorrhoids and/or anal fissures,” says Sauceda.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; So, if pooping is our body’s natural means of eliminating waste, does skipping a day or two allow it to become toxic? While this is a popular selling point for colon cleanses, there isn’t scientific evidence to back up the theory that your poop can poison your body if you aren’t pooping daily.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Your microbiome, which is a key player in your immune system, is well-equipped to protect you. In fact, colon cleanses may sweep away the good gut bacteria you need to support healthy bowel habits.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-when-skipping-poops-does-become-a-problem"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; When Skipping Poops Does Become a Problem &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While “regular” can mean something slightly different for everyone, healthy bowel movements should meet these criteria: “A healthy, normal consistency (but not too hard), brown in color and about 6 to 12 inches long and 1 to 2 inches in diameter (resembling a sausage or a peeled banana),” says Volpe. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; On the other hand, skipping a poop becomes a problem if it has been longer than three days and you are starting to feel uncomfortable. The most common symptoms indicating that you’re not pooping often enough include bloating, excess gas and stools that are hard, dry or difficult to pass. Fortunately, you can address a sluggish digestive system with a few small changes to your diet or lifestyle.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you aren’t pooping regularly, here are a few tips from our experts that can help you get things moving again. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hydrate:&lt;/strong&gt; “We all know to eat more fiber, but don’t discount water. While fiber is critical to get things moving, we have to help it along by staying hydrated. If you aren’t drinking enough water, then you can make constipation worse,” says Sauceda.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manage Your Stress&lt;/strong&gt;: “Stress can also slow things down in the gut, so addressing the stress can help get things moving. There is a strong connection between the mind and the gut, so if your mind is stressed, that can translate to a stressed gut,” says Sauceda.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focus on Fiber&lt;/strong&gt;: “Incorporating fiber-rich foods (such as fresh fruit, veggies or functional foods like chia seeds and/or ground flaxseeds) into the diet can go a long way to help get things moving in most cases,” says Volpe. She adds that you’ll want to make sure you are drinking plenty of fluids when adding more fiber to your diet. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Move Your Body:&lt;/strong&gt; “Movement and moderate exercise can also help to promote healthy gut motility and regular bowel movements,” says Volpe.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “It doesn’t have to be anything too extreme or intense—even 20 minutes of walking each day (or most days) can make a big difference in gut motility!” &lt;/li&gt;&lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-sc-block-adslot-inline"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Supplement When Needed: &lt;/strong&gt;If you have tried increasing your fiber and fluid intake as well as being more active, and you’re still feeling backed up, supplements may help. Shukla notes that magnesium or prune juice are good options for getting things moving again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-when-to-see-a-health-care-provider"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; When to See a Health Care Provider &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Since everyone’s “normal” bowel habits are different, research has found it’s more important to look out for changes in your normal pooping schedule. For example, not going to the bathroom regularly for two weeks or longer is a strong indicator that you should follow up with your doctor.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “The red flag symptoms or warning signs that may indicate a more serious underlying condition in a patient presenting with constipation include rectal bleeding, blood mixed in the stool, unexplained weight loss, iron-deficiency anemia, a sudden or significant change in bowel habits, a change in stool caliber and a strong family history of colorectal cancer. The presence of any of these features should prompt further evaluation, typically with colonoscopy, to exclude colorectal malignancy or other serious pathology,” says Shukla.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-our-expert-take"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Our Expert Take &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It’s a common misconception that you need to poop every day for optimal gut health. Everyone goes to the bathroom on a different schedule; the key is to recognize what’s normal for you and take note if you’re experiencing discomfort. Symptoms like bloating or hard stools are indicators that you aren’t going to the bathroom frequently enough, and it may be time to adjust your diet or activity to promote regular bowel movements.&lt;br&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-safety-and-availability/fda-warns-consumers-not-purchase-or-use-any-tianeptine-product-due-serious-risks"&gt;issued an urgent warning&lt;/a&gt; about tianeptine – a substance marketed as a dietary supplement but known on the street as "gas station heroin".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Linked to &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/tianeptine-products-linked-serious-harm-overdoses-death"&gt;overdoses and deaths&lt;/a&gt;, it is &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7304a5.htm?s_cid=mm7304a5_w"&gt;being sold&lt;/a&gt; in petrol stations, smoke shops and online retailers, despite never being approved for medical use in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what exactly is tianeptine, and why is it causing alarm?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/fda-issues-eye-drops-warning-after-deadly-outbreak-of-bacterial-infections?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;FDA Issues Eye Drops Warning After Deadly Outbreak of Bacterial Infections&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40122-023-00539-5"&gt;Tianeptine&lt;/a&gt; was developed in France in the 1960s and approved for medical use in the late 1980s as a &lt;a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=_J2ti4EkYpkC&amp;amp;pg=PA3222"&gt;treatment for depression&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Structurally, it resembles tricyclic antidepressants – an older class of antidepressant – but pharmacologically it behaves &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4119213/"&gt;very differently&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike conventional antidepressants, which typically increase serotonin levels, tianeptine appears to act on the brain's glutamate system, which is involved in learning and memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is used as a prescription drug in some European, Asian and Latin American countries under brand names &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11587517/"&gt;like Stablon or Coaxil&lt;/a&gt;. But &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25026323/"&gt;researchers&lt;/a&gt; later discovered something unusual, tianeptine also activates the brain's &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41386-018-0225-3"&gt;mu-opioid receptors&lt;/a&gt;, the same receptors targeted by morphine and heroin – hence it's nickname "gas station heroin".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="align-center "&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" alt="A box of Stablon pills." src="https://images.theconversation.com/files/677034/original/file-20250627-56-dwbp50.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;fit=clip" srcset="https://images.theconversation.com/files/677034/original/file-20250627-56-dwbp50.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=600&amp;amp;h=464&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/677034/original/file-20250627-56-dwbp50.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=30&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=600&amp;amp;h=464&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/677034/original/file-20250627-56-dwbp50.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=15&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=600&amp;amp;h=464&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/677034/original/file-20250627-56-dwbp50.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;h=583&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/677034/original/file-20250627-56-dwbp50.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=30&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;h=583&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/677034/original/file-20250627-56-dwbp50.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=15&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;h=583&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=3 2262w" sizes="(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;As a prescription drug, tianeptine is sold under various brand names, including Stablon.

People chasing a high might take doses far beyond anything recommended in medical settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite never being approved by the &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/information-select-dietary-supplement-ingredients-and-other-substances/tianeptine-dietary-supplements"&gt;FDA&lt;/a&gt;, the drug is sold in the US as a "wellness" product or nootropic – a substance supposedly used to &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/consumer-health/in-depth/tianeptine-is-safe-use-possible/art-20562252"&gt;enhance mood or mental clarity&lt;/a&gt;. It's packaged as capsules, powders or liquids, often misleadingly labelled as dietary supplements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This loophole has enabled companies to circumvent regulation. Products like Neptune's Fix have been promoted as safe and legal alternatives to traditional medications, despite lacking any clinical oversight and often containing unlisted or dangerous ingredients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some samples have even been found to contain &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38300852/"&gt;synthetic cannabinoids and other drugs&lt;/a&gt;. According to US poison control data, calls related to tianeptine exposure rose by over &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39724478/"&gt;500% between 2018 and 2023&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/tianeptine-products-linked-serious-harm-overdoses-death"&gt;In 2024 alone&lt;/a&gt;, the drug was involved in more than 300 poisoning cases. The FDA's latest advisory included product recalls and import warnings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Users have taken to the social media site Reddit, &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/QuittingTianeptine/"&gt;including a dedicated channel&lt;/a&gt;, and other forums to describe their experiences, both the highs and the grim withdrawals. Some report taking hundreds of pills a day. Others struggle to quit, describing cravings and relapses that mirror those seen with classic opioid addiction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since tianeptine doesn't show up in standard toxicology screenings, health professionals &lt;a href="https://keystonelab.com/tianeptine/tianeptine-drug-testing-guidelines/"&gt;may not recognise it&lt;/a&gt;. According to doctors in North America, it could be present in hospital patients without being detected, particularly in cases involving &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/consumer-health/in-depth/tianeptine-is-safe-use-possible/art-20562252"&gt;seizures or unusual heart symptoms&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People report experiencing withdrawal symptoms that resemble those of opioids, like &lt;a href="https://www.crew.scot/drug/fentanyl/"&gt;fentanyl&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/67/wr/mm6730a2.htm"&gt;anxiety, tremors, insomnia, diarrhoea and muscle pain&lt;/a&gt;. Some have been hospitalised due to &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-safety-and-availability/fda-warns-consumers-not-purchase-or-use-any-tianeptine-product-due-serious-risks"&gt;seizures, loss of consciousness and respiratory depression&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;UK legality&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the UK, tianeptine is not licensed for medical use by the &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/medicines-and-healthcare-products-regulatory-agency"&gt;Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency&lt;/a&gt; and it is not classified as a controlled substance under the &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/controlled-drugs-list--2/list-of-most-commonly-encountered-drugs-currently-controlled-under-the-misuse-of-drugs-legislation"&gt;Misuse of Drugs Act 1971&lt;/a&gt;. That puts it in a legal grey area, not formally approved, but not illegal to possess either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It can be bought online from overseas vendors, and a quick search reveals dozens of sellers offering "research-grade" powder and capsules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is little evidence that tianeptine is circulating widely in the UK; to date, just one confirmed sample has been publicly recorded in a national drug testing &lt;a href="https://www.wedinos.org/"&gt;database&lt;/a&gt;. It's not mentioned in recent Home Office or Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/controlled-drugs-list--2/list-of-most-commonly-encountered-drugs-currently-controlled-under-the-misuse-of-drugs-legislation"&gt;briefings&lt;/a&gt;, and it does not appear in official crime or hospital statistics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that may simply reflect the fact that no one is looking for it. Without testing protocols in place, it could be present, just unrecorded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because of its &lt;a href="https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Tianeptine"&gt;chemical structure&lt;/a&gt; and unusual effects, if tianeptine did show up in a UK emergency department, it could easily be mistaken for a tricyclic antidepressant overdose, or even dismissed as recreational drug use. This makes it harder to diagnose and treat appropriately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's possible, particularly among people seeking alternatives to harder-to-access opioids, or those looking for a legal high. With its low visibility, online availability and potential for addiction, tianeptine ticks many of the same boxes that once made drugs like &lt;a href="https://www.standard.co.uk/lifestyle/mcat-meow-meow-drug-2024-young-people-london-raves-b1185517.html"&gt;mephedrone&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.crew.scot/drug/synthetic-cannabinoids/"&gt;spice&lt;/a&gt; popular before they were banned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UK has seen waves of novel psychoactive substances emerge through similar routes, first appearing online or in head shops, then spreading quietly until authorities &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/the-uk-has-banned-drugs-that-dont-even-exist-yet-psychoactive-substances-act/"&gt;responded&lt;/a&gt;. If tianeptine follows the same path, by the time it appears on the radar, harm may already be underway.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/259194/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

While medications and lifestyle play a vital role, adding a single vegetable can naturally improve blood sugar control, even for those with diabetes. A new study found that eating a certain vegetable has been linked to improved blood sugar levels in prediabetes, a precursor to type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study conducted at the University of Gothenburg found that a compound in broccoli has a more significant effect on blood sugar levels in certain people. The study is published in &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-025-01932-w" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Nature Microbiology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Broccoli’s role in managing blood sugar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous research has found that sulforaphane, a compound found in broccoli, is an antidiabetic agent in type 2 diabetes. A study conducted in 2017 found reduced &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/diabetes-10-smart-fruit-choices-to-help-manage-blood-sugar-levels/photostory/122145614.cms" rel="noopener" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;blood sugar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; in people with diabetes after they took large doses of sulforaphane extracted from broccoli sprouts. The new study looked at the impact of this compound in controlling blood sugar in people with prediabetes. This condition is a precursor to type 2 diabetes, with slowly rising blood sugar levels due to impaired insulin production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;The study &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study involved 89 people with elevated fasting blood sugar, a sign of prediabetes. They were all between 35 and 75 years old and were either overweight or obese.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants were randomly given either sulforaphane or a placebo for 12 weeks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neither they nor the researchers knew who got what. By the end, 74 people completed all stages of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Significant change in fasting blood sugar &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results of the study were striking. The participants, who consumed the sulforaphane compound had a higher average reduction in fasting blood sugar than those who didn’t. In some participants, the results were even more prominent. Certain participants had more benefits. The group with the greatest improvement after taking sulforaphane had early signs of mild age-related diabetes, a relatively low BMI in the context of the study, low insulin resistance, low incidence of fatty liver disease, and low insulin secretion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Possible precision treatment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prediabetes affects millions of people across the world, and there is no clear treatment structure currently in place. This is because the condition often remains undetected. Early detection increases the chances of not developing type 2 diabetes. Anders Rosengren stressed the importance of early and individualized interventions to prevent the disease. The treatment of prediabetes is currently lacking in many respects, but these new findings open the way for possible precision treatment using sulforaphane extracted from broccoli as a functional food. However, lifestyle factors remain the foundation of any treatment for prediabetes, including exercise, healthy eating, and weight loss. The results of the study also offer a general model of how pathophysiology and gut flora interact with and influence treatment responses. A model that could have broader implications," Anders Rosengren said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Kheera for weight loss: 5 reasons to eat cucumber with every meal&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Sat, 05 Jul 2025 01:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijwJBVV95cUxNOWpkM0p2dHAwMHJQem5aVE5zNHpqcFN5akhtZXowT1NWbkNjTDVlTUtiREhpekR5OHIzWGlqbFAyOHFlbFVSei1NY01hVW5rQXNjMnEyUDF0VnphTnBQTFRTd2ZsZWphbUxhQUlEdmhFZ1JNbkpLcE9QMDJ5VzdvVkU5VC10RXVRSmE1RTZsLTFqQjNMV1FiMTZtSGp0aWNteEpCNEkzdUVxS3c1WElJRFh1OWRVanp2M2lkU3BSRl9iekpJdE9XWDZBLVZKREJudXQwV0t2SW9uYnZXU3NEbmJiaC04ZV85VDRvNEstQkZOOG1hWXhBclBzN204SWZMOUt1X2tUdy1ZOE1ETV9V</guid></item><item><title>研究发现，新的“药物工厂”植入物成功杀死多种类型的癌症-新闻的光明面 | New ‘drug-factory’ implants successfully kill many types of cancer, study finds - The Brighter Side of News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMivwFBVV95cUxOTHd1a1NRNUk1bndNOTFRbW1kTFNlMy1SWlFEVkItX0JNQlVJR21jNzN3TFF0dXNOS2F4a3hRYlFpV0dlcktBeHdvUlVWZndGRzljb2F3NTBjOGRTUDZ2SkhRT094bTdnOHlpRlVYOVBYdVNoMnp4a1JCTHgyMXUwUWFLc2NYUHhIVzRKREpKQ3otQUVhRTEwaHAxUW9jbTh3SC00VW8tUnFxbGpLcEZ6enNSci0ta3JnZjhyRDlDdw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiBox-root css-a9h2n1" data-id="page-content" data-og-area="article-blocks"&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cancer treatment has long faced a challenging trade-off: therapies strong enough to eliminate tumors often cause severe side effects. One promising solution involves cytokines, natural proteins that stimulate your immune system to attack cancer cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, conventional cytokine therapies have significant limitations. Scientists from &lt;a href="https://www.rice.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Rice University&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.bcm.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Baylor College of Medicine&lt;/a&gt; are overcoming these hurdles by developing tiny implants that produce cytokines directly at tumor sites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="understanding_cytokines_and_their_challenges"&gt;Understanding Cytokines and Their Challenges&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cytokines act as messengers in your immune system, triggering responses that fight infections or cancers. Specifically, interleukin-2 (IL-2) boosts the activity of immune cells called T cells, critical for destroying cancer cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;A team of Rice University bioengineers—Amanda Nash, Omid Veiseh, and Samira Aghlara-Fotovat—partnered with Dr. Bryan Burt of Baylor College of Medicine to lead the collaboration.

Yet, traditional methods involve high doses of IL-2 injected intravenously, causing dangerous side effects such as vascular leak syndrome. This condition results in fluid buildup damaging vital organs like your &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/ozempic-successfully-treats-kidney-disease/"&gt;heart and kidneys&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="5" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, IL-2 rapidly disappears from your bloodstream, meaning high doses are necessary to fight tumors effectively. Repeated high doses often trigger your immune system to produce antibodies against the treatment itself, further reducing its effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="a_new_approach_cytokine_factories"&gt;A New Approach: Cytokine Factories&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="6" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;To overcome these drawbacks, researchers developed "cytokine factories"—microscopic beads loaded with thousands of engineered cells that naturally produce IL-2. Each bead, just 1.5 millimeters wide, continuously delivers IL-2 directly to &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/scientists-discover-why-lungs-are-so-prone-to-developing-cancer/"&gt;tumor sites&lt;/a&gt;, significantly reducing systemic side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="7" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In studies published in journals like &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abm1032" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Clinical Cancer Research&lt;/a&gt;, researchers implanted these cytokine-producing beads next to tumors in mice with ovarian, colorectal, and mesothelioma cancers. Remarkably, ovarian and colorectal tumors vanished within days. In mice with aggressive mesothelioma—a cancer of the lung lining often caused by asbestos exposure—over half the tumors disappeared using only the implants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="8" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even more impressively, when cytokine factories were combined with checkpoint inhibitor drugs targeting proteins like PD-1, every mesothelioma tumor treated disappeared completely. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="9" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Bryan Burt, chief of Baylor’s Division of Thoracic Surgery, highlighted the significance, stating, "It's very hard to treat &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/eating-green-bananas-can-lower-your-risk-of-cancer-by-over-60/"&gt;mesothelioma&lt;/a&gt; tumors in mice, just as it is in humans. Our data show regional delivery produces very effective treatment responses. I've never seen such efficacy in eradicating mesothelioma tumors in mice."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Rice University bioengineering graduate student Amanda Nash is creating cell-encapsulation technologies to treat cancer.

IL-2 concentrations in these localized treatments remain about 100 times higher than in your bloodstream. This method maintains therapeutic effects without causing widespread toxicity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="11" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a clinical trial with &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/major-discovery-identifies-the-cause-of-ovarian-cancer/"&gt;ovarian cancer&lt;/a&gt; patients receiving IL-2 directly into the peritoneal cavity, side effects were significantly reduced compared to traditional treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="12" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amanda Nash, a Rice University graduate student involved in developing the cytokine factories, emphasized the platform's potential: "From the beginning, our objective was to develop a platform therapy useful for multiple immune disorders or cancers."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="4" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="clinical_trials_and_future_directions"&gt;Clinical Trials and Future Directions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="13" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Encouraged by these results, researchers are rapidly moving toward human trials. A spinout company, &lt;a href="https://avengebio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Avenge Bio&lt;/a&gt;, has secured FDA approval to start trials for ovarian cancer patients later this year. Additionally, researchers are preparing trials targeting mesothelioma and other lung cancers spreading within the chest cavity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="14" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Omid Veiseh, a Rice bioengineer leading this research, described the upcoming clinical plans: "In the next couple of months, they expect to begin treating patients with these IL-2 cytokine factories." Meetings with the FDA have already laid groundwork for these promising trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="15" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond cancer, Veiseh and colleagues received an &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;American Heart Association&lt;/a&gt; grant to explore cytokine implants for heart attack recovery. This expansion into heart disease highlights the broad therapeutic possibilities of the technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Tiny alginate bead implants developed in Omid Veiseh’s lab at Rice University can carry cells that release cytokines—key proteins that regulate immune response.

							&lt;p data-start="319" data-end="559"&gt;There’s something incredibly frustrating about being exhausted, crawling into bed, and then… staring at the ceiling for hours. Or waking up at 2:47 a.m. for the third night in a row and wondering if this is just how life is going to be now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="561" data-end="690"&gt;For many people over 70, getting through the night without interruption feels like a luxury. But it’s not necessarily inevitable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="692" data-end="918"&gt;Yes, age brings changes to sleep cycles, hormone levels, and even how our bodies regulate temperature. But what we often forget? Some of our evening habits—seemingly harmless ones—might be the very things sabotaging our sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="920" data-end="971"&gt;Let’s talk about the six culprits I see most often.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="978" data-end="1017"&gt;1. Falling asleep in front of the TV&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1019" data-end="1230"&gt;We’ve all done it—curled up with a good show after dinner and nodded off halfway through. In fact, it can feel like a comforting bedtime ritual. But there’s a reason sleep specialists strongly advise against it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1232" data-end="1519"&gt;TVs (and phones and tablets) emit blue light, which interferes with melatonin, the hormone that regulates your internal clock. Even with your eyes half-closed, your brain is still registering those flickering lights and unpredictable sound spikes—keeping your mind in a semi-alert state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1521" data-end="1780"&gt;Not only that, but falling asleep on the couch often means your body doesn’t fully relax. Your head might be tilted at a weird angle. Your back unsupported. Your sleep shallow. Then, when you finally get up to go to bed, your body treats it like a full reset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1782" data-end="2015"&gt;I used to tell myself it “didn’t count” if I just dozed for 20 minutes in the recliner. But I started tracking my sleep with a basic monitor, and sure enough—on TV nights, I had way more interruptions and grogginess the next morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2017" data-end="2232"&gt;So if TV is part of your routine, that’s fine. Just time it to end at least 30 minutes before bed. Use that final half hour for something lower stimulation—like listening to calm music or reading with soft lighting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="2239" data-end="2285"&gt;2. Snacking too late—even if it’s “healthy”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2287" data-end="2359"&gt;Let me be clear: this isn’t about strict food rules or late-night guilt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2361" data-end="2650"&gt;This is about your body’s digestive system still working overtime when the rest of you wants to power down. Late-night snacking—especially on things like dark chocolate, yogurt, trail mix, or even fruit—can spike blood sugar or trigger wakefulness just as your body is trying to wind down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2652" data-end="2922"&gt;Here’s something many people don’t realize: digestion slightly raises your core temperature. And one of the signals your body relies on for sleep is a natural drop in temperature. So a late-night snack, even a small one, can throw off that signal and delay deeper sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2924" data-end="3146"&gt;As Dr. Shelby Harris, author of &lt;em data-start="2956" data-end="2998"&gt;The Women’s Guide to Overcoming Insomnia&lt;/em&gt;, has noted, “&lt;a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/is-it-bad-to-sleep-right-after-eating-8419928?.com"&gt;Digestion can disrupt sleep&lt;/a&gt;, especially when you lie down too soon after eating. It’s best to finish eating 2–3 hours before bedtime.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3148" data-end="3350"&gt;I once got into a habit of eating a banana with almond butter around 10 p.m. because I thought it was “healthy fuel.” Turns out, even that mild snack was enough to keep my sleep shallow and interrupted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3352" data-end="3556"&gt;If you &lt;em data-start="3359" data-end="3363"&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; need a little something, keep it light and easy to digest. A warm herbal tea, a small piece of whole grain toast, or a slice of avocado can help settle you—without overstimulating your system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="3563" data-end="3616"&gt;3. Having that one extra glass of wine “to unwind”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3618" data-end="3765"&gt;Alcohol is a common go-to for relaxation, especially in the evening. And yes, it can make you feel drowsy at first. But sleep-wise? It’s deceptive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3767" data-end="4016"&gt;Alcohol messes with REM sleep—that stage where your brain does the emotional and memory processing. And it tends to wear off a few hours after you fall asleep, leading to &lt;em data-start="3938" data-end="3959"&gt;rebound wakefulness&lt;/em&gt;—which is that sudden 2 a.m. alertness you can’t explain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4018" data-end="4177"&gt;The reason? As your body metabolizes the alcohol, your nervous system becomes more active again, causing light sleep, vivid dreams, or frequent bathroom trips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4179" data-end="4341"&gt;Sleep doctor Michael Breus puts it bluntly: “Alcohol is the&lt;a href="https://www.sleep.com/sleep-health/tart-cherry-juice-benefits?.com"&gt; number one sleep aid in the world&lt;/a&gt;—and also one of the worst things you can do for your sleep quality.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4343" data-end="4597"&gt;Instead of relying on that nightcap, try something that mimics the ritual but doesn’t interfere with your sleep: a warm cup of tart cherry juice (which contains melatonin), a magnesium-rich cocoa tea, or even just a mindful breathing practice before bed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4599" data-end="4712"&gt;And if you do have a glass of wine or cocktail with dinner, just keep it early—at least 3–4 hours before bedtime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="4719" data-end="4755"&gt;4. Obsessively checking the clock&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4757" data-end="4791"&gt;This one sneaks up on a lot of us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4793" data-end="4987"&gt;You wake up in the middle of the night, glance at the clock, and suddenly you’re doing math. &lt;em data-start="4886" data-end="4987"&gt;It’s 2:46… okay, if I fall asleep in the next 20 minutes, I can still get 4 hours before the alarm…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4989" data-end="5076"&gt;Before you know it, you’re wide awake, irritated, and now anxious about &lt;em data-start="5061" data-end="5066"&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; sleeping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5078" data-end="5310"&gt;This is called &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/article/how-to-sleep-better-good-nights-sleep-lpw6vfskn?&amp;amp;region=global"&gt;sleep performance anxiety&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s something I see often in people who used to be “good sleepers” but find their patterns changing with age. The more we try to force sleep—or monitor it—the more elusive it becomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5312" data-end="5481"&gt;As Dr. Guy Meadows explains, “Clock-watching increases anxiety, which is one of the main enemies of sleep. You begin to fear being awake, and that fear keeps you alert.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5483" data-end="5711"&gt;Try this instead: remove visual cues. Cover your bedside clock or turn your phone face-down. If you wake up, resist the urge to check the time. Remind yourself that rest—&lt;em data-start="5653" data-end="5679"&gt;even if not fully asleep&lt;/em&gt;—is still valuable to your body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5713" data-end="5860"&gt;Some nights you’ll still wake up. That’s okay. But by not adding pressure, you’re giving your mind a chance to ease back into sleep more naturally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="5867" data-end="5912"&gt;5. Having heavy conversations after dinner&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5914" data-end="6187"&gt;Evening might feel like the natural time to talk things through—especially if you live with someone and the house finally gets quiet. But your nervous system doesn’t know the difference between a stimulating debate and an emotional argument. Either way, it kicks into gear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6189" data-end="6440"&gt;I’ve been there. One minute I’m catching up with a friend or my spouse about something that happened during the day. The next thing I know, we’re deep in a serious conversation about finances or health fears… and my brain is now buzzing with cortisol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6442" data-end="6552"&gt;It doesn’t always feel stressful in the moment. But your body still registers those discussions as activating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6554" data-end="6687"&gt;And when you mix that with aging-related changes in cortisol regulation, it creates the perfect recipe for fragmented, anxious sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6689" data-end="6954"&gt;Not every serious conversation can be perfectly timed. But where you can, shift those talks to earlier in the day. Or write down what you want to say and revisit it in the morning. That way, your mind isn’t left chewing on unresolved stress as you try to drift off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="6961" data-end="7003"&gt;6. Staying too sedentary during the day&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7005" data-end="7076"&gt;This one surprised me when I first started digging into sleep research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7078" data-end="7219"&gt;We often think of sleep issues as something to fix &lt;em data-start="7129" data-end="7139"&gt;at night&lt;/em&gt;. But a key part of deep sleep comes from how we move—or don’t—during the &lt;em data-start="7213" data-end="7218"&gt;day&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7221" data-end="7463"&gt;If your body isn’t getting enough physical activity, it doesn’t build up sufficient &lt;em data-start="7305" data-end="7321"&gt;sleep pressure&lt;/em&gt; (that biological drive that helps you fall into deep rest). And when you do lie down, you may fall asleep lightly but struggle to stay there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7465" data-end="7611"&gt;As the National Institute on Aging puts it, “Regular physical activity can help you &lt;a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/exercising-for-better-sleep?.com"&gt;fall asleep faster&lt;/a&gt;, stay asleep longer, and feel more rested.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7613" data-end="7824"&gt;This doesn’t mean high-intensity exercise or exhausting routines. For many people over 70, things like gentle yoga, gardening, housework, tai chi, or even a couple of 10-minute walks a day can make a difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7826" data-end="7993"&gt;I’ve seen people improve their sleep just by switching their morning routines to include 10 minutes of movement after breakfast. It’s about consistency, not intensity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7995" data-end="8131"&gt;Sleep loves rhythm. And when your body has a full, steady rhythm of movement during the day, it’s more likely to settle deeply at night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="8138" data-end="8155"&gt;Final thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8157" data-end="8300"&gt;Sleep isn’t just about rest—it’s one of the most important levers we have for cognitive health, mood stability, and overall vitality as we age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8302" data-end="8534"&gt;So if you find yourself waking up often, lying awake for hours, or feeling groggy despite spending eight hours in bed—it may be time to zoom out and look at what’s happening in those two to three hours before you turn out the light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8536" data-end="8745"&gt;Try cutting one habit at a time. Track what works. Maybe it’s the wine. Maybe it’s the 10 p.m. bowl of granola. Maybe it’s something you hadn’t even noticed—like the conversation you’re replaying in your head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8747" data-end="8936"&gt;Sleep hygiene isn’t a one-size-fits-all formula. But most of us can get better sleep not by adding more, but by gently removing the habits that sneak in over time and chip away at our rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8938" data-end="9009" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node=""&gt;A peaceful night is possible. You just might have to make space for it.&lt;/p&gt;
						&lt;/div&gt;

On April 9, 2025 the &lt;a href="https://idf.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;International Diabetes Federation&lt;/a&gt; confirmed that chronic undernutrition can seed a very different form of blood‑sugar trouble, giving the condition its own place in the global classification system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Malnutrition‑related diabetes has historically been vastly under‑diagnosed and poorly understood,” said Dr. Meredith Hawkins as the vote was announced. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hawkins is an endocrinologist at &lt;a href="https://einsteinmed.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Albert Einstein College of Medicine&lt;/a&gt; and founding director of the Global Diabetes Institute (&lt;a href="https://einsteinmed.edu/centers/global-health/global-diabetes-institute/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;GDI&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-a-fifth-type-matters"&gt;Why a fifth type matters&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearly one in nine adults worldwide now lives with some form of diabetes, and more than 250 million people remain unaware of their status, according to the 11th edition of the &lt;a href="https://idf.org/news/idf-diabetes-atlas-11th-edition/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;IDF Diabetes Atlas&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most public campaigns focus on type 2 diabetes, yet an estimated 20 to 25 million lean adolescents and young adults in Asia and Africa carry the new diagnosis of type 5, a burden comparable in size to HIV infection in the same regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike type 2, type 5 takes hold where food is scarce, not plentiful. That reality undercuts a long‑standing public narrative that ties &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/scientists-identify-a-cellular-switch-mitochondria-that-could-reverse-type-2-diabetes/"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; exclusively to over‑nutrition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For governments counting every healthcare dollar, a distinct label matters. Budgets follow labels, and without one, entire populations have slipped through screening and treatment programs designed for very different metabolic problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is about equity, science, and saving lives,” said &lt;a href="https://idf.org/who-we-are/our-structure/board/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Professor Peter Schwarz&lt;/a&gt;, president of the IDF, summing up the stakes during the Bangkok congress. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-early-hunger-leaves-a-lasting-mark"&gt;Early hunger leaves a lasting mark&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Decades of animal work show that a low‑protein diet during gestation or adolescence stunts pancreatic growth and the formation of &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10046343/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;beta cells&lt;/a&gt;, the tiny factories that make insulin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Human epidemiology echoes that biology, linking low birth weight and recurring childhood malnutrition to impaired glucose control later on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers now group type 5 under &lt;a href="https://diabetesjournals.org/diabetes/article/69/10/2086/16081/Subtypes-of-Type-2-Diabetes-Determined-From" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;severe insulin‑deficient diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, a label that captures the core defect: the pancreas never learned to keep up with sugar loads, even though the rest of the body remains sensitive to insulin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In South India, investigators tracked adults whose body‑mass index averaged just 18.3 kg/m² yet whose blood sugar routinely soared; birth‑weight records, where available, pointed to under‑nutrition in the womb. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Community nutrition programs are therefore viewed not only as anti‑hunger measures but also as long‑range &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/sugary-drinks-linked-to-millions-of-diabetes-and-heart-disease-cases/"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public‑health economists note a secondary benefit. Feed a girl properly before and during pregnancy, and her children may avoid the same metabolic trap, breaking an expensive inter‑generational cycle of disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;State‑of‑the‑art euglycemic clamp &lt;a href="https://diabetesjournals.org/care/article/45/6/1428/146920/An-Atypical-Form-of-Diabetes-Among-Individuals" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt;, published in 2022, confirmed that type 5 patients secrete dramatically less insulin than matched controls while showing normal or even heightened insulin sensitivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same work found little &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/24147-visceral-fat" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;visceral fat&lt;/a&gt; and modest liver fat, a stark contrast to type 2 profiles. In practical terms, these young adults do not carry the metabolic baggage that fuels insulin resistance in obesity‑driven diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.testing.com/tests/autoantibodies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Autoantibody screens&lt;/a&gt; stay negative, ruling out the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5723426/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;immune‑mediated beta‑cell destruction&lt;/a&gt; that defines type 1 diabetes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The numbers therefore line up: glucose levels look dangerous, &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/c-peptide-test/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;C‑peptide&lt;/a&gt; looks scant, but inflammatory markers typical of autoimmunity are absent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the pancreas is small, many experts suspect that oral drugs that nudge the remaining beta cells may help more than high‑dose insulin injections, a strategy that could lower costs and reduce dangerous hypoglycemia in food‑insecure settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-diabetes-type-causes-clinical-confusion"&gt;Diabetes type causes clinical confusion &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Doctors are still unsure how to treat these patients, who often don’t live for more than a year after diagnosis,” Dr. Hawkins warned. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Younger clinicians, trained on the obesity paradigm, may reach for large insulin doses that push already fragile patients into &lt;a href="https://karger.com/gel/article-abstract/86/4/535/358345/The-Etiologic-Factors-in-the-Causation-of?redirectedFrom=PDF" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;ulcerating hypoglycemia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Misclassification also skews surveillance data. When a thin teenager in rural Uganda shows up with elevated glucose but no &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/keto-diet-promotes-fat-loss-but-potentially-wrecks-your-health/"&gt;ketosis&lt;/a&gt;, the chart often reads “type 1,” obscuring the true epidemiology and directing precious insulin supplies away from those who need them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 2025 commentary in the &lt;a href="https://journals.lww.com/bjem/pages/currenttoc.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bangladesh Journal of Endocrinology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; emphasized the threat: standard insulin regimens carry “potentially fatal consequences” for type 5 patients who are mis‑typed as type 1, because even small dosing errors provoke sharp glucose crashes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simple screening cues can help. A BMI below 19 kg/m² in the absence of autoantibodies should prompt consideration of type 5, especially when the history includes prolonged childhood hunger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-steps-for-care-of-diabetes-type-5"&gt;Steps for care of diabetes type 5&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two weeks after the Bangkok vote, the &lt;a href="https://idf.org/news/new-type-5-diabetes-working-group/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;IDF&lt;/a&gt; launched a dedicated working group to write diagnostic criteria, compile treatment algorithms, and build an international patient registry by 2027.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The panel, co‑chaired by Hawkins and &lt;a href="https://www.cmcendovellore.org/nihal-thomas-php/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Dr. Nihal Thoma&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href="https://www.cmch-vellore.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Christian Medical College&lt;/a&gt; in Vellore, India, will test low‑dose insulin, &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK513225/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;sulfonylureas&lt;/a&gt;, and structured nutrition programs in multi‑site trials. Results could reshape essential‑medicine lists in low‑income countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public‑health agencies are already modeling the economic impact. Analysts predict that shifting even half of misdiagnosed cases from &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/scientists-identify-a-cellular-switch-mitochondria-that-could-reverse-type-2-diabetes/"&gt;insulin&lt;/a&gt; vials to oral drugs could save tens of millions of dollars each year, funds that might be redirected to &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/fathers-have-a-surprising-influence-on-their-babys-birth-weight/"&gt;maternal nutrition&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Advocates also press for the inclusion of pancreas‑focused imaging in major nutrition cohorts. Measuring organ size early could identify high‑risk children before glucose spirals out of control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are taking decisive steps to correct this,” said Schwarz, insisting that momentum will continue. Policies built on that momentum will decide whether type 5 becomes another silent killer or a preventable relic of poverty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://journals.lww.com/bjem/fulltext/2025/05000/type_5_diabetes_mellitus__global_recognition_of_a.1.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Diabetes Care&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 04 Jul 2025 22:11:45 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiuwFBVV95cUxNbGJmakNMd2pDR1JobmtpTzdOWnp4d19nYkI3ekZQNmpDT2ZlREpJSkJnM1BycHNhVVBxZkNKWVZieXZ6aG5GdU1sWU5JdnlFQXN3b090QmtxZWFfSkN0d00zQ1BWVWhiZFhpeVFGdHlfUnBuRWJjYVl6bjVBOVhMS1hfckw0TllJQjhIZ3h2SGxSU2pBYzVZeUMzbGdVQV9FdWY3SW1Nclo2TWJWcDJwYkdFWXd3QWJzcURv</guid></item><item><title>神秘的麻风病原体在美洲潜伏了4000年- ScienceAlert | Mysterious Leprosy Pathogen Has Lurked in The Americas For 4,000 Years - ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinwFBVV95cUxPZzIyTEVOb1lZOTVfNFo5MXBlTWFGcTJ4bzhwQWMxeHhITjM5NURRYk9XdThIdnBlMmRROUlmYmJLQ1FOZ3BlbFQ2YnllelFKemdGQ0psYTZSM0pZTlJOSVdidGNhX2VITVFMME9pdlVuRTZpNUY0TFE2TzF4Nm1SU19fUFJjRFFoRVBlb1FMdnk3VE1KZFB4My1oeFU1Wms?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;A new study has found that &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leprosy"&gt;leprosy&lt;/a&gt; was circulating in Chile some 4,000 years ago, meaning the disease arrived in the Americas much earlier than previously thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's based on an analysis of ancient bones and teeth by researchers from institutions in Germany, Argentina, and Chile, and it challenges &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12915-021-01120-2"&gt;the conventional wisdom&lt;/a&gt; that leprosy was a disease introduced by European settlers from the 16th century onwards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through a comprehensive study of DNA fragments found in two human skeletons, the researchers were able to match the genetic material to the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycobacterium_lepromatosis"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mycobacterium lepromatosis&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; pathogen – the less common of two bacteria known to cause leprosy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We were initially suspicious, since leprosy is regarded as a colonial-era disease, but more careful evaluation of the DNA revealed the pathogen to be of the lepromatosis form," &lt;a href="https://www.mpg.de/24966569/0626-evan-a-rare-form-of-leprosy-existed-in-the-americas-for-thousands-of-years-150495-x"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; anthropologist Darío Ramirez, from the National University of Córdoba in Argentina.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/experts-warn-leprosy-isnt-ancient-history-as-cases-surge-in-the-us?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;Experts Warn Leprosy Isn't Ancient History as Cases Surge in The US&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists are still learning about &lt;em&gt;M. lepromatosis&lt;/em&gt;, which has only recently been identified. Another bacteria, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycobacterium_leprae"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mycobacterium leprae&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, is the dominant strain behind leprosy, and its history and spread has been more clearly mapped to date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While there's a scarcity of samples in the Americas, &lt;em&gt;M. leprae&lt;/em&gt; has been tracked back &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0185966"&gt;for thousands of years&lt;/a&gt; across Eurasia, which is part of the reason why researchers have long thought it traveled from Europe across the Atlantic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_166422" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-166422" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/LeprosySkull.jpg" alt="Leprosy skull" class="wp-image-166422 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/LeprosySkull.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/LeprosySkull-623x415.jpg 623w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/LeprosySkull-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-166422" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers found tiny traces of bacteria in human remains.

This new find, pushing its arrival back millennia earlier, adds further evidence that we need to rethink the history of leprosy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Ancient DNA has become a great tool that allows us to dig deeper into diseases that have had a long history in the Americas," &lt;a href="https://www.mpg.de/24966569/0626-evan-a-rare-form-of-leprosy-existed-in-the-americas-for-thousands-of-years-150495-x"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; anthropologist Kirsten Bos, from the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Germany.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The advanced techniques now used to study ancient pathogen DNA allows us to look beyond the suspects and into other diseases that might not be expected from the context."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trying to pick apart this history of disease isn't easy. Indigenous American peoples would certainly have had afflictions of their own, but they would have also been hit hard by infections &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/2000-year-old-pottery-reveals-trade-networks-in-australia-long-before-colonization"&gt;imported by colonists&lt;/a&gt; – infections their bodies were poorly prepared for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers are confident that there's more to the story, in terms of both modern and ancient forms of the disease – especially in regards to &lt;em&gt;M. lepromatosis&lt;/em&gt;. Each archaeological dig and clinical test gives experts more genomes to work with, which then further helps our understanding of disease history, spread, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/pandemics-seem-to-have-made-a-comeback-why-is-this-happening"&gt;and diversification&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part of the skill needed by researchers is knowing what to look for, which is highlighted by this study – previous work in this area may have missed ancient markers of leprosy, simply because no one thought to look for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This disease was present in Chile as early as 4,000 years ago, and now that we know it was there, we can specifically look for it in other contexts," &lt;a href="https://www.mpg.de/24966569/0626-evan-a-rare-form-of-leprosy-existed-in-the-americas-for-thousands-of-years-150495-x"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; anthropologist Rodrigo Nores, from the National University of Córdoba.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41559-025-02771-y"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Ecology &amp;amp; Evolution&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

nerves and causes difficulty breathing, muscle paralysis and even death. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;By June 27, 10 attendees - all of whom had eaten the salad - had sought treatment at one of two hospitals in Fresno County (five patients at each hospital) for symptoms resembling those of botulism. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As a result, the &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/centers-for-disease-control-and-prevention-cdc/index.html" id="mol-95436990-590f-11f0-9a09-150b0fdb8864"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;, the Fresno County Department of Public Health and California Department of Public Health launched an investigation to discover the cause of the widespread illness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After days of lab testing, officials were ultimately able to discover that the uncooked nopales present in the salad - which had been left unrefrigerated in 100 degree Fahrenheit heat and served on both days - was contaminated with C botulinum. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Soon after, eight of the 10 patients were diagnosed with the condition - marking it as one of the largest documented foodborne outbreaks of the infection in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/california/index.html" id="mol-94ed88c0-590c-11f0-9a09-150b0fdb8864" class=""&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Eight people were hospitalized in California after eating a homemade salad made of uncooked nopales that was contaminated with C botulinum - a deadly neurotoxin that can cause paralysis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nopales, a popular food in traditional Mexican dishes also known as prickly pear cactus, has recently gained popularity in dishes as a healthy ingredient. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Officials confirmed that one of the eight patients had made the salad using fresh onions, fresh tomatoes and home-preserved nopales stored in reused commercial glass jars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the CDC case report, the salad-maker had immersed empty jars into boiling water and then added chopped, uncooked nopales mixed with a small amount of salt. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Once stuffed to the brim, she sealed the jars with new metal lids and stored them for six weeks in an outdoor shed behind her house - a technique she said she had been practicing for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, she was unaware that she had created the perfect breeding ground for C botulinum spores as they thrive in a low-oxygen, low-acid, canned environment with moderate to high moisture and temperatures between 38F and 113F to grow. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Norma Sanchez, communicable disease specialist with Fresno County Department of Public Health, later said they identified the contaminated cactus after sifting through trash cans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Spores of this bacteria &lt;span&gt;are often found on the surfaces of fruits and vegetables and in seafood and, in this case, rapidly grew on the surface of the uncooked and canned nopales. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;All eight patients diagnosed with botulism had double vision, seven had a hoarse voice, six were experiencing dizziness and six also found it difficult to swallow. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The eight patients with clinical botulism were the only attendees who ate the nopales salad; the 42-year-old woman, who experienced the most severe symptoms, ate this item at both events. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Once stuffed to the brim, she sealed the jars with new metal lids and stored them for six weeks in an outdoor shed behind her house - a technique she had been practicing for years&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Eight of the 10 patients were diagnosed with botulism caused by C botulinum - marking it as one of the largest documented foodborne outbreaks of the infection in California &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As a result, all of the patients had to stay at the hospital for between two and 42 days - out of which six were admitted to an intensive care unit and two required invasive mechanical ventilation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The CDC later confirmed in its case report that all the people diagnosed with botulism had survived and recovered. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Botulism is a rare but serious infection caused by a bacterial toxin that attacks the nervous system and is mostly commonly a result of food or wound contamination. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Common symptoms of botulism include difficulty swallowing, muscle weakness, double vision, drooping eyelids, blurry vision, slurred speech, difficulty breathing, and trouble moving the eyes, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In cases of foodborne botulism, these symptoms of typically begin 12 to 36 hours after the toxin enters the body depending on the level of exposure to the toxin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If left untreated, the infection can cause muscle weakness, paralysis and in certain cases, death. &lt;/p&gt;

It’s shaped early on, during fetal development, by how the brain responds to hormones like androgens (male sex hormones). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This early exposure is known to affect many important adult traits. But there’s been one big obstacle: how do you measure that influence without invasive methods?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-rat-fingers-hint-at-sexual-behavior"&gt;Rat fingers hint at sexual behavior &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers from &lt;a href="https://www.okayama-u.ac.jp/index_e.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Okayama University&lt;/a&gt; in Japan may have found an answer – by looking at rats’ fingers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a recent study, a team led by Professor &lt;a href="https://loop.frontiersin.org/people/32931/overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Hirotaka Sakamoto&lt;/a&gt; and Dr. Himeka Hayashi found that a simple finger measurement – the ratio of the second digit to the fourth digit, known as 2D:4D – can predict sexual behavior and preference in rats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This digit ratio has been studied in humans for years. On average, men tend to have a lower 2D:4D ratio than women, meaning their index fingers are shorter relative to their ring fingers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But surprisingly, there hasn’t been much research testing whether this holds true in other animals, nor has sexual proclivity been measured against 2D:4D ratio in humans or other animals. That’s what drew the researchers to rats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-understanding-the-2d-4d-ratio"&gt;Understanding the 2D:4D ratio&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As stated, the 2D:4D ratio compares the lengths of your index finger (2D) and your ring finger (4D). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To find it, just look at your right hand: if your ring finger is longer than your index finger, your 2D:4D ratio is considered low; if your index finger is about the same length or longer, your ratio is higher. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists have found that this ratio is set before you’re born, influenced by the amount of &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/men-with-low-testosterone-have-a-higher-risk-of-mortality/"&gt;testosterone&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/study-suggests-menopause-can-be-delayed-or-even-eliminated/"&gt;estrogen&lt;/a&gt; you were exposed to in the womb. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In general, people with lower ratios were exposed to more testosterone, while higher ratios suggest more estrogen exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This tiny finger difference has caught scientists’ attention because it seems to connect to traits like athletic ability, aggression, risk-taking, and even career interests. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, some studies have found that people with lower 2D:4D ratios tend to do better in competitive sports or lean toward science and engineering fields. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s also been tied to traits like &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/practicing-yoga-nidra-improves-sleep-memory-and-cognition/"&gt;cognition&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/personality-traits-are-not-strongly-inherited-from-parents/"&gt;personality&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/lack-of-sexual-satisfaction-linked-to-rapid-memory-decline/"&gt;sex drive&lt;/a&gt;, and even &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/same-sex-sexual-behavior-linked-to-evolutionary-advantages-in-monkeys/"&gt;sexual orientation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it’s not a rule – it’s just a pattern seen in large groups, not a way to predict someone’s future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-shorter-fingers-stronger-sex-drive"&gt;Shorter fingers, stronger sex drive&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We found that the 2D:4D ratio serves as a reliable biological marker for predicting sexual activity in rats,” said Sakamoto. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Rats with shorter second digits were not only more sexually active but also showed a clear preference for female scent.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Building on their initial measurements, the team then ran mating trials to observe &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/science-behind-predicting-and-changing-human-behavior/"&gt;behavior&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results were clear. Male rats that ejaculated during their first encounter had shorter second digits compared to those that didn’t. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These males also showed signs of higher sexual drive: they ejaculated more often, did so more quickly, and had stronger erectile function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-scent-of-sexual-behavior"&gt;The scent of sexual behavior &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To go beyond behavior and look at preference, the researchers ran a simple but telling test. They placed male rats in a cage with two kinds of bedding: one scented by females, and the other by males.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All the male rats initially explored the male-scented bedding. But only those with shorter second digits stayed interested in the female-scented bedding. They sniffed, explored, and spent more time with it – indicating a clear sexual preference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While most studies have only linked the digit ratio to morphological sex differences, we noticed a surprising lack of research connecting digit ratio to the biological basis of sex itself – especially sexual activity and preference,” notes Hayashi. “This curiosity marked the start of our study.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-fingers-mirror-brain-wiring"&gt;Fingers mirror brain wiring&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond offering insight into rat behavior, the study points to a deeper question: how early hormone exposure shapes the brain in lasting ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before birth, hormone exposure might wire our brains in ways that the 2D:4D ratio later reflects – potentially shaping complex behaviors like sexual orientation or emotional attachment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our results suggest a profound link between the body and mind, with significant scientific and clinical implications,” said Sakamoto. “Simply examining our fingers could one day help identify aspects of our behavioral tendencies.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings also offer a practical model for exploring biological questions that are difficult – or impossible – to study directly in humans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because 2D:4D is also connected to cognitive traits and mental health conditions, this research could help explain sex-based differences in disorders like &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/toddler-screen-time-linked-to-atypical-sensory-behaviors/"&gt;autism&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/how-gut-bacteria-morganella-morganii-could-cause-depression-not-a-brain-disorder/"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;, or attachment issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-biology-is-not-the-whole-story"&gt;Biology is not the whole story&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the findings are compelling, they also raise important questions. For one, it’s still unclear how well results from rats translate to humans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rats provide a useful model for controlled experiments, but human sexuality is influenced by many layers – cultural, social, psychological – that go far beyond biology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also focused only on male rats. Future studies will need to explore whether similar patterns hold true for females, and how other factors like environment or stress interact with digit ratios to shape behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another key question is causation. Rats with shorter 2D:4D finger ratios tend to show more sexual activity and stronger preferences, but scientists aren’t yet sure whether the digit ratio drives this behavior – or if both stem from shared prenatal influences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;None of this takes away from the value of the study. But it highlights the importance of treating biological markers like 2D:4D as part of a much larger picture. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full study was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/expanim/advpub/0/advpub_24-0159/_article" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Experimental Animals&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 04 Jul 2025 19:49:19 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinAFBVV95cUxQZUZaUkRmVXp6NHBMTE1rM20talkzMkltczhqOUFtYVFkdGxVOS1Rd3hzYWdqampRRXV0cFdXQV9ndGxYSTMtTUowaE1rbmpxUEU4N01CZXhoY3lmWHJXZlFnYmkxcWZZSS1EbjQ1RGJ0TGFhMFNENElGLWlkemNtUC10TTJ6bEU1VUJrWEtwaW1rTWdyWkhkUUo4OHk</guid></item><item><title>数百万人已经服用的有争议但便宜的补充剂胜过痴呆症-每日邮报 | Controversial but cheap supplement that millions already take beats dementia - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMioAFBVV95cUxOOENXcjBobUJNQmY2WmhqSG5pcS1rQ1Vxb1VPTU9nczhKZ3hTQzFrOG5CMS1jMk9xeHE4ZzBWR2k1LXZLM19pb2syUHllVHZPdDlMRHV2Q0lPRDRVMzVpUnhGbjlHdUtJdE52TlpUUnM3QnNhd0FKUXo3alNEaUdzTVBmbG1VcnBPNDBlb2J2VWtob0FTNkltTndULVBLYkc3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Apart from helping you improve muscle growth, your protein powder may also protect your brain from decline and dementia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers from the University of &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/kansas/index.html" id="mol-905550e0-58e9-11f0-9717-43b0f5186f43"&gt;Kansas&lt;/a&gt; have found that consuming creatine as a supplement in any form can help improve memory and potentially reduce the risk of &lt;a target="_self" href="/sciencetech/alzheimers-disease/index.html" id="mol-e64cc020-590a-11f0-9e13-cde44e70d64c"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Usually found in the body's muscles, creatine is an organic compound made of amino acids (simple proteins) that is &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14806857/I-diagnosed-Alzheimers-overused-medical-procedure-caused-dementia.html"&gt;also found in the brain&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is produced by the liver, pancreas and kidneys and is critical in maintaining the brain's memory, attention span, energy production and processing speed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Previous research has shown that lower levels of creatine in the brain is associated with cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And while low creatine levels are not a direct cause of dementia, they could lead to less energy production, which may worsen a person's memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In a new study, scientists found that patients suffering from Alzheimer's disease who took 20 grams of creatine for eight weeks showed an 11 percent increase in their brain's creatine levels and a slight increase in cognitive and memory tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lead author Dr Matthew Taylor, assistant professor of dietetics and nutrition at KU School of Health Professions, said: 'There has been evidence in other populations that giving a higher dose of creatine does change brain creatine levels, but seeing it change in Alzheimer's patients was really exciting.

Following a brief breathing exercise, participants in the study reported feeling less negative and less agitated when viewing unpleasant images. They also felt more capable of using mental strategies to intentionally change their emotional state, suggesting this simple technique can provide an immediate boost to emotional self-regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers have long understood that the ability to manage our emotions is a key component of mental well-being and coping with life’s challenges. When this ability is diminished, it is associated with a range of mental health issues, including depression and anxiety. A complex, bidirectional relationship exists between stress and our capacity for emotional control. High levels of stress can impair our ability to regulate our feelings, and, conversely, poor emotional regulation can make us feel more stressed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This impairment happens through a specific biological pathway. When we experience stress, the body’s central stress response system, known as the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, becomes activated and releases stress hormones like cortisol. These hormones can interfere with the brain’s higher-order thinking regions, particularly the prefrontal cortex, which is responsible for executive functions like self-control and decision-making. This process effectively weakens the “top-down” control our thinking brain has over our more automatic emotional centers, making it harder to stay calm and rational.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given this connection, the researchers reasoned that if they could find a way to quiet the body’s stress response, it might free up the mental resources needed for effective emotional regulation. One promising method for doing this is slow-paced breathing. Deliberate, slow breathing has been shown to activate the parasympathetic nervous system, the part of our nervous system responsible for the “rest and digest” response that calms the body down. It achieves this by increasing the activity of the vagus nerve, a major nerve that helps regulate heart rate and other internal functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientists behind this study sought to bridge a few gaps in existing research. While many studies have explored mindfulness, they often involve long-term training or simply ask participants to focus on their breath without deliberately slowing it. This study wanted to see if a single, very short session of intentionally slow breathing could have an immediate effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, previous research often measured how breathing changed a person’s baseline emotional state, but did not test if it improved their ability to actively use a specific mental strategy, such as cognitive reappraisal—the technique of changing how you think about a situation to alter how you feel about it. Finally, the researchers wanted to test emotional flexibility by not only asking participants to reduce their negative feelings but also to intensify them, a less-studied aspect of emotional control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To investigate these questions, the research team conducted an experiment with 13 undergraduate students from a college in New England, with an average age of about 21 years. The study used a “within-subjects” design, which means that every participant took part in both the experimental condition and the control condition, allowing for a direct comparison of their performance under each circumstance. The two sessions were held online via video conference and were separated by one to two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The order in which participants completed the conditions was mixed to prevent any ordering effects. In both sessions, participants engaged in a cognitive reappraisal task. They were shown a series of emotionally negative pictures (such as images of accidents or violence) and some neutral pictures. Before each image appeared, they received an audio instruction to either “enhance,” “suppress,” or “maintain” their emotional reaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the “enhance” instruction, they were asked to use cognitive reappraisal to make their emotional response stronger, perhaps by imagining themselves or a loved one in the situation. For the “suppress” instruction, they were to use reappraisal to lessen their emotional response, for example, by thinking of the situation as fake or by focusing on a non-emotional detail. For “maintain,” they were told to simply view the image and let their feelings unfold naturally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key difference between the two sessions was the manipulation. In the control condition, participants moved directly to the picture task after a short break. In the slow-paced breathing condition, before starting the task, they were guided through a three-minute “box breathing” exercise. An on-screen animation instructed them to inhale for four seconds, hold their breath for three seconds, exhale for four seconds, and hold for another three seconds, repeating this cycle for the full three minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After viewing each picture, participants provided several ratings. Using a tool called the Self Assessment Manikin, which uses simple figures to depict feelings, they rated the picture’s valence (how pleasant or unpleasant it made them feel on a 9-point scale) and its arousal (how calm or excited it made them feel on a 9-point scale). They also rated their own performance on a 4-point scale, indicating how successful they felt they were at following the instruction to enhance, suppress, or maintain their emotion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The breathing exercise had a direct effect on the participants’ emotional state. When instructed to simply “maintain” their reaction to negative images, participants in the slow-paced breathing condition rated the pictures as less negative and felt  calmer (less aroused) compared to their ratings in the control condition. This shows that the breathing exercise on its own served as an emotional buffer, toning down the immediate impact of the unpleasant stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even more interesting were the findings related to the active use of cognitive reappraisal. The most striking result came from the self-reported success ratings. In the control condition, without the breathing exercise, participants reported that they were significantly less successful at suppressing their negative emotions compared to enhancing or maintaining them. They felt they struggled to mentally distance themselves and reduce their feelings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, in the slow-paced breathing condition, this struggle disappeared. Participants reported feeling equally successful at all three tasks: enhancing, maintaining, and suppressing their emotions. When directly comparing the two conditions, participants rated themselves as more successful at suppressing their emotional response to negative images after having completed the breathing exercise. This suggests that the breathing exercise subjectively improved their sense of control and their confidence in their ability to manage their feelings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also found that the breathing exercise helped individuals who are naturally more avoidant of negative situations. For participants who scored higher on a measure of the Behavioral Inhibition System, which reflects a tendency to avoid aversive stimuli, a notable pattern emerged. In the control condition, these individuals found it difficult to follow the “enhance” instruction—they struggled to voluntarily increase their negative feelings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the slow-paced breathing exercise, this was no longer the case; they became just as capable of enhancing their emotional experience as other participants. This finding hints that the calming effect of the breathing may provide a sense of safety that allows individuals to approach and engage with uncomfortable emotions in a more controlled way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors of the study acknowledge some limitations. As a pilot study, the sample size of 13 participants was small, and the findings will need to be replicated with larger, more diverse groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A primary limitation was a potential “floor effect.” The breathing exercise was so effective at lowering negative feelings and arousal at baseline that it left little room for further reduction. In the breathing condition, the emotional ratings for the “maintain” instruction were already almost as low as the ratings for the “suppress” instruction in the control condition. This makes it difficult to determine how much additional benefit the cognitive reappraisal strategy provided on top of the breathing itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future research could address this by using more intensely negative stimuli. Future studies should also incorporate direct physiological measurements, such as heart rate variability, to confirm that the observed emotional benefits are indeed linked to increased activity in the body’s calming parasympathetic nervous system. It would also be valuable to compare the effectiveness of different breathing techniques and paces to optimize the intervention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/00332941251329856" target="_blank"&gt;Acute Effects of Slow-Paced Breathing on Emotion Regulation: A Pilot Study&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Laura B.
